<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elena's "methodically curious" nature is shown through her frame-by-frame comparison work, and her interior voice remains consistent throughout. The central choice—to recommend exposing the archaeological wound—emerges from her map-framing philosophy but feels more like thematic insight than a decision with visible cost or competing pressures. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves smoothly from observation to epiphany without the friction of genuine stakes testing her professional judgment or personal investment.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elena's methodical examination builds density through parallel footage, grass patterns, and geological surveys, culminating in her recommendation and dawn realization. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final paragraph reweights the henge as "a monument to the unmappable" and maps as documents of faith—but the cost remains abstract and conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful deepening occurs when she notices the identical listening gesture and spiral grass pattern, but the recommendation itself lacks on-page resistance or a visible trade-off that would make the before/after more visceral.</comment>

<comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is established early with vivid specificity ("ghostly suggestions," moisture-damaged saints) and returns implicitly at closure ("ruined frescoes above her workspace"). The dual-screen setup and the henge's grass spiral provide tactile anchors. However, the vault functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; it does not pressure Elena's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate despite strong sensory detail.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving structural stability while capturing the henge's "peculiar grace"—is signaled early and coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates through Elena's examination (the identical gesture, the spiral grass, the older foundations), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options with visible cost. Her recommendation to expose the eastern approach is presented as a realization rather than a trade-off against competing professional or institutional pressures, leaving escalation underplayed for this length.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: maps that "contained more white space than geography," the henge as a space where "silence accumulated meaning," and the closing image of certainty ending where faith begins. The final paragraph offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through Elena's epiphany. Minor penalty: "permission to listen deeply to what couldn't be spoken" and "map of human longing" edge toward abstract philosophizing in the penultimate and final paragraphs, though the framing through Elena's professional lens keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: selective perception filtered through Elena's map-framer lens ("that crucial threshold where cartography becomes faith"), purposeful diction ("shielded openness," "archaeological wound"), and stable psychic distance. Free indirect style is clean, and the reflective mode anchors in present stimuli (the footage, the geological surveys). One slip: "She began comparing the footage frame by frame" followed immediately by "Then she noticed it" compresses discovery into summary rather than showing the noticing moment, but this does not obscure focalization or break narrative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clear and controlled with varied syntax and strong rhythm: "the damaged murals seemed to frame absence itself," "a monument to the unmappable, a chapel constructed from gaps and stone." Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor deductions: "methodically curious by nature" is label-only exposition; "shielded openness—revealing what she'd discovered while protecting what she couldn't prove" uses a dash to define the phrase rather than letting it emerge from action; and the penultimate paragraph's "map of human longing" phrase risks abstraction. No loops or template cadence; momentum is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—a map framer interpreting a henge through silent archival footage—offers a fresh synthesis of profession, site, and method. The parallel between damaged maps and the henge's layered archaeology is specific and non-obvious, and the recommendation to expose the older foundations transforms a routine commission into a thematic statement. However, the emotional arc (observation → epiphany) follows a familiar contemplative template without bold structural risk, and the final insight, while elegant, arrives through reflection rather than a dramatized choice that tests Elena under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Elena is present throughout and her professional lens shapes every observation. She makes one key choice—the recommendation to expose the eastern approach—which alters the Trust's options and reflects her philosophy. However, her "perceptive" quality manifests primarily through noticing (the identical gesture, the grass spiral) rather than decisions that create reversals or test competing values with visible cost. The character enables the thematic arc but does not drive narrative turns through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The henge appears in setup (Historical Trust commission, the Whispered Chapel's reputation), development (footage comparison, the identical listening gesture, spiral grass pattern, older foundations), and closure (Elena's epiphany and the final image of "ancient stones...patient and perceptive"). It supplies the central mystery and thematic anchor. However, it remains an object of study rather than a constraint that pressures Elena's tactics or a tool she manipulates; it is handled through mediated footage and geological reports rather than direct interaction, capping its causal force.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"A whispered chapel" is named and explored: the henge's nickname, the murmured prayers, Elena's insight that "the monument created a space where silence became interpretable." It shapes her interpretive lens and her recommendation, functioning as a thematic organizing principle. It does not, however, constrain her tactics on the page or force a trade-off between competing interpretations with visible cost; it remains a concept Elena articulates rather than a pressure that tests her choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>"Methodically curious" is label-stated in the second paragraph and shown through Elena's frame-by-frame comparison and cross-referencing work. It enables her discoveries (the gesture, the spiral, the foundations) and fits her professional identity. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—she does not face a moment where methodical process conflicts with intuition or institutional pressure—leaving it functional but not causally tested under stress.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Reopen" is the Trust's explicit goal (introduced early: "The Trust wanted to reopen the site") and Elena's recommendation directly addresses it: "reopen the site, but leave the eastern approach exposed." This action drives the closure and reflects the thematic synthesis of disclosure and mystery. It is not, however, a high-stakes turn that Elena must fight for or that tests her against institutional resistance; the piece presents it as her considered advice rather than a contested decision with on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Comparing silent footage from 1957 and last month is established in paragraph two, structures Elena's investigation throughout (parallel screens, timestamp comparison, the identical gesture, grass pattern analysis), and yields the key discoveries that inform her recommendation. The method's mechanics—frame-by-frame comparison, enhancement, cross-referencing with surveys—are shown on the page and shape her tactics. It is indispensable to the story's logic and thematic concern with silence and continuity across time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The "rain-scoured fresco vault beneath the old cathedral" is vividly established in the opening and returns at closure ("ruined frescoes above her workspace"). It provides atmospheric resonance (damaged murals that "frame absence itself" parallel Elena's work) and situates her socially and professionally. However, it does not pressure her choices, supply a constraint that alters her tactics, or participate causally in the investigation; it remains a richly described backdrop rather than an active force in the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"At the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" is metaphor rather than literal timeframe. It appears as thematic language in paragraph five ("that crucial threshold where cartography becomes faith") and is echoed at closure. It does not function as a ticking clock or temporal constraint that tightens Elena's decisions; the investigation proceeds at her methodical pace with no time pressure on the page, leaving the element ornamental rather than causally integrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated explicitly in paragraph four as Elena's "specific motivation" and shapes her approach to the footage, the henge, and her recommendation. It drives her professional lens and thematic arc. However, it is not dramatized through friction or trade-off—she does not face a moment where empathetic interpretation conflicts with institutional demands or her own doubt—leaving the motivation more told than tested under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Shielded openness" is named in paragraph eight ("prepared her report with shielded openness—revealing what she'd discovered while protecting what she couldn't prove") and modulates the final recommendation and thematic closure. The tone is coherent: measured, reflective, balancing disclosure and mystery. It charges the ending image (maps and the henge as documents of faith at the border of certainty) but remains more stated than enacted through tonal friction or pressure modulation across beats, keeping it functional rather than indispensable.</comment>
