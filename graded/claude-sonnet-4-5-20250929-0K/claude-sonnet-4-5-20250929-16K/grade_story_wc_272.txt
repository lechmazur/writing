<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to understand her fragmented vision is clear and drives her choices in the library. The gathering and arranging of cards demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the epiphany arrives too easily—she moves from confusion to understanding without meaningful internal resistance or cost. The final acceptance of fragmentation as truth feels asserted rather than earned through struggle against her artistic identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with clear closure: Elena's realization that fragmentation is truth rather than failure, with the cost being her abandonment of conventional portraiture. The walls contracting provide external pressure that escalates logically. Orientation is established early (lighthouse library, present tense). The closure lands on-page with the decision to "paint differently now" and the acceptance of the broken box, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in terms of what she's actually giving up professionally or personally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is vivid and functional: circular room, salt-smell, contracting walls that literally pressure the protagonist. The tarot cards as physical objects constrain her problem-solving. The lighthouse beam's rotation provides recurring sensory punctuation that charges key moments. The contracting walls shift from metaphor to literal constraint, effectively grounding the psychological crisis in spatial terms. Minor deduction: the spiral stairs and some book-tumbling details feel slightly ornamental rather than integrated into choice-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why her portraits emerge broken—is clear from the opening. The walls contracting provides external escalation that forces faster work. However, the resistance is largely environmental rather than internal; Elena encounters no meaningful temptation to retreat or doubt her new understanding. The resolution feels unearned because we don't see what she's sacrificing: will clients accept fragmented portraits? The cost remains abstract. One clear tightening when she realizes the pattern isn't random, but the final acceptance lacks trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of wholeness-as-illusion emerges clearly from the fragmented cards and Elena's artistic crisis. The broken box as deliberate opening rather than damage is an effective image. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme: "wholeness was the illusion, fragmentation the only honest way to see" states rather than dramatizes. The question "Would anyone understand? Did it matter?" gestures at cost but immediately retreats. Thematic resonance is present but would be stronger without the explanatory final moves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout with consistent distance. The prose carries a distinctive lyric register: "luminescent ache," "gossamer filaments." Perceptual signature is present in art-specific noticing (paint under nails, thread connections). Minor issues: "What was a face but an agreed-upon arrangement?" reads slightly authorial rather than character-voiced in this crisis moment. The rhetorical questions become a pattern that occasionally substitutes for dramatized thought. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong images: "cards scattered like fallen teeth," "lighthouse contracting around her like a closing fist." However, several artifacts accumulate: "necessary darkness" and "necessary breaking" repeat the modifier; "redesign" appears in three contexts without clear distinction; "luminescent ache" in the antepenultimate paragraph feels forced. The rhetorical questions stack in the middle section without always advancing pressure. Rhythm varies well, but figurative density is high in spots without always serving urgency. Information density is good overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a portrait artist who sees faces fragmented offers some freshness, and linking it to tarot cards provides a concrete visual system. The contracting lighthouse library is an effective gothic touch. However, the artist-who-must-learn-to-see-differently arc is familiar, and the resolution—accepting fragmentation as truth—follows a predictable path from crisis to acceptance. The piece doesn't transform the template through surprising choices or costs. The tarot-as-psychological-mirror and descending-into-darkness-for-wisdom are established tropes executed competently but not reimagined.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her choices (touching the box, gathering cards, untangling threads, arranging them, refusing to close the box) drive all major beats. "Crestfallen" is established in the opening and her emotional state shapes perception. She appears in the closure as the one who will "paint differently now." Deduction: "crestfallen" as an attribute is told more than embodied in micro-choices that show her defeated state influencing tactics. The descriptor front-loads her emotional state but doesn't constrain choices in visible ways—she's quite functional and decisive throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box appears early (central table), is handled at multiple points (she touches it, gathers cards from it, places cards back), and returns with reweighted meaning at the end (she leaves it cracked, "refusing the lie of containment"). The crack itself becomes thematic. It's present in or shapes the closure. Deduction: while it's involved in three beats, the box itself is somewhat passive—it's a container more than an active constraint. Its "brokenness" charges meaning but doesn't alter her tactics; the cards do more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is the story's engine: Elena can't see faces whole (setup), the tarot cards show split faces across multiple cards (development), and she realizes fragmentation is truth rather than failure (payoff/closure). It shapes her stakes (why can't I paint whole faces?), tactics (untangling threads to understand the pattern), and the ending (she'll paint fragmentary truths from now on). The concept is irreplaceable—swap it for any other artistic problem and causality breaks. Cost is present: she's abandoning conventional portraiture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear throughout: "How had she become this?", "Were these her portraits?", "What was a face but...?", "Would anyone understand? Did it matter?" They establish a questioning voice but don't meaningfully constrain action—Elena would gather and arrange the cards regardless of whether she asked these questions. They're a stylistic tic rather than a trait that enables or limits choices. The questions don't force her into a particular approach or cost her anything. Present in closure paragraph but ornamentally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Redesign" appears three times in key positions: she came "to redesign her failing vision," she's "redesigning reality itself" as she arranges cards, and "redesigning herself in fragments" at the end. It frames her goal, names her middle action, and charges the closure. The concept of reconstruction/rearrangement drives her method (arranging cards by thread-pattern). Remove "redesign" and substitute "understand" or "fix"—the story still coheres but loses the active, intentional quality of her agency. Strong integration; could reach higher with more visible cost to the redesign choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is signaled when she sees "gossamer filaments connecting eye to mouth," explicitly named ("She began working by untangling threads"), and shown across multiple beats as she traces luminous strands and repositions cards. The method matters: it's how she solves the puzzle, and the lighthouse beam is needed to make threads visible. Mechanics are clear and the method shapes her attempts. Present in closure memory ("untangling the last threads"). Deduction: slightly metaphorical—we don't see her physically struggle with tangled vs. ordered states in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the lighthouse is established early, provides multiple functional pressures (contracting walls force speed, circular shape mirrors her problem, books tumble as obstacles, the rotating beam illuminates threads), and charges the ending (she sits as the beam turns overhead). The setting's unique properties—especially the contracting walls and lighthouse beam—are irreplaceable for the escalation and closure. It's not mere backdrop; the space acts on her. Very strong integration. Microscopic deduction: spiral stairs appear only in transit, not as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is both the timeframe label and a literal event. The walls shudder inward early, contract again mid-story forcing faster work, touch her shoulders near the end, then stop when she finishes and later expand. Time pressure is visible and tightens decisions. She "needed to finish" because the space is physically closing. The timeframe shapes tactics and is present at closure (the walls have stopped/expanded). Deduction: elapsed clock is vague—we don't know how long the closing takes, which slightly softens the urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is stated as her motivation ("she'd come here seeking isolation...to understand"; "perhaps she needed to descend into necessary darkness"). It's present in her choice to enter the library and frames the ending realization ("darkness she'd descended into wasn't absence but depth"). However, it's more narrated theme than dramatized want with friction. We don't see her wrestle with the decision to descend or resist the darkness. The motivation is asserted and fulfilled without conflicting wants or visible costs to the descent itself. Present across beats but told > shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Luminescent/luminous appears four times, "ache" once; the tone is consistently lyric-melancholic with phrases like "salt and abandonment," "fragmented reality bleeding through," "gossamer filaments...strung with stars." Tone modulates appropriately: sharper during wall-contraction pressure, more reflective at the resolution. The final image—"luminous with necessary breaking"—directly charges the ending with the specified tone. Coherent throughout turns. Minor deduction: "luminescent ache" in the antepenultimate paragraph feels slightly ornamental/forced rather than arising organically from the moment's pressure.</comment>
