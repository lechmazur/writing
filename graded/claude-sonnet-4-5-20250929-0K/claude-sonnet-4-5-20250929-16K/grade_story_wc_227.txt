<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's self-narration habit and the grandmother's kintsugi philosophy provide clear motivation. Her uncertainty is embodied through trembling hands and the final choice to pour her own fog-grey doubt into the statue. The emotional arc from fear to acceptance of uncertainty as vessel is earned, though the protagonist's competence (matching essences to pockmarks) feels slightly frictionless given the high stakes. Internal contradiction between her wish for certainty and her grandmother's embrace of brokenness drives the central action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the wave strikes, the workshop holds, and Mira commits to continuing her work—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where uncertainty becomes a vessel waiting to be filled. The causal chain is tight: collecting essences → discovering the statue's pattern → matching them under time pressure → golden fusion that buoys the workshop. Orientation is swift (workshop, acid sea, task established in opening beats). One meaningful tightening occurs when the rising wave forces the final placement with visible cost (her own uncertainty poured in).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vivid and purposeful; the tilting platform and shrieking gears escalate pressure, and the porthole frames the rising wave that forces the climax. The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting—a physical constraint that guides Mira's choices beat by beat. Sensory details (acid hissing on brass, vials glowing softly, golden light erupting) are filtered through urgency. The key ring charm is handled twice (opening brush, final touch) and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: complete the kintsugi repair before the acid wave destroys the workshop. Pressure escalates through the tilting platform, shrieking gears, and the cathedral-tall wave rushing toward her. The reversal—understanding the pockmarks as map rather than damage—narrows options and accelerates action. Agency is strong: Mira's choice to pour her own uncertainty into the throat pockmark completes the pattern and enables the golden fusion. The cost is visible: she must place her most vulnerable essence (her fog-grey doubt) to achieve closure, and the wave strikes immediately after.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the kintsugi metaphor: breaks illuminated with gold, damage worn as jewelry, meaning constructed from fragments. The statue's pockmarks literalize the concept without becoming a sermon. Mira's final realization—that uncertainty itself is a vessel for gold—answers the central question through image rather than statement. The quilted emotions and the "dire enchantment of choosing to mend" avoid platitude by grounding abstraction in specific actions (matching vials, pouring essences). The ending offers resonance without moralizing: "She continues to work."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's self-narration habit ("She approaches the pedestal") is a distinct perceptual signature that reflects her coping mechanism under fear. Voice remains consistent and distance is controlled throughout. The prose modulates appropriately—short bursts during the wave's approach, longer reflection when she touches the charm at the end. Minor filter-verb stacks appear ("seemed to breathe") but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue is present; single-POV interiority is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the final crisis accelerates with shorter clauses while reflection moments breathe. Some ornamental phrasing appears: "joy from a wedding celebration interrupted by plague" lists rather than dramatizes, and "between breaths held underwater, between living and drowning, between meaning and void" stacks poetic parallels at a peak beat, adding slight density without advancing clarity. Information density is generally high. Minor paraphrase loop: "Each depression was a template, a mold for specific emotional weight" restates the map realization. No major scaffold or template cadence runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The kintsugi concept applied to emotional alchemy offers a specific synthesis; the statue-as-map twist is earned and non-obvious. The self-narration habit and the grandmother's absent-but-present mentorship avoid stock framing. The acid sea and floating workshop combine steampunk and alchemical elements with purpose rather than ornament. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its metaphor without retreating into irony, and the lyric compression at closure ("She continues") trusts the reader. The emotional essences-as-vials could trend toward familiar fantasy logic, but the pockmark-matching mechanic adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create every major turn: approaching the statue, understanding the pockmark pattern, matching essences under pressure, and pouring her own uncertainty into the final cavity. Her self-narration habit is present early and under stress. The final choice to continue working completes the arc. Strong causal role across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The charm appears in the opening beat (Mira's fingers brush it) and the closing image (she touches it and smiles). It primes the kintsugi theme but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. The reprise reweights meaning—her acceptance of uncertainty mirrors the charm's mended gold—but the object remains largely symbolic. Two-gate presence (setup and payoff) with thematic resonance but no causal pressure in development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions drive the entire plot: Mira collects emotional fragments, discovers the statue's pattern, and completes the repair by illuminating breaks with essence-as-gold. The concept shapes her grandmother's philosophy, her task, and the final understanding that uncertainty is a vessel. It appears in setup, governs middle action (matching essences), and provides the closure insight. Essential across all three gates with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quilting memories is the core action: Mira matches disparate emotional essences (grief, rage, joy, wonder) to the statue's pockmarks, and they fuse into a tapestry. The attribute is dramatized across multiple beats and directly enables the golden light that buoys the workshop. It constrains her method (each essence must find its corresponding hollow) and pays off at closure when the quilted pattern holds the workshop against the wave. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Self-narration structures every pressure beat: "She removes the first vial," "She makes the final placement," "She continues." It anchors Mira's coping mechanism, sustains voice under stress, and frames the closure image. The habit is present early and returns at the end with visible cost (she narrates through panic to complete the task). Removing it would collapse the POV's texture and the final resonance. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pockmark-matching method is signaled in the setup (statue's "deliberate pockmarks"), discovered as the map in the reversal beat ("each depression was a template"), and executed across the climax (matching essences to cavities). It shapes every tactical choice and enables the golden fusion. The mechanics matter: dimensions must match perfectly, and the throat pockmark for uncertainty is the final piece. Indispensable to plot logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop provides persistent pressure: listing three degrees, gears grinding, acid spray hissing, violent tilting, and the shrieking protest under the wave. The floating platform's survival depends on the completed pattern, making the setting integral to stakes and closure. The porthole frames the threat throughout. The gears and brass hull are handled in multiple beats and constrain Mira's timeframe. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Between breaths held underwater" appears in Mira's narration during the final placement, heightening urgency at the climax. The rising wave creates a live clock across the second half. The timeframe is somewhat abstract—months of collection compressed, then sudden crisis—but the breath-held compression charges the peak beat and the dawn breaking at closure reweights time from suspended to continuing. Two-gate presence (development pressure and closure participation) with moderate causal impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to conjure meaning from oblivion is stated early ("her grandmother called kintsugi intentions") and dramatized through Mira's collection of essences and her task of quilting disparate emotions into coherence. The acid sea and perpetual twilight literalize the edge of oblivion. Her final understanding—that meaning is woven from fragments, breaks revealing where gold can enter—answers the motivating question. Present across all three gates with thematic and causal weight, though slightly tilted toward told wisdom rather than pure friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dire enchantment coheres throughout: the acid sea, perpetual twilight, the statue breathing, and the golden light erupting carry both threat and wonder. Tone modulates with pressure—calm reflection in early beats, urgency during the wave's approach, quiet resolve at closure. The "dire enchantment of choosing to mend" is named at the climax, charging the final image. The breaking dawn shifts tone from suspended dread to tentative hope without losing coherence. Strong tonal control under pressure and closure participation.</comment>
