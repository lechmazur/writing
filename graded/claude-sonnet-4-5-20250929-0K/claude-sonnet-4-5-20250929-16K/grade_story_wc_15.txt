<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore the labyrinth is clear and her sleepwalking discovery creates an embodied contradiction, but her character arc unfolds largely through exposition rather than on-page choices under pressure. The council confrontation is summarized in a single paragraph, flattening what should be a high-stakes moment. Interior life relies on poetic assertion ("strange certainty humming in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final descent feels inevitable but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers sleepwalking discovery, textile creation, and communal participation toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (wharf, canyon, labyrinth). However, the closure unit—Mara joining the walkers—lacks visible cost; the council's reversal is told rather than dramatized, and the final image ("perpetual, communal becoming") asserts transformation without showing what Mara forfeits or risks. The tightening needed for RR at this length does not land with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The red canyon, tide pools, and carved labyrinth are vivid and purposeful; the wharf suspended above creates spatial constraint. The illustration plate and dyed threads ground Mara's craft in sensory detail. The labyrinth's physical structure enables the overlapping-path revelation and the natural gathering spaces discovered by walkers, directly shaping the story's central choice. Micro-setting (loom, textiles, white stones) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the labyrinth's purpose against precedent—is signaled early and the sleepwalking discovery creates one meaningful tightening. However, the council's prepared enforcement dissolves off-page without dramatized resistance, and the transformation happens through summary rather than a turn that narrows Mara's options. The walkers' participation and the elder's demonstration are recounted, not shown, so escalation flattens when it should crystallize. No visible price paid for breaking precedent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of "reverence through use versus preservation through stillness" emerges from the labyrinth's dual state and Mara's nocturnal discovery. The overlapping paths and textile metaphor are purposeful, and the copper plate provides concrete historical grounding. "Orchid solace" arrives as direct label in the final third, reducing what should be implicit resonance. The ending image of communal weaving is non-literal and reweights the opening stillness, but the phrase "perpetual, communal becoming" tilts toward abstraction rather than concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is lyric and consistent ("wooden prayer," "canyon's rhythms into fabric"), though it occasionally drifts into elevated register that risks distancing the reader from Mara's immediacy. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. Filter verbs ("She felt called," "She understood now") soften what could be direct perception. The final paragraph's shift to empty wharf and "perpetual becoming" is voice-consistent but leans abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective. However, several loops and scaffolds appear: "The labyrinth breathed" is asserted twice without new meaning; "stillness had never been its purpose" is immediately followed by "not the worship of dust but the honoring of original intent," a paraphrase loop. "Orchid solace" is defined in exposition rather than emerging from image. Figurative density ("like neural pathways, like the way water knows its course") stacks without causal work. The closing paragraph's "perpetual, communal becoming" abstracts rather than grounds the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sleepwalking-as-unconscious-memory and the labyrinth-as-participatory-ritual offer fresh angles on ruin restoration. The copper illustration plate as historical evidence is specific. However, the council's easy reversal and the communal transformation lack friction or surprise; the emotional arc follows a predictable path from discovery to acceptance. The "orchid solace" coinage reads as prompt-fulfillment rather than organic necessity. Mara's descent at the end feels thematically satisfying but structurally expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara discovers the sleepwalking pattern, sews the panels, and descends to join walkers. These choices drive the plot's three major beats. However, the council confrontation—where her agency should be most visible—is summarized, and her final descent lacks a dramatized tradeoff. Present across beats but decisions under pressure are muted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The illustration plate appears in mid-story as historical evidence, is described with sensory detail ("copper surface glowed"), and is offered to the council at closure. It shapes one key turn (the council's reversal) but is not handled or reweighted across multiple beats; its role is functional but could be replaced by other archival evidence without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" frames the central conflict from the second paragraph ("break every precedent") and drives Mara's choice to sew the panels and invite walkers. The council arrives "to enforce precedent," and the resolution hinges on "precedent transformed." The concept shapes stakes, tactics, and closure image, appearing in setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is explicitly labeled in one line ("woke slowly, hauntingly, optimistically") and echoed in "orchid solace" at the end, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action. The tone is consistent with Mara's project, yet no tradeoff or cost is tied directly to this trait; it functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sewing the panels is the pivotal action: Mara uses canyon clay and indigo to create maps, hangs them from the wharf, and the panels guide the walkers who restore the labyrinth. The act appears in setup (decision to sew), middle (panels hung and viewed), and closure (weaving as communal metaphor). Removing sewing would collapse the story's mechanics and central metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sleepwalking is discovered in paragraph two, traced with white stones, and the overlapping paths become the basis for the textile maps and the communal ritual. The method shapes Mara's revelation and the story's core conceit. However, the sleepwalking itself stops once Mara becomes conscious of it; the method's mechanics matter in setup and are echoed metaphorically at closure, but do not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth carved into red canyon walls is the story's spatial anchor and conflict engine. Its passages, carved symbols, and gathering chambers discovered by walkers are essential to the plot. The wharf's height above the canyon floor creates access constraint during tide cycles. The setting pressures choices (council's preservation rule, walkers' routes) and charges the final image of communal movement through ancient stone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tide pools emptying three days prior establishes the window for action and creates urgency ("when they emptied next, the walkers would return"), but no on-page decision is tightened by a ticking clock. The timeframe is setup and a closing nod; it does not constrain middle tactics or escalate pressure during the council scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated explicitly and drives Mara's sewing, panel display, and descent. The desire is present in setup ("felt called"), middle (panels as proposal), and closure (joining walkers). However, the motivation is more told than dramatized; internal conflict between preservation and use is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses or a visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is explicitly defined in the final third ("rare and delicate comfort found in honoring what had been lost by letting it live again differently") rather than emerging through image and action. The tone of quiet hope is consistent across beats, but it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through embodied contrast. Label-only delivery lowers integration.</comment>
