<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular ("ran his fingertips across the worn vellum...feeling the raised ink"), and his motivation accumulates across decades of waiting. The final choice to step through is earned by the grandfather's deathbed promise and the gradual confluence of signs. However, the internal conflict feels more sequential than simultaneous—he thinks of his shop, then his grandfather, then decides—rather than contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The closing line distinguishes "lonely" from "alone by choice," but the shift reads more as conceptual clarity than a visceral reversal with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph (Marcus, his shop, "three days" of rain, midsummer twilight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: signs converge (creek, light, ants) until the doorway materializes, and Marcus's choice reweights the lingering promise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he steps through "into his decision," crystallizing options with conceptual cost (leaving the maps, the "comfortable isolation"). The cost is felt but abstract; the final image charges the ending without a concrete forfeiture dramatized on the page. One tightening (the convergence of signs) deepens the stake sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The creek rising, the limestone outcropping, the constellation-tunnel, and the blooming cavern all constrain Marcus's path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: shop floor → alley → crack in rock → tunnel → cavern → door. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("glimmered with moisture and something else—veins of crystalline mineral"). The cavern's impossible bloom at midsummer functions as micro-setting that makes the door's appearance credible within the story's logic and charges the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—honoring the lingering promise—is signaled early and tightens through accumulating signs (ants, creek, midsummer light). Marcus's agency is visible: he follows the ants, pushes aside honeysuckle, approaches the door, and inserts the chip. The tightening is meaningful (each sign narrows his options toward the cavern), and the final act forecloses his "comfortable isolation." However, the cost is declared rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture; stepping through "into his decision" reads as conceptual repricing rather than a dramatized price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The theme of choice versus inaction emerges through Marcus's grandfather (who "mapped the territory but never shared what he'd found") and Marcus's twenty-year wait. The final image—"no longer lonely, but finally alone by choice"—reweights the lingering promise without stating a moral. The matrix chip and door function as motifs that accumulate pressure rather than token recurrence. However, the grandfather's wisdom arrives via summary ("made him promise...to watch for the signs") rather than a dramatized scene, and the closing insight ("choosing, finally, after decades of waiting") edges toward articulation of the story's thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus's empirical touch-reading of maps, his noticing of ants and light quality. The prose modulates with pressure—short, decisive sentences at the door ("He could return...Or he could honor...Marcus inserted the chip"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "thought") are used sparingly and fit the reflective mode. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final line's parallel construction ("no longer lonely, but finally alone by choice") charges the ending without forcing a voice shift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("The creek's roar seemed distant now, muffled by stone and earth"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere. However, the opening contains light scaffold: "conversations with customers felt like performances in a language he'd nearly forgotten" could be cut without loss. The phrase "a lingering promise unfulfilled" appears twice (title concept and narrator summary), creating slight paraphrase loop. The final paragraph cycles through decision framing ("He could return...Or he could honor") in a way that reads purposeful but edges toward redundancy. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The convergence of signs (ants, creek, midsummer, matrix chip) and the freestanding door in a blooming cavern offer a fresh synthesis of portal-fantasy and decision-as-threshold. The empirical touch-reading trait and the lingering-promise frame feel specific to Marcus. However, the core premise—choosing whether to open a mystical door after decades of waiting—maps closely to familiar threshold-crossing templates, and the story does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational detail that would charge the ending further. The closing distinction between "lonely" and "alone by choice" is conceptually neat but not viscerally surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Marcus's choices drive all major beats: he follows the ants, pushes aside honeysuckle, approaches the door, inserts the chip, and steps through. His loneliness and empirical touch-reading are signaled early, and his occupation as map dealer charges the ending irony ("maps that charted everywhere he'd never gone"). Present across setup, middle (following ants), and closure (stepping through). The trait "lonely antique map dealer" shapes his motive and the final image's reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The matrix chip appears in three distinct beats: deathbed gift (backstory anchor), "sat in a velvet-lined drawer" (twenty-year wait), and insertion into the door (closure action). Its symbols match the door's inlay, making it causally indispensable. Marcus holds it up to the door and it warms in his palm, charging the moment. Removal would break the lock mechanism and the inheritance logic. The chip's specific nature (type foundry, brass, etched symbols) matters to the story's printing/mapping motif.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The lingering promise is the story's dominant stake, signaled in the title and the grandfather's deathbed request. It shapes Marcus's twenty-year wait and his decision to follow the signs. The final paragraph explicitly frames the choice as "honor the lingering promise not by opening the door, but by choosing." The concept constrains tactics (watching for signs) and drives the closure action. However, the phrase "lingering promise" is stated twice by the narrator rather than emerging solely through action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Marcus's empirical-intuitive method appears only in the opening beat ("sensing authenticity through texture and temperature") and does not return or constrain later action. The trait is described but not used on the page to solve a problem or alter tactics. It characterizes his occupation but does not participate in the creek/ants/door sequence. Swappable with "experienced map dealer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Glimmering appears twice: the tunnel walls "glimmered with moisture and something else—veins of crystalline mineral" and the paths beyond the door "glimmered with possibility." The first instance guides Marcus through the darkness and makes the cavern's discovery credible; the second charges the final image. However, the action is atmospheric rather than causal—Marcus would proceed regardless of the glimmer, and it does not narrow options or impose cost. Present in setup (tunnel) and closure (paths).</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Following ants drives the middle sequence: Marcus notices them, follows them across the shop floor, traces their path outside, and they lead him to the crack in the limestone. The method is signaled early ("yesterday, Marcus had noticed the ants") and shapes his route to the cavern. The grandfather's instruction to "watch for the signs" primes the tactic. Removal would require a new discovery mechanism. Present in setup (noticing), middle (following), and implicitly in closure (the path they revealed).</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The blooming cavern at midsummer provides the story's visual and thematic climax: "impossible, miraculous...a garden of stone flowers that had somehow burst into actual bloom." It houses the door and justifies the convergence of signs. The setting is described vividly but does not constrain Marcus's choice at the door—he could encounter the door in any setting. The cavern charges the final image thematically (bloom = possibility) but does not alter tactics. Present in middle discovery and frames the closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The rising creek appears in the opening ("rising for three days"), midpoint ("The water had breached its banks, flooding the narrow alley, soaking his shoes"), and is noted as distant at the cavern ("The creek's roar seemed distant now"). It signals the threshold condition from the grandfather's maps. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Marcus has already waited twenty years, and the story does not dramatize urgency or a closing window. The creek functions more as atmospheric marker than live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The motivation to find the doorway of decisions is the story's spine: the grandfather's deathbed instruction, Marcus's twenty-year wait, and the final choice to step through. The desire is dramatized through watching for signs and the physical journey to the cavern. Internal friction is present ("He could return to his maps, to his comfortable isolation. Or he could honor...") but remains somewhat declarative. The motivation drives setup (the promise), middle (following signs), and closure (inserting the chip and stepping through). Cost is conceptual (leaving isolation) rather than viscerally enacted.</comment>
