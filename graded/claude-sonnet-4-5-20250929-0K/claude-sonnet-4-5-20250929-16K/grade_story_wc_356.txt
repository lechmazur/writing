<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is clearly stated but her interior journey relies heavily on summarized reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The three-year span is compressed into "each day she tended it," flattening the struggle into narrated endurance. The final transformation—"her relationship to it had fundamentally shifted"—is asserted rather than dramatized through a specific micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("hands tremble," "waves of nausea") but the climactic three-day vigil summarizes rather than shows moment-by-moment contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with clear orientation (treetop village, herbalist, olfactory sensitivity) and follows a causal arc: seed arrival → planting → bloom → transformation. However, the closure unit—"completely still inside"—lands as an asserted internal shift without a decisive on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a prior path with felt cost. The three-year compression and three-day bloom are summarized ("she remained," "she stayed present"), obscuring the moment-by-moment pressure that would earn the Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation test penalty is waived; mild lens ambiguity (accumulative/causal hybrid) does not fully obscure the ending but the cost remains told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly established with rope bridges, swaying platforms, and spatial hierarchy (Lirien at "the highest reach," Marin "two platforms below"). The corpse flower pot "at the platform's edge, where wind could carry away some of its eventual perfume" constrains her choice of placement and charges the final image of swaying with the village. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lirien's olfactory bias ("faint musk, like distant thunder"). The micro-setting—her garden platform—serves as the pressure vessel for the entire arc, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within assault on her senses—is signaled early and tightens when the bloom arrives. However, the climactic three-day vigil is summarized ("she remained," "stayed present") rather than shown through moment-by-moment reversals or trade-offs. The cost is asserted ("discovered something profound") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or tactical shift under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (the bloom's arrival) but the escalation relies on narrated endurance rather than protagonist agency that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of "serenity not as absence of disturbance, but the ability to remain centered within it" emerges from the corpse flower ordeal and Lirien's olfactory sensitivity. The final image—"swayed with it, completely still inside"—resonates without stating a moral. However, the theme is heavily scaffolded by explicit statements ("the tide turns when thought turns," "wisdom had always flowed beneath ambition") rather than arising purely from particulars. The pressed petal and journal doodles recur but feel decorative rather than constraint-bearing. The piece invites reflection but leans toward articulated insight rather than earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in Lirien's olfactory sensitivity ("could distinguish healing herbs by scent alone from platforms away"). Narrative distance modulates purposefully between close interior and reflective summary. The prose carries character-specific texture in diction ("the tide turns when thought turns" fits the village idiom) and the doodling motif is woven through her processing. Brief filter-verb use ("she understood," "she discovered") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance shifts serve the reflective mode cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages rely on paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing: "Her motivation had crystallized… to cultivate serenity… to find stillness" restates the same idea without added pressure. "She began to journalize… her entries covering… 'Day one with the seed,' she wrote" is redundant narration of the same act. Template cadence appears in the opening ("was an ambitious herbalist… was both gift and curse"). The corpse flower's stench is described vividly but the final paragraph leans toward thematic summary ("the greatest cultivation was not of plants, but of presence itself") rather than propulsive closure image. Clarity remains intact but momentum dips under reflective weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of treetop village, olfactory sensitivity, and corpse flower as a chosen ordeal is specific and non-obvious. The doodling custom adds texture but does not constrain a key choice, reading as decorative detail. The emotional arc—hypersensitivity confronting worst-case stimulus—transforms a familiar "face your fear" template through the particular vehicle of the corpse flower and the arboreal setting. However, the resolution relies on asserted transformation ("emerged transformed") rather than a dramatized inflection point that grows inevitably from prior particulars. The piece commits fully to its premise but the final beats retreat into articulated wisdom rather than maintaining the specificity that opens the story.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien is present throughout and her choice to plant the seed frames the arc. However, her key decision (to remain during the bloom) is summarized rather than shown in moment-by-moment turns. The "ambitious herbalist" label is established early, she shapes two beats (planting, enduring bloom), and her stance at closure is tied to her prior pursuit. Missing a visible middle complication where her ambition conflicts with her sensitivity in a dramatized choice; the three-year gap compresses agency into narrated diligence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seed is handled in the opening beat (arrival, unwrapping, doodling on the paper), planted at the platform's edge, and returns at closure as a pressed petal surrounded by doodles. It appears in at least three beats and its bloom drives the climactic ordeal. The object's stench is the causal agent of Lirien's transformation, and its final reprise (pressed petal) reweights the journey. Strong integration but the seed itself (as distinct from the bloom) is less active in the middle; the bloom does most of the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The undercurrent of wisdom" is articulated explicitly ("wisdom had always flowed beneath ambition like an underground river") but does not constrain a choice on the page. It functions as thematic commentary rather than a force that alters Lirien's tactics or options. Old Marin's cryptic line ("the tide turns when thought turns") gestures toward it but does not pressure a decision. The concept is present as a reflective frame but remains ornamental to the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity is established early, constrains her placement of the pot ("at the platform's edge, where wind could carry away some of its eventual perfume"), and is the source of her climactic ordeal during the bloom. The trait is causally active in two beats and shapes the closure by enabling her final insight. However, the three-day vigil summarizes her struggle rather than showing a moment where the sensitivity forces a visible trade-off or tactical shift. The cost is felt but not dramatized in a single on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Journalizing is mentioned in four beats (first evening, ongoing documentation, during the bloom, final pressed petal), but it does not drive a major turn. The action is a reflective accompaniment to events rather than a lever that changes options or tactics. The doodles on the journal pages recur but do not constrain a choice; they are a coping mechanism described rather than shown altering her stance. Functional presence but replaceable with another reflective habit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is introduced in the opening beat and recurs in journal margins, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. It is a textural detail that characterizes Lirien's processing style without causal pressure. The method is seeded early and reprised at closure (pressed petal "surrounded by careful doodles") but remains ornamental; removing it would not break story logic or stakes. Swappable with any other meditative habit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly established and pressures Lirien's choice of pot placement ("at the platform's edge, where wind could carry away some of its eventual perfume"). The swaying platforms become the physical metaphor for "motion" in her goal and the final image ("the treetop village swayed gently… Lirien swayed with it, completely still inside") charges the closure. The setting is causally active in two beats and integral to the thematic resonance. Strong micro-setting use but the village's constraints are not tested in a middle complication.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"At the turning of the tide's thought" is a poetic marker for the seasonal shift (winter to spring) when the bloom begins, and it echoes Old Marin's cryptic line. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the three-year wait and three-day bloom are both summarized without a live clock pressuring tactics. The phrase appears late (after the midpoint) and functions as atmospheric color rather than a constraint. Present but ornamental; no visible effect on Lirien's choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate serenity within motion" is stated early ("her motivation had crystallized"), drives her choice to plant the corpse flower despite her sensitivity, and is reprised at closure ("discovered that the greatest cultivation was… presence itself"). The desire is dramatized in her choice to remain during the bloom, creating friction between her sensitivity and her goal. However, the struggle is summarized rather than shown in moment-by-moment trade-offs. The motivation is causally active in three beats and shapes the ending but the cost is asserted rather than visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" appears only in the final paragraph ("In the wildflower hush of dawn") as a tonal marker for the closure. The tone throughout is contemplative and measured, modulating slightly during the bloom's intensity ("body screamed to flee") but remaining largely static. The phrase is seeded nowhere in the first two-thirds and does not shape pressure or modulate with escalation. A lyric closure accent but ornamental; the same ending would function without this exact phrase.</comment>
