<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is established (seeking where unused love goes), but her agency remains passive—she observes and facilitates rather than making choices under pressure. The elderly woman's grief is embodied through breathing patterns, yet the resolution feels unearned; Marina's declaration "It's not gone" arrives without prior struggle or contradiction. Internal conflict is minimal: Marina proceeds smoothly from question to answer without genuine cost or foreclosed options. The camera obscura work reads as therapeutic procedure rather than character-defining choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (image-led, breathing pattern accumulates meaning). Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The closure unit—unused love revealed in breath and light—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks felt cost; Marina's question is answered too cleanly without sacrifice or tactical constraint. The "past life memory" frame introduces a causal thread that dissolves into atmosphere without shaping present stakes. One meaningful deepening occurs (the woman's knot loosening), but the protagonist does not alter or foreclose a path—she confirms what she sought.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct and blooming wisteria anchor setting early and return at closure with charged imagery. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting, constraining perception through Kwan Yin's tear and shaping the healing sequence. Sensory detail is purposeful: "violet waves," "breathing in shallow, rapid bursts," "light radiating...golden and soft as pollen." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The twilight atmosphere modulates pressure subtly, supporting the foggy-lucid tone without becoming static postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (where unused love goes) is signaled in paragraph one but resolved through revelation rather than escalation. No meaningful reversal or tightening: the woman arrives needing help, Marina applies her method, the knot dissolves, answer found. Coincidence (the woman "sent for a healer") enables rather than complicates. Agency is observation, not choice—Marina could have refused, probed the woman's resistance, or confronted her own unused love, but instead she enacts a smooth procedure. Cost is absent: no tactical trade-off, no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (unused love stored in the body, released through breath) emerges from image and action rather than statement. The crystal, breathing rhythm, and dissolving knot create subtext. However, the thematic question receives a tidy answer without ambiguity: "It's here, in your breath." The final paragraph edges toward thesis ("not to capture images, but to release them"), undercutting earned resonance. Emotional honesty is present in the woman's tears, yet Marina's epiphany feels unearned—she sought an answer and received it without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marina; perceptual signature is consistent (artist's attention to light, shadow, breathing patterns). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "arrived like light through a pinhole," "what yearned to be," "foggy lucidity." The woman's dialogue is spare and goal-driven. Psychic distance is managed well, staying close during the healing sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak pressure (the healing beat), rhythm tightens appropriately without register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in sensory passages. Minor scaffold appears: "Marina understood then" tells rather than shows the decision to proceed. The phrase "spiritually curious" repeats twice in close proximity. Metaphor density is elevated ("like smoke on her tongue," "light through a pinhole," "ink in water, like stars in fog") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are maintained, though the healing sequence could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The camera obscura artist premise offers a fresh synthesis of spiritual curiosity and image-making. The specific crystal (Kwan Yin's tear showing "what yearned to be") and breathing-as-healing method are memorable particulars. However, the healer-arrives-helps-stranger frame follows a familiar arc without subversion. The past-life thread promises complexity but evaporates into atmosphere. Emotional truth in the woman's grief is present, yet the resolution—love visualized, tears flow, healing complete—hits predictable beats. The transformation test is borderline: swap names and setting, the arc persists unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marina (camera obscura artist) is present throughout and her role shapes the healing sequence. However, her choices are minimal: she agrees to help, adjusts the crystal, instructs breathing. Observation dominates over decision. She does not face a competing stake or tactical dilemma. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is low—she enacts a known method without cost or error.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear (the crystal) is introduced early, handled twice (adjusting at mid-scene, one final adjustment), and shapes the closure image by revealing the woman's light. Its unique property ("showed not what was, but what yearned to be") matters to the healing. Swappable with "magic lens" but specificity and temple origin add texture. Present in all three gates; causal role is functional but not indispensable—another lens could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" is defined early as "someone who traveled...toward better questions, collecting light and shadow." It frames Marina's identity but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The concept is ornamental: remove it, the story's logic persists. No middle development or closure participation beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" appears twice as a label. It motivates Marina's journey and her willingness to help, but no on-page action tests this trait with cost. It enables rather than constrains. Functional setup, but no middle beat involvement or closure reweighting. Swappable with "empathetic" or "open-minded" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heal" is the central action: Marina facilitates the woman's emotional release. Present in setup (woman seeks healer), middle (breathing exercise), and ending (healing complete). However, the act is procedural—Marina applies her method without obstacle, error, or trade-off. Swappable with "reveal" or "counsel" with minor edits. Causal but not indispensable; the stakes could pivot to another action (e.g., confront, refuse) without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Revealing through breathing changes" is signaled early ("breathing came in shallow, rapid bursts"), demonstrated in the middle beat (Marina instructs, woman matches rhythm, knot loosens), and shapes the ending (breath releases love). Mechanics matter: the method is specific and causal. However, it could be swapped for another somatic technique (touch, sound) without breaking logic. Present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom is established in paragraph one, returned in the final image ("the viaduct bloomed eternal"). Wisteria provides atmosphere and a visual motif. The setting does not constrain choice or supply tactical resources—the healing could occur in any quiet outdoor space. Setup and closure participation earn mid-band; lack of middle pressure limits score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the past life memory surfaces" anchors the timeframe ("three days ago"). It motivates Marina's question but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The memory is backstory; no live clock pressures the present scene. Setup only, no middle development or closure participation. Swappable with any recent catalyst.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To find where unused love is stored" drives Marina's quest and frames the thematic question. Present in setup, tested in the middle (woman's unexpressed love for her daughter), answered at closure ("It's here, in your breath"). However, the motivation is satisfied without friction or competing cost—Marina seeks, finds, confirms. No dramatized internal conflict between this want and another. Functional across beats but replaceable with another existential question.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is maintained through diction ("inverted, true," "shimmer...dark and knotted like roots," "luminous, like ink in water, like stars in fog") and pacing (slow, meditative rhythm). Tone modulates subtly during the healing sequence, tightening slightly without breaking the dream-logic register. It charges the final image ("bloomed eternal in the gathering dark"). Coherent throughout; could be more dynamically varied under pressure but purposeful and consistent.</comment>
