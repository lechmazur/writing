<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The harmonic stone skimmer possesses a consistent, calcified resolve and her choice to help the trapped pulse is motivated by centuries of reverent listening. However, her interior life leans heavily on summary ("She was historically reverent by nature and necessity") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final teaching moment—spreading consciousness through echoes—feels more like an expository transfer than a dramatized struggle with visible cost. The wandering pulse's arc is vivid, but the protagonist's own stakes and internal friction remain muted.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pulse shifts from frantic loop to purposeful wandering, and the skimmer adds "one more voice to the canyon's eternal song." The cost is legible—she remains unmoving, dust settling afresh, her own navigation unchanged—but the price feels more conceptual than visceral. The Accumulative lens holds across the piece (echoes folding, bird patterns decoding memory), and the final image reweights the arrowhead's meaning. Orientation is clear early (canyon, bone towers, three hundred years), and causality is clean: arrowhead arrival → bird observation → teaching through hum → release.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly particular, with femurs and skulls creating "melodies of memory" and dust layered through centuries. The setting directly constrains the protagonist's method—navigation through resonance rather than movement—and the bird flock's descent transforms echoes, enabling the skimmer's appraisal. Sensory detail is filtered through the skimmer's auditory bias (pitch of human hands, frequency matching vibration), and the arrowhead's placement "at her feet" charges the final stillness. The environment is indispensable to both method and closure.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—releasing the trapped hunter's pulse—is signaled clearly when the arrowhead arrives with its "wandering, untethered" consciousness. Pressure tightens through the bird-pattern appraisal, revealing the pulse's origin and frantic loop, then deepens when the skimmer must teach stillness to something defined by motion. The reversal is clean: from chase-obsessed circling to expansive echo-mapping. However, the skimmer's own agency feels understated—she waits, hums, and teaches without visible personal cost or tactical adaptation. The resolution is protagonist-driven but lacks a felt trade-off or foreclosed path for her.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the duality of motion and stillness, pursuit and patience, embodied in the skimmer's centuries-long lesson and the hunter's arrested chase. The final image—"navigation of stillness" and "one more voice to the canyon's eternal song"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting the arrowhead's imprisonment as potential rather than trap. The piece invites reflection on how consciousness can travel without the body, and how reverence for legacy shapes the present. No prompt-language intrudes, and the bone towers' cyclical singing subtly mirrors the pulse's transformation from loop to exploration.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through the skimmer's auditory-focused perception ("pitch of human hands," "frequency that matched the arrowhead's internal vibration"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("weathered resolve," "perfect her art"), though some phrases veer toward lyric abstraction ("consciousness ranged across the canyon") without grounding micro-action. Psychic distance is controlled, and there is no head-hopping. Brief elevated constructions ("Through centuries of layered dust") fit the timeless voice, but a few filter-adjacent constructions ("she felt something else") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("folded into itself like prayers spoken in rounds," "coating itself in the dust of countless seasons"). However, several adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "The pulse showed her this through the birds' sudden scatter and regroup—the pattern of interruption, of motion arrested. The consciousness had been so focused on the chase that it couldn't conceive of stillness, even in death." This paraphrase loop and the summary-heavy middle section ("She showed it what she had learned through centuries") reduce information density and slightly flatten momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the teaching sequence leans on telling over dramatized embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—a centuries-still being who navigates via sound helping a hunter's trapped consciousness escape its loop—offers a fresh synthesis of stasis, reverence, and psychic release. The bird-flock appraisal method is specific and visually striking, and the emotional truth of the hunter's arrested chase feels earned. However, the arc relies on familiar mentor-teaches-stuck-soul beats, and the skimmer's own transformation is minimal, limiting the boldness of the resolution. The combination of elements is original enough to avoid template feel, but the stakes and final image do not quite surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout and her decision to help the pulse is signaled early ("To help it, she would need to appraise its true nature"). She makes the key choice to hum and teach the pulse, directly enabling the closure. However, her own stakes and internal conflict are muted—she waits, then acts without visible cost or tactical adaptation. Her three-hundred-year stillness is background rather than a constraint tested on the page. Setup, middle involvement, and closure presence are all met, but causal pressure and cost connection are modest. The story works without her making a difficult trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The stone arrowhead appears early, is handled across multiple beats (arrival, appraisal via birds, teaching hum, final quiet), and its state evolves from frantic pulse-container to peaceful repository. Its "pulse left wandering" drives the central conflict, and its final stillness "in a new way" charges the closure image. The arrowhead's properties—flint holding consciousness, vibration matching the skimmer's hum—are specific and irreplaceable. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met, with strong closure linkage and beat involvement. It shapes the ending decisively and could not be swapped without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The "pulse left wandering" is signaled in the second paragraph and drives the entire conflict: the hunter's consciousness circles endlessly, unable to rest, and the skimmer's task is to release it. The concept shapes the bird-pattern appraisal (scatter and regroup showing interruption) and the teaching hum that expands the pulse outward. It is causally active across beats and present at closure ("The pulse still wandered, but now with purpose"). However, the concept overlaps heavily with the arrowhead (9B), and its mechanics—how a pulse enters stone, how it learns—are more asserted than dramatized. Setup, development, and payoff are met, with solid causal pressure but limited specificity beyond the arrowhead.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Historically reverent" is stated early ("She was historically reverent by nature and necessity") and motivates her careful listening to the bone towers and her decision not to "silence herself." It frames her patient approach to the trapped pulse. However, the trait functions more as backstory coloring than an on-page constraint with visible cost. There is no moment where reverence forces a difficult choice or trade-off—she simply applies it. Setup and thematic presence are met, but middle development (a beat where reverence constrains action) and closure linkage are weak. The trait is consistent but not irreplaceable; patience or wisdom could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Appraise" is central: the skimmer waits to appraise the pulse's nature, then uses the bird flock to read its pattern, revealing the hunter's arrested death. This action drives the middle turn and enables the teaching resolution. However, "appraise" is somewhat generic—observe, decode, or understand could replace it with minimal structural change. The method (bird patterns) does the heavier causal lifting. Setup (signaled at "she would need to appraise its true nature"), development (bird-reading beat), and payoff (understanding blooms, leading to the hum) are all present. Causal pressure is solid, but specificity and irreplaceability are modest. The action shapes the arc but is not uniquely indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The bird flock is signaled ("Three days later, the birds arrived") and its mechanics matter: each bird becomes a note, formations become phrases, and the collective movement decodes the pulse's loop. The method is specific and visually striking, enabling the skimmer's understanding and subsequent teaching. It appears in the middle beat and directly shapes the resolution. However, it is introduced late (well past the first third) and used in only one extended sequence. Setup is weak (late arrival triggers −0.3), but development and payoff are strong. The flock's scatter-and-regroup pattern is irreplaceable for this exact appraisal, lifting the score despite the late intro.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is present from the opening line and inseparable from the skimmer's method: she navigates via resonance, bone towers sing civilizations' stories, and echoes never die but fold into rounds. The setting enables the teaching ("She began to hum, a frequency that matched the arrowhead's internal vibration. The sound traveled through the dust at her feet, into the flint") and charges the final image ("the canyon's eternal song"). Setup, development (bone towers contextualize the pulse's people), and payoff are all met. The setting is causally indispensable—remove it and navigation-by-resonance collapses. High irreplaceability and closure linkage push this into the strong band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" appears early and establishes the skimmer's timescale ("three hundred years," "ages"), framing her patience and the bone towers' accumulated memory. However, the timeframe functions as atmospheric backstory rather than a live constraint. The three-day wait for the birds is the only on-page duration that affects tactics, and it feels arbitrary rather than pressured. There is no clock tightening decisions or foreclosing options. Setup is present, but middle development and payoff are weak—the centuries contextualize character but do not alter choices. Swappable with "long ages" or "eons" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is her perfected art, stated early and demonstrated through her stillness and echo-ranging consciousness. It motivates her teaching: she shows the pulse how to "travel infinite distances while remaining perfectly still." However, the motivation is past-tense mastery rather than an active, conflicted want. There is no friction between her desire and a cost—she has already achieved stillness and simply shares it. Setup and thematic presence are strong, but the motivation does not drive a difficult on-page choice or escalate under pressure. It shapes the method but lacks the dramatized friction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Weathered resolve" is coherent throughout: the skimmer waits with patience, hums with steady frequency, and remains unmoving as dust settles. The tone modulates subtly—from the arrowhead's arrival ("singing a note she hadn't heard in ages") to the birds' transformative spiral to the final quiet peace. The tone charges the ending image ("dust settling fresh upon her shoulders") and reflects the accumulation of echoes and time. However, the tone is consistent rather than dynamically pressured; it does not shift sharply at the climax. Setup, development, and payoff are met, with solid coherence and a purposeful final modulation that reweights the opening stillness.</comment>
