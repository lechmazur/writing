<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's interior world is concrete and contradictory—her fingers seeking the parachute buckle as both escape and nervous habit, her body moving through practiced paths while doubt threatens pattern work. The micro-choices (releasing the buckle, deciding to teach rather than pronounce) carry visible cost and embody her struggle between authority and transparency. Internal conflict operates simultaneously rather than in alternating summary. Minor slip: the "crushing responsibility" and "watcher's burden" phrases edge toward declaration rather than fully embodied experience, though the tactile work and final renunciation recover the ground.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost: Vera chooses transparency over escape, releasing the buckle in the final beat and committing to share her burden rather than hoard authority. The inferred lens is Causal-Situational hybrid (pressure forces stance crystallization; her methodology choice alters trust dynamics). One meaningful tightening occurs when the council's contradicting reports force immediate revision, narrowing her options to either insist or teach. Cost is legible on the page: "Some burdens were meant to be carried, not escaped." Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The radio-silence setup and council challenge drive escalation without coincidental resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arbor setting pressures Vera's choices: three thousand feet of isolation, the parachute as constant option, silver leaves that must be read through touch and arrangement. The nocturnal arbor constrains her to midnight work and embodied pattern-seeking. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—bark, leaf moisture, wind-carried rain scent—filtered through professional attention. Micro-setting through body and tool (fingers on bark, buckle at belt) charges the final image. Minor gap: the "mechanisms Vera had long ceased questioning" gesture toward world-building without payoff, a small pocket of unexplored specificity that doesn't constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving trust while defending an accurate reading—is signaled early and tightens when the council's contradicting reports arrive. One meaningful reversal: Vera's choice shifts from defending her authority to teaching her method, a tactic change that forecloses the simpler path of pronouncement. Agency is clear (she composes the message, releases the buckle) and the cost is visible: sharing methodology redistributes the burden and risks exposing fallibility. The escalation is driven by protagonist decision under situational pressure. No coincidental resolution; her reading stands because she can demonstrate it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of burden-sharing versus solitary authority emerges through Vera's tactile work and final choice to teach rather than pronounce. The arbor's suspension mirrors her isolation, and the parachute buckle accumulates meaning from escape to renunciation without overt symbolism. The ending reweights the watcher's role as collaborative rather than hierarchical. Minor slip: "Some burdens were meant to be carried, not escaped. Some heights were meant for watching, not falling" edges toward thematic statement rather than purely resonant image, though the prior buckle-release action earns much of the weight. The "soundless echo of truth" motif recurs but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Vera's perceptual signature clear: professional noticing (moisture content, wind direction), nervous habit (buckle-touching), embodied pattern-seeking. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("the crushing responsibility," "soundless echo"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to environmental awareness. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated. Minor slip: "The leaves whispered agreements in silver and shadow, and Vera understood" in the final paragraph drifts slightly elevated for the established register, though it reads intentional for closure rhythm. No head-hopping; internal access remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity is strong through most beats. Notable weaknesses: paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("Being attentively inventive had always been her strength—seeing connections others missed, finding meaning in seemingly random arrangements") restates without added pressure. The phrase "soundless echo of truth reverberating through her bones" mixes metaphor (soundless yet reverberating). Template cadence in paragraph seven: "Three steps left, duck beneath the lowhanging bough, reach up to touch the intersection point" reads procedural without pressure modulation. Modest line-level artifacts accumulate but don't obscure closure. Apply −0.8 for two distinct issues (paraphrase + metaphor muddle) per accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of cloud-station pattern-reading through embodied tactile work offers a fresh angle. Vera's choice to teach rather than defend authority transforms the trust-under-pressure template through specific methodology (muscle memory, leaf arrangements). The arbor as floating workspace is vivid. Weaknesses: "watcher's burden" and "pattern seeker" read slightly generic without deeper transformation; the emotional arc (doubt → confidence → sharing) follows a familiar path. The parachute buckle as recurring motif is purposeful but not entirely surprising. Risk-taking in the quiet, embodied closure is solid but doesn't push into higher originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's identity as midnight pattern seeker frames her skill set and drives two key choices: trusting her original reading over the council's reports, and choosing to teach her methodology. Present in opening, middle (reading the patterns), and closure (transmitting the teaching message). The role constrains her to nocturnal work and tactile interpretation. Could be genericized to "weather predictor" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure; modest specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Parachute buckle appears in three beats: nervous habit when doubt strikes, considered escape option mid-scene, and released renunciation at closure. The object's meaning evolves from safety to temptation to rejected path, directly shaping the final stance. Early signal (paragraph five), middle development (paragraph nine), closure participation (final paragraph). Visible cost tied to releasing it. Could be replaced with another escape mechanism (radio call, ladder), but the tactile buckle-touching fits the embodied pattern work. Strong integration with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"The watcher's burden" is named in paragraph two, drives Vera's stakes (responsibility for valley lives), and is reweighted at closure when she chooses to share rather than hoard it. The concept constrains her to stay despite escape temptation and shapes the teaching decision. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is implicit (the burden causes her doubt). The phrasing "watcher's burden" reads slightly generic; the story could swap to "guardian's duty" or similar with minimal edits. Solid causal role; modest specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is introduced in paragraph four as Vera's strength in seeing connections others miss. It enables her pattern-reading but doesn't visibly constrain a choice or impose cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized through a specific on-page tradeoff. No clear middle beat where this attribute shapes a tactic differently than "careful" or "skilled" would. Present in setup, absent in development and closure participation. Functional but replaceable label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The action "revise" (her prediction) is the council's demand in paragraph three and drives Vera's central conflict: defend the original reading or comply. Her decision to revise her *approach* (teaching rather than insisting) rather than her *prediction* creates the major turn. The revision request forces the pattern re-reading and the final message composition. Present in inciting pressure, middle examination, and closure message. Could be swapped to "confirm" or "explain" with structural edits, but "revise" specifically charges the trust-versus-accuracy tension. Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Remembering through muscle memory" is named in paragraph five and demonstrated in paragraph six when Vera's hands trace the arbor's geometry without conscious thought. The method enables her to re-confirm the reading under pressure and is signaled early. No explicit reprise at closure, though the decision to teach implies sharing this embodied knowledge. Present in setup and middle development; closure linkage is thematic rather than direct. The method shapes one key beat (the re-reading) and differentiates her approach from visual observation. Moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor suspended three thousand feet above the valley is introduced immediately, creates isolation that tests Vera's resolve, provides the silver leaves and branches she must read, and appears in the closure image ("arbor swayed gently"). The setting constrains her to embodied tactile work in darkness and makes the parachute escape option concrete. Present in setup, middle (the reading space), and payoff (swaying in winds that carry rain scent). Removing the arbor would break the story's spatial logic and stakes. Strong integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Radio static clearing "an hour ago" is mentioned in paragraph three and enables the council's message to arrive, setting up the immediate revision demand. The timeframe "after the radio static clears" anchors the window but doesn't create visible time pressure once the message is received. Vera's work unfolds at her pace with no countdown or escalating clock. Present in setup; absent in middle tightening and closure. The element functions as inciting trigger but doesn't shape tactics through elapsed time. Functional but thin causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to preserve trust is declared in paragraph three ("Trust, carefully preserved through five years of accurate readings, now balanced on this single night's work") and drives her entire arc. The tension between insisting (risking trust) and teaching (sharing burden) shapes her final choice. Present in setup, middle conflict (the temptation to escape), and closure (choosing transparency). Visible cost: she must expose her methodology and risk appearing fallible. The motivation is dramatized through the buckle-touching, the re-reading, and the message composition. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears in paragraph seven ("the soundless echo of truth reverberating through her bones") and recurs in the final paragraph ("translating their soundless echo into words"). The tone suggests ineffable knowledge made legible, coherent with the tactile pattern-work. It modulates from internal certainty to outward translation. Present in middle and closure; setup is implicit in the quiet, embodied opening. The phrasing charges the final image but remains somewhat abstract. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake with moderate cost. Solid thematic resonance; modest specificity.</comment>
