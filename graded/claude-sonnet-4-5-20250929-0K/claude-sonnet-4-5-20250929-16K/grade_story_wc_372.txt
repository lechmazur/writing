<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste's interiority is concrete and embodied through her archival work, with her transformation from preserver to transmitter earned by prior causality. Her motivations are clear—dedication to preservation evolving into acceptance of necessary transformation—and the final choice to release the capsule while staying behind carries visible cost. Internal contradiction operates through her simultaneous acceptance of death and commitment to continuity. Minor slip: the emotional progression feels slightly too smooth given the magnitude of choosing to die with the library.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Celeste releases the capsule and accepts the library's fall with visible cost—her own death. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through measured frequencies, reweaving patterns, and the final image of descent. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). One meaningful deepening occurs when Celeste realizes preservation requires transformation. The cost is undeniable on the page: "standing quiet among the shelves, having already sent the most important record ahead."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Frozen Library functions as more than setting—its crystalline architecture, quartz chamber, and cloud-suspension actively constrain Celeste's work and charge the final image of descent. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "breath forming constellations," "quartz hush," ink freezing as she writes. The Resonance Chamber's pure quartz walls that "dampened even the sound of the heart" directly enables the transformation work. Spatial choreography remains clear through ice-veined corridors to chamber to library's edge. The magic lantern slide as micro-object constrains multiple choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving knowledge versus accepting transformation—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Celeste's realization that "the library could not be saved in its current form" followed by her choice to reweave the vows into transmissible form. The stakes escalate from measurement to transformation to release, each narrowing her options. Agency is clear: her "gently meticulous precision" drives the reweaving, and the final act of releasing the capsule while staying behind imposes visible cost (her life). The "Unless" paragraph marks the pressure point that forecloses preservation-as-is.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between preservation and transformation, permanence and adaptation. The magic lantern slide's evolution from "ghost images of vows" to "seed of continuous becoming" enacts the theme through concrete particulars without stating it. "Memory was its own form of magic—changeable, adaptive, alive" reweights the opening's "illusions fade to memory" without moralizing. The final image—capsule falling with "everything that mattered"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether meaning can survive endings. No thesis statement mars the thematic work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric-archival texture through diction ("gently meticulous," "quartz hush," "luminous vows") that feels consistent with the protagonist and setting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, drawing close for Celeste's realization moments and pulling back for the library's groaning descent. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices frequencies, harmonics, crystalline script. Minor register wobble: "propagate through whatever came next" feels slightly more abstract than her established idiom. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm control and vivid imagery ("breath forming constellations," "needles on brass dials began their trembling dance"). Information density is high; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. However, mild overwriting appears in the accumulation of figurative language: "ice-veined corridors," "crystalline script," "quartz hush," "luminous vows" cluster densely without always earning their metaphoric weight. "Imposed their own quartz hush" borders on precious. No loops or scaffold detected. The final image is strong and propulsive. Template cadence appears briefly in paragraph structure but doesn't harm momentum significantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—dying library above clouds, archivist choosing transformation over preservation—offers a fresh angle on librarian-as-last-custodian tropes through the frequency-sampling mechanics and the distinction between static preservation and transmissible seeds. The "luminous vows" concept and crystallizing breath are specific to this world. However, the emotional arc of accepting necessary endings follows a familiar template, and the symbolic apparatus (frozen library = dying knowledge, falling capsule = hope) resolves predictably. The piece commits fully to its premise but doesn't surprise in its execution of the transformation choice. Solid synthesis without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste as "orderly records chief" drives all key turns: measuring the slide's integrity, recognizing preservation must become transformation, reweaving the vows, releasing the capsule, and choosing to stay. Her occupational identity shapes her perceptual filter (frequencies, harmonics, ledgers) and constrains her methods. Present in setup (first paragraph), development (Resonance Chamber work), and closure (release and descent). The trait is causally active across multiple beats with visible cost at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in setup (carried "in both hands," described as holding "ghost images"), development (inserted into frequency scanner, used to reweave vows in the chamber), and closure (placed in suspension capsule and released). It is handled physically in multiple beats, its meaning evolves from static record to "seed of continuous becoming," and its final use—being sent ahead while Celeste stays—charges the ending. Removing it would break the story's core mechanism and closure image. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" shapes stakes (preserving the founders' promises, maintaining the library's levitation) and tactics (measuring their resonance, reweaving their frequencies). The concept appears in setup (introduced in paragraph four), drives the transformation work in the chamber, and informs the closure when the vows become transmissible instructions. It constrains Celeste's options—she must work with the vows' existing frequencies—and the stakes turn on whether they can adapt. Solid causal integration across beats, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears in the opening scene ("gently meticulous steps") and returns in the chamber work ("gently meticulous precision"). The trait enables her success at reweaving the complex harmonic layers and reflects her professional identity. However, it doesn't visibly constrain a choice with felt cost—nothing in the plot hinges on her being meticulous versus hasty. The trait colors her actions but remains more descriptive than causally necessary. Mid-range: present and consistent, but replaceable with similar traits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Measure" drives multiple beats: Celeste measures the slide's resonance patterns with the frequency scanner (confirming vow integrity), measures "each harmonic layer" during the reweaving work, and the act of measurement enables the transformation from static record to transmissible seed. The action shapes her tactics throughout the chamber sequence and cannot be easily swapped—without measuring/sampling, the transformation mechanism breaks. Present in setup (she's brought the slide to measure), development (the scanner work), and implied in closure (the result of measurement). Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" is signaled early (the Resonance Chamber measures "remaining coherence...by sampling frequencies") and becomes the mechanism for transformation: "using the chamber's equipment to measure each harmonic layer of the vows, then reweaving them into a new pattern." The method shapes Celeste's tactics—she must work through frequency patterns rather than direct copying—and enables the story's central turn. The mechanics matter: frequencies that "vibrated with enough strength to be preserved" versus those dissolved "into the static of forgetting." Present across multiple beats with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "frozen library above clouds" constrains choices throughout: its failing levitation creates the inciting pressure (it will fall unless frequencies strengthen), the crystalline shelves and ice-veined corridors embody the preservation mission, the Resonance Chamber's quartz walls enable the transformation work, and the library's edge provides the release point. The setting's imminent fall forces the transformation decision. Geography is clear and functional. The library appears in setup, pressures development, and the final image of its descent alongside Celeste charges closure. Strong integration across all gates with causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" appears in the opening and reprises near the end: "The illusions were fading to memory, yes, but memory was its own form of magic." The timeframe creates ambient pressure (things are ending) but doesn't tighten decisions with a live clock—Celeste works for "hours" without urgency cues. The phrase functions more as thematic framing than tactical constraint. The vows are "flickering like distant stars approaching their final collapse," but no countdown forces her hand. Lyric reprise with conceptual reweighting but limited causal grip on pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is dramatized through Celeste's actions: she moves from measuring (attempting to preserve) to recognizing that "to conjure meaning...required transformation," then executes the reweaving and release. The motivation creates friction—her three-decade dedication to preservation conflicts with acceptance that "the library could not be saved in its current form." The desire shapes the chamber work and the final choice to send the seed forward while staying behind. Present across setup, development, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" operates throughout: the chamber "imposed their own quartz hush upon all who entered, dampening even the sound of the heart," establishing a tone of reverent quiet and crystalline suspension. The tone modulates appropriately—contemplative during measurement, focused during transformation, elegiac at the release. The final image maintains the hush: Celeste "standing quiet among the shelves." The tone charges the closure by making the library's descent feel like a dignified passing rather than catastrophe. Coherent through turns, purposefully restrained, integral to the story's emotional register.</comment>
