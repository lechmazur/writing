<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's progression from debunker to truth-suppressor shows clear internal conflict: her initial confidence ("Maya knew better than to trust comfortable lies") directly opposes her final choice to burn documents. The micro-choices during reconstruction ("her pulse quickened") and the deliberate document-burning sequence embody contradictory impulses under pressure. Vera's character is functional but underdeveloped; her suspicious greeting and tea-service feel staged. The climactic choice to protect the comfortable lie carries visible cost—Maya abandons her fifteen-year mission—but the decision compresses into summary ("she realized") rather than a dramatized struggle with competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Maya burns the evidence, foreclosing her truth-excavation mission to preserve survivors' hope. The causal lens holds—document reconstruction → revelation → moral calculus → choice—with one meaningful tightening when the stillpoint mechanics emerge. Orientation anchors (Maya, orchard gate, post-liquidation wasteland) appear within the first three paragraphs. The fifteen-year backstory and "sharply observant gaze" paragraph delay momentum slightly, but the core because/therefore chain from shredded papers to final renunciation remains unbroken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard's impossible greenness against rust-colored dust establishes vivid situational pressure early; "dust seemed to flow around the orchard rather than through it" makes the anomaly concrete. The shredded-paper reconstruction provides tactile micro-setting that constrains Maya's investigation method across the night sequence. The wasteland exterior charges the final stakes—destruction of the diamond means "the last pure place would become as poisoned as everything else"—but spatial choreography inside Vera's cottage (table, stove, window) remains generic and doesn't pressure the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to reveal or suppress the stillpoint truth—signals clearly in the opening (debunking conspiracy theories) and tightens when Maya pieces together the memos. The reconstruction sequence provides one meaningful escalation: external radiation intensification is the causal price of the preserved orchard. Maya's agency at closure (burning documents) forecloses her excavation mission with legible cost, though the calculus compresses into a single paragraph. The survivors' desire to destroy the diamond adds external pressure but remains off-page; no immediate antagonist tests Maya's choice in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the stillpoint mechanics: preserving one precious thing required sacrificing everything beyond its borders, reframing "curse" from random suffering to calculated triage. The final image—"better left buried beneath the thriving apple trees"—answers the opening question (comfortable lie vs. uncomfortable truth) without stating a moral, and "knowing when to stop digging" reconfigures Maya's excavation mission with ironic cost. The Krasnov Diamond's "teardrop" inclusion and "sometimes excavating truth" line hover near thematic echo but stay within character voice during decision pressure. No heavy-handed thesis intrudes on the stove-feeding closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Maya catalogs details (radiation burns, dust flow, document edges) consistent with her debunker role. Dialogue is sparse but functional—Vera's "You're the debunker" and "They want it destroyed" advance plot without exposition dump. The phrase "sharply observant gaze already cataloging details" tells rather than shows; filter verbs ("she'd come," "she realized") stack in peak beats. Under decision pressure, diction holds ("terrible mosaic," "fragment of hope") without register drift, though "terrible mosaic" borders on elevated metaphor for crisis thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high in the reconstruction sequence: memo fragments, geometric anchor detail, and radiation-push mechanics unfold without redundancy. However, paraphrase loops appear: "spent fifteen years debunking conspiracy theories" / "Come to tell us our diamond curse is nonsense" restate the same setup, and "They sacrificed everything else to save the orchard. The diamond is buried here, still working" repeats closure logic already clear from Maya's prior thought. Template cadence in the climactic paragraph ("The comfortable lie had been...The uncomfortable truth was...") flattens propulsion. The opening sentence effectively anchors voice and stakes; the final line's "stop digging" metaphor charges earlier excavation language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stillpoint-as-radiation-redistributor transforms the cursed-object trope through specific physics (geometric anchor, containment field) and adds moral calculus: intentional sacrifice versus random curse. Maya's choice to suppress truth rather than debunk it inverts the conspiracy-debunker premise with non-obvious stakes. The shredded-document reconstruction and orchard-amid-wasteland juxtaposition feel particular to this scenario. Risk is present—ending on document destruction rather than revelation—but the "know when to stop digging" closer borders on tidy aphorism that slightly softens the harder image of feeding papers into the stove.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's debunker role drives setup (fifteen-year backstory, arrival to excavate truth), the middle reconstruction sequence (assembling shredded letters, discovering stillpoint mechanics), and the closure choice (burning documents to preserve the comfortable lie). Her decision to suppress rather than reveal truth creates the story's final reversal and forecloses her stated mission with visible cost. The character appears in all three gates and her occupation-specific skill (intuiting document locations, matching torn edges) enables the investigation that generates the moral dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Krasnov Diamond is present in beat one (tale, teardrop inclusion, scapegoat backstory), returns in the memo reconstruction (tested as focus, geometric anchor for the field), and charges the ending stakes (survivors want it destroyed; destruction would collapse the stillpoint). Its unique internal flaw—teardrop-shaped inclusion—provides the technical specificity that makes it irreplaceable as the field anchor. However, the diamond itself never appears physically on the page; Maya never sees, handles, or confronts the object, only reconstructs its documented role. The element shapes causal logic and closure consequences but remains abstract throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept seeds early (orchard greenness, dust flowing around rather than through), drives the reconstruction discovery (containment field maintains stability, radiation pushed outward), and supplies the closure stakes: destroying the diamond collapses the stillpoint, poisoning the last pure place. The mechanics—bubble of normalcy with catastrophic side effects—redefine the curse as intentional triage and create Maya's moral calculus. The concept is irreplaceable: swapping "stillpoint" for another containment metaphor would require rewriting the physics, the Institute memos, and the radiation-redistribution consequence that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is labeled in paragraph three ("her sharply observant gaze already cataloging details") and demonstrated through specific noticing (radiation burns, dust behavior, torn document edges). The trait enables the reconstruction work—matching torn edges and faded ink requires sustained attention—but observation itself doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost. Maya's decision to burn the documents arises from moral calculus, not observational acuity; a less observant character could have reached the same ethical fork once the memos were reassembled. The attribute shapes method but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Intuition drives Maya's arrival at the orchard ("Maya had intuited there would be documents here") and enables the reconstruction logic ("she could intuit the answer from the reassembled letters"). The trait shortcuts investigative labor and provides the causal link from fragments to understanding. However, "intuit" here functions as narrative summary rather than dramatized insight; the reader is told Maya intuited rather than shown the perceptual or deductive process that generates the leap. The action could be replaced with "researched," "deduced," or "expected" with minor wording shifts, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled in setup (metal box, protocol destruction), occupies the entire middle investigative sequence (matching torn edges, piecing together memos, working through the night), and generates the closure dilemma: the reconstructed truth must be destroyed to preserve hope. The mechanics are specific—"spread the strips across Vera's table," "patterns emerged," "truth had assembled itself like a terrible mosaic"—and irreplaceable; a different investigation method (digital files, witness interviews) would eliminate the tactile reconstruction labor and the ironic reversal of assembling truth only to burn it. The method shapes both tactics and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard juxtaposition anchors the opening image (rust-colored dust storm, impossibly green trees), provides the anomaly that drives investigation, and charges the closure stakes: destroying the diamond poisons "the last pure place." The radioactive soil and thriving fruit trees create the physical impossibility that the stillpoint mechanics must explain. Spatial details—gate, cottage, table, stove, window view—ground the reconstruction sequence. The setting is indispensable: relocating to a non-wasteland or removing the orchard would eliminate the survival-versus-truth tension and the visible cost of Maya's choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The post-liquidation timeframe is established early (three provinces into deadlands, survivors needing someone to blame) and provides context for the Institute's desperate experiment and the survivors' curse belief. The fifteen-year gap (Maya's debunking career) adds character backstory. However, time doesn't tighten present decisions—no countdown or deadline pressures Maya's choice. The "after" framing is necessary for the wasteland setting and survivor politics but functions as static backdrop rather than active constraint; the story could occur one year or fifty years post-liquidation without altering Maya's moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya's truth-excavation mission is stated in the opening ("excavate truth," fifteen years debunking, "knew better than to trust comfortable lies"), drives the reconstruction sequence (her pulse quickening at each discovery), and creates the closure conflict when truth itself becomes the threat to hope. The motivation generates visible friction: Maya's professional identity requires revelation, but the stillpoint's cost demands suppression. The final choice to burn documents forecloses her stated goal with clear renunciation. The desire is dramatized through concrete action (document assembly, feeding papers to the stove) rather than merely claimed.</comment>
