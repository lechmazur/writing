<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (trapped composition, maternal guilt) is clear and her final realization is earned by the locksmith's orchestrated revelation. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("improbable longing," "enveloped secrets") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic epiphany "that creating something beautiful would mean I loved her less" feels therapy-speak diagnostic rather than discovered through scene pressure. Micro-choices are present (withdrawing the handkerchief, accepting the device's use) but remain illustrative of pre-stated fear rather than forcing new trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Mara seeks the locksmith → device reveals fear's architecture → understanding floods → she exits with the symphony unlocked. Orientation anchors (shadowed nexus, locksmith's shop, Mara + handkerchief) land within the first ~80 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "some locks exist only because we forget we've always held the key" reweights the premise with visible cost (tears, the aching longing remains). The causality holds, though the device's mechanics ("sounds emerged—not melodies, but the architecture of feeling") remain somewhat abstract, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus, shifting key-sign, and astrolabe-music-box device are vivid and voice-filtered. The lock of hair charges the final image (threaded with starlight) and the waiting-for-Venus beat anchors time. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, window, roofline, doorway). The device constrains the middle choice (Mara must accept disorientation to proceed), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: "three alleys converged" and "twilight surrendering to night" trend toward stock phrasing, and the walls-breathing effect is gestured at rather than grounded in Mara's specific perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock the trapped idea to repair estrangement with Clara) is signaled early and remains coherent. The locksmith's requirement ("disorient you, shake foundations") introduces cost, and Mara's mid-beat gasped confession narrows options by stripping the protective lie. The device chimes, walls steady, understanding floods—a meaningful tightening that forecloses the self-deception path. Cost is legible (tears, the daughter's absence persists, longing remains aching) and the protagonist's acceptance of vulnerability drives the turn. One pressure point is sufficient at this length; escalation reads as deepening rather than reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core question—whether self-expression and maternal love must be mutually exclusive—emerges through the lock-of-hair motif, the astrolabe device, and Mara's climactic realization. The ending ("some locks exist only because we forget we've always held the key") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights sacrifice as self-imprisonment without sermonic statement. The starlight-threaded ribbon and "small resurrections" image charge the closure. Minor slip: "the relentless pursuit of beauty even when the world demanded practicality" edges toward thematic statement rather than remaining fully implicit in the action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (clutching the handkerchief, remembering Clara's disappointed eyes) is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext ("You're here to unlock something" / "The key lies in what you've already given away"). Distance control is clean. However, diction drifts elevated in peak beats: "enveloped secrets," "improbable longing," "scaffolding on which notes might climb," "infinite dark" read as authorial poeticism rather than Mara's urgent thought under pressure. The locksmith's voice and Mara's converge in register ("relentless pursuit of beauty"), reducing distinctness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "wisps of smoke," "instruments that defied classification," "raw need beneath," "architecture of feeling," "scaffolding on which notes might climb," "constellations finding their shapes in the infinite dark." This clusters in every beat, including the disorientation climax, applying −0.5. Stock metaphor pairs appear: "trembling with improbable longing," "deepening blue," "streaming tears." Template cadence in the reflection beat: "I was afraid... And now?... The device chimed... The walls steadied. Understanding flooded..." reads as stacked filter-verb + declarative summary. Paraphrase loop: "the fear had never protected Clara, only imprisoned the full truth" restates the prior realization without new pressure. Cumulative Q7 deductions: −1.2, and the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The locksmith-as-therapist premise is familiar (mystical guide unlocks emotional truth), and the story does not substantially transform it—the mechanics (device, disorienting turn, epiphany) follow predictable beats. The lock-of-hair motif and astrolabe-music-box device add specificity, and the ending's quiet resonance (sending the ribbon to Clara, "small resurrections") offers a non-obvious final note. However, the emotional arc (fear of selfishness → realization that creation honors love) and the wisdom delivered ("it's never too late to stop hiding") trend generic. Transformation test: swapping names and the specific art form (symphony) would not alter the emotional structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The locksmith appears early (setup), drives the middle choice by offering the device and requiring Mara's acceptance of disorientation (development), and delivers the final insight ("send it to her") that shapes the closure action (payoff). His decisions constrain Mara's options at two beats (waiting for Venus, operating the device). However, his role is largely facilitative; Mara's internal realization does the heavier causal lifting. Swappability: a therapist or oracle could serve a similar function with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lock of hair appears early (Mara clutches the handkerchief, beat one), is placed in the device (beat two), and returns threaded with starlight in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning (closure payoff). It represents sacrifice-as-cage and its transformation into a message of courage. Three gates met; three distinct beats; causal pressure (the device requires it to operate) +1.0; closure linkage +1.2; specificity (ribbon color, starlight threading) +0.5. Total ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept "enveloped secrets" is named in the locksmith's opening line and shapes the dominant stake (unlocking the trapped idea). However, it remains largely thematic; the on-page mechanics are disorientation and device-operation rather than secret-unwrapping. It frames expectation but does not constrain tactics in a specific, irreplaceable way. Setup +0.5, one beat (opening dialogue) +0.4, thematic presence without mechanical pressure −0.6. Score ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "unassumingly bold" is applied to the locksmith's gaze ("his gaze unassumingly bold, piercing through pretense"). It is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates how being unassuming enables boldness or costs him something. Late first mention (second beat) −0.3, ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3. Score ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The action "disorient" is required by the locksmith, enacted by the device (walls breathing, floor tilting), and drives Mara's confession ("I was afraid..."). It redefines options by stripping her protective narrative. Setup +0.6, two beats (requirement + execution) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, cost connection (her certainty dissolves) +0.5. Total ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method "a hint given by first star seen at twilight" is signaled early (locksmith: "we begin when the first star appears"), shapes the waiting beat, and delivers the hint ("Venus... the key lies in what you've already given away"). Setup +0.7, two beats (waiting + hint delivery) +0.9, causal pressure (the hint shifts Mara's understanding) +1.0, closure linkage (the hint precipitates the device use) +0.9. However, the hint itself is somewhat generic (sacrifice-as-cage) and could be delivered another way. Swappability −0.4. Score ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is established early and frames the entire encounter. The starlight recurs (Venus, starlight-threaded ribbon) and charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a middle choice; Mara could have this realization anywhere. Setup +0.7, closure linkage (starlight reprise) +1.1, lyric resonance +0.5, lacks middle causal pressure −0.5. Score ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the hush of cosmic possibility" is present in the waiting-for-Venus beat ("time becoming fluid, negotiable"). It creates atmospheric pressure but does not tighten decisions; no clock forces Mara's moves. Setup +0.4, one beat (waiting) +0.4, thematic presence without tactical constraint −0.6. Score ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to free an idea trapped behind fear" is Mara's stated goal and drives every beat. It is dramatized through her confession, the device's use, and the final decision to send the ribbon. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (tears, longing remains) +0.5. Total ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "improbable longing" is established early ("words trembling with improbable longing") and recurs ("The longing remained—improbable, aching—but no longer suffocating"). It modulates with pressure (trembling → aching → no longer suffocating) and charges the final image. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, modulation under pressure +0.6. However, "improbable" reads as slightly forced poetic diction. Register friction −0.4. Score ~6.9.</comment>
