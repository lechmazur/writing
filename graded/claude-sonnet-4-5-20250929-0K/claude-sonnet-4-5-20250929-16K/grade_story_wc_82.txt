<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief is embodied through concrete action (polishing gems, folding cranes) rather than pure summary, and her teaching others provides stakes beyond solipsism. However, the internal arc relies heavily on metaphor rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in choice—she moves smoothly from torment to acceptance without visible friction. The daughter exists only as absence and symbol; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of competing values. The final tea-pouring moment gestures at transformation but doesn't foreclose a live path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by paragraph two. The piece accumulates pressure through the crafting sequence and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when Mira sits among the thousand cranes, her grief transformed into "a garden." The cost—her daughter remains gone, the shadow never reattaches to the body—is conceptually legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she teaches others, expanding the vessel motif. The "descends while ascending" metaphor is applied but doesn't constrain a tactical choice on the page, remaining largely thematic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating tea garden with celestial kettles and the glass basilica supply vivid, specific anchors. The basilica's optical trick ("descends while ascending") recurs to charge the final paragraph's metaphor. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbolic vehicle rather than tactical constraint—no choice is narrowed by proximity, access, or environmental pressure. Sensory detail tilts visual and remains relatively static across the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming unbearable grief into something sustainable. The piece shows one meaningful deepening when Mira's solitary practice becomes communal teaching, and the thousandth crane with the diamond represents a tightening (hardest gem, most recent dream). However, the escalation is more additive than narrowing—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical cost forces a trade-off. Agency is present (she chooses to craft, to teach) but without on-page friction or reversal that tests commitment under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lantern-making and crane-folding: grief as vessel, light from darkness, descent/ascent paradox. The final image—sitting among the cranes, "descending while ascending, transforming while remaining"—offers a non-literal answer to how one survives unbearable loss without stating a moral. Avoids platitude. The recurring "luminous torment" phrase and the shadow-as-persistence motif elevate resonance. Minor slip: the basilica metaphor is articulated slightly too explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("Mira understood finally what this meant").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature (the basilica "felt like mockery," steam "mingled with clouds"). Diction is lyric and elevated but internally consistent. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Distance modulates purposefully during the polishing sequences. One register slip: "captures sleepers' visions when hung bedside" reads slightly expository for the emotional register. The phrase "luminous torment" recurs as a tonal anchor but borders on over-reliance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly purposeful. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph two ("paper alone could not contain" / "something more permanent, more crafty, more true" restates without added pressure) and the stacked trio "descending while ascending, transforming while remaining, crafting light" in the final paragraph, which reads template-like. The phrase "dream-recording gems that captured sleepers' visions" contains filter redundancy. Clarity remains high; no causality break. Information density is generally strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of dream-recording gems, origami cranes as grief vessels, and floating-island setting is specific and evocative. However, the emotional arc—solitary grief transformed through craft into communal healing—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The "descends while ascending" metaphor is applied wholesale rather than earned through a hard choice. The daughter's shadow detaching is a striking image but remains abstract; we never see Mira confront a trade-off that hinges on that specificity. Swappability test: the core emotional progression could function with different crafts and metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's decisions to polish gems, fold cranes, and teach others create the story's forward momentum and frame the closure. Present in setup, middle (teaching beat), and ending (thousandth crane, sitting with tea). Her choices drive escalation and the final reconfiguration. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in three beats: initial description as "mockery," the optical "descends while ascending" observation mid-story, and the final sunrise illumination. It supplies the central metaphor and charges the ending image when it catches morning sun and "every crane illuminated." However, it is never handled or used—only observed. The "descends while ascending" quality is told rather than shown constraining a choice. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream recording shapes the core mechanic: Mira polishes gems to capture nightmares and memories, which differentiates her lanterns and drives the craft sequence. It appears in setup (lanterns "embedded with dream-recording gems"), development (three specific dream-polishing beats), and closure (the diamond holding the final dream). The concept enables the transformation of grief into light and changes her tactics (from paper alone to gem-embedded cranes). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is introduced as the basilica's optical property, recurs as Mira's interpretive metaphor ("Grief took you down into darkness even as life insisted you rise"), and echoes in the final paragraph's parallelism. It provides thematic coherence and charges the ending. However, it never constrains an on-page action or forces a tactical trade-off—Mira doesn't choose differently because of the paradox. Lyric function without causal pressure. Two gates (setup metaphor, closure reprise) met; middle development is thematic only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Transform" governs the entire arc: Mira transforms her practice (paragraph two: "she would transform her entire practice"), transforms paper cranes via gem-polishing, and transforms pain "into something that could fly." The action appears in setup, drives the crafting beats, and is explicit in the closure paragraph. It redefines her options (from passive grief to active crafting) and enables the communal teaching turn. The verb is used repeatedly and specifically. High causal pressure and closure participation. Not merely swappable—removal would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced in paragraph three with specific method detail ("Small circles, patient pressure, letting the stone reveal its inner architecture"), executed across three dream-recording beats (moonstone, sapphire, diamond), and supplies the means by which grief becomes vessel. The method matters: the diamond is "the most difficult gem to polish because it showed every imperfection," tying craft difficulty to emotional honesty. Setup, middle (repeated use), and closure all feature the method. It shapes her attempts and differentiates the final crane. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden with chamomile and silver needle plants anchors nearly every scene, houses the workshop and the hanging cranes, and becomes "a gallery of luminous torment" that draws other residents. Present in setup, development (teaching others in the garden), and closure (Mira pours tea and sits among the cranes). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as stage and symbolic container rather than tactical pressure. Strong presence and thematic charge but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the shadow detaches" is established in the opening (daughter's shadow detached, leaving stillness) and frames the entire story as post-loss. It sets the emotional baseline and makes the crafting an act of survival rather than prevention. However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or track a live clock—"Night after night" is vague duration, and no urgency forces a tactical shift. Setup and thematic frame are present; middle and closure participation are weak. Introduced early but functionally static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to fold one thousand origami cranes holding fractions of anguish is stated in paragraph two, drives the entire crafting sequence, and culminates in the thousandth crane with the clear diamond. Mira's realization that "paper alone could not contain" her grief pivots her to gem-embedded cranes, showing friction between initial want and discovered need. The desire is dramatized through repeated action and the cost (her daughter remains gone) is visible in the closure image. Setup, middle escalation (cranes as communal teaching), and closure all tie to this motivation. Strong integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" appears as descriptor in paragraph two and the final paragraph, and the oxymoron governs the story's emotional texture: grief that "made every breath shine with unshed tears while simultaneously crushing her chest." The tone modulates from raw loss (opening infirmary stillness) to purposeful craft (polishing sequences) to communal resilience (teaching others) to bittersweet acceptance (sitting with tea among the lights). Coherent through turns and charges the final image ("crafting light from the luminous torment of love"). The phrase itself is used twice and frames the emotional arc. High tonal control and closure linkage.</comment>
