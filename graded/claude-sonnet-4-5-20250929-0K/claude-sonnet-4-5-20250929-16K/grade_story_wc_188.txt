<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal landscape is handled through her chant and "ambient awareness," but these remain largely label-only mechanisms rather than embodied contradictions. Her motivation to combat hopelessness is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under competing pressures. The commander's transformation feels convenien—glazed emptiness to wet-eyed recognition in one night—without visible internal friction or cost that would make the change credible. Mara's competence is unbalanced by genuine struggle; she executes her plan without meaningful obstacle or self-doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the fortress's sickness is established, Mara interprets the mosaic, executes her fireworks, and the ending offers a cadence shift ("cracked, letting light seep through"). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (blooming fortress, dusk, main gate). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise variant—where the fortress is "cracked" and the commander "stood straighter," but the cost remains mostly conceptual and understated; the felt price of Mara's labor or the fortress's partial transformation lacks sharp on-page legibility. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length, but the cost proof test is borderline: we infer exhaustion and departure, but no sentence crystallizes a visible trade-off or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming fortress and moonflowers anchor locale and mood early; the mosaic functions as both setting detail and mechanism, constraining Mara's interpretation and charging her choice to act. Kerosene rags and the highest tower provide micro-setting that shapes the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (purple walls, white faces, kerosene scent implied), filtered through Mara's itinerant lens without tourist exposition. The final image of moonflowers closing at dawn reinforces cyclical time and partial transformation, charging the closure beat with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and pursued through Mara's mosaic discovery and fireworks display. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a density increase: from ambient awareness to mosaic interpretation to the climactic light show, pressure tightens through purposeful layering. However, no live opposition or meaningful friction complicates her execution; the commander's arrival is passive, and the fortress yields without resistance. The cost at closure is conceptual (partial change, not transformation), meeting the lens's requirements but lacking sharp on-page trade-offs or visible prices that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—manufactured hope versus discovered meaning—emerges organically from Mara's actions and the mosaic's message ("make your own"), avoiding overt statement until the commander's exchange, which borders on articulation but remains grounded in scene pressure. The kerosene knots function as charged motifs that accumulate and reweight prior material (the absent stars, the drooping moonflowers). The ending resists neat resolution ("cracked, letting light seep through" rather than healed), offering a non-literal answer through image. Minor slip: "hope isn't found—it's manufactured" in dialogue edges toward thematic echo, though it's filtered through Mara's voice and the mosaic's discovery rather than pure authorial summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Mara's perceptual signature: chant-as-filter, ambient awareness, the wanderer's lens that separates "what mattered from what merely existed." Diction is controlled and distinct ("blooming fortress," "serious playfulness," "temporary poetry"), with purposeful compression at peaks. The commander's brief dialogue contrasts flatness against Mara's lyric interiority, creating voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance narrows appropriately during the fireworks sequence. Minor artifact: "voice low and rhythmic" and "smile sharp with understanding and mischief" lean toward stock descriptors, but overall texture is character-particular and rhythmically varied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes without padding. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("gravity of hopelessness," "temporary poetry," "ash to ember, ember to sky") is purposeful and integrated. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences: "She smiled, the expression sharp..." could compress to eliminate the appositive filter. "Through ambient awareness" recurs as a label without always showing the sensory particulars of that sixth sense. The climax—fireworks sequence—sustains propulsion and vivid image without loops. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs mar peak beats, keeping the score comfortably above mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wandering fireworks designer frame offers a fresh synthesis of itinerant artist and hope-bringer archetypes, grounded in specific craft (copper filings, sulfur, kerosene knots). The mosaic-as-message and "make your own stars" motif feel earned rather than convenient, rising from the fortress's history. However, the core emotional arc—outsider restores communal hope through spectacle—remains familiar; the transformation lacks a non-obvious moral calculus or surprising cost that would push originality higher. Tropes are executed competently but not radically transformed. The chant and "ambient awareness" risk feeling like quirky ornament rather than integrated necessity, though they do constrain Mara's perceptual method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices (interpreting the mosaic, preparing kerosene knots, launching fireworks) drive all major beats. She is signaled early (opening line), shapes the middle discovery and preparation, and executes the climactic action. Her agency is decisive at closure: the fireworks crack the fortress's hopelessness. However, her decisions face minimal friction or trade-offs; she succeeds without meaningful obstacle or internal conflict, reducing felt cost. Two gates (setup, payoff) are clear; middle development is present but passive. Causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, beat involvement (three: arrival, mosaic, fireworks) +1.4, but swappability and lack of visible cost on her person limit the score: any wandering specialist with transformative craft could fill the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knots are introduced in the tower preparation beat, used extensively in the climax (multiple launches, each described as purposeful design), and their effect—"temporary poetry"—charges the ending by cracking the fortress's state. Setup occurs mid-story (~50% mark), which applies a late-arrival friction (−0.3), but the knots are causally active across two distinct beats (preparation, launch) and shape closure by writing "messages in light" that stir the populace. Specificity is high: "soaking rags in kerosene, binding them into intricate knots the way fire spinners did" makes the object irreplaceable. Beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9, late signal −0.3. The object constrains Mara's method and enables the climactic turn, preventing easy swap.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mosaic note ("When stars refuse to witness, make your own") is discovered at the midpoint, reframes Mara's understanding of the fortress's purpose, and directly motivates her fireworks plan. It appears in one extended beat (courtyard discovery) and is echoed thematically in the climax ("replaced the absent ones"). Setup by ~40%, development (changes Mara's tactics), and payoff (the fireworks enact the note's imperative) all present. Causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.8 (indirect: the stars she makes fulfill the note's command), beat involvement +0.4 (one primary beat, thematic echo at end). However, the note's message is somewhat generic ("make your own hope"), reducing irreplaceability; a similar inscription could substitute. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use, plus mild thematic generality, cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chant ("Ash to ember, ember to sky") appears three times: entering the gate, walking the mosaic perimeter, and departing at dawn. It is described as "an old habit that helped her filter the world's noise from its whispers," but this filtering effect is asserted, not dramatized through a visible trade-off or constraint. The chant does not enable or prevent an action; it colors voice and rhythm but remains largely ornamental. Setup is early, payoff at closure (final paragraph), but middle development is absent—no on-page choice is altered by chanting. Beat involvement +0.4 (frame device, not causal), specificity +0.4 (distinctive phrase), but ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5 (any meditative habit could serve). Label-only trait friction applies: the chant is told to help her "filter," but we never see what she gains or loses by chanting versus not.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Filter" as action appears explicitly once: "she'd cultivated...that sixth sense...to filter the world's noise from its whispers." The concept recurs implicitly when Mara walks the mosaic's perimeter and "the pattern shifted in her perception like a puzzle solving itself," and again when she designs each fireworks burst to "bypass reason and struck directly at the heart." The action shapes her interpretive method and tactical choices across two beats (mosaic discovery, fireworks design). Setup early, development (mosaic), payoff (fireworks effect on populace). However, the filtering mechanism is asserted more than shown; we do not see her sift competing signals or make a choice contingent on what she filters out. Beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.5 (the fireworks enact filtered art), but summary-only use −0.5 and swappability −0.4 (observation or intuition could replace "filter" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is named twice: Mara "felt the fortress's sickness" and later "felt the fortress stirring below" during the fireworks. The method is signaled early (~25%), but its mechanics remain vague—no sensory particulars, no trade-off for using this sense, no moment where it enables an action that mundane observation could not. It shapes her diagnosis (the fortress is hopeless, not plagued) and confirms her success (people emerging), but both beats could proceed via visual observation or overheard conversation. Setup present, middle and payoff present but shallow. Beat involvement +0.4 (two touches, same mechanism), ornamental use −0.6, swappability −0.6 (label-only sixth sense). The method does not constrain a choice or cost Mara anything; it functions as narrative convenience rather than irreplaceable technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk is established in the opening line and recurs throughout: moonflowers opening/drooping, the central courtyard mosaic, the highest tower for launch, and moonflowers closing at dawn in the final image. The setting pressures Mara's choices—she must interpret the mosaic to understand the sickness, climb to the tower for visibility, and time her display to the starless night. Setup immediate, development (mosaic/courtyard, tower climb), payoff (dawn/moonflowers closing reweights the transformation as partial and cyclical). Causal pressure +1.0 (the fortress's layout and mood drive her tactics), closure linkage +1.0 (final image), beat involvement +1.4 (four touches: arrival, gate, courtyard, tower, dawn), specificity +0.6 (moonflowers and mosaic are distinctive). The fortress is irreplaceable; another setting would require structural change.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe—"during the hush of a night with no stars"—is signaled at the climax and frames the fireworks display. The starless night is the condition Mara addresses (absent stars → she makes her own), creating thematic and tactical pressure. However, the timeframe is not established early; dusk is mentioned at opening, but "night with no stars" appears only when Mara climbs the tower (~70%). By dawn, the display is complete and moonflowers close, bracketing the action. Setup late (−0.4), development present (the starless void is the canvas and problem), payoff strong (dawn marks closure and partial success). Causal pressure +0.8 (no stars forces her to create replacements), closure linkage +0.9 (dawn as before/after marker), beat involvement +0.4 (one extended beat). The timeframe is thematically charged but could be generalized to "night" without breaking the plot, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated explicitly in Mara's interiority ("This was why she wandered—to defy the gravity of hopelessness") and drives her choice to perform the fireworks. She identifies the fortress's sickness as hopelessness early, interprets the mosaic as a call to action, and executes the display to crack that state. Setup by ~30%, development (mosaic discovery and preparation), payoff (fireworks and partial transformation). However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through competing wants or visible friction. Mara does not wrestle with doubt, cost, or an alternative path; her desire is singular and unchallenged. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, beat involvement +0.9 (three beats driven by this motive), but label-only interiority −0.5 and lack of conflicted choice −0.4 limit the score. The motivation shapes all action but lacks the felt cost or internal contradiction that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is embodied throughout: Mara's "sharp" smile "with understanding and mischief," her fireworks described as "a dance of serious playfulness, each gesture precise yet joyful," and the closing chant/departure that balances gravity with forward motion. The tone modulates appropriately—grounded observation at arrival, lyric intensity during the fireworks, quiet closure at dawn—without static uniformity. It is signaled early (Mara's manner and voice) and charges the final image (the fortress blooms as she wanders on, maintaining her itinerant lightness against heavy work). Setup immediate, development (mosaic interpretation, fireworks design), payoff (the ending balances cost and hope without tidy resolution). Coherence across turns +1.0, closure charge +0.9, specificity +0.5 (the oxymoron is apt and sustained). The tone is purposeful and integrated, meeting high-band thresholds.</comment>
