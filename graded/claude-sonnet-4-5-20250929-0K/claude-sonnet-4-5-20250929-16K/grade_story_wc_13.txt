<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is concrete and sustained—she tracks temporal disruptions methodically through observation and finally acts on the cages. The pendant provides a physical constraint that embodies the time-sculpting stakes. Interior specificity is strong ("borrowed time she'd collected hummed in the air like trapped insects"), though the protagonist remains somewhat reactive until the cage-opening sequence. The final renunciation (releasing borrowed time as payment) earns closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered sensory detail, temporal motifs, and the cage discovery that reweights the echo concept. Orientation anchors early (gondola, rooftop canal, giant's nap timeframe). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"echoes weren't born from surfaces or distance…but from completion"—with felt cost (the pendant cools, borrowed time flows out). One meaningful deepening when she reaches the cages and reweights her investigation into action. The "interrupted cadence" concept charges the final image cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals and the Throat's suspended cages create vivid spatial pressure. The pendant functions as micro-setting, warming and cooling to signal time malleability and constraining her choices (aging the lock, releasing borrowed time). Sensory hierarchy is selective: "water barely rippling," "suspended quiet," cages "swaying without wind." The canal system supplies resources (proximity, momentum) that enable the climax. The body-as-setting threshold is met when the pendant's temperature shift signals tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—documenting the origin of echoes—is signaled early and tightens when she finds the cages. One clear reversal: the lock is temporal, not mechanical, forcing her to use the pendant and accept a trade (borrowed time for freed sounds). Agency is decision with visible cost: releasing her stockpile forecloses future time-sculpting. The giant's nap imposes a countdown, though its pressure remains background. Escalation is accumulative rather than multi-turn, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: echoes as "completion," sounds "learning they weren't alone," the pendant as physical cost of time theft. The cage-opening moment dramatizes the concept without stating a moral. Final image—"The echo of her oar striking water returned to her before she'd finished the stroke"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior observations. Subtext operates in the bargain she's made and the "fair exchange" of seconds for songs. The infinity symbol pendant risks symbolic convenience but earns its place by constraining action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with concrete perceptual signature: Mira notices "interrupted cadence," temperature shifts in the pendant, sounds "aged and weather-worn." Diction is purposeful and voice-specific ("storm beetles, crystalline moss, spiral-finned fish"). Psychic distance tightens cleanly during the cage sequence. No dialogue; interiority carries the load without filter-verb stacks. Elision is minimal and purposeful (the "bargain she'd made" is primed without over-explaining). The prose rhythm modulates with urgency—short clauses when she releases sounds, longer syntactic arcs during observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances discovery or adds sensory texture. Sentence openings vary cleanly. Minor issues: "suspended quiet" and "suspended between the towers" echo within two paragraphs; "borrowed time she'd collected hummed" employs a stock metaphor that doesn't quite land with specificity. Figurative language (time "thick as honey, thin as wire") is vivid but clusters in one beat without full payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Propulsion is strong through the cage sequence, though the opening two paragraphs lean slightly expository before momentum kicks in.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—echoes born from temporal completion rather than acoustic reflection—offers a fresh conceptual angle. Time-sculpting via borrowed seconds is specific and constrains choices with cost. The giant's nap as enabling condition is imaginative but remains under-exploited (functions mostly as countdown furniture). The cage sequence transforms the echo concept through concrete action. Risk-taking is present in the abstract temporal mechanics, though the emotional arc (lone investigator achieves discovery) follows a familiar template. Transformation test: plot and arc feel specific to this world's logic and Mira's illustrator lens.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Natural history illustrator is present by paragraph one, frames her observational approach, and drives the documentation motive. She makes the key turn—uncaging the sounds—based on her months of tracing patterns. The occupation shapes tactics (precise sketches, careful notes) and charges the final image (she's documented the origin). Present across setup, middle choice, and ending. Causal pressure is moderate; the role enables but doesn't deeply constrain. Swappability: another investigator type could function with minor edits, but the illustrator lens adds textural specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Infinity symbol pendant appears early, is handled in at least three beats (cold weight, warming during time manipulation, cooling after release), and enables the climactic lock-aging action. It embodies the time-sculpting cost visibly. Present in setup, middle use (aging the lock), and payoff (cools after releasing borrowed time). Strong causal role and closure linkage. The infinity symbol risks symbolic convenience, preventing a higher score. Irreplaceability is moderate—another artifact could serve, though the pendant's temperature shifts provide good embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is introduced early ("echoes arrived in interrupted cadence, breaking apart"), shapes her investigation tactics (mapping disruptions), and is resolved in the climax ("freed sounds danced in interrupted cadence, each one teaching others"). The concept constrains her goal and charges the final image when her oar's echo "returned to her before she'd finished the stroke." Present across all three gates with strong thematic and causal work. High irreplaceability—removing "interrupted cadence" would break the story's logic and closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Time-sculpting is signaled early ("Time-sculpting was forbidden"), demonstrated in action (creating an accelerated bubble, aging the lock), and carries cost (borrowed seconds, the pendant's temperature). It enables key beats and constrains the climax (she must pay back borrowed time). Present in setup, middle action, and payoff. Causal pressure is strong. One friction: the trait could be replaced with another magic system without fundamentally altering the emotional arc. Specificity (borrowing from eggs, sunset, heartbeats) adds texture and lifts integration above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Uncaging is the story's central action and climactic turn. She uncages the first sound at the peak beat, then "moved faster, uncaging sound after sound." The action resolves the mystery (echoes born from completion), pays off the time-sculpting setup, and charges the final image. Major turns trace directly to this action. Present in closure with decisive causal weight. High irreplaceability—removing uncaging breaks the plot and thematic resolution. Cost is visible (borrowed time flows out). All three gates are met with strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Borrowing time is signaled early (paragraph five: "borrowed time she'd collected," "taken seconds from hatching eggs"), demonstrated mid-story (creating the time-bubble), and paid off at closure (releasing borrowed time as "fair exchange"). The method shapes her tactics (careful theft, noted debts) and provides the cost mechanism. Present across all three gates with strong causal and thematic integration. Swappability: another resource-gathering magic could serve, but the specific "borrowing" fits the time-sculpting attribute and interruption theme well. Two or more beats plus closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system is established early, provides spatial choreography (gondola through the Throat, towers leaning together), and supplies resources (momentum, proximity to cages). The Throat narrows to create the discovery site. Present in setup, middle navigation, and the climax location. The canal constrains tactics (she must travel during the nap window) and enables the ending. Causal pressure is moderate—setting supplies the stage but doesn't deeply alter choices. Solid integration across beats and closure, though the canals could be replaced with another transit system without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The giant's nap timeframe is introduced early ("would last perhaps six more"), creates urgency ("The giant would wake soon"), and bounds the action window. It tightens decisions (she must act now) and explains the canal's existence. Present in setup, noted at closure, though middle development is light. One friction: the clock is mostly atmospheric; no on-page moment shows her racing against expiration or adjusting tactics due to dwindling time. Causal pressure is moderate. Two gates (setup, closure mention) plus atmospheric constraint justify mid-6s; stronger tactical impact would lift higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Finding the origin of echoes is stated early ("never this. Never the origin of echoes themselves"), drives her months-long investigation, and is resolved at the climax ("This was it"). The motive is dramatized through her actions (tracing disruptions, mapping patterns, traveling to the Throat) and conflicted via cost (she must release her borrowed time). Present across all three gates with strong causal work. The final realization—"echoes…born from completion"—directly answers her quest. Irreplaceability is high; removing this motive breaks the story's spine. Visible cost and closure linkage push into high 8s.</comment>
