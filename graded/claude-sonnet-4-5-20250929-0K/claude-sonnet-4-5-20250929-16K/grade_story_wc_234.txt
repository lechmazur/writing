<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—the six pocket-suns—rather than mere reflection, and her choice to stay is earned by Kael's revelation and her own journey. Internal contradiction appears in her conflict between commercial success and original purpose, embodied in the difference between her capital work and the new spheres. The "scientifically romantic" attribute and some emotional passages ("the weight of being truly here") edge toward label-speak but remain anchored in her alchemical practice. Kael's blindness and the three-year separation provide genuine pressure, though his passivity as secondary character is appropriate at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly through Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's decision to stay and collaborate forecloses her capital career with visible cost (abandoning profitable work) and reconfigures the relationship from separation to shared purpose. The causal lens holds: her return was motivated by the columella curl's meaning, Kael's revelation changes stakes, and her gift of the pocket-suns demonstrates earned capability. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the secret is whispered, shifting from reunion to urgent collaboration with the six-month clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as more than backdrop: the converging embers and brazier establish the meeting place's significance, and twilight's progression mirrors the emotional arc. The pocket-suns as micro-setting objects constrain Mira's demonstration and charge the final image when held "between their joined hands." Sensory detail is purposeful—"dying light," "drifting sparks," "ember-glow"—and filtered through alchemical perception. The nautilus shell's physical presence (silver chain, spiral catching light, warm between palms) grounds the abstraction and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving what matters before Kael loses his sight—is signaled clearly when he reveals his condition at midpoint, creating urgent pressure. Mira's agency drives escalation: her decision to create memorial pocket-suns (not just commercial ones) and commit to staying represents a meaningful tightening with visible cost (foregoing capital success, reputation, financial security). The six-month timeline creates concrete constraint. Kael's revelation functions as an effective reversal that narrows Mira's options and forces her to choose between paths, with the resolution earned through her specific alchemical capability demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete contrast between commercial pocket-suns (cold, efficient, profitable) and memorial ones (warm, feeling-charged, gifted), avoiding direct statement until the final beat's "scientifically romantic" synthesis. The columella curl functions as a recurring image that shifts from departure-gift to shared tool, charging the closure. However, phrases like "capture the density of presence itself" and "weight of being truly here" tilt toward abstract philosophizing rather than arising purely from dramatized particulars. The rose-white sphere "holds the courage to begin again after failing" edges close to symbolic convenience, though it's anchored in her prior commercial work's sterility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third through Mira, with perceptual signature filtered through alchemical vocabulary ("pocket-sun," "columella curl," "scientifically romantic"). Dialogue carries subtext—Kael's "You came back" / "Differently" exchange conveys three years of separation economically. The prose modulates appropriately: compressed during reunion, expanding for the revelation, tightening again for the gift. Minor register drift appears in passages like "revalue everything" and "directed spontaneity" (the latter feeling prompt-adjacent), and "A palette of resolve" reads slightly elevated for spoken narration, but the overall voice remains character-particular and controlled under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. However, scaffold patterns appear: "This was" opens two paragraphs in close succession, and "the weight of" recurs three times ("weight of moments," "weight of being," implied in "density"). Some figurative language clusters without full payoff: "swirled...like lazy stars," "settled...like falling ash," and the extended "spiral inward and outward" metaphor in the final paragraphs. The phrase "directed spontaneity" in the penultimate paragraph feels like a conceptual label rather than embodied action. Propulsion remains strong through most beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemy-as-memory-preservation premise offers a fresh angle on "preserving sight before blindness" material, and the specific detail of pocket-suns with emotional hues (amber of laughter, gold of silence) provides texture. The "scientifically romantic" synthesis and columella curl as mathematical-beauty bridge show thematic coherence. However, the core emotional arc—returning home to help a dying/failing loved one—follows a familiar template, and the mutual-redemption resolution (she finds purpose, he gets preserved sight) feels relatively safe. The transformation test is borderline: the emotional beats would largely survive generic substitution of "alchemist" → "artist" and "pocket-suns" → "paintings." Freshness resides more in world-detail than in the human stakes or their resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create key turns: deciding to craft the memorial spheres during her journey (setup), presenting them at the nexus (middle beat), and committing to stay and document Kael's remaining sight (closure). Her agency drives all three gates, and her alchemical skill is demonstrated rather than declared. The pocket-sun creation represents irreplaceable specificity tied to her character, and the cost (abandoning capital work) is visible. Early signal is strong, beat involvement spans the arc, and closure linkage is direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nautilus shell appears in the opening image (catching light, spiral described), returns when Mira traces its spiral mid-story while processing Kael's revelation, and is pressed back into her palm at closure. It accumulates meaning from gift → reminder of their shared philosophy → collaborative tool. However, its causal pressure is limited—it prompts reflection rather than altering tactics—and the closure moment where Kael returns it feels lyric-resonant but not functionally indispensable. Strong early seed and purposeful reprise lift it into mid-band, but swappability (another keepsake could serve similar symbolic work) and lack of visible cost cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A palette of resolve" appears explicitly when Mira presents the six spheres, each encoded with a different determination (amber resolution, gold commitment, rose-white courage). The concept shapes the middle beat—her specific alchemical solution to the problem—and frames the thematic question about what resolve means when commercialized versus gifted. Setup occurs implicitly through her capital work (one kind of resolve), payoff is direct in the sphere-gift scene. However, the phrase itself arrives late (~60% mark), the concept could be described as "emotional preservation" with minor edit, and it functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint. Mid-band for clear presence and thematic integration, but insufficient causal necessity for higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is introduced as Kael's past phrase, recurs in Mira's reflection on her capital work's sterility versus wonder, and brackets the closure beat ("precise in method, wild in heart"). It shapes her motivation—the tension between formula and feeling—and the final synthesis represents thematic payoff. However, it functions primarily as characterization label and thematic frame rather than constraining on-page choices with visible cost. The attribute is demonstrated through her two types of pocket-suns (commercial vs. memorial) but doesn't create a tactical tradeoff in the scene itself. Functional presence with thematic coherence, but replaceable phrasing and no direct cost keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Revalue" appears explicitly at the turning point: "This was her chance to revalue everything—not the suns she could sell...but the ones she could gift." The action defines the major turn from commercial success to memorial preservation, and her creation of the six spheres enacts it. Setup is implicit in the backstory of capital work, development occurs when she pulls the spheres from her satchel, payoff is the commitment to stay. However, the action could be described as "reprioritize" or "rechoose" with minor conceptual shift, limiting irreplaceability. Strong causal linkage and beat involvement, but moderate swappability cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Returning differently" is signaled in Mira's reply to Kael's greeting (early, ~15% mark), shapes the entire premise—she left to commercialize her work and returns with new understanding—and is restated at closure: "I'm returning, which isn't the same as never leaving." The method (transformation through departure and return) enables the plot and constrains her stance: she can't simply resume where they left off. It's demonstrated through the contrast between capital-era pocket-suns and the new memorial spheres. Strong setup, clear development through backstory integration, and direct closure participation. Causal pressure is moderate—it's more existential frame than tactical constraint—but thematic irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ember nexus is anchored early (where five ash-roads meet, central brazier, converging embers) and establishes the reunion location with atmospheric specificity. It provides mild pressure through its symbolic history ("their place") and the twilight-to-darkness progression mirrors emotional stakes. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—the conversation and gift could occur elsewhere with minor adjustment—and functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical resource. Sensory detail (drifting sparks, ember-glow) enriches atmosphere but doesn't alter the outcome. Early setup, atmospheric coherence, and closure presence earn mid-band, but limited causal necessity caps higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "moment a secret is whispered" arrives at ~40% when Kael reveals his impending blindness, creating the story's central pressure and time constraint (six months). This beat redefines stakes from reunion to urgent preservation work and drives Mira's tactical choices (creating memorial pocket-suns, committing to stay and document). Setup is implicit in their reunion, the whisper itself is the development beat, and closure directly responds to the revealed timeline. The timeframe tightens decisions with visible cost (her capital career must be abandoned now, not later). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; late arrival and single-beat concentration prevent top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to capture the density of presence" crystallizes explicitly at the revelation beat and drives her creation of the memorial pocket-suns versus commercial ones. The motivation is dramatized through action—crafting spheres during her journey, presenting them to Kael—and creates visible friction (abandoning profitable work, committing to stay). Setup occurs through her dissatisfaction with capital work's sterility, development is the six-sphere demonstration, payoff is the collaborative commitment. The phrasing trends abstract ("density of presence," "weight of moments") but is anchored in her alchemical practice. Strong beat involvement, clear cost, and closure linkage; moderate register abstraction prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" appears as explicit label late (final page: "with directed spontaneity, neither fully planned nor random") describing her sphere-gift gesture, and is restated in the final synthesis ("precise in method, wild in heart"). The tone of calibrated improvisation is demonstrated through her journey-crafted spheres and the reunion's mix of preparation and emotional responsiveness. However, the phrase itself is late, functions more as thematic summary than moment-by-moment tonal control, and could be replaced with "intentional openness" without structural loss. It modulates the closure image effectively but doesn't shape earlier beats. Payoff-heavy with late signal caps the score despite thematic coherence.</comment>
