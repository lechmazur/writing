<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Matthias's interiority is densely textured with contradictory impulses—revolutionary fervor cooled to scholarly obsession, the tension between wanting validation and protecting the vanished architects. His motivation to reimagine the civilization is embodied through concrete choices (covering mirrors, writing in verse, holding the shard during storms). However, the emotional progression feels somewhat abstract at peak moments; phrases like "burnished sorrow" and "frozen tear" label affect rather than ground it in bodily specifics. The final mirror moment attempts synthesis but edges toward symbolic convenience rather than earned contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (Matthias, baroque asteroid, post-revolution scholar). The piece accumulates pressure through layered realizations—mirrors trap storms, the builders were non-human, they too covered mirrors—culminating in the mirror-touch moment that reweights his scholarly struggle as cross-species grief. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes his stance with conceptual cost (academic isolation, ongoing dispute) made undeniable. One causality slip: the shard "remembers" light is asserted poetically but never constrained by mechanics, leaving the storm-vision mechanism vague when it should tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Matthias must cover mirrors before storms, the gilt corridors house stone panels left by prior inhabitants, and the crystal shard refracts differently during temporal auroras. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (luminescence refracted into "prismatic ghosts," copper-and-gold time streams). The mirrors-as-hazard and the stone panels both charge the closure by proving the aliens knew the danger first. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves; the setting evolution (covered/uncovered mirrors, storm arrival) tracks causally and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove the non-human origin of the baroque asteroid against academic dismissal. Pressure accumulates through the storm sequence—Matthias checks coverings, sees the alien builders again, realizes they also covered mirrors—deepening from professional dispute to existential witness. The final mirror-touch crystallizes his isolation and commitment with felt cost (ongoing bitter dispute, solitary elegies). One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm validates his poetic methods by revealing the builders' identical precautions. Agency is present but muted; Matthias observes and records more than he decides, and no on-page choice visibly forecloses an alternative path during the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—species as transient makers of beauty, grief as shared currency—emerges organically from the mirror-covered halls, the shard's remembered light, and the verse-form observations. The closure image (two species touching the same broken thing across time) reweights the academic dispute as a broader meditation on recognition and erasure without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the velvet/stone panel parallel and the phrase "burnished sorrow," which shifts from décor description to thematic anchor. The final couplet risks overt thematic statement ("cathedrals / from our sorrow") but earns it through prior scene work and the mirror-touch beat, avoiding the explain-everything trap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person close with stable psychic distance and a lyric register that suits a poet-scholar. Perceptual signature is consistent: Matthias notices geometric grace, arabesque hymns, and light's memory rather than raw data. Diction remains elevated but voice-motivated ("baroque artistry merely a waystation") with no unmotivated register shifts. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("he realized," "he saw") anchor clarity without dulling immediacy. One slip: "perhaps they were right to call him poetically inclined" reads as narrator intrusion rather than Matthias's own rueful thought, briefly loosening focalization mid-paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. Two friction points: the opening metaphor "frozen tear" and later "burnished sorrow" edge toward stock elevated diction without fresh embodiment. Line "They had not been human at all" functions as a beat reveal but the short declarative after dense description feels artificially weighted for effect. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion remains steady through reflection-heavy passages. Minor overwriting in figurative density ("temporal storms," "visible river of moments," "copper and gold streams") clusters without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of temporal-storm mechanics, archaeological method-as-verse, and cross-species mirroring is specific and non-obvious. The mirror-covering parallel (velvet/stone) transforms a safety protocol into thematic hinge, which feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric interiority heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One derivative element: the lone scholar in ornate ruins disputing establishment academics is a familiar frame; the story transforms it through the temporal-vision mechanics and the non-human twist, but the revolutionary-turned-recluse arc remains recognizable. Transformation test passes: swapping names or world details would lose the time-visibility conceit and the baroque aesthetic's thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Matthias as defunct revolutionary frames the opening and his exhaustion/wisdom trade-off, shaping his isolation and poetic methods as residue of the Chronist Uprising. His choice to keep asking and write elegies at closure ties to his former fervor. Present across beats (revolution backstory, current dispute, ending stance) and signals motivation, but on-page decisions lean observational; he checks mirrors and records rather than making a choice that narrows tactical options. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is contemplative rather than choice-driving. Specificity strong (Chronist Uprising, tenure disputes); cost visible (isolation, ongoing dispute). Swappability moderate—"disillusioned scholar" would fit with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystal vase shard appears in at least three beats: held in his palm with lead-crystal mention, used during temporal storms to see builders, placed against mirror at closure. Each use deepens meaning—from evidence of Terran origin (Keraine's claim) to "remembered light" to the final touch-across-time image. Early signal (second paragraph); constrains method (he holds it during storms); charges closure (mirror-touch). Cost connection: the shard's non-Terran properties fuel the academic dispute. Irreplaceability high; the "remembered light" property is specific. Missing one stronger middle beat where the shard enables or forecloses a tactical choice under pressure; current use leans observational.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute (Keraine's Terran-colonist theory vs. Matthias's non-human evidence) is the dominant external stake, signaled early and present at closure ("The dispute would continue, bitter and academic"). It shapes his methods (verse vs. data logs) and his isolation. Two beats: initial framing and ending acknowledgment. However, the dispute itself never tightens on the page—no new evidence contest, no confrontation, no tactical adaptation. It functions more as premise and thematic backdrop than active pressure that narrows options. Cost visible (professional isolation) but the dispute doesn't escalate or force a mid-story choice. Swappability moderate; "academic vs. establishment" is a familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" constrains Matthias's methods: he writes observations in verse, finds rhythm captures temporal nuances better than data logs, and composes elegies. Early signal (paragraph four); present at closure (verse couplet). The trait enables his unique archaeological approach and charges his outsider status ("the academic establishment dismissed as poetry"). One visible cost: his methods are dismissed, fueling isolation. Middle development: the trait shapes how he records storm visions. Irreplaceability moderate—"intuitive" or "artistic" could substitute with minor edits, but the verse-form specificity anchors it. No moment where being poetic forecloses a more pragmatic option under immediate pressure; the cost is chronic rather than acute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Devise new methods of temporal archaeology" is told as backstory accomplishment (five years learning) rather than dramatized on the page. It frames his current techniques (holding the shard during storms, writing in verse) but the action of devising occurred off-page. Setup present; payoff indirect (his methods yield the storm visions that charge closure). No middle beat where he actively devises or adapts a method under pressure in this story's window. Swappability high—"developed" or "invented" fit equally. The methods themselves (shard-holding, verse-writing) are on-page and integral, but the action "devise" is summary. Cost visible (academic dismissal) but tied to the methods, not the act of devising within this narrative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is method, constraint, and thematic hinge. Early signal (paragraph one: "learned to cover them"); mechanics matter (mirrors trap temporal feedback loops that shatter minds). Middle beat: Matthias checks coverings during the storm, ensuring safety. Closure participation: the discovery that aliens also covered mirrors (stone panels) reweights his precaution as shared knowledge across species, charging the final mirror-touch image. The method enables his storm observations (he can watch through windows while mirrors stay safe) and the parallel (velvet/stone) drives thematic payoff. Cost implicit (tedious ritual, constant vigilance). Irreplaceability high; removing it breaks safety logic and thematic parallel. Three gates met; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid supplies the frescoed chambers, gilt corridors, and ornate mirrors that ground the action and thematic aesthetic. Early signal (opening line). The setting constrains choices: Matthias must navigate mirror-lined passages, cover them before storms, and interpret the stone panels and arabesques left by builders. Closure linkage: the asteroid's baroque artistry as "merely a waystation" reweights human colonization narratives. The mirrors and carved stone panels are micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography clear; the emptiness and silence amplify his isolation. Irreplaceability moderate—"abandoned space station" could substitute but would lose the aesthetic specificity that ties to theme (beauty, transience, artistry).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "after time becomes visible" (two decades post-event) frames the temporal storms as new phenomenon and grounds Matthias's methods. Early signal (paragraph one: "when time became visible two decades ago"). The visible-time mechanic enables storm sequences where Matthias sees the alien builders and shapes his archaeological approach (watching history/futurity spiral). Closure connection: the ability to see time makes his cross-species witness possible. However, the timeframe itself doesn't tighten decisions—no approaching deadline, no clock pressure. The storms arrive and pass on their own schedule without forcing tactical adaptation. Cost indirect (the revolution and its aftermath occurred in this era). Specificity high (two decades, visible auroras of past/future); irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated explicitly (paragraph five) and drives Matthias's ongoing work: holding the shard during storms, writing verse observations, composing elegies. It opposes Keraine's erasure narrative and fuels the academic dispute. Present at closure: "he would use it to ensure these vanished architects were not forgotten." Friction between want (recognition, proof) and cost (isolation, dismissal, "bitter and academic" dispute) is visible. Middle beat: his storm observations serve this goal. However, the motivation is more chronic drive than acute choice under pressure—no moment where reimagining forces him to sacrifice an alternative path in this story's window. Two gates met; specificity moderate (could be "honor" or "preserve" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone "burnished sorrow" is established early ("frozen tear," velvet-draped mirrors, "elegies") and sustained through reflection on lost revolutionaries, vanished architects, and Matthias's isolation. Modulates appropriately: quiet in the mirror-covering routine, elevated during storm visions, resonant at closure ("two species reaching across time to touch the same beautiful, broken thing"). The final couplet ("cathedrals / from our sorrow") charges the tone without breaking it. Coherence strong; no tonal whiplash. The tone constrains narrative choices—Matthias's methods are contemplative rather than combative, his stance witness rather than conqueror. Charges the final image by making grief the bridge across species. Specificity high; irreplaceability moderate ("melancholy" could substitute but lacks the metallic, aesthetic connotation of "burnished").</comment>
