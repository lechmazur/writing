<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices across beats—translating developer proposals by day while encoding resistance messages at night. The foundation stone chip functions well as an embodied tether to motivation, shifting from anchor to seed. Interiority remains concrete through most beats ("Her hand trembled, sending a streak of yellow across the wrong star"), though the closing paragraph edges toward summary rather than lived contradiction. Marcus lacks sufficient on-page presence to fully test relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the graffiti system → Marcus's warning → yellow streak error → cooperative insight → proposal → vote forms a clear because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure lands as Decisive Change (shift from resistance to cooperative negotiation) with visible cost (compromise replaces pure preservation). The final image—"hopeful desperation transformed into desperate hope"—is stated rather than shown through concrete action, slightly weakening the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The raft city's rotting platforms and fraying cables constrain Mira's tactical choices (resist vs. negotiate), and the carnival's chaos provides cover for her graffiti work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("paint-splattered overalls," "drunk on sugar and spectacle"), filtered through Mira's mediator perspective. The setting participates in closure (graffiti murals glowing at sunset), but spatial choreography across platforms remains somewhat abstract—we don't track distances or adjacencies that would further tighten tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve carnival culture vs. inevitable privatization) signals early and tightens through one meaningful turn: the yellow-streak mistake forces Mira to pivot from resistance organizing to cooperative proposal. The cooperative model represents genuine agency with visible cost—neither pure preservation nor erasure. Marcus's warning and the three-month timeline create pressure, though the council vote outcome remains off-page. The escalation from encoded resistance → near-disaster → synthesized solution narrows options under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (transformation vs. erasure, collective agency under displacement) emerges through the graffiti shift from resistance coordinates to cooperative blueprints and the foundation chip's reweighting from anchor to seed. The closing line "hopeful desperation transformed into desperate hope" makes theme too explicit, reducing resonance. Mira's dual role as translator/resister dramatizes the question without resolving into false equivalence—gentrification remains harmful, but collective ownership offers a non-illusory path. The cooperative model avoids both sentimental rescue and cynical capitulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (reading tensions, encoding messages) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Mira and Marcus carries subtext and advances plot without exposition ("They know someone's organizing resistance" / "I can slow them down"). The prose modulates well under pressure—the yellow-streak error moment tightens syntax effectively. Marcus's register occasionally converges with Mira's educated mediator voice, slightly reducing character distinction, but his "lose some paperwork" pragmatism holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines advance character, conflict, or world. Two minor filter-verb clusters in reflective beats ("wanted to hate him," "felt something she'd almost forgotten") slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality. The phrase "orderly intuitive thinking" reads as convenient label rather than dramatized trait. The closing metaphor "anchor to the past, but a seed for future growth" is effective but borders on overstatement given prior restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gentrification-resistance frame is familiar, but the graffiti-as-secret-language and cooperative-equity pivot offer specific angles. The carnival setting provides fresh texture, though "culture shock absorber" as job title feels slightly manufactured. Mira's dual role avoids pure victim or hero templates. The cooperative solution feels earned rather than convenient, growing from her translator skill set. The foundation chip and graffiti system integrate well, but the emotional arc (dual allegiance → unified proposal) follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious inflection that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as culture shock absorber shapes her skill set (reading tensions, translating proposals) and drives the cooperative insight—her mediator training enables the synthesis. Present across all beats and essential to closure; removing this occupation would break her tactical agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip appears in three beats: clutched as reminder (early), "stayed in her pocket" (middle pivot), and "weight changed" (near-end). The final reweighting (anchor → seed) charges the shift from resistance to cooperation, but the chip itself remains passive—Mira never uses or handles it in a way that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (translator by day, resistance organizer by night) defines the central conflict and drives every major choice. The yellow-streak mistake and cooperative proposal both stem from this split. Mira's climactic synthesis unifies the dual roles into one stance. Removing this concept would erase the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive thinking" appears as early label ("reading unspoken tensions, predicting conflicts") and recurs at the cooperative insight moment ("the idea crystallizing with orderly intuitive clarity"). The trait enables the solution but functions more as convenient summary than as a dramatized constraint with visible cost—we don't see a moment where this mode of thought fails or forces a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reorganize" anchors three beats: the graffiti message instructing cells to reorganize/split, Mira's cooperative-ownership proposal ("reorganize the ownership structure"), and the closing line ("We reorganize together, or we sink separately"). The term shifts from tactical resistance to structural transformation, and the cooperative model depends on this action. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Graffiti encoding system is signaled early (dawn spirals with encoded messages), mechanics explained (wave curves, star points, colors), demonstrated through Mira's painting and the yellow-streak error, and recurs at closure ("graffiti murals glowed in the sunset"). The method shapes resistance coordination and provides the mistake that forces the pivot. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city's physical decay (rotting platforms, fraying cables) creates the material pressure driving the conflict—without investment, it sinks in five years. The carnival's chaos provides tactical cover for graffiti work. Setting participates in closure (murals at sunset, vote in pavilion). Spatial details could be sharper, but the setting meaningfully constrains options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Before privatization" frames urgency throughout: demolition already underway (eastern quarter gone), three weeks until council vote, developers "accelerating the timeline." The timeframe tightens Mira's choices and drives the pivot to cooperative proposal. The three-month jump to the vote slightly loosens the clock's grip on tactics, but the deadline shapes the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification (preserve vs. displace) is the dominant stake, dramatized through Mira's translator role, graffiti resistance, and synthesis of cooperative ownership. The motivation creates friction between preservation desire and survival pragmatism ("Without investment, Flotilla would sink within five years"). Visible cost at closure (compromise replaces purity).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is consistent across beats—dual allegiance tearing her apart, yellow-streak panic, Marcus's truth ("you need to understand—privatization is coming"), and the closing inversion ("hopeful desperation transformed into desperate hope"). The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image, though the closing line makes the shift too explicit.</comment>
