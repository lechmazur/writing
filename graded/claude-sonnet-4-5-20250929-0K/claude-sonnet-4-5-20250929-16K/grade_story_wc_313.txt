<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal life is present through her grandfather backstory and seventeen-year tenure, and her choice to document rather than restrict shows agency with cost (supervisor calls her insubordinate). However, her transformation feels under-dramatized: the pivot from dutiful warden to archivist-activist happens in a single paragraph of reflection without visible struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "precisely humane" attribute appears only as a label twice, never constraining an on-page choice with visible tradeoff. Embodied emotion is thin; we're told she "understood" and "thought about" rather than shown sensory degradation or contradictory physical pulls under the decision pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (Mara, ridgeway, post-drought). The closure—Mara's memorial proposal leading to descendants visiting—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (threats to expunge her proposal, insubordination label). Drive lens reads Causal: her choice to document and disseminate triggers the supervisor conflict and community response. One meaningful tightening occurs when the supervisor demands restricted access and Mara counters with the memorial proposal. The cost is present but mild; the "within a week" resolution compresses what could be higher-stakes resistance into summary, and the final image of restoration dilutes the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway, exposed lakebed, and Dutoit's storefront are vividly rendered with selective detail (mudbank, skeletal structures, sapphire-hued label behind cracked glass). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional lens (water levels, seep points) and the emerging ruins constrain her path down Main Street. The wind chime bookends the piece, charging the final image when it "began ringing again... with something like restoration," a purposeful return that reweights the mirrored hush. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to restrict or memorialize the drowned town—is signaled by midpoint and tightens when the supervisor demands expungement. Mara's agency drives the key turn: her choice to propose a memorial and send copies to external groups forecloses the path of compliance with visible cost (insubordination threat). However, the resolution summarizes the community response in a single paragraph rather than dramatizing a confrontation or second reversal, and the cost remains abstract (threats) rather than a lived consequence on the page. The final image of people arriving and weeping provides emotional closure but lacks a tactical price that alters Mara's situation beyond reputation risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: water as erasure versus restoration, bureaucratic expungement versus living memory. The wind chime and sapphire label recur with shifted meaning, and the final image—"watching over water meant watching over everything it touched, everything it took, everything it might return"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The piece resists binary resolution; Mara's vigilance now encompasses historical witness, not just levee safety. Minor slip: "spin stories into shared meaning" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo, nearly articulating the thesis, though it's cushioned by the concrete action of collecting photographs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Mara's professional and personal lens (levee warden knowledge, grandfather's displacement). Diction is mostly controlled, though "precisely humane" and "mirrored hush" feel elevated beyond Mara's established register in peak moments. The supervisor's radio dialogue is functional but generic ("Clean slate, they're saying. Safer that way.") without subtext or distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is present in her noticing of water levels and seep points, and the final paragraph's rhythm modulates with restored wind-chime sound. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high in the discovery beats. However, several artifact patterns appear: "precisely humane expression" and "precisely humane vigilance" repeat the phrase without functional evolution; "mirrored hush" appears twice as a stock descriptor; the penultimate paragraph's "spin stories into shared meaning" reads like mission-statement diction outside Mara's established voice. The closing sentence stacks three "everything it" clauses in a way that feels rhetorically intentional but slightly over-written for the moment's pressure. Mid-story exposition about the Dutoit family ("she had heard stories") tells rather than shows, though it's brief. No paraphrase loops, but the figurative language clusters ("accusations," "restoration," "spin stories") in the final third without anchoring in immediate sensory detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—drought revealing a drowned town and sparking a memorial movement—offers a fresh synthesis of environmental crisis and historical reckoning. Mara's dual role as warden and descendant adds specificity, and the photograph trail is a concrete discovery mechanism. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: personal loss → professional duty conflict → activist choice → community healing. The supervisor's flat opposition and the quick community rally within a week feel convenience-shaped rather than complex. The sapphire-hued label and wind chime provide texture, but the transformation from bureaucratic erasure to public memory proceeds without significant friction or counter-pressure after Mara's choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create the key turn: she collects photographs, proposes the memorial site, and sends copies to external groups, triggering the supervisor conflict and community response. Her vigilance (observing the receding waterline, descending the ridge) drives the discovery, and her final understanding reconfigures her role. However, much of her vigilance is observational; the decisive actions cluster in one paragraph of report-writing rather than being distributed across beats with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued liqueur label appears in two beats: Mara finds it behind cracked glass in Dutoit's store, and she collects it that night along with photographs. It's described vividly and tied to the Dutoit family backstory, but it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image centers the wind chime and arriving descendants, not the label. The label enriches texture but remains replaceable with any other artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reservoir town resurfacing shapes every beat: it drives Mara's descent, reveals the photograph trail and Dutoit's store, and creates the supervisor conflict over restricted access. The core concept generates the stakes (memorialize or expunge) and the closure (descendants visiting the ruins). The concept is on the page throughout, altering tactics (Mara's report pivot) and enabling the final image of communal memory. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" appears twice as a label: the older Dutoit's expression in the photograph, and Mara's "precisely humane vigilance" in the penultimate paragraph. It does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible tradeoff. The attribute reads as thematic decoration rather than a trait that shapes action under pressure. Swappable with "compassionate" or "careful" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears three times and drives the conflict: the supervisor orders expungement of town records, threatens to expunge Mara's proposal, and Mara's counter-move (sending copies externally) prevents erasure. The action redefines the stakes from physical safety to historical memory and shapes the major turn. The verb is specific to bureaucratic erasure and ties directly to the theme. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The trail of photographs is signaled early (Mara notices one, then another ten feet away, "as if someone had laid a deliberate trail") and its mechanics matter: she follows them down Main Street to Dutoit's store, where dozens more pinned beneath timber reveal the family story. The method enables the discovery beat and her decision to document. However, it does not return or shape the ending beyond having been collected. The method is functional and drives one key beat but does not constrain closure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway at twilight frames the opening and closing, and Mara's descent along the ridge path structures the discovery sequence. The setting provides spatial coherence (ridge → mudbank → Main Street → Dutoit's store) and the ridgeway is where people later arrive. However, the setting does not impose a tactical constraint or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as a legible stage rather than an active pressure. The wind chime at her station charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The wind chime falls silent "an hour before she began her walk" and rings again in the final paragraph, creating a temporal bracket. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; Mara's walk and discoveries unfold without a live clock. The "within a week" summary compresses the community response but does not dramatize urgency. The chime's return signals restoration thematically but does not track elapsed time as a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to spin stories into shared meaning" is stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and tied to her grandfather's silence and her choice to become a warden. It drives her decision to propose the memorial and share photographs. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; we do not see her wrestle with competing desires (e.g., job security versus historical witness) in scene. The motivation explains her action but lacks visible friction or cost tied to the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears twice: Mara stands in it at the lakebed, and the wind chime breaks it at closure. The tone is coherent—quiet, contemplative, elegiac—and modulates slightly when the chime rings "with something like restoration." The tone supports the theme of memory resurfacing and charges the final image. However, the tone remains relatively static across beats; the supervisor conflict and Mara's insubordination do not sharpen or tension the hush. The tone fits but does not escalate with pressure.</comment>
