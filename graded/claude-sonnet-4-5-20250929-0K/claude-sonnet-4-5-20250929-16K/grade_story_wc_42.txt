<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is grounded in embodied expertise—her grandmother's teaching method, forty years repairing cameras—and her actions flow from those particulars. The decision to honor what the clock is becoming rather than forcing it back shows genuine character agency tied to her craft philosophy. Minor weakness: Director Chen's "luminous ache" is stated rather than shown through behavior, though this doesn't touch the closure. The ending choice (dancing with forces rather than breaking free) emerges organically from the repair work dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights escape velocity from speed to acceptance, with the cost embodied in the mountain shaking and the clock's wild hand measuring what cannot be held. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—sensory density and recurring images (spinning hand, tremors, Moon's constancy) build pressure that crystallizes in the ending realization. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (observatory, workbench, Mira's loupe). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira restructures the mechanism to measure instability rather than time, narrowing options and changing what the observatory can capture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains Mira's work (foundations shaking, tools rattling, telescope array synchronization deadline) and the spinning clock hand becomes a micro-setting element that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: the hand's hum "like wind through a paper forest," clouds "like a second ocean," the seismic rhythm felt through feet. The spatial choreography between workbench, dome, and window remains coherent. Does not reach 9+ because while the clock and tremors shape choices, the broader observatory environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint in the climactic repair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: synchronize the telescope array before the lunar transit by repairing the clock. Mira's agency drives escalation—she diagnoses the problem ("trying to escape"), removes three gears, repositions the hairspring, gives the spinning purpose rather than stopping it. The resolution carries visible cost: the clock now measures instability instead of conventional time, and the observatory must accept what it cannot hold. The piece enters the 8-band because protagonist choice narrows options (restructure vs. force) and the price is legible (conventional chronometry sacrificed for seismic truth). One tightening point is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the spinning hand's grooves creating new pathways, escape velocity calculations streaming across screens, the Moon's patient constancy against the mountain's instability. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing—"escape velocity wasn't about speed" but "dancing with" forces—grounded in the specific repair work. The final image (leaf falling through clouds toward unseen earth) charges the ephemeral/permanence tension established throughout. Minor gap: "luminous ache" appears twice as a phrase rather than being wholly dramatized, though the concept saturates the piece through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries craft-specific texture: "grammar of springs and wheels, syntax of controlled release." Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing plot without excess. One friction: Director Chen's line "We need that clock functional to synchronize the telescope array" reads slightly expository for someone who would know Mira understands the stakes. Perceptual signature is strong—Mira notices through her jeweler's loupe and listens "by the sound of a leaf falling"—and remains coherent under pressure in the repair sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with varied rhythm and concrete imagery. Information density is high in the repair sequence. Two minor drags: "changelessly constant" appears twice in identical phrasing (Moon description), a small loop. The phrase "luminous ache" recurs without variation, functioning as a motif but creating slight template feel. Opening and closing lines are purposeful. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops in peak beats. The prose propels cleanly through the repair sequence without scaffolding, though the double "changelessly constant" and recycled "luminous ache" prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock repair, seismic measurement, and escape velocity philosophy feels earned rather than assembled. The transformation of a broken chronometer into an instability gauge is specific and non-obvious. The ending's insight—freedom as dancing with forces rather than breaking free—grows organically from the repair particulars rather than being imposed. Risk element: the lyric ending and accumulative structure commit fully without hedging. One constraint: the sage-repairer archetype is familiar, though Mira's jeweler's-loupe specificity and grandmother's teaching method add freshness. The piece earns its band through synthesis and follow-through rather than surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (sage camera repairer) drives two key turns: diagnosing the clock as "trying to escape" rather than broken, and restructuring the mechanism to measure instability instead of forcing conventional time. Present in setup (jeweler's loupe, forty years repairing cameras), middle development (listening method from grandmother, removing gears), and payoff (standing at window understanding the lesson). Her craft expertise enables the solution and her final realization. Reaches mid-6 band because decisions alter tactics and the closure epiphany is hers, though the "sage" archetype and the somewhat passive watching at the end keep it below 7+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clock hand that won't stop spinning appears across four distinct beats: initial observation (humming blur), diagnosis ("trying to escape"), restructuring (removing gears, adding dampener), and payoff (pulsing on the wall as Mira watches, measuring what cannot be held). The hand's behavior changes causally—from wild spinning to purposeful pulsing—and its final state charges the thematic closure. Specific mechanics matter: worn grooves creating new pathways, the hum beneath which Mira hears rhythm. Essential to story logic; removing it breaks both plot and theme. Reaches 8+ band because it drives multiple beats, transforms on the page, and shapes the ending image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Escape velocity shapes stakes (scientists' obsession, calculations streaming across screens) and the final thematic insight (not about speed but dancing with forces). Present in setup (paragraph three introduces the concept), middle (Mira's reflection on what velocity escapes time), and payoff (restructured understanding closes the piece). It operates more at thematic than tactical level—the repair doesn't literally require escape velocity math—but the concept reweights the entire premise in the ending. Reaches mid-6 band because it's causally present across the arc and essential to closure meaning, though its influence is more conceptual than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" constrains the narrative by establishing the Moon as fixed reference against which all instability is measured. Appears in setup (Moon as "patient witness"), middle (Mira's diagnosis of what stays vs. what shakes), and payoff (Moon hanging "changelessly constant, impossibly far" in the final paragraph). The attribute enables Mira's solution: because the Moon is constant, everything else's instability becomes measurable. Visible cost: conventional chronometry must be abandoned for this new measurement paradigm. Reaches low-7 band because it directly enables the plot solution and charges the ending contrast, though the exact phrase's repetition is slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Restructure" drives the central turning point: Mira removes three gears, repositions the hairspring, adds a camera-shutter dampener, creating a new mechanism that measures tremors instead of time. Present in setup (tools spread, problem framed), development (physical restructuring dramatized beat-by-beat), and payoff (restructured clock pulsing on the wall, measuring instability). This action redefines all options—from "fix the broken clock" to "honor what it's becoming." The ending realization about escape velocity flows directly from this physical restructuring choice. Indispensable; the story collapses without this exact action. Reaches high-8 band because it's causally central, dramatized in specific mechanical steps, and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"By the sound of a leaf falling" appears in setup (grandmother's teaching method), middle (Mira closes her eyes and listens beneath the hum to find the pattern), and payoff (final line: hearing the leaf fall through clouds). The method enables the diagnosis—listening beneath obvious noise—and charges the closure image. However, the mechanics remain somewhat impressionistic: we see Mira listen and act, but the exact causality from sound to solution is elided. Reaches upper-5 band because it's present across the arc and tied to both problem-solving and ending, but the method's specific mechanics don't constrain the repair as tightly as the physical tools do.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lunar observatory above the clouds supplies essential resources and constraints: the elevation creates deadline pressure (clouds below, telescope array waiting), the shaking foundations directly cause the clock malfunction and rattle Mira's tools mid-repair, the dome's opening frames the Moon observation. Present in setup (title and opening), development (tremors interrupt work multiple times), and payoff (standing at window, dome opening for the final sound). The setting's instability is not backdrop but the problem's source. Reaches mid-7 band because the location's physical properties drive causality and the ending image requires the specific altitude and access, though the observatory's astronomical function operates more as context than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"When foundations shake" provides both the inciting problem and ongoing escalation: tremors cause the clock malfunction, interrupt Mira's repair ("coffee cups rattled," "stronger this time"), and pulse in rhythm that the restructured clock ultimately measures. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (multiple tremor beats tighten pressure), and payoff (clock's hand pulsing faster, foundations trembling in response, seismic rhythm matched). The timeframe is the causality engine—without the shaking, there's no broken clock, no diagnosis, no solution. Reaches 8.0 because the shaking is indispensable to plot logic and its rhythm shapes the final mechanism, with visible cost (instability accepted rather than controlled).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" drives Director Chen's explicit goal (synchronize telescope array, capture the lunar transit) and creates the friction Mira must resolve. Present in setup (Chen's deadline speech), development (Mira's counter-insight: "this clock knows better than to try holding what moves"), and payoff (the restructured solution measures rather than holds). The motivation is dramatized through the repair choice—Mira rejects harness-and-hold in favor of measure-and-release. Reaches low-7 band because it frames the central problem and the ending inverts it with cost (giving up capture for measurement), though Chen's desire operates more as framing pressure than on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is stated twice explicitly (astronomers watching unreachable things, Moon in final paragraph) and embodied throughout: the spinning hand's hum, clouds flowing like time, the Moon's distance juxtaposed with the mountain's trembling. Tone modulates appropriately—controlled observation during diagnosis, intensifying during the repair under tremor pressure, elegiac in the closing image. The tone charges the final lines where ephemeral beauty and permanent distance coexist without resolution. Reaches upper-7 band because tone is coherent through turns, saturates the piece via image and rhythm, and the final paragraph crystallizes the ache with conceptual cost (acceptance of unreachable constancy), though the explicit phrase repetition is slightly mechanical.</comment>
