<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Della's motivations are clear and intensify through the investigation; the hierarchy of values shows through her choices with Kern. Her decision to stop the recording and let him go carries visible cost and feels earned by her father's heirloom and the parallel father-daughter stakes. Minor slip: Kern's desperation feels slightly under-embodied in the confrontation—more gestural specificity would sharpen the moment. Internal contradiction between vengeance and mercy lands cleanly without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: false leads trace cleanly to the north-caves revelation, and Della's final choice forecloses her vengeance path with legible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she refuses to use the recording, accepting that mercy trumps justice, and the cost is felt in her climb back "toward the dying stars." One beat could tighten: the transition from confrontation to decision feels slightly compressed given the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market is vividly rendered with barnacle-crusted ladder, rotting timber, oil lamps, and lobster-trap throne; these details are filtered through Della's mission-focused perception. The watch fob's physical warmth and the sensory detail of "salt-thick darkness" ground the scene. Minor gap: spatial choreography between Della and Kern could be sharper—her movement "closer" lacks specific distance or positioning that would charge the confrontation stakes. The sunrise timeframe bookends effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identifying her father's killer—is signaled early and tightens through the false-lead method to the Kern confrontation. The escalation is causal: each false start was designed to flush the informant, and the north-caves detail delivers the proof. Della's choice to stop recording and release Kern is driven by her agency and forecloses vengeance with on-page cost (she climbs away with no justice, only mercy). The moral calculus between father and daughter sharpens the peak choice with competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "some truces of hush existed not from cowardice, but from mercy" grows from Kern's confession and Della's final act rather than declaration. The watch fob's return—"kept better time than any man's word"—charges the ending without stating a moral. Slight over-articulation: "the sound of trust shattering, preserved forever" edges toward thematic echo, though it's anchored in her recording device and mission. The piece resists binary resolution and embraces moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close; Della's perceptual signature shows in "curiously steadfast determination" and the heirloom's weight. Dialogue carries subtext—Kern's "Him or her, Della. What would you have chosen?" pursues justification, not confession alone. Minor register slip: "comforting cadence of her childhood, stories by the fire, lullabies that smelled like copper and grain alcohol" feels slightly elevated for crisis perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery: "dying stars," "salt-thick darkness," "comfort in his expression curdled into something desperate." Minor template cadence in the setup: "She'd told Marcus… She'd whispered to Old Chen… She'd confided in Vera…" runs identical stems across three sentences without taught pattern payoff (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: "the sound of trust breaking" (paragraph 2) and "the sound of trust shattering" (paragraph 7) restate without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is high; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—detective work through traceable false leads in an underground market—is solid genre execution but not wholly fresh. The moral turn (mercy over vengeance via a father's parallel dilemma) elevates the familiar revenge plot with specific lived stakes. The watch fob and recording device are purposeful, but the pirate-market-beneath-the-pier leans toward atmospheric template without transforming the trope. Emotional honesty in the final choice avoids safety-hedging and commits fully to the moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening and drives all key beats: she devises the false-lead method, identifies Kern through the north-caves detail, and makes the closure choice to stop recording and release him. Her agency shapes escalation and the ending's cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 1) and reprised at closure ("The watch fob swung gently as she climbed back"), but mid-scene use is mostly descriptive. Kern's line "kept better time than any man's word" reweights it thematically, yet it doesn't constrain a choice. Two-gate setup (early + closure reprise) with lyric resonance, but lacks causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "truce of hush" governs the underground economy, motivates the betrayal, and is named explicitly in paragraph 3. It shapes Della's method (everyone keeps secrets) and her final decision (mercy over exposure). The concept constrains her options—breaking the truce would destabilize the system—and directly charges the closure when she chooses silence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast determination" appears in paragraph 2 as a descriptor but doesn't visibly constrain an on-page action with cost. Her steadfastness is consistent with her mission, yet the attribute feels more like voice coloring than a trait that enables or limits a specific choice. Functional but replaceable with "determined" or "resolute."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Thwart" appears explicitly when Kern confesses "I tried to thwart them, sent them to wrong places, but they knew I was lying." This action defines his moral position, explains his desperation, and justifies Della's mercy. Removing it would flatten Kern into a simple betrayer and undercut the parallel-father stakes that drive the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The false-starts method is signaled in paragraph 4 ("Each false start had been calculated"), detailed with three specific lies (Marcus/north caves, Chen/docks, Vera/church), and pays off when the north-caves detail proves Kern's guilt. The mechanics shape Della's investigative approach and deliver the causal proof that forces the confrontation. Indispensable to the plot's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The pirate market is introduced early (paragraph 2) with vivid detail (barnacle ladder, rotting timber, oil lamps, lobster traps) and provides the social context for the "truce of hush." It supplies the meeting place for the confrontation and the system Della chooses not to destabilize. While atmospheric, it doesn't alter tactics—Della's plan would work in any hidden venue. Present across all three gates but lacks unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sunrise is mentioned in the opening ("dying stars"), as the time her father was killed ("dawn"), and at closure ("dying stars" again, plus Kern's directive "Be gone before sunrise"). It bookends the story and lends urgency to Kern's escape, but the clock doesn't visibly tighten Della's investigation choices in the middle. Two-gate lyric reprise with mild pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Della's desire "to capture the sound of trust breaking" is named in paragraph 2, dramatized through her recording device and false-lead method, and directly tested at closure when she stops the recording. The friction between capturing betrayal and extending mercy creates the story's central cost. The motivation is embodied in her tactical choices and final renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named once (paragraph 8: "the comforting unease of the moment") but the tone is sustained throughout: warm imagery (amber lamplight, childhood lullabies, Kern's "comforting cadence") layered with menace (rotting pier, tarnished silver, "revenue men shot him"). The tone charges the final image—mercy feels both right and costly. Modulates with pressure and coheres through the closure.</comment>
