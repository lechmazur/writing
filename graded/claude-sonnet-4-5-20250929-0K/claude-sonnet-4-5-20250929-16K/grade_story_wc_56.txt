<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's arc from legend-seeker to truth-finder is legible and his discovery of Dessen's story earned, but his interior life remains somewhat abstract. The epiphany about the "architecture of lies" arrives on-page but feels announced rather than embodied—"hindsight clarity washed through him like cold water" tells the shift without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to photograph the maps and walk toward the city with "thoughtfully clear purpose" closes the arc but the emotional cost registers more as intellectual satisfaction than visible foreclosure of his prior identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Marcus, canal dock, twilight-to-dawn). The drive lens reads Causal: Marcus's trained instincts lead him from false compass to bent sundial to hidden maps, each beat narrowing his understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he secures evidence, pockets the sundial, and turns toward the city with new purpose—the cost is conceptual (his legend-seeking identity reweighted) but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (radio silence marking complicity, maps revealing the cover-up) suffices for this length, though the radio's return feels more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The barge canal is vivid and selective: "amber reflection and diesel shimmer," "deck groaning," charts that "crumbled at his touch." The setting constrains Marcus's search (pilot house, hold, crates) and the dawn imagery charges the closure ("serene upheaval of morning" modulates from opening twilight to final sunlit departure). Micro-setting (sundial, maps) drives the core revelation. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the industrial-ghost atmosphere supports tone without overwhelming action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understand why the false legend exists. Pressure tightens when Marcus finds the sundial instead of the compass, then escalates in the hold when he discovers the buried maps and grasps the cover-up. Agency is present—his decision to photograph evidence and keep the sundial forecloses his prior legend-chasing with visible cost (the radio's return feels like intrusion on what he now carries). One meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation reads more as intellectual assembly than high-stakes conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the bent sundial embodies Dessen's refusal to track time after tragedy, and the fake legend as a shell hiding real documentation. "Hide the mundane in the spectacular's shadow" and the final image of Marcus walking with "salvaged truth" answer the thematic question without moralizing. The sundial's return at closure—"some people measured time differently…hindsight was the only clarity that mattered"—reweights prior material. No Thematic Echo in final paragraph; the insight stays grounded in Dessen's bent gnomon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and Marcus's perceptual signature is legible (trained instincts, pattern recognition). Voice is controlled but leans toward elevated register in peak beats: "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear precision," "architecture of lies" recur with a faint template cadence. No dialogue present to assess naturalism. Psychic distance is consistent, though some passages edge toward expository interiority ("he understood: someone had taken Dessen's real story…and wrapped it in fantasy" tells what the maps should dramatize).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is strong and information density high in action beats. Overwriting issues: "serene upheaval" appears three times, "thoughtfully clear" twice, "architecture of lies" twice—these recur as thematic markers but edge toward stock phrasing. "Hindsight clarity washed through him like cold water" is a generic metaphor for realization. Template cadence in the middle section: "Marcus had sought…Now, standing…he understood" and "The legend was false…But standing here…Marcus understood" loop the revelation structure. Sentence variety is good overall, but figurative density in reflective passages (second half of story) accumulates without always advancing pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock metaphor density touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—false legend constructed to hide evidence of negligence—offers a fresh angle on the treasure-hunt frame, and the bent sundial as grief-marker is specific. Transformation is present: Marcus's arc reweights legend-seeking into truth-salvage. However, the emotional template (lone investigator discovers cover-up, walks away with evidence and new purpose) is familiar, and the ending's symbolic clarity ("broken gnomon a reminder") feels slightly over-articulated. Risk is modest; the piece executes competently within established literary-thriller conventions without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus (errant legend seeker) is present throughout and his choices drive all key turns: stepping onto the barge, recognizing the sundial's significance, descending to the hold, photographing the maps. Setup in opening line, development across multiple beats, payoff in final paragraph. His role as trained seeker enables the discoveries and his decision to salvage truth (rather than chase myth) closes the arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Antique pocket sundial is handled twice (found in pilot house, pocketed at end) and its bent gnomon is the key to understanding Dessen's grief and the cover-up's emotional architecture. Setup mid-story, causal role in the revelation beat, charged reprise in final paragraph where it becomes a "reminder that some people measured time differently." Irreplaceable: the bent gnomon's specific meaning distinguishes it from a generic artifact. Strong closure linkage and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity shapes Marcus's epiphany ("hindsight clarity washed through him") and recurs in the final image ("hindsight was the only clarity that mattered to him"). The concept drives the thematic question but less so the tactical stakes—Marcus's forward-looking detective work (finding maps, photographing evidence) relies more on present-tense pattern recognition than backward-looking realization. Present in setup, development, and closure, but the mechanics of hindsight as a constraint or enabler remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thoughtfully clear appears twice as a descriptor of Marcus's instincts and purpose. It labels his trait but does not visibly constrain or enable specific actions with cost—Marcus's discoveries flow from trained observation rather than a dramatized trade-off between thoughtfulness and speed or clarity and ambiguity. Present in setup and closure, functionally consistent, but the attribute reads more as summary than as a lever that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Salvage drives multiple beats: Marcus seeks to "salvage what remained of this dying place's truth," photographs maps as "salvaged truth secure in his camera," and the final image frames his walk as carrying salvaged evidence. Setup early, causal work in the hold sequence, payoff in closure. The action redefines his purpose from legend-seeking to evidence-preservation. Strong integration, though the mechanics (photographing maps) are straightforward rather than tactically costly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Training/instincts are signaled early ("trained instincts, honed through years of sifting genuine mystery from elaborate hoax") and recur ("instincts that had become almost prescient through training"). The method shapes his approach (recognizing fabrication's architecture, following clues in the hold) but the mechanics remain general—no specific technique or trade-off is dramatized. Present across beats and mentioned at closure, but the means could be swapped for "intuition" or "experience" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal is present in opening line, provides the physical setting for all action (dock, barge deck, pilot house, hold), and charges the final image ("canal waters caught the rising sun," "canal's industrial dawn"). The setting supplies the resources (barges, crates, maps) and constraints (rotting dock, crumbling charts) that drive the plot. Time progression from twilight to dawn modulates the tone. Indispensable to story logic and atmosphere; removing this exact locale would break the closure image and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Morning radio silence marks the moment Marcus realizes he's been following fabrications and later signals the harbormaster's complicity ("the radio crackled back to life…the harbormaster had known, had perhaps been paid for his silence"). Setup and payoff present, and the silence reweights the investigation. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—Marcus's search proceeds at a contemplative pace without a live clock. The radio functions more as atmospheric marker than escalation lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Understanding the architecture of lies is dramatized: Marcus recognizes the elegant fabrication, traces Dessen's real story, and grasps the cover-up's purpose ("create a mystery attractive enough, and truth becomes invisible"). The motivation drives his descent into the hold and his decision to photograph the maps. Setup in opening third, development across the revelation beat, payoff in closure where he walks away with "salvaged truth." The desire is tested and refined on the page with visible cost (his legend-seeking identity reweighted), though the friction between wants and costs could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Serene upheaval appears three times: opening ("serene upheaval of dawn"), middle ("The serene upheaval of morning intensified"), and implicitly in the closure (stillness that "promised imminent transformation"). The tone is coherent and modulates from twilight quiet to charged dawn, supporting the thematic shift from myth to truth. However, the repeated exact phrase edges toward ornamental recurrence rather than functional pressure, and the tone's contribution to the final image is atmospheric more than causal. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but not indispensable.</comment>
