<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Teryn's motivation is clear and her internal state is conveyed through concrete action (strapping the keystone, climbing, mist walking). The grandmother's teachings provide embodied memory that informs present choices. Minor weakness: the final beat's self-aware epiphany ("she had become exactly the mage she'd always been") edges toward summary rather than fully dramatized realization, though the keystone press anchors it in gesture. The climb and placement sequence show genuine physical struggle that earns the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) at closure: Teryn completes the keystone placement, the spire responds with lingering luminance, and the final image crystallizes her stance as a mage who "accommodates impossibilities." Cost is felt in her awareness that the Academy will come to "optimize" what she's restored, and the climb itself represents physical and social forfeiture. Orientation anchors quickly (cloudline climb, keystone, Academy context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the keystone slots into place and the light spreads, reweighting her identity and the old magic's persistence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, cloudline, and mist are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (ice layers revealing vine patterns, fog as solid ground). The keystone itself functions as micro-setting, its "lingering luminance" quality charging the closure image when light echoes through the spire's ice. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, cloudline, mist walking, apex gap, placement. The setting constrains choice (the climb is arduous, the gap specific) and the final image of light through ice fractals directly supports the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: proving that old magic and "the sacred in simple stone" still matter. The climb provides escalating physical pressure, and the keystone placement is a clear tightening that narrows options (she completes the act or fails). Cost is visible in the physical struggle and the knowledge that automatist mages will come to investigate. The piece leans more toward accumulative pressure than sharp reversals, which fits the inferred lens, but the Academy's looming response after closure adds tangible friction. One micro turn: the keystone fits perfectly, triggering the luminance cascade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the keystone's properties, the contrast between hand-drawn sigils and automated spellcraft, and the folly's philosophy ("served no purpose except beauty"). The final image—light that "refused to forget"—offers a non-literal answer to whether beauty and slowness retain value in an efficiency-driven age. Minimal overt philosophizing; the spire's response and Teryn's recognition are enacted rather than stated. The phrase "she had become exactly the mage she'd always been" flirts with summary but is anchored by the preceding keystone press and luminance pulse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature tied to Teryn's training (noticing vine patterns, lingering luminance, mist physics). Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-appropriate for a mage steeped in old lore. No head-hopping. The phrase "light chasing itself through frozen fractals" and "brilliant dimness" show rhythmic control and specific lexical choices. Psychic distance tightens at the keystone placement. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Grandmother's quoted wisdom integrates naturally without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sensory anchors ("translucent layers," "water droplets," "muscles burning"). Minor loop/scaffold: "The fit was perfect" is a one-line beat that could integrate with the luminance spread sentence for tighter momentum. The phrase "she had finally passed the only examination that mattered" is near-summary; the prior keystone press and pulse carry the real weight. Figurative language ("light chasing itself," "brilliant dimness") is consistent and controlled, though density is high in the final third without obscuring clarity. No major syntax monotony or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—old magic vs. automated spellcraft, underachieving mage restores an ancient artifact—is familiar but executed with specific detail (lingering luminance, folly keystone, mist walking mechanics). The "accommodates impossibilities" concept and the luminance property offer fresh texture. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to a quiet, lyrical closure rather than a confrontation, which fits the material. The final reconfiguration (light remembering, Teryn recognized by old magic) feels earned in hindsight. The Academy as looming external pressure adds a non-obvious complication but remains off-page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Teryn's identity as an underachieving mage frames the entire arc: her failure at Automatist Exams motivates the climb, her hand-drawn sigil practice contrasts with automation, and the closure validates her as "exactly the mage she'd always been." Setup by paragraph one, development through the climb and mist walking (old methods), payoff in the final recognition. Her choices (strapping the keystone, climbing, stepping into mist, placing the stone) create every key turn. Cost is visible in physical struggle and social defiance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keystone appears in beat one (strapping, carrying), is described in beat two (lingering luminance property), is unstrapped and held at the cloudline (beat three), lifted and placed at the apex (beat four), and triggers the luminance cascade (beat five). Its specific property—accommodating impossibilities and lingering luminance—is irreplaceable and directly charges the closure image. Removing it breaks the story's logic and thematic resolution. Cost: physical burden during the climb, social risk of salvaging it from demolition.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is introduced early as the keystone's "peculiar quality" (light persisting after shadow), demonstrated during exams (spells work but slowly), and becomes the closure's central image when light spreads through the spire's ice, "each reflection lasting a heartbeat longer than physics allowed." The concept shapes stakes (proving impossibilities can be accommodated) and directly charges the final reconfiguration. It constrains tactics (Teryn's slow spells fail automated timers) and the ending would lose coherence without this exact property.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is named in paragraph three, demonstrated when the keystone makes Teryn's inefficient spells work (though too slowly for timers), enacted when she mist walks (treating fog as solid ground), and fulfilled when the keystone slots perfectly into the ancient gap and the spire glows with impossible light. The trait enables the climb's success and constrains the approach (old methods only). Cost: the Academy's systems reject her approach as too slow, forcing her to seek the spire alone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The unstrapping occurs at the cloudline, marking a transition from physical burden to intentional presentation of the keystone before the mist walk. It's a hinge beat but not the story's major turn—that role belongs to the placement at the apex. Swappable with "lifted" or "raised" without major structural loss, though the specific detail (she carried it strapped, then freed it to hold) adds embodied texture. Present in setup and middle but not directly shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mist walking is introduced via Grandmother's teaching in paragraph four, mechanics explained ("treating fog as solid ground," "where the mist is taking you"), and enacted in paragraph five as Teryn steps into the cloud. It contrasts with modern teleportation (precision vs. need-based arrival) and ties to the "accommodates impossibilities" theme. The method shapes her ascent and enables the spire's revelation. Cost: uncertainty ("each step both certain and uncertain"). Removing it would require a mundane climb, flattening the thematic opposition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire is the story's destination, introduced early (paragraph one: "icebound spire above the clouds"), described when Teryn arrives (ice-coated tower, vine patterns matching keystone), and houses the apex gap where the keystone must fit. It supplies the constraint (the missing keystone slot) and the resource (the ancient structure that can still respond to old magic). The spire's ice becomes the medium for the luminance cascade at closure, charging the final image. Removing it breaks both plot and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when creativity gets automated") is established in paragraph one (Automatist Exams, algorithm-driven spellcraft, efficiency wardens) and paragraph six (Academy's algorithms will flag anomalous readings, efficient mages will come). It provides context and mild urgency but does not function as a live ticking clock that alters Teryn's tactics during the climb. The contrast between old and automated magic is thematic backdrop rather than moment-to-moment pressure. Present in setup and implied at closure but does not tighten decisions beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Teryn's motivation—"to find the sacred in the simple"—is introduced via the folly philosophy (paragraph two: beauty as highest purpose), tested during the climb (physical acts of "climbing, carrying, caring"), and fulfilled at closure when the spire responds and Teryn recognizes "the sacred lived in simple acts." The desire is dramatized through her choice to salvage the keystone, endure the climb, and place it despite knowing the Academy will investigate. Friction: her methods are rejected as inefficient, and the cost is social and physical. The final beat ties motivation directly to the luminance image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is named in paragraph five ("not with sharp clarity...but with the soft revelation of dawn") and paragraph seven ("not bright but brilliant, not dim but gentle, somehow both at once"). The tone—paradoxical, liminal, both/and rather than either/or—coheres through the mist walk, the lingering luminance description, and the closure image of light that "refused to forget." It modulates with pressure (from physical climb to lyric revelation) and charges the final image. The phrase appears twice, the second time integrated into the keystone's effect, which reweights the concept with cost and achievement.</comment>
