<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains cryptic but largely static—her "infinitely patient" trait is asserted in summary ("She had spent seven years once…") rather than tested on the page with visible cost. Interior life is thin: we see ritual action but no embodied contradiction or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. The change in townspeople (Marcus, baker's daughter) is told in brief snapshot rather than dramatized with felt stakes, so the protagonist's arc reads more as catalyst than as a character who forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of walking + tuning-fork strikes and lands on a resonant image (bells ring true, people return). Orientation is clear by the archway opening. However, the closure lacks on-page felt cost: the bell tuner simply leaves "infinitely patient, cryptic as ever" with no visible price paid or option foreclosed. The "collapse would not come" is declared, not demonstrated through a decisive beat that reweights prior material with cost. The orientation test passes, but Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence shows what the tuner sacrificed or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Millhaven's cobblestones, archway, and spatial choreography (square → main street → alleys) are vivid and purposeful. The ebony tuning fork as micro-object charges multiple beats and the keystone strike seeds the final bell-ringing image. Sensory detail is selective (dissonant chime, "wild hush," weeds through cobblestones) and filtered through the tuner's professional ear. No occupational systems exposition, economy maintained. The archway and cobblestones constrain the walking ritual and shape the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prevent the town's collapse. One meaningful deepening occurs when people begin to pause (Marcus, baker's daughter), but these moments are told in quick summary rather than dramatized with trade-offs. The protagonist's agency is present (the walking ritual) but never tested—no setback, no adaptation, no visible friction. The timeframe ("three weeks left") is declared but does not tighten tactics on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break; here the ritual simply repeats without complication until success is announced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of restoring shared balance and rhythm emerges organically from the tuning-fork ritual and cobblestone walking without overt statement. The final image (bells ring true, people stay) answers the thematic question non-literally and reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the "wild hush" shifting to "possibility," and the ebony fork's age deepens resonance. No forced epiphany. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap and resists tidy morals, though the protagonist's own arc does not complicate the theme with internal friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: the tuner hears "discordant chime" and "sound died against weathered stones," filtering world through her professional senses. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("hemorrhaging people," "wild hush," "drinking in the morning light"). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in archway moment, wider in town summary). The prose reflects her calm, patient stance without drift into therapy-speak or label inflation. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity and rhythm are strong; sentence openings vary, figurative language (ebony fork "drinking in" light, frequency "felt more than heard") is specific and coherent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold: "Her motivation was simple, though the method was not" and the backstory summary ("seven years once," "entire winter") tell rather than dramatize, diluting momentum in the first third. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Information density high in ritual beats, but the closure paragraph's declarative summary ("The collapse would not come. Not today…") leans abstract rather than anchoring in concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The bell-tuner-as-traveling-healer premise is familiar (troubadour/doctor variants), but the ebony tuning fork and cobblestone rhythm add specific texture. The "frequency" and "rhythm" as literal town-saving tools transform the stock ghost-town setup into something more particular. Risk-taking is modest: the piece commits to its acoustic logic without subverting it, and the protagonist's competence is never complicated by genuine struggle or mistake. The ending's inevitability feels more schematic than earned through character friction. Fresh inflection present but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cryptic bell tuner frames expectation (setup), drives the middle walking ritual (development), and departs in the final paragraph (payoff: all three gates). She enables the central action but does not face a choice that narrows her options—she executes her ritual without setback or cost. Present across beats but largely observational/actional rather than decisional. Causal pressure modest; closure linkage via departure image. Swappability moderate: a healer/tinker/priest could perform similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ebony tuning fork appears in setup (archway keystone strike), middle beats ("struck the tuning fork again"), and ending (placed back in satchel after bells ring true). Handled physically across three distinct beats; its acoustic properties enable the ritual and charge the closure moment when bells finally "rang true." Specificity high: age, material, and function irreplaceable. Cost connection modest (no visible sacrifice tied to the fork itself). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift score into essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ghost town revival shapes stakes (prevent Millhaven's collapse) and the ending turn (people return, shops reopen). Present in setup (hemorrhaging people, empty shops), drives middle tactics (walking ritual to restore rhythm), and resolves at closure (baker's daughter unlocks door, Marcus unhitches cart). The concept redefines options: without revival, the town dies. Specificity solid: the "before the collapse" frame makes the revival urgent rather than abstract. Cost legibility weaker: success is declared, not shown through a fraught beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Infinitely patient is declared in summary ("She had spent seven years once…") and label-applied ("Patience was not a virtue to her but a tool"). Does not constrain an on-page action with visible tradeoff—the three-day ritual completes smoothly without friction testing her patience against another need. Mentioned in setup and invoked at closure ("infinitely patient"), but ornamental: swappable with "methodical" or "skilled" without structural loss. Label-only trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rebuild drives the middle sequence (walking circuits, striking fork, stitching frequency) and the ending turn (balance restored, people stay). Present in setup via stated goal, enacted through middle beats, and confirmed at closure. The action is causally central: removing "rebuild" would erase the plot. Specificity moderate: the acoustic-ritual method is unique, but the rebuild itself is declared more than dramatized with setbacks. Major turns trace to this action; essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones is signaled in setup (she walks the square/streets/alleys) and executed in middle beats ("heel-toe, heel-toe, a heartbeat laid down in percussion"). The method shapes the ritual's mechanics: footsteps + tuning fork = frequency restoration. Present at closure when the balance holds. Swappability low: the cobblestone rhythm is the story's signature mechanic. Development solid; closure linkage present but understated (the final paragraph summarizes rather than showing one last step). Causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ancient archway anchors the opening and closing images (she stands beneath it, listens, walks away). The keystone receives the first tuning-fork strike, seeding the ritual. Archway as threshold matters thematically ("founders who understood that thresholds mattered") and spatially (eastern entrance). Present in setup, touched at closure. Does not constrain a mid-story choice or alter tactics—it functions as symbolic frame more than active pressure. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Before the collapse timeframe is stated ("three weeks left") in setup and invoked at closure ("The collapse would not come"). Does not tighten on-page tactics: the three-day ritual proceeds without clock pressure, setbacks, or urgency adjustments. The timeframe is declared but not tracked or felt in beats. Swappable: removing "three weeks" would leave the plot intact. Present and thematically relevant but functionally ornamental; no live countdown that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To restore shared balance is stated in setup ("Her motivation was simple") and enacted through the walking ritual. Desire is clear but not dramatized with internal friction—she executes her plan without want/fear conflict or visible sacrifice. The ending confirms success (balance returned), but no on-page moment shows what restoring balance cost her. Present across all three gates; causal role solid. Told-only lowers score: we never see her weigh this restoration against another competing need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Wild hush appears in setup ("peculiar quiet when nature begins reclaiming"), modulates in middle ("began to shift, to contain something more than absence"), and charges the ending ("leaving Millhaven humming…into the wild hush"). Tone is coherent and purposeful, reflecting emptiness-to-life arc. The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, creating lyric cohesion. Does not constrain a choice but does modulate with pressure and charges the final image. Solid setup–payoff reprise lifts into mid-6s.</comment>
