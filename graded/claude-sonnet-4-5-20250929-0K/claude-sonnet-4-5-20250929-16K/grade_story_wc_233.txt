<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The queen's disenchantment is clearly established and her choice to climb away from courtly life is motivated. However, the internal contradiction feels stated rather than embodied—she "felt nothing but distant concern" reads as summary. The old woman's sudden appearance and the queen's acceptance lack visceral hesitation or doubt. The transformation from disenchantment to purpose in the final beat is declared but not earned through on-page micro-choices that show competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (queen, palace, dreams). The causal chain is present: dreams → messengers → climb → grotto → vision → decision to return. The closure lands on the page as a reconfiguration (disenchantment → purpose), and the old woman's intervention provides a turning point. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral—what the queen sacrifices or forecloses by returning is implied but not concretely dramatized. The "bleeding starlight" visions show branching futures but don't narrow her options through a difficult on-page choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the ridge's treacherous ascent, the ember grotto as false destination, the cobalt grotto's impossible suspension. The "bleeding starlight" detail is striking and specific. The fireflies ascending at closure create a strong visual anchor that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the climb, and the environment subtly mirrors the queen's internal journey without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the recurring dreams—is signaled early. The climb provides physical escalation, and the encounter with the old woman offers a knowledge shift. However, the pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten through protagonist agency; the old woman simply shows her the visions and explains their meaning. The queen's agency at closure is to "return" and "rule," but this decision lacks an on-page trade-off or visible cost that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bleeding starlight image and the fireflies mirroring the heavens—mystery unraveling into choice rather than answer. "Even stars can bleed, even queens can climb" avoids didacticism by tying abstraction to concrete images. The ending reweights the opening's disenchantment as necessary groundwork for purpose. The vision of branching futures invites reflection on agency without spelling out a moral. Minor slip: "mysteries unravel not into answers but into choices" edges toward stated theme in the old woman's closing speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in the queen's perspective throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "lacy menace—delicate as frost patterns, dangerous as the blade beneath" shows controlled figurative language. The old woman's dialogue feels purposeful and distinct. Minor issue: "softly commanding voice that made refusal sound like benediction" is a tell-only construction that could have been shown through dialogue or action. The queen's perceptual signature is consistent but leans toward elevated diction throughout without modulation under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("blade of stone cutting through morning mist," "wounds across the sky"). Sentence rhythm varies appropriately. Minor issues: "This mystery belonged to her alone" and "Disenchantment had settled into her bones like winter cold" feel slightly stock. The phrase "shared silence, and then, with a shared exhale" in the firefly moment uses "shared" twice in close proximity. Information density is high, and the climb sequence propels efficiently without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disenchanted-monarch-seeking-mystical-truth premise is familiar, but the bleeding starlight and fireflies ascending create fresh specificity. The old woman as guide is archetypal, yet her "lacy menace" and the grotto's impossible physics add texture. The transformation from passive vision-recipient to active chooser is earned but not deeply surprising. The piece commits fully to its lyric-fantasy register and executes competently within that mode, but doesn't take structural or thematic risks that would elevate it beyond capable execution of known patterns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen frames the story, makes the decision to climb (midpoint choice), and decides to return and rule (closure choice). Present in setup, development, and payoff. The climb is her action, but the encounter with the old woman is largely passive—she watches visions and receives explanation. The return decision lacks visible on-page cost or trade-off that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears once at midpoint as a resting place and false destination that "reminded her of a dying hearth." It serves structural contrast to the cobalt grotto but doesn't constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning. Present in development but not setup or payoff. Its causal role is minimal—simply a waypoint that could be replaced.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is seeded in the opening dreams, drives the climb (she follows the vision), appears as the grotto's central phenomenon, and enables the vision of branching futures. Present in setup, development, and payoff. It shapes her understanding and decision to return, though the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than constraining. The fireflies at closure mirror and reweight the bleeding light image, creating resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is mentioned twice: in the ascent when she refuses her ladies-in-waiting, and when facing the old woman. Both are label-only descriptions rather than demonstrated through dialogue or action that shows the trait enabling or constraining a choice. No visible cost tied to this attribute. Present in setup and development but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The climb is the story's spine: decision to climb (setup), physical ascent past treeline and through clouds (development), arrival at the cobalt grotto and descent (payoff). The action structures all major turns and the closure hinges on having climbed—"even queens can climb." Removing the climb would break the story's logic. The physical journey mirrors and enables the internal transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies" appears only at closure. It provides the moment of understanding and reweights the bleeding starlight motif, but isn't signaled earlier or used to shape attempts. The mechanics (shared breath, mutual observation) matter emotionally but don't constrain prior choices. Present in payoff only; strong lyric reprise but late arrival and single-beat use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is seeded in opening dreams, drives the quest (she climbs to find it), and provides the setting for the climactic vision and understanding. Its impossible position "above the cloudbank" and the bleeding-light phenomenon are specific and irreplaceable. Present in setup (dreams), development (goal), and payoff (revelation site). The setting enables the closure but doesn't constrain tactics as sharply as possible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames the opening and creates urgency (third messenger collapse). The climb's temporal progression (dawn departure, midday treeline, afternoon clouds, evening descent) structures the narrative and tightens pressure through physical exhaustion. The fortnight of recurring dreams establishes prior duration. Time is tracked and shapes the arc, though it doesn't create a ticking-clock that alters specific tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The recurring dreams and the drive to understand them motivate the entire journey. Established in setup ("maddening"), tested in development (climb despite danger), and resolved in payoff (understanding leads to return). The motivation is dramatized through the climb's physical cost and the queen's rejection of courtly explanations. Mild friction between enlightenment and the cost of returning could be sharper, but the desire shapes all major choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is explicitly named in the old woman's smile and colors her presence. The tone blends lyric beauty ("cobalt," "bleeding starlight") with danger ("blade of stone," "minds broke") consistently. It modulates appropriately—softer in the firefly moment, sharper in the grotto's revelation. The tone charges the final image's balance of wonder and purpose. Present throughout and coherent, though not always operating at peak intensity.</comment>
