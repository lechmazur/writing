<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity and protective instinct are established early and drive her actions throughout. However, her competence borders on magical—tracing pulses, accessing records, intuitively knowing the carnival location—without sufficient struggle or blind spots. The moment she realizes Elena is missing and in danger feels too convenient, undermining the earned quality of her choices. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves through the beats with professional certainty rather than genuine doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal chain: hearing aid pulse → message discovery → hospital records → missing girl alert → carnival location → rescue. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening). The closure delivers a Decisive Change (Elena saved) with felt cost (Mara's isolation, the weight of her work), though the coincidence of Elena being at the exact carnival weakens causal integrity. The drive lens reads as Causal with some Situational pressure, held consistently to the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with potted ferns creates a distinct atmosphere that recurs and charges the final image ("the mist began to lift"). The hearing aid functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's method and providing tactile detail ("grew warm, then hot"). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The carnival as off-page destination is economically sketched through the photograph, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (deliver the boy's message to his grieving sister) is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers Elena is suicidal and missing. The pressure escalates through Mara's agency (her decision to call authorities, to direct them to the carnival). One meaningful reversal occurs when the simple message becomes a life-saving intervention. The cost is visible: Mara's solitary burden, her need to convince skeptics, and the ongoing cycle of vulnerable voices awaiting her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the electromagnetic signatures of grief, devices as vessels for unfinished love, incidental heroism arising from curiosity. The hearing aid and photograph function as charged objects without becoming overtly symbolic. The final image—mist lifting, device archived, boundary between living and dead solidifying—offers a resonant answer to the question of connection and completion without moralizing. "Incidental heroism" is stated once but earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and literary, with a distinct perceptual signature ("mist-clad," "reeling hush," "incidental heroism"). Focalization remains controlled in Mara's POV throughout. The single line of direct dialogue ("Check the carnival grounds on Riverside...") feels natural and goal-driven. However, phrases like "contact tracer for hearts" and "incidental heroism" read slightly authorial rather than character-specific thought. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is generally high. However, several phrases carry ornamental weight without advancing pressure: "potted ferns that seemed to lean toward secrets," "reeling hush," "the weight of incidental heroism." The phrase "incidental heroism" appears twice, creating mild redundancy. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd discovered," "she realized") when immediacy would strengthen key beats. The closure image is clean and propulsive, largely untouched by these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—tracing electromagnetic signatures of grief through abandoned devices—offers a fresh supernatural/procedural hybrid. The specific detail of a hearing aid and the carnival photograph anchor the concept in tactile particulars. However, the "contact tracer for hearts" frame and the convenient alignment of Elena being at the exact carnival location lean toward template plotting. The transformation of "message delivery" into "suicide prevention" provides a non-obvious turn that feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
