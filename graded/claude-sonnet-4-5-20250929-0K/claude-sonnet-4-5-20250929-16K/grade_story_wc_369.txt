<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior is concrete and selective—the opening perception ("silence that followed felt textured") and the wound-healing moment are well-embodied. However, her motivation to "deconstruct the measurement system" arrives almost entirely through the astronomer's notes rather than her own contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to map dreams feels inherited rather than earned by on-page struggle, and no visible cost forecloses a live path at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative lens early (pin → corridors → astronomer's notes → sextant reconstruction → moonlight reveal) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Kael's understanding shifts from quantified sorrow to "the full scope of human continuation." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The final image ("carrying moonlight in her bones") reweights prior material with felt cost—her night's labor and new knowledge—though the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatically visible as a forfeited option or wound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth's growth-ring walls, the storm-wracked turret, and the moonlight's angle all constrain and enable Kael's final reconstruction. The sextant's broken mirrors catching moonlight drive the climactic beat, and the "thousand-year oak" keystone anchors the closure. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (stone textures, silver light pooling, storm intensifying), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from staircase to astronomers' corridor to labyrinth heart.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what the labyrinth has missed—is signaled early and tightens once when Kael realizes "the labyrinth had always been incomplete." The sextant reconstruction is a meaningful deepening that reweights the concept of measurement. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than agonistic: no live option is foreclosed, and the visible cost at closure is labor and insight rather than a trade-off that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the labyrinth's design and the astronomer's failed experiment: quantification captures sorrow but misses "the unquantifiable grace of going on." The final image—"carrying moonlight in her bones"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The tree-memory motif accumulates pressure and charges the closure by revealing "ordinary miracles" the architects never measured. No abstract philosophizing intrudes on the scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-limited to Kael; perceptual signature is consistent (she notices growth rings, calculates units of sorrow, reads moonlight as "medicine"). Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("provisional and holy," "dreams that predated the labyrinth"). One minor slip: "She understood then what needed doing" tells rather than shows the realization through embodied perception. Psychic distance is intentional and effective throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or plot. Minor template cadence in the dream-mapping passage: "Here: a woman… There: a man…" reads list-like but serves the accumulative design. One paraphrase loop: "the labyrinth had always been incomplete" → "Sorrow could be measured… But healing happened in the spaces between" restates without added pressure. No figurative muddle or register drift; clarity holds at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—trees hold pre-quantified emotional memory—transforms the familiar "ancient repository" trope through the sextant-as-moonlight-reader mechanic, which is specific and non-obvious. The final turn (ordinary continuance was unmeasured) feels earned in hindsight by the astronomer's desperation and Kael's reconstruction. Risk-taking in the lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The "mundane miracles" frame avoids generic abstractions by grounding them in concrete images (mother singing, strangers becoming lovers).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's maintenance role is signaled early ("fourteen years of tending the labyrinth") and shapes two key beats: recognizing the pin's significance and possessing the skill to reconstruct the sextant. Her choice to map dreams and descend to continue her work drives the closure. The character is essential to the story's logic—only a long-term caretaker would notice the pin and understand the labyrinth's architecture well enough to act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sextant appears in three beats: discovery (broken on the table), healing moment (Kael's thumb against glass), and reconstruction (placed to catch moonlight at the keystone). Its broken state is causal—Kael must "deconstruct and reform" it, not restore it—and the fractured mirrors enable the tree-memory revelation. Removing this exact object would collapse the climax; the astronomer's tool must read ancient wood, not stars.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is introduced early (three left turns = 847 units) and shapes the stakes: Kael discovers the system is incomplete. It reappears at closure when she realizes "healing happened in the spaces between" measurement. However, the concept operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—Kael never wrestles with whether to keep measuring or how to integrate unmeasured data. It reweights meaning but does not narrow her on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moonlight-healing trait appears once (Kael's thumb wound closes after touching the sextant's mirror) and primes her understanding that moonlight can reveal hidden truths. The moment is concrete and embodied, but the trait does not constrain a later choice or carry visible cost. It functions as foreshadowing rather than a tactical lever—Kael would reconstruct the sextant even without experiencing healing herself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" governs the major turn: Kael realizes the sextant must be "deconstructed and reformed… as it needed to be" rather than repaired, enabling the moonlight to speak through fractured mirrors. The action is signaled by the astronomer's final note ("Must deconstruct the measurement system") and enacted on-page. Removing this exact action would require a different climax—simple reconstruction would not unlock tree-memory. The verb is causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mapping is signaled midpoint when Kael arranges the astronomer's scattered notes into "a map—not of stars but of the dreams that had walked these corridors." She enacts the method twice: reading the notes (mapping past dreams) and working until dawn to map moonlight-revealed fragments. The method matters causally—she must organize data to understand the pattern—but the mechanics remain abstract. We see her "mapping each dream-fragment" without witnessing the specific choices or constraints the process imposes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit tower by moonlight is present throughout and essential: moonlight's angle is the tool that reveals tree-memory, the storm intensifies during the climax ("lightning turning the moon inconstant"), and the eastern turret window supplies the light that makes the astronomer's room "provisional and holy." The setting directly enables the sextant's function and charges the final image. Removing moonlight or the storm would break the story's central mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The pin falling at 3:47 AM is noted precisely and functions as inciting incident, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions afterward. Kael works "until dawn" without urgency or a ticking constraint; the storm provides atmospheric pressure but no deadline. The moment of hearing the pin is more spatial (seventeen corridors) than temporal, and no clock alters her tactics during the reconstruction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's desire to discover what trees witness is dramatized through her choices: she opens the door "she'd always meant to open," deciphers the astronomer's notes, and reconstructs the sextant to read wood-memory. The motivation is consistent and drives two beats (note-reading and reconstruction). However, it lacks on-page friction—no competing want or cost complicates her pursuit. She proceeds methodically without sacrifice or doubt, so the motivation shapes action but not conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "mundane miracles" tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: early wonder ("silence that followed felt textured"), intensifying discovery (the astronomer's "desperate handwriting"), and lyric closure ("carrying moonlight in her bones"). The tone charges the final image by framing ordinary human moments (mother singing, lovers meeting) as what the labyrinth missed. The register remains stable—reverent without sentimentality—and the tone reweights the concept of measurement at closure.</comment>
