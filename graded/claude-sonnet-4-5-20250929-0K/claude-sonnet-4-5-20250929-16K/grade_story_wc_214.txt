<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's interior life is concrete and distinctly filtered through his spiritual curiosity, embodied in his empathic ritual with meteors. The backstory ("a marriage ended, a career abandoned") is compressed but tilts his present stance toward vulnerability as strength, delivering a credible shift by the ending when he sings back to the birds. Internal contradiction appears in his oscillation between self-imposed penance and discovery of meaning through imperfection, though the final renunciation of brokenness feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in a pivotal choice. Minor therapy-speak ("finding in each falling light a mirror of his own brief, burning journey") at the closure edge nudges the score down but does not break the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a cadence shift at dawn that reweights solitude and observation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Kael's nightly vigil transforms from exile-as-penance into a chosen stance of witnessing, with the cost legible in his ongoing solitude and the station's abandonment. The yellow glass revelation functions as a micro turn that deepens rather than reverses, consistent with the accumulative pattern. One structural seam: the backstory paragraph slightly flattens momentum mid-piece, but recovery is swift and the lens holds through the singing finale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly anchored (copper dome, spiral stairs, amber glow transforming shadow and light) and the yellow lantern glass—with its trapped bubbles—constrains Kael's understanding and charges the final image by proving imperfection creates beauty. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Kael notices star trajectories and lantern patterns because they serve his ritual. The micro-setting (desk, lantern, charcoal, paper) functions as tool-as-setting that shapes his nightly choice to trace rather than measure. Minor cap: while the mountain's edge and abandoned instruments are evocative, they do not pressure a choice as directly as the glass does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in solitary observation after personal loss—is signaled early and tightens through the lantern-glass revelation, which reframes Kael's self-perception from broken to beautifully flawed. One clear deepening occurs when he realizes "cracks let the light through," a micro turn that narrows his self-judgment and opens a path to singing at dawn. Agency is present as endurance and attention (continuing the vigil, teaching himself the meteor language), and the cost is visible in ongoing solitude and the station's marginality. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; a second pressure point (a threatened interruption or resource limit) would have lifted the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the yellow glass's imperfections and Kael's ritual: vulnerability and witness as sources of meaning, solitude as connection to cosmic rhythms. The story resists a stated moral; the final observation ("watching—truly seeing—transforms the watcher") borders on thematic statement but is framed as a chart note rather than authorial pronouncement, and the singing finale offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The "flourishing stillness" concept integrates well, charging the abandoned station and Kael's renunciation of bustling certainty. Minor slip: "cracks let the light through" is a Leonard Cohen echo that, while apt, lacks full transformation into story-specific particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (spiritual curiosity, empathy with meteors, attention to imperfections). Diction is elevated but consistently voice-motivated ("cathedral of shadow and light," "primal elegance"), and the prose modulates with emotional intensity—compressed syntax during the meteor shower, expansive sentences at the dawn realization. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. One minor register slip: "flourishing stillness" and "motivation to find strength in vulnerability" read slightly prompt-adjacent in the backstory paragraph, but the surrounding specificity (yellow glass, trapped bubbles, charcoal tracings) anchors the voice and prevents broader contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening period ("perched… like a forgotten prayer") sets a lyric cadence sustained through the piece. Information density is high: the lantern glass does triple duty (tool, motif, thematic vehicle). Two template-cadence artifacts appear in the backstory paragraph ("He'd thought himself broken… he'd discovered something unexpected" adjacent to "His motivation… wasn't about healing… it was about recognizing"), a minor −0.3 penalty. The final image ("carrying its glow inside himself") borders on abstraction but is grounded enough by prior concrete handling of the lantern to avoid a larger deduction. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks; zero line-level opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor-as-spiritual-seeker frame is a fresh synthesis, and the yellow glass imperfections driving the epiphany is a specific, non-obvious turn. The Perseids as indifferent witnesses and Kael's empathic charting avoid stock lonely-astronomer tropes. Two deductions: the "cracks let the light through" conceit is a close echo of Leonard Cohen's "Anthem" without full transformation (−0.4), and the backstory paragraph ("a marriage ended, a career abandoned") reads template-familiar, reducing the piece's irreplaceability (−0.3). The piece commits fully to its premise and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight, preventing a steeper penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael ("cosmic janitor") is present throughout and his choice to continue the vigil, to empathize rather than merely record, and to sing at dawn constitute key turns. Setup clear (opening paragraph), middle development (lantern revelation), and closure participation (singing back, carrying the glow inside) all present. The final singing is a decision that alters his emotional stance with felt cost (ongoing solitude accepted). Two-beat involvement (nightly ritual, dawn realization) and causal pressure (his empathy enables the glass insight) lift the score. Swappability modest: another solitary role could replace "janitor" without breaking logic, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass is handled on-page in at least three beats: carried up stairs (setup), casting patterns during observation (middle), and extinguished/carried inside at dawn (closure). Its imperfections (trapped bubbles) drive the thematic turn ("flawed, it created beauty impossible for perfection") and constrain Kael's understanding. Early signal, causal pressure (the glass's flaws enable the epiphany), and closure linkage all present. Irreplaceability high: remove the glass and the story's logic collapses. Cap slightly below 8.5 because the middle beat ("patterns on his charts") could have been more tactilely dramatized to show the alignment moment rather than summarizing it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named once mid-story and frames the thematic synthesis (station abandoned yet alive, solitude as strength). It does not constrain a choice but reweights the dominant stake by naming the paradox Kael inhabits. Setup implicit (opening), middle development (named and explained), closure participation (dawn stillness as he sings). The concept operates more as thematic resonance than on-page tactic, keeping it in mid-band. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: the dawn tableau reactivates the stillness-as-flourishing frame with cost (he remains alone but transformed).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is attributed early ("Why had his ancestors built this place? What strength had they found…?") and enables his empathic ritual with meteors. The trait constrains his method (he asks questions rather than accepting rote measurement) and charges the final realization about imperfection. Setup clear, middle development (empathy action), closure participation (dawn insight). One visible tradeoff: his curiosity keeps him isolated from the loud, certain world beyond the mountain. Cap below 7.0 because the trait is more enabler than source of friction; a scene showing curiosity costing him something specific (a missed opportunity, a misunderstanding) would have lifted the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Empathize" (with falling stars) is the core action of Kael's ritual, signaled early ("he tried to empathize… to feel its ancient journey") and repeated in the meteor-charting beats. It enables the lantern-glass revelation (his attention to particulars lets him notice the bubbles' beauty) and shapes the ending (singing back to the birds is an empathic extension). Setup, middle development, and closure participation all clear. Two beats (meteor observation, dawn singing). Causal pressure: empathy drives the thematic turn. Cap at mid-7s because "empathize" could be swapped for "observe deeply" or "witness" with minor edits and the plot logic would hold.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is Kael's nightly method, signaled in the opening third ("his nightly ritual") and dramatized on-page with charcoal and paper during the Perseids. The means matters: hand-tracing (versus machines) embodies his shift from measurement to meaning. Setup clear, middle development (the tracing reveals lantern patterns), closure participation (final chart note). Two beats, causal pressure (the method enables the glass discovery), and specificity (charcoal, swift strokes) all present. Cap below 8.0 because the mechanics of tracing could be slightly more tactile—showing his hand moving in a specific arc that mirrors a meteor's descent would have elevated irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tracking station is anchored early (copper dome, spiral stairs, abandoned instruments) and supplies resources (desk, lantern, charts) that enable Kael's ritual. Micro-setting (the observation desk, the glass lantern) constrains his method and charges the final image (he descends the stairs carrying the glow inside). Setup, middle development (station as temple of forgotten wonder), and closure participation (dawn departure) all present. Two beats (nightly vigil, dawn realization). The station's abandonment pressures Kael's solitude choice with social cost (he is the last keeper). Cap at mid-7s because the station could be replaced with another isolated observatory without breaking logic; the yellow glass is more irreplaceable than the location itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" is named in the opening and frames the station's abandonment (humanity turned inward, stars forgotten). It does not tighten a decision or track elapsed time within the night's scene. The era provides atmospheric context and charges the thematic stakes (Kael's vigil is countercultural), but it remains vague—no live clock, no urgent deadline. Setup clear, middle development absent (the era does not alter tactics mid-scene), closure participation weak (dawn arrives but era-scale time does not crystallize a choice). Lyric-resonance partial: the "overlooked era" reappears implicitly in the final image (Kael as lone witness), but without cost legible at that moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is named in the backstory paragraph and dramatized through Kael's realization that "cracks let the light through." The motivation is conflicted (he chose exile as penance but discovers it as path), and the glass epiphany is the pivot. Setup implicit (opening solitude), middle development (lantern revelation), closure participation (singing at dawn embodies the shift). One friction: the motivation is more told ("His motivation to find strength in vulnerability wasn't about healing…") than shown through a specific on-page choice where vulnerability costs him something and he chooses it anyway. The dawn singing is close but feels more like arrival than active trade-off, capping the score at 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is attributed to Kael's movements ("his body swaying with each mark he made, as though he were dancing with the sky") and modulates with pressure (compressed syntax during the meteor shower, expansive rhythm at dawn). Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (the birdsong exchange, the glow carried inside). Setup clear (opening cathedral imagery), middle development (dance-like tracing), closure participation (quiet singing). The tone supports the "flourishing stillness" concept without jarring shifts. Cap below 7.0 because "primal elegance" is named once as a descriptor rather than proven through sustained rhythmic control or a tonal shift that reweights the stake; the piece is elegiac throughout, with no primal rawness under peak pressure.</comment>
