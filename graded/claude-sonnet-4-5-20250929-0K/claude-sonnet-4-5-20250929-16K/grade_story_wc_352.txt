<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celene's prism-minded trait is introduced purposefully and her motivation to plant the seeds is established early. However, the core agency moment—planting the seeds—reads as a foregone conclusion rather than a fraught choice with visible internal contradiction. The "prism-minded" descriptor remains largely a label; we don't see her holding multiple interpretations simultaneously during a pressured decision. Interiority leans toward exposition ("she'd been searching for three years") rather than embodied conflict in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph (archivist, archive vault, then grotto). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the serpentine path, threshold effects, and inversion-hour mechanics layer to reweight the central question of preservation. Closure occurs on-page (planting the seeds in the hidden chamber) with felt cost: she leaves but the vigilance will remain, a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses her personal guardianship. One meaningful deepening—the discovery of the masters' prior planting—shifts her act from founding to renewal, charging the final image. The cost is legible but understated; we feel the passage of knowledge more than personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's serpentine passages and the inversion-hour mechanic actively constrain Celene's route and timing. The hidden chamber revealed by rising sediment depends on the inverted gravity, and the doodle's marginal luminescence functions as a micro-object that charges the final connection. Sensory detail (mist, floating stone tears, glowing walls) is selective and filtered through urgency. The environment shapes the closure beat—sediment rising to expose the second opening—meeting the 9+ gate test for setting constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the forgotten combination to plant seeds of vigilance—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inversion reveals the hidden chamber, narrowing her options to this precise moment and place. Agency is present but muted: Celene's discovery and planting feel procedural rather than a trade-off with visible friction. The cost is conceptual (she will leave, the seeds will remain) but lacks a dramatized forfeit or complication that tests her commitment. Escalation reads as revelation rather than pressure that forces a hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus forgetting emerges through the seeds, the dying archive, and the masters' prior planting. The final image—pressing seeds into stone-become-soil—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: vigilance blooms through renewal, not founding. Subtext operates in the serpentine path (knowledge as coiled, hidden) and the inversion-hour (perception depends on state). The piece resists overt moralizing; the closure reweights the premise (she is continuing, not originating) without stating a thesis. No thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; Celene's perceptual signature (prism-minded, archive-trained) colors the narration with specificity like "clandestinely luminous" and "threshold effects." Distance is controlled, though a few filter verbs ("she reminded herself") momentarily dull immediacy. Voice modulates under pressure—short clauses during the inversion, longer syntax in reflective beats. One mild register drift: "botanical consciousness" reads slightly elevated for a crisis moment. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought and tense remain consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each line advances setting, stake, or action). Minor loop: "She'd explored it once before, mapping its turns by lamplight, finding nothing" restates the prior failure without added pressure. A few stock phrases ("echo of her own breath," "hair drifted like seaweed") lean generic. Sentence openings vary; clarity is strong. The closure beat is clean—no artifacts touch the planting moment. Figurative language (serpentine, intestines, spider silk) is purposeful but occasionally clusters without payoff. Overall propulsion is steady with minor scaffold in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of inverted gravity, threshold effects, and marginal doodles offers a fresh synthesis. The twist—that the masters already planted seeds—reweights Celene's mission from founding to renewal, a non-obvious turn earned in hindsight. However, the emotional arc (lone archivist seeks lost knowledge) follows a familiar template, and the final planting reads procedural rather than risky. The piece commits fully to its premise but doesn't take bold structural or perspectival risks. Specificity (limestone grotto, luminescent ink) anchors universals without feeling derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Celene is present throughout and her archive expertise enables interpretation of the doodle and grotto symbols. Her choice to go during the inversion hour drives the plot. However, her prism-minded trait remains mostly label; we don't see her parse multiple interpretations in a pressured moment. The planting decision at closure is a fulfillment of prior intent, not a turn that alters tactics. Two beats (doodle discovery, chamber entry) involve her choices. Swappability is moderate; a different archivist type could achieve the same with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The doodle appears in beat one (discovery), beat two (she carries it in the satchel), and is referenced in the final chamber when she recognizes the symbol match. Its serpentine path defines her route, shaping two key moves (grotto navigation, threshold identification). The doodle's clandestine luminescence mirrors the chamber's glow, creating a reprise that reweights meaning at closure. Removing it would break the causal chain. Slight friction: the doodle is described more than handled after the opening.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The seeds are signaled early (she carries them in the satchel), shape her motivation throughout, and are planted in the closure beat. Their purpose—botanical consciousness to preserve memory—defines the dominant stake. However, the planting itself reads as execution of a plan rather than a choice with friction or visible cost. The concept alters options (she must find the right place/time) but doesn't create on-page tactical trade-offs. Closure participation is strong; beat involvement is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The clandestinely luminous trait describes the doodle's ink and the chamber's walls. It enables her to see the path and recognize the match, affecting two beats. However, the trait is largely decorative—a marker rather than a constraint. No visible cost or trade-off tied to luminescence; she could have discovered the path through other means (e.g., magnification, heat). Present by setup, touches two beats, but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reentering the chamber is the major structural turn: she enters a space "she'd been in without seeing," unlocking the hidden layer. This action depends on the inversion and threshold mechanics, making it specific to the established rules. The reentry reveals the masters' prior planting, redefining her mission from founding to renewal—a key escalation that charges closure. Appears late (final third) but transforms prior material decisively. Removing "reenter" would collapse the discovery logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Threshold effects are signaled early ("transitions between states") and shape her navigation (cave mouth to chamber, dry to water-filled, narrow to vast). She pauses at each marked threshold to "feel for the change," a specific tactic. The mechanic enables the hidden chamber discovery—a floor opening becomes visible only through the inversion threshold. Three beats involve the method; it's causally necessary. Slight friction: the mechanics remain abstract ("shift that indicated something more") rather than tactile cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto is introduced early and revisited during the inversion. Its serpentine passages mirror the doodle's path, creating thematic coherence. The limestone and sediment mechanics are essential: rising sediment reveals the hidden opening, directly enabling closure. The grotto constrains her timing (must arrive before inversion) and her route (follows the coils). Setting provides the resources (threshold spaces, inverted floor) that alter the outcome. Removing the grotto would break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inversion hour is signaled early and creates urgency: she must plant during the sixty-minute window. The mechanic tightens decisions (she grips the entrance, pulls herself through passages) and alters perception (sediment rises, hidden chamber visible). Time is tracked through her physical sensations (lightness in bones, gravity return mentioned at closure). The hour-long limit shapes tactics and enables the discovery. Slight friction: the exact passage of minutes within the hour is not dramatized, so the clock's pressure is more conceptual than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation—to find forgotten combinations—is stated early and drives every beat (manuscript study, grotto exploration, seed-carrying). It's dramatized through her three-year search and the closure planting. However, friction is minimal; we don't see competing wants (e.g., personal safety vs. duty, doubt vs. conviction) tested on the page. The motivation is consistent but not conflicted. Two beats (doodle discovery, planting) directly express this desire. Closure participation is strong, but the lack of visible cost or competing impulse keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Latent blaze appears explicitly in one line ("the grotto hummed with latent blaze, power sleeping but not dead"). The phrase captures dormant power awaiting activation, fitting the seeds' purpose. Tone modulates slightly—quiet study in the archive, urgency during inversion—but "latent blaze" as a sustained tonal quality is underdeveloped. The image charges the closure beat (power remembered back to life) but doesn't recur or modulate across earlier beats. Present at closure with thematic coherence, but more illustrative than structural.</comment>
