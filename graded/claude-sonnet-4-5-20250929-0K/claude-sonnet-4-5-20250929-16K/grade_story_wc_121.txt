<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and specific, especially in the realization that "she was the one darkening" rather than the viaduct. The motivation to find "the version of herself that made sense" drives her choices, and the final choice to stop retracing feels earned by the tablet's message and her accumulated exhaustion. However, the embodied emotion remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "hope corroding" lean toward metaphor rather than visceral sensation—and the peak beat where she "let herself fall upward" lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Maya's repeated visits build density until the pattern breaks with her realization that the labyrinth has no center. Orientation anchors (inverted Maya on viaduct, tablet in hand, post-storm) arrive immediately. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—she shifts from "lost inside it" to "she was it"—with visible cost (she stops searching for a perfect self). The causality holds under the accumulative lens, though the tablet's sudden new message ("The labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited") feels slightly convenient rather than emerging from prior pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain is vivid and specific, with the inverted gravity creating memorable spatial pressure. The setting actively constrains choice: it appears only every forty-three days, exists "between the drop and the ripple," and its periodic manifestation shapes Maya's tactics. The final image of Maya touching "real ground" and walking through "ordinary rain" charges the closure by contrasting the viaduct's impossible physics. Sensory detail is purposeful—"rainwater dripping upward," "phosphorescence"—and filtered through Maya's exhausted perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the version of herself that makes sense—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes "there was no perfect Maya hidden in the procedural depths," which narrows her options from infinite search to acceptance. The cost is legible: she relinquishes the search and accepts her fractured nature. However, the escalation relies heavily on accumulative exhaustion rather than a sequence of tactical narrowing choices, and the agency at closure (letting herself fall) reads more as surrender than active decision, which fits the lens but limits the pressure band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—that selfhood is infinite recursion without a perfect center—emerges organically from the procedural timeline device and Maya's failed search. The tablet's late message articulates the theme explicitly ("The labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited"), which borders on thematic echo but is presented as in-world rune translation rather than authorial commentary. The final image of Maya being both lost and the labyrinth itself offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The "darkening brightness" motif effectively reweights from external mystery to internal corrosion without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The POV remains stable third-person limited, with Maya's perceptual signature consistent: she notices timelines, gravitational states, and glowing runes. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "periodically eternal" and "fractured selves" fitting the conceptual register. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure—shorter clauses as realization hits ("No—that wasn't right"). However, some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("recursion with no base case") that feels slightly authorial rather than character-bound, and the rhythm occasionally flattens into declarative sameness during the middle reflection block.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is generally high, with most sentences doing double work (setting + interiority, or timeline example + thematic weight). However, the story carries noticeable paraphrase loops: "The viaduct manifested every forty-three days, always after rain" repeats information already established, and the phrase "periodically eternal" recurs without functional variance. The middle section summarizing Timelines 847 and 2,193 uses template cadence ("In Timeline X, she had..."). Some filter-verb stacking ("felt all the fractured timelines pulse") and stock metaphors ("truth crystallized like ice forming on glass") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template cadence (−0.5), and filter-verb stack penalties totals roughly −0.9, landing the score here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—a tablet generating infinite procedural timelines of alternate selves—offers a fresh synthesis of multiverse tropes and self-knowledge quest. The gravity-defying viaduct and "between the drop and the ripple" timeframe are specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (obsessive search → acceptance of fragmentation) follows a familiar template, and the closing realization that "the labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited" echoes well-worn wisdom about self-acceptance. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safety-hedging, but the transformation test is borderline: with different nouns (mirror, door, map) the arc would remain largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's gravity-defying ability is present throughout (inverted stance, walking on vertical beams, falling upward) and shapes the viaduct's physical logic. It enables her access to the timelines and appears in the closure image when she "let herself fall upward." However, the trait functions more as setting texture than as a choice-driver—she never faces a decision where defying gravity creates a trade-off or cost. The ability is intrinsic to the viaduct's manifestation rather than a skill she must choose to deploy under pressure. Present in setup, middle description, and closure image (three touches), but the causal pressure is light: it enables access but doesn't narrow options or create a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tablet appears in the opening image (Maya holds it, runes glow), returns functionally in the middle (she presses her palm, feels timelines pulse, reads new runes), and appears in the closure (she clutches it while falling, it "grew quiet"). It drives the core mechanic—generating infinite timelines—and the new rune message ("The labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited") precipitates her final shift. However, the tablet's properties are mostly static; Maya handles it but doesn't manipulate or struggle with it under pressure. The late rune message feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior interaction. Three distinct beats, clear closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape the entire premise and appear in every major beat: the procedural generation, Maya's retracing across visits, the examples of Timelines 847 and 2,193, and her final realization that "all the fractured timelines pulse simultaneously." The concept directly constrains her goal (finding the right timeline) and the closure realization (no center exists). However, the timelines remain largely abstract—we see summaries rather than on-page crossings—and Maya's interaction with them is passive observation rather than tactical choice within a timeline. The concept shapes stakes more than it alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears as a descriptor for the viaduct's temporal state ("this periodically eternal moment") and recurs in the closing paragraph ("periodically eternal"). The phrase carries thematic weight—the cycle repeats every forty-three days, infinite yet recurring—but functions primarily as label and motif rather than as a constraint that forces a choice with cost. The periodic nature (forty-three-day cycle) does shape Maya's access and her knowledge that she will return, but the "eternal" half remains metaphorical. Present in setup and closure, modest thematic charge, but no visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Retracing is the story's engine: Maya has been "retracing them for years now," appearing every forty-three days to review timelines. The action drives her exhaustion and frames the central question (which self to find). The major turn—her realization that retracing is futile—inverts the action's premise. However, most of the retracing occurs off-page in prior visits; on-page we see only summary (Timelines 847, 2,193) rather than a live retracing beat with tactical friction. The closure moment is less about retracing than about stopping it ("next time, she suspected, she wouldn't need to retrace anything at all"). Present across all three zones, drives the turn, but the on-page dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Procedural generation is named explicitly ("it generated infinite timelines procedurally") and explains the tablet's mechanism—every possible Maya exists in its calculations. The concept justifies the infinite scope and the exhaustiveness of her search. However, the mechanics never matter tactically on the page: Maya doesn't manipulate the generation parameters, trigger a new seed, or face a choice about how to navigate the procedural system. It remains background explanation rather than a method that shapes attempts. Signaled in the first third, thematically relevant, but swappable with "infinite catalog" or "omniscient archive" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The viaduct is present in every beat: opening image, Maya walking its beams, its glow fading, and the final disappearance. It supplies the impossible gravity that enables her retracing and appears only after rain every forty-three days, creating a time constraint. The viaduct's glow initially seems to dim, then Maya realizes "she was the one darkening"—a micro-turn that reweights the setting's meaning. In the closure, the viaduct's disappearance forces her return to ordinary ground, and the promise "In forty-three days, she would return" ties future tactics to its periodic manifestation. Early anchor, multiple beats, closure participation, clear causal and symbolic work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" frames the viaduct's temporal window and recurs in the closing paragraph ("Between the drop and the ripple, between timeline and timeline"). The phrase establishes an impossible frozen instant that justifies the setting's physics. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions on the page—Maya isn't racing against the ripple or the drop—and no live clock alters her moves. The forty-three-day cycle provides pacing context but operates in backstory. The timeframe functions more as lyric motif and world rule than as active pressure. Present in setup and charged reprise at closure, thematic contribution, but tactical impact is modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to conquer the labyrinth of self—is named explicitly ("She needed to conquer the labyrinth of self") and dramatized through her years-long search across timelines. It drives every choice: her appearance at the viaduct, her review of Timelines 847 and 2,193, and the final shift when she realizes "The labyrinth is not conquered but inhabited." The closure directly addresses and transforms the motivation—she stops seeking conquest and accepts inhabitation. Friction between want (find the right self) and cost (endless exhaustion) is visible. However, the phrasing "conquer the labyrinth of self" skews slightly abstract and prompt-like; more embodied interior stakes would deepen this further.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Darkening brightness operates throughout: the viaduct's glow "seemed bright but somehow made the darkness around it more profound," then Maya realizes "she was the one darkening" while the viaduct remains constant. The tone modulates from wonder (opening inversion, glowing runes) to exhaustion (hope corroding) to quiet acceptance (touching real ground, ordinary rain). The final image—"complete and fractured, bright and darkening, periodically eternal"—explicitly charges the tone contrast. The tonal arc mirrors the thematic shift from seeking light to accepting shadow. Present across all beats, coherent through turns, and the oxymoron charges the final image without becoming static.</comment>
