<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's shifting personas are embodied through physical detail ("Prague engraver" precision, "Parisian lilt") and drive the central pressure—his fear that his own feelings are "incomplete." The confession to Mira ("Yes...I suspect mine is incomplete") lands with genuine vulnerability. However, the borrowed personalities function more as atmospheric texture than on-page constraint; we never see him forced to choose between a persona and his own impulse with visible cost. Mira remains observational rather than a secondary pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal beats. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (letterpress operator, topaz workshop, vanishing stars). The piece escalates through because/therefore linkage: halo fragment → printed page → Mira feels transposed empathy → he sets type "with his own uncertain hands." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes his shift from borrowed to owned agency under time pressure, and the cost—"before there's nothing left to feel about"—is undeniable. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The topaz glow and "unraveling heavens" are vivid and purposeful. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting object: it's handled with tweezers, placed on the press bed, shatters under pressure, and its luminescence flows into ink—each beat constrains the operator's method and charges the closure. Spatial choreography (slate table, press lever, doorframe) remains clear. The vanishing stars operate as both atmosphere and ticking clock, reweighting every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode emotion's mathematics before stars vanish—is signaled early and tightens throughout. The operator's agency (placing the fragment, pulling the lever, setting new type) drives each beat. The fragment's shattering is a visible, irreversible cost that enables the breakthrough: Mira feels transposed empathy. The final choice to work "with his own uncertain hands" forecloses reliance on borrowed personas, and the time constraint ("Before there's nothing left to feel about") charges the ending with undeniable urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—whether emotion can be decoded, whether the self is solvable—emerges through concrete action (fragment into press, luminescent page) rather than statement. The operator's confession that he borrows personalities because his own "is incomplete" earns the thematic question without platitude. The ending resists neat resolution: he begins "the next proof" with uncertain hands, embracing incompleteness as method. Mira's line "I feel what you feel" dramatizes transposed empathy as both breakthrough and intimate exposure. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material through stance shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. The operator's perceptual signature—"equations...existing, the way grief exists in a clenched jaw"—is distinct and voice-consistent. Dialogue ("You're doing it again") feels natural and advances pressure. However, register occasionally drifts: "transpose their emotional states" and "static of consciousness" read clinical against the prevailing lyric texture, especially under peak pressure. The shift from borrowed voices to "his own voice, unfamiliar and small" is purposeful and earns the final turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("Joy propagates at measurable speeds. Longing has half-lives"). One mixed metaphor: "shadow fracturing across his workspace" (shadows don't fracture) reduces clarity mid-beat. A paraphrase loop appears: "Emotion has structure...It follows laws" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the exposition block ("The stars are equations too. Each one a variable...") slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure the closure image. Information density is strong; lines multi-task without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress as vehicle for emotional mathematics, vanishing constellations as metaphysical countdown—feels specific and non-obvious. The halo fragment's dual reading (holy/technological) serves the premise rather than decorating it. Risk is present: the operator's borrowed-persona trait could collapse into quirk, but it's anchored to his fear of incompleteness and resolved through on-page choice. The piece commits fully to its lyric-philosophical register without retreating to mundane explanation. Transformation test passed: swap the press for another medium and the tactile stakes dissolve.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present early; drives two beats (examining fragment, pulling press lever) and the ending (sets type "with his own uncertain hands"). The cryptic trait (borrowed personas) is more atmospheric than mechanically decisive—we don't see it constrain a tactical choice with visible cost—but his final shift to working in his own voice forecloses reliance on others and charges the closure. Middle development present but modest; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("halo fragment, no larger than a thumbnail"); handled in three beats (tweezers inspection, placed on press, shatters under pressure). Its luminescence flowing into ink enables the transposed-empathy breakthrough—without the fragment, the page would not glow and Mira would not feel his emotion. The fragment's destruction is irreversible cost. Specific properties (translucent equations, borrowed luminescence) matter causally. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("transposed empathy, the heart of his research") and operationalized on-page: the printed page makes Mira feel the operator's loneliness and hope. The concept shapes stakes (decode emotion's structure) and tactics (print feeling into medium). It appears in the ending ("Emotion made transferable, readable, perhaps even solvable") with cost (urgency of vanishing stars). Two beats (research explanation, successful transfer) plus closure participation. Causal pressure evident.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (astronomer's precision, merchant's smile, Prague engraver, Parisian lilt). Constrains perception and voice but does not visibly alter a tactical choice with on-page tradeoff until the ending, when he abandons borrowed mannerisms to work "with his own uncertain hands"—a renunciation with felt cost. The trait charges the closure but remains more thematic accent than mechanical lever across middle beats. Setup and payoff present; middle development modest.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The operator disorients readers by selecting type "for weight and negative space" to "transpose their emotional states—make them feel his determination as their own doubt." This action is specific to his method and central to the transposed-empathy premise. It drives two beats (type-setting, printed page's effect on Mira) and underpins closure success. However, the disorientation itself is told rather than shown—we see Mira's reaction but not the reader surrogate's confusion. Strong causal role; moderate irreplaceability (could be rephrased as "confuse" with minor loss).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("the ambiguity was deliberate, necessary even") and operationalized through the halo fragment's dual nature (holy/technological) and the type selection for emotional transposition. The method shapes his research approach and the printed page's effect. However, "deliberate ambiguity" remains more conceptual principle than mechanical constraint—we don't see him choose ambiguity over clarity at cost. Present in two beats (fragment description, page creation) and implied at closure. Functional but not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced immediately ("topaz...amber walls catching starlight"). The workshop provides the press, slate table, and tools that enable the experiment. The "unraveling heavens" operate as visible countdown, tightening every choice. The setting's luminescence ("walls dimmed slightly" as another star vanishes) tracks cost on-page. The workshop constrains method (letterpress specific) and the vanishing stars impose urgency at closure ("Before there's nothing left to feel about"). Three beats (workspace choreography, star disappearance, final dimming) plus closure pressure. Strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("three months before the celestial mathematics collapsed entirely") and dramatized throughout: stars vanish on-page ("another star disappeared"), walls dim, and Mira's urgency ("Then hurry") charges the ending. The timeframe is not abstract—each star loss is witnessed and tightens the operator's window. The deadline shapes his decision to attempt the dangerous print now rather than refine further. Three beats (initial countdown, mid-scene star loss, Mira's plea) plus closure urgency. Strong causal pressure; irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("I'm trying to understand the mathematics") and dramatized through action: placing the fragment, pulling the lever, observing Mira's response. The motivation is conflicted—he wants to decode emotion because he fears his own is incomplete—and this friction drives the confession beat and final turn. The desire forces a costly choice (shattering the fragment) and shapes the ending (beginning "the next proof" despite uncertainty). Three beats (research explanation, fragment sacrifice, new attempt) with visible cost. Strong causal linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone—intellectually precise yet emotionally urgent—remains coherent through turns. Diction like "transposed empathy," "half-lives," "surgical precision" coexists with "fear sharp and geometric" and "sorrow mixed with understanding." Rhythm modulates: the confession beat slows ("his own voice, unfamiliar and small"), then accelerates at closure ("Before there's nothing left to feel about"). The final image ("his own uncertain hands") charges the turbulence with earned vulnerability. Tone shapes two beats (research explanation, confession) and the ending. Strong coherence; good pressure modulation.</comment>
