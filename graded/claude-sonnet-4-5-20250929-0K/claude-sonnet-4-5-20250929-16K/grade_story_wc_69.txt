<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is embodied through concrete gestures (tracing the rosette, arranging chairs) and her stance is consistent—"expectantly resigned" manifests in action. However, the students remain largely undifferentiated; Aisha and Thomas get names but no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The transformation is asserted ("they were hearing each other") rather than dramatized through a specific micro-choice that reveals internal conflict. The final cost—some students leaving—is mentioned but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (velvet library, autumn, Mira). The closure aims for Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the art passes forward), but the cost is abstract—"something ancient and essential had been passed forward" tells rather than showing a visible price. The weekly progression compresses causality into summary ("week after week"), flattening the escalation that should charge the ending. The final image gestures at cost but does not make it undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light are vividly rendered and consistently present across beats. Sensory details (frost on windows, leaves spiraling) are selective and mood-appropriate. The zither as micro-setting object constrains the teaching method and charges the final image when students hold it. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, meeting the constraint test for this band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching harmony across division) is signaled early, but escalation occurs off-page in summary ("week after week"). No on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; the "some students stopped coming" is mentioned, not dramatized. The method (subtracting noise) is applied once in the opening and once at closure without visible friction or cost in between. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; summary compression prevents it from landing with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (vanishing arts as metaphor for deep listening) is purposefully developed through the zither's rosette and the subtraction method. The final paragraph risks thematic echo ("The vanishing arts lived wherever someone chose to subtract the noise") but stops short of full sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant image (voices rising together, "distinct and necessary") but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it restates the premise. Subtext operates cleanly in the rosette's symbolic petals and the braiding metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately between Mira's reflection and scene action. Dialogue (Mira's instructions, the single exchange with Aisha and Thomas) is functional but brief, offering no subtext or character distinction. Perceptual signature is present in Mira's focus on sound and her "traveled stillness," but students' voices are not individuated. Under peak pressure (the final evening), diction remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and the prose is largely clean. Two issues lower the score: "denoting a principle" and "denoted belonging" recycle the stem from the required action, creating template cadence; "traveled stillness" appears three times (opening, middle, end) without evolving meaning, reading as ornamental repetition rather than charged motif. Information density is high in the opening third but thins in the summary middle. No paraphrase loops or major clarity issues, but the closure beat ("something ancient and essential had been passed forward") abstracts rather than concretizes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vanishing-art-as-social-harmony metaphor is a recognizable template (craft object teaching life lesson). The subtraction method and rosette symbolism are purposeful but not surprising. The story commits to its premise without bold structural risk; the weekly montage and tidy arc (division → tentative harmony) follow a median path. Specificity in sensory detail (velvet library, frost, zither) elevates texture, but the emotional arc is familiar and the ending restates rather than transforms the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira frames the story, teaches the method, and gestures students into harmony. Her choices (arranging chairs, playing the zither, instructing subtraction) enable beats but do not create reversals. She is present at closure, observing transformation rather than undergoing it. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate (enables rather than constrains). Swappable with another patient teacher archetype without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rosette appears in three beats: Mira traces it (setup), explains its petals (development), students hold it (payoff). Its symbolic function (each petal = a principle) is told rather than dramatized—no choice hinges on a specific petal's meaning. It charges the final image by association but does not reweight prior material or constrain action. Present across the arc but remains ornamental; removing it would not break story logic if replaced with another teaching tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" is the dominant stake and frames both the zither (grandfather's craft) and the harmony method. It shapes Mira's motivation and the thematic question. The concept appears early, recurs in the middle ("every vanishing art takes a piece of human connection"), and anchors the closure ("The vanishing arts lived wherever someone chose to subtract the noise"). It alters the framing of the students' task (they are learning an endangered skill), adding conceptual cost. Essential to the story's thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is named twice (paragraph 6 and near the end) and embodied in Mira's patient gestures. It constrains her approach—she offers tools, not guarantees—but does not force a visible tradeoff or cost. The trait is consistent but passive; it describes her baseline rather than complicating a choice. Setup and development present; payoff is thematic echo ("expectant resignation lifting into something lighter") rather than causal pressure. Functional but replaceable with "patient" or "steady."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Denote" appears twice: the rosette petals denote principles, hymns denote belonging. The action is metaphorical rather than physical and does not create a turn. It supports the vanishing-arts theme (symbols carry meaning) but is swappable with "signify" or "represent" without structural change. Present in setup and development; absent from closure. The action is thematic accent, not causal driver. Mid-band for coherent presence across beats but low causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subtraction method is introduced early ("Before we sing, we subtract"), dramatized in the listening exercise (students subtract external sounds), and returns at closure ("subtract everything but truth"). It shapes Mira's pedagogy and the students' transformation. The method is specific and irreplaceable—removing it would require rewriting the teaching approach and thematic spine. Strong setup, development (listening exercise), and payoff (final instruction). Causal pressure: the method enables the students' braiding and frames the vanishing-art metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is vividly established (burgundy curtains, oak table, tall windows) and remains spatially coherent. Autumn light and frost mark time. The setting provides atmosphere and continuity but does not constrain choices—the teaching could occur in any quiet room. It charges the final image through mood (velvet autumn air) but does not alter tactics. Setup and payoff present; development is atmospheric rather than causal. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears twice (opening and closure) as thematic frame. The timeframe spans autumn weeks but is compressed into summary ("week after week through that autumn"). No live clock that tightens decisions; the progression is asserted rather than dramatized. The phrase "unlearning hatred" labels the process but does not shape on-page tactics. Setup and payoff as theme; development is summary. Swappable with "across weeks of practice" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (to braid diverse voices into harmony) is stated early and drives her method (subtraction, listening exercises). It is tested when students stop coming but the friction is mentioned, not dramatized. The desire shapes the arc and is present at closure ("their voices rose together... creating harmony"). Setup, development (instruction beats), and payoff are met. Causal pressure is moderate—the motivation frames action but does not force a visible tradeoff. Removing it would flatten Mira's role but the teaching structure could remain.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears three times (Mira's movements, dusk leaves, end of autumn) as a tonal anchor. It modulates slightly (from resigned patience to "lifting into something lighter") but remains static across pressure beats. The tone is coherent and purposeful, charging the final image with quiet resonance. Setup and payoff present; development is repetition rather than evolution. The phrase is distinctive but swappable with "patient calm" or "quiet resolve" without breaking closure.</comment>
