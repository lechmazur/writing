<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is present—grief and guilt transformed into her restoration project—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to tattoo herself with amber-dust ink is dramatized, but the insight that she's "been speaking to ourselves all along" arrives as an epiphany rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting in scene. The piece withholds key facts (her mother kept her, raised her) solely to manufacture the late reveal, and the protagonist's agency at closure is more receptive than active.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (laboratory, Mira, translation device acting strangely). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—letters, firmware messages, and amber converge to reweight Mira's relationship to her past—and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she stops running, rests among the voices). Cost is implied through the sacrifice of the amber pendant and the easing of lifelong dissonance, but the final image is more atmospheric than materially consequential. The late reveal that her mother kept her undermines prior causality; the firmware and letters function more as oracular devices than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and purposeful, filtering detail through Mira's professional lens (obsolete recording equipment, temporal sensors, firmware). The amber pendant constrains the final choice—she opens it, uses the firefly dust in her tattoo ink—charging the closure image with materiality. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single location, and sensory details (meteor hush, nebulae-colored ink) are selective and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of guilt—is signaled early and accumulates through the firmware messages and discovered letters. Pressure tightens when Mira inserts the amber into the device and hears her own infant cry, prompting the tattoo decision. However, the firmware and letters deliver answers rather than complications; Mira's agency is primarily interpretive. The cost at closure (opening the pendant, easing dissonance) is felt but not a visible trade-off that forecloses a tangible path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—guilt, translation, and self-forgiveness across time—emerges through particulars (constellation tattoos, baby-cry device, amber firefly) without overt moralizing. The final image of the empty pendant and the sentence "forgiveness sounds like silence after the echo finally fades" offers a resonant answer to the central question. However, the letters function as thematic exposition ("you can tether what was lost to what is found"), and the protagonist articulates the theme in near-prompt language ("untranslatable, untetherable") in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's metaphors draw from stars, frequencies, and lab equipment ("ink the color of nebulae," "meteor hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. The letters' matching handwriting and impossible dates are legible as a temporal fold device. However, the late reveal that her mother kept her withholds knowledge Mira would possess, and elevated phrasing occasionally drifts from the immediate pressure ("some stories complete themselves only when time folds in on itself").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("memories the way amber holds ancient insects," "temporal sensors flickered") and occasionally stacks without progression. The phrase "meteor hush of 2 a.m." recurs without reweighting. Paraphrase loops appear: "untranslatable, untetherable" and "dissonance… harmonize what cannot be changed" restate the same idea adjacently. Rhythm varies and information density is high, but filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she understood," "she had never questioned"). The final paragraph elevates into thesis-like phrasing that abstracts the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, and time-folding letters is conceptually ambitious and specific to this voice. However, the temporal-fold premise and self-addressed letters from the future echo familiar speculative-fiction templates without transformation through lived consequence. The firmware and letters function more as oracular conveniences than constraints Mira must work around. Emotional truth in the guilt-and-forgiveness arc is present but abstracted by metaphor rather than grounded in a single irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Constellation tattooist is present throughout (backstory, lab work, final tattoo) and shapes Mira's perceptual signature. The final tattoo—using amber dust to map time folding—is a key on-page choice that alters her stance. However, the trait is more thematic accent than tactical necessity; the story would function with minor edits if Mira were a different kind of artist. Two beats (backstory reference, closure tattoo), early signal, closure participation, but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Amber pendant with firefly appears early (mother's gift, worn always), returns at midpoint (understanding its promise), and is physically opened and dissolved into tattoo ink at closure. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (she must sacrifice it to complete the tattoo), closure linkage, and specificity (the firefly's preserved light encodes the story's theme). Cost is tied to the element: the pendant is destroyed to enable the final act. Irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is seeded early (firmware acting strangely, phantom translations) and drives the midpoint discovery (inserting amber, hearing her own cry). It appears in three beats and constrains Mira's investigation. However, it functions more as an oracle delivering answers than a tactical problem; the story could substitute another supernatural device (haunted recording, time-crystal monitor) with minimal structural change. Present across beats, but moderate swappability lowers integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Translates baby cries is established early (device designed for that purpose) and thematically linked to Mira's mother hearing "only noise." The firmware's phantom message echoes a baby's need to be tethered. However, the translation function is not used tactically on the page; Mira does not attempt to translate a cry or make a choice contingent on translation. Label-only presence; ornamental thematic echo without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tether appears in the firmware's message ("Mother, tether me"), the letters ("tether what was lost to what is found"), Mira's self-description ("attempting to tether [voices] back to the living world"), and the final understanding. Four mentions across setup, middle, and closure. The concept reweights the ending—Mira stops trying to tether the lost and instead tethers herself to acceptance. However, the action itself is metaphorical rather than a physical constraint; swappable with "anchor" or "bind" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Handwritten letters in mahogany desk appear early (estate sale, hidden drawer) and recur at midpoint (new letter appears, ink still wet). Two beats, early signal, and closure relevance (letters stop appearing after the tattoo). The method shapes Mira's arc—she discovers her future self's guidance—but the mechanics are convenient (letters appear when needed) rather than constraining. Functional but the story could substitute a different supernatural communication (voice recordings, device logs) with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Laboratory of lost sounds is anchored early, filters all perception, supplies the tools (translation device, temporal sensors, obsolete equipment) that enable the plot, and charges the final image ("not a tomb but a temple"). Setting constrains Mira's choices—she works alone there, the device is present, the amber port exists—and the ending reweights the space's meaning. Three beats, causal pressure, closure participation, and specificity. Removing the lab would require fundamental restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Time folding is signaled early (firmware acting strangely "three weeks ago"), explicitly named at midpoint ("time was folding again"), and encoded in the final tattoo (constellation showing "time folding"). The letters' impossible dates and Mira's realization that she's speaking to herself depend on temporal recursion. Three beats, early signal, closure linkage. However, the timeframe functions more as a conceptual rule than a tactical clock; no on-page choice is pressured by a ticking countdown or narrowing window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hushing dissonance of guilt is named explicitly ("the dissonance that had lived in her chest since childhood"), dramatized in Mira's lab work (collecting lost sounds to find her infant self's cry), tested at midpoint (hearing her own cry, understanding the guilt is her mother's), and resolved at closure (dissonance eases, she rests). The desire drives all three acts and the final tattoo choice. However, the motivation is stated more often than shown through conflicting micro-choices; Mira's want versus fear is told rather than embodied in contradictory action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Meteor hush is seeded early ("meteor hush of 2 a.m."), recurs at closure ("meteor hush of that eternal moment"), and modulates through the arc—quiet becomes charged as pressure accumulates, then returns as restful silence. The tone is coherent, supports the Accumulative lens, and charges the final image without contradiction. Diction and rhythm sustain the hushed, studious atmosphere even under emotional pressure. Purposeful reprise that reweights the dominant stake; tone constrains voice and pacing throughout.</comment>
