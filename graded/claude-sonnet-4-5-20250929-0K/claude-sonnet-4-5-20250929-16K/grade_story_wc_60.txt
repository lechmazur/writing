<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's trait of "realistic imagination" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her action at the fountain is guided more by magical mechanics than internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The label "luminous skeptic" and her doubt are asserted but never tested against a competing impulse in the closure beat. Embodied emotion is minimal; the phosphorescence functions as metaphor without physical consequence that shapes her tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure delivers a Decisive Change—trapped emotions return, fountains flow, Mara's glow fades—with visible consequence. The causal chain from breadcrumbs to constellation map to box-opening is legible under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors appear early (city, dawn, fountains). However, the geese pause as inciting mechanism remains abstract; the box's time-lock and Mara's specific role ("bridge the frozen moment") arrive late without prior setup, weakening the earn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fountains anchor space throughout and the constellation map constrains the final choice, satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, the "oldest quarter" and "Fountain of Sidereal Patience" appear abruptly in the second half without spatial build-up. The stained glass box "exists slightly outside normal time" via assertion rather than tactile discovery, reducing embodied interaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when Mara places the shards. One meaningful escalation occurs (box opens, emotions pour out). The ending forecloses Mara's luminous role with visible cost (glow fades, "no longer needed"). Yet the escalation is driven by puzzle-solving rather than protagonist agency under competing pressures; the box's mechanics do the work, and no live choice tests commitment or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as feeling, not fact—emerges through particulars (weddings without joy, funerals without grief) and the final image of water and memory flowing reinforces it without sermonizing. The geese pause as metaphor for frozen time accumulates resonance. "Sidereal patience" operates thematically but also literally shapes the protagonist's method. However, "patient, imaginative understanding" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "luminous skeptic," "skeptical smile," poetic diction ("defiant hush," "rotation of spheres"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Free indirect style is clean. The prose carries a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm. Minor register drift: "realistic imagination, the ability to envision the impossible while maintaining the rigor of the real" reads as authorial definition rather than Mara's idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Figurative language is purposeful ("stone basins collecting only leaves," "emotions swirled around her"). Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolution. However, runs of template cadence appear: "She found... Then another... and another"; "They remembered weddings but not joy, funerals but not grief" is elegant parallelism but borders paraphrase. "The memories hadn't vanished; Mara suspected they'd been collected" restates across adjacent clauses. Baseline −0.6 for patterned loops across three instances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of trapped emotions with stalled geese and dry fountains offers a fresh metaphysical conceit. "Sidereal patience" as both method and theme is specific. The protagonist's luminescence as beacon rather than curse inverts expectation. However, the core arc—magical puzzle solved by following breadcrumbs to unlock a trapped-memory box—leans on familiar fantasy mechanics. The ending's restoration (fountains sing, geese return, glow fades) resolves neatly without lingering ambiguity or cost that complicates closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara ("luminous skeptic") drives all beats: follows breadcrumbs, places shards, opens box, releases emotions. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Her skepticism is asserted but not tested through conflicting choice; her "realistic imagination" enables the solution but without visible cost or tradeoff. The character is essential to plot but not irreplaceable in terms of specific internal friction shaping the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears mid-story, wedged in the fountain. Mara interacts with it twice: first touch fails (time-locked), second succeeds (opens, releases emotions). It is the closure mechanism. However, it does not create the problem it solves; it is discovered late and resolved immediately without prior complication. Strong closure linkage and causal role lift it above 7.0, but late introduction and single-use arc cap it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is named and explained: constellations aligning over a century, motions measured in rotation of spheres. Mara works "with the deliberate slowness that celestial bodies teach." The concept shapes her method (placing shards slowly) and contrasts the city's rush. It appears in setup (fountain name), middle (Mara's method), and thematically at closure. However, it does not narrow a choice or impose cost; it describes tempo rather than constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Realistic imagination, the ability to envision the impossible while maintaining the rigor of the real" is explained mid-story. Mara uses it to understand the box ("didn't trap memories through force but through forgetting the act of release"). This insight enables the solution. However, the trait is told rather than demonstrated through a specific on-page tradeoff or cost; it functions as label for problem-solving competence rather than a constrained capability with visible downside.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unstick" is the story's verb and stakes: emotions "stuck" in crystal, box "stuck between moments," geese paused mid-migration. Mara "unsticks each feeling from its crystal prison." The action defines the climax and is irreplaceable; no synonym captures the mechanical and metaphorical work. Present in setup (geese pause), middle (time-lock), and closure (releasing emotions). Strong causal role and specificity, but the action is singular (one unsticking event) rather than iterative across beats with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Breadcrumbs (glass shards) appear early: first in Fountain of Lost Daughters, then two more fountains, leading Mara to the oldest quarter. The method is signaled and motivates movement across three beats. The shards reappear as keys (placed on constellation stars), directly enabling closure. The method shapes plot structure and is irreplaceable. However, the shards' dual function (trail + key) is revealed late without prior hint, reducing earn slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is present in every beat: dry basins, vendors, specific named fountains (Lost Daughters, Weeping Merchant, Plague Memorial, Sidereal Patience), constellation map, and flowing water at closure. The setting supplies the constraint (breadcrumbs in fountains) and the mechanism (constellation map as key). Spatial choreography is clear. The fountains' return to function is the closure image. Indispensable; story logic collapses without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The geese pause is the inciting event ("that pause had changed something fundamental") and bookends the story (geese return north at closure). The timeframe anchors causality: memories trapped since the pause, released when the pause ends. However, the geese function more as metaphor than active timer; no ticking urgency narrows Mara's choices mid-scene. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance but minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liberating trapped memories is Mara's stated goal from early: "suspected they'd been collected, trapped somewhere." The quest structures all action. At closure she releases the emotions with "gentle gestures." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through competing desires or friction; Mara never weighs a cost of liberating versus keeping them trapped, nor does she face temptation or obstacle that tests commitment. Functional but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is named explicitly: "This was not the silence of surrender but of resistance—the quiet of those who refuse to forget they've forgotten." The tone permeates: dry fountains, phosphorescent glow, vendors crossing themselves, "skeptical smile," water beginning to flow quietly. Atmospheric consistency is high. The tone modulates purposefully (dawn quiet → active solving → fountains singing) and charges the closure image (water and memory flowing, geese honking "loud with joy"). Strong coherence and payoff.</comment>
