<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is present and generally specific, with embodied moments like "cutting through the night" and the building desire to understand. However, the arc from comfortable curiosity to confrontation feels under-motivated; the narrator accepts Dr. Khoury's immortality claim with minimal dramatized resistance or internal contradiction. The final "Teach me" pivot arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path—no depicted struggle between skepticism and belief that would charge the choice. Minor: "agreed upon lies" as a phrase reads slightly meta rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the rooftop revelation crystallizes the narrator's stance, and the final image of teaching ancient alphabets under meteors reweights the Thursday-tea pattern. Closure participation is clean. Causality holds across the flashback structure (sugar → tea → lessons → rooftop confrontation). One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator pushes past the "agreed upon lies" boundary. Cost is somewhat implied rather than viscerally felt on the page—no depicted sacrifice or foreclosed option at the ending beat itself, though the transformation is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower anchor the confrontation scene effectively; the bronze griffin catches meteor-light in a purposeful sensory moment. The "cluttered apartment where books towered like miniature skylines" provides strong spatial grounding for the middle. Micro-setting (the desk seal) recurs with tactile handling. Minor gap: the city "spreading below" remains generic—no specific brownstone or limestone detail filters through the narrator-architect's professional lens at the rooftop moment when that expertise would naturally sharpen perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings, which is also the narrator's desire to pierce the mystery of Dr. Khoury—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator interrogates her on the rooftop. The confrontation ("How old are you really?") is a clear escalation driven by accumulated inconsistencies. The resolution feels slightly convenient: Dr. Khoury's immediate, full confession and the narrator's instant acceptance ("Teach me") sidestep potential resistance or doubt that would have raised the emotional cost and sharpened the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of time, memory, and the speaking past emerges cleanly from the images (weathered keystones, the Byzantine seal, meteors as "punctuation marks"). The final metaphor—"borrowing...was never meant to be returned"—reweights the sugar/tea/lesson progression without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection on what is preserved and what is lost. Minor: "mysterious familiarity" as a phrase is used both as tone and as a thematic label, creating slight redundancy; the closing bridge metaphor ("built one Thursday at a time") verges on summarizing rather than purely resonating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is consistent and carries a distinct, slightly elevated idiom ("cornices weren't mere decoration but declarations"). Dr. Khoury's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, especially "buildings never stop speaking—we just forget how to listen." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor: "patiently nimble" recurs three times in identical phrasing, reading slightly formulaic rather than varied in context. The phrase "agreed upon lies" appears twice in close succession, and dialogue occasionally tilts toward articulate thesis-speak ("I am a tutor of dead languages because I speak them natively") rather than the indirection expected under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and largely free of loops. Strong lines: "meteors scored white lines across the August sky," "the quality of something ancient wearing a contemporary face." Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. No major artifacts, but "patiently nimble" recurs identically three times (a minor template echo), and "mysterious familiarity" appears twice in quick succession. The final paragraph's metaphor cascade (sugar → tea → lessons → bridge) compresses meaning efficiently but risks slight over-explanation where image alone might have sufficed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The immortal-tutor premise is familiar but executed with specific detail (Byzantine seal, Sumerian and Akkadian, Damascus markets). The rooftop-meteor framing and the "agreed upon lies" concept offer fresh angles. The transformation of a mundane request (borrowing sugar) into esoteric mentorship feels earned. However, the core emotional turn—skeptic accepts immortality and asks to learn—closely mirrors mentor-revelation templates; the narrator's instant acceptance without dramatized internal conflict or a non-obvious moral calculus keeps the piece in the strong-but-not-bold range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dr. Khoury's choices create multiple turns: she offers tutoring (inciting), she teaches inscriptions and alphabets (development), and her rooftop revelation and final agreement to teach "everything" directly shape the closure. Her decision to reveal the truth at that moment is pivotal and causally linked to the narrator's interrogation. Present in all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desk seal appears in the opening (holding down papers), is brought to the rooftop (unusual choice that signals importance), and is handled during the revelation ("patiently nimble fingers traced the griffin's worn surface"). Its Byzantine provenance is cited as evidence of Dr. Khoury's age, making it integral to the confrontation. The griffin "shift[ing] its wings" under meteor-light charges the final image. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "agreed upon lies" concept is named explicitly and shapes the middle section: the narrator and Dr. Khoury maintain an unspoken contract that her stories are metaphors. The rooftop confrontation directly challenges this boundary. The final exchange ("Only the lies about what I am were agreed upon") reweights the concept with cost (the comfortable pretense is broken). Present in all three gates and drives a key choice, but the phrase itself is somewhat tell-heavy and lacks full dramatization of the friction it imposes on earlier beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is used three times, always to describe Dr. Khoury's movements (measuring sugar, moving through languages, tracing the seal). It characterizes her but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. The attribute remains descriptive rather than causal—removing it would not break a turn or alter the closure. Label-only trait with no demonstrated tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The interrogation ("How old are you really?") is the story's inciting confrontation and directly precipitates Dr. Khoury's revelation. The narrator explicitly frames it as "interrogating her, pushing against the comfortable boundaries." This action redefines the relationship and enables the closure ("Teach me everything"). Strong causal role, though the aftermath (instant acceptance) slightly undercuts the interrogation's cost. Present in setup and closure with clear pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The progression from borrowing sugar to Thursday teas to lessons is narrated in the opening and middle, establishing the relationship's arc. It is reprised in the final paragraph as a metaphor for transformation ("The sugar had become tea..."). The method shapes the backstory frame but does not constrain a present-tense choice on the rooftop; its main work is thematic rather than tactical. Lyric early-to-final reprise that reweights meaning without mid-scene mechanical use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the meteor shower provides the setting for the entire confrontation scene. The meteors supply atmospheric pressure ("intensified, as if the universe itself was listening") and charge the final image (teaching "an alphabet older than the meteors"). The meteors' light interacts with the bronze seal, a purposeful sensory detail. Setup is late (rooftop begins at ~60%), but the setting directly enables the revelation's tone and participates in closure. Strong closure linkage offsets late start.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to "learn the language of old buildings" is stated early, pursued through the tea-and-lesson sessions, and drives the rooftop confrontation when the narrator demands the truth behind Dr. Khoury's knowledge. The final "Teach me everything" directly fulfills and escalates this want. The motivation is dramatized through repeated actions (attending lessons, researching the seal) and tested at closure. Friction between curiosity and comfort is present but could be sharper; the narrator's acceptance comes quickly once the truth is offered.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is named twice and enacted throughout: Dr. Khoury's anachronistic knowledge, her "as though she'd heard this request before, perhaps centuries ago," and the final meteor-light moment where "her features held that mysterious familiarity...the quality of something ancient wearing a contemporary face." The tone is coherent and modulates from cozy (tea sessions) to charged (rooftop reveal). It permeates the piece and charges the closure image, though the phrase itself is somewhat abstract and relies on repetition rather than varied embodiment.</comment>
