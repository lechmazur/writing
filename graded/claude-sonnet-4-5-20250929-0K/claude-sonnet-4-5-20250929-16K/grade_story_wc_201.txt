<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's proprioceptive enhancements are embodied concretely ("sense the weight of each footfall before her boot touched ground"), and her internal contradiction—hating the precision her body has become—drives micro-choices throughout. The involuntary hand gesture and the decision to carve equations show agency under pressure. Minor deduction: the therapist's framing ("trauma responses, involuntary patterns") edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's quickly dramatized through physical action. The final acceptance ("no longer fighting what she'd become") is earned by the night's work and closes the arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening: Kira, violet forest, post-extraction timeline. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each memory surge deepens her engagement with the forest's responsiveness, culminating in the dawn insight that mercy is transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts her rewired state and commits to an incomplete mathematics with visible cost ("forever changed"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the forest's molecular response to her tears models the transformation she seeks. Minor slip: the middle surges feel slightly repetitive in their physical presentation, but each adds new material (the hesitant interrogator, the trees absorbing pain) that reweights her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and selective: bioluminescent bark responding to movement, trees dimming where she touches them, glow intensifying where tears fall. Sensory detail is filtered through her proprioceptive enhancements ("microscopic tremors of insects beneath the surface"). The environment constrains choice—she carves into living trees, and their molecular response to salt and emotion becomes the model for her equation. The forest charges the final image: dawn breaking violet through the canopy as she completes her night's work. Spatial choreography (stumbling forward, bracing against trunk and ground, carving symbols) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to find something...the mathematics of mercy." Pressure accumulates through three memory surges, each forcing Kira to process pain while searching for pattern. The tightening occurs when she realizes the forest models transformation—"absorbing her pain. Converting it to something else"—which narrows her approach from abstract equations to a biologically grounded metaphor. Agency is evident: she chooses to let the surge come rather than fight it, carves multiple attempts, works through the night. The cost is legible: she must carry her enhancements back to a world that doesn't glow, "forever changed." Minor gap: the interrogator's hesitation is recounted rather than shown in a discrete beat, reducing its pressure contribution slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the forest's biochemical response and Kira's equation-carving: mercy as metabolic transformation rather than cruelty's absence. The pewter strap functions as both "reminder and record," anchoring her acceptance without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the crossed-out equations and the phrase "incomplete, would always be incomplete"—acknowledging limits without resolution. The final image ("map the distance between cruelty and grace. That would be enough penance for today") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: penance as ongoing work, not absolution. No thematic echo or moralizing in the ending; the closing gesture (touching the strap gently) dramatizes acceptance through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Kira's proprioceptive lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices soil density, root structure, microscopic tremors—details her enhancements impose. Diction stays consistent ("calibrated second of awareness," "precision instrument") and voice modulates appropriately under stress (short fragments during surges, longer analytical sentences when carving). No head-hopping. Minor issue: "Her therapist called them trauma responses" is clean context but edges toward exposition; mitigated by immediate physical dramatization. The whispered line "I'm here to find something" functions as self-anchor rather than dialogue, fitting the solitary scene. Psychic distance tightens during surges and pulls back during reflection without jarring shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length modulates with pressure. Information density is high: most lines advance character state, environment interaction, or thematic exploration. Minor loop detected: "her body had become a precision instrument" and the proprioceptive descriptions risk template cadence in the middle section, though each instance adds new specificity (footfall, insects, muscle fiber tension). No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The carving sequence propels cleanly: wrong equations are crossed out on the page, showing failed attempts without summary. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image recharges the pewter strap motif with new weight (acceptance rather than constraint). Figurative language ("each tree a glowing cipher") is purposeful and not overdense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of proprioceptive enhancement, ultraviolet bioluminescence, and equation-carving as trauma processing feels specific and non-obvious. The forest-as-model-for-mercy pivot transforms the interrogation-survivor premise beyond stock recovery arc. Risk: the extended reflection on algorithmic cruelty and mercy could flatten into abstraction, but the biochemical responsiveness of the trees grounds it in concrete action. Derivative element: post-torture recovery in an alien/enhanced landscape has precedent, but the ultraviolet-penance frame and the literal carving of incomplete mathematics add fresh inflection. The ending avoids both tidy resolution and cynical negation, committing fully to "incomplete, would always be incomplete" as the story's stance. Transformation test passes: the specific enhancements, forest mechanics, and equation imagery are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Enhanced interrogation survivor (Kira) drives all key choices: entering the forest, allowing surges rather than fighting them, carving equations through trial and error, accepting her rewired state at dawn. Setup is immediate (extraction team, surgeons, interrogation). Development: memory surges force processing decisions. Closure: her final touch of the pewter strap and acceptance ("no longer fighting what she'd become") crystallizes the arc. Two beats minimum: surge responses and the carving sequence. Causal pressure: her trauma and enhancements directly enable and constrain her search for mercy's mathematics. Visible cost: she returns "forever changed" with proprioceptive awareness she hates. Irreplaceable: the specific torture and enhancement history cannot be swapped without breaking the equation logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pewter mask strap appears in three beats: opening description (embedded behind ear, left by surgeons), mid-story implicit presence during surges (no explicit touch but contextually present), and closing image ("touched it gently, no longer fighting"). Setup early; closure participation clear. However, middle development is weak—it's mentioned but not actively handled or constraining a choice until the end. The strap functions as symbol and reminder but doesn't alter tactics or narrow options in the carving sequence. Lyric reprise (constraint → acceptance) reweights meaning at closure with felt cost, lifting score into mid-6s. Swappability: any embedded implant could serve similar symbolic function; the pewter material and mask origin are specific but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance shapes the premise and stakes: Kira seeks the forest because it hurts ("the way truth hurts") and to discover mercy's mathematics. Setup is immediate (title echoes in "ultraviolet forest," "penance for today"). Development: the forest's violet glow triggers trauma responses, forcing engagement. Closure: dawn breaks violet and she frames her work as penance. The concept constrains her location choice and thematic framing. Friction: "penance" is stated more than dramatized—her equation-carving reads as inquiry or processing rather than explicit atonement for betrayal. The ultraviolet light enables the trauma-trigger mechanism but doesn't uniquely shape tactics beyond any harsh sensory environment. Cost is tied to acceptance of her state, not specifically to penance. Mid-band: present across arc, thematically coherent, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced attribute appears in setup ("sense the weight of each footfall before her boot touched ground"), development (detecting tree responses, "microscopic tremors of insects," "mapping every muscle fiber's tension"), and closure (using enhanced awareness to complete the night's work). The enhancement enables her to perceive the forest's molecular response to her tears, which becomes the key insight ("Life recognizing pain. Life adjusting"). Cost is explicit: "Too much information. Always too much" and "hated every calibrated second of awareness." The trait constrains by overwhelming her and enables by revealing the transformation pattern. Causal pressure: without proprioceptive nerves, she couldn't detect the trees' biochemical feedback that models mercy. Two beats minimum: surges and forest interaction. Irreplaceable: generic enhanced senses wouldn't provide the same precision or burden.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brace action recurs throughout: bracing against tree trunk during first surge, bracing against ground during second surge, bracing for the hike back at closure. Setup early; development shows the action under escalating pressure (standing, kneeling, preparing to return). Each brace marks a decision point: to stay and process rather than flee. Closure linkage: "braced herself for the hike back" signals acceptance of return with her changed body. Causal pressure: the physical act of bracing while proprioceptively mapping tension embodies her attempt to ground herself during surges. Cost: repeated bracing shows physical and emotional endurance required. Specificity: brace fits her need for stability under overwhelming sensory input. Minor swappability: "steady" or "anchor" could substitute in some instances, but the proprioceptive focus on muscle tension makes brace particularly apt. Three beats; shapes tactics; contributes to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is signaled early ("trauma responses, involuntary patterns the body enacted") and recurs in three surges. Setup clear; development shows the method in action (violet light and humming frequency trigger memories, hand gesture enacts interrogation compliance, convulsions bring electric current recall). Closure: she lets the surge come and uses recovery to detect forest patterns. The method enables her insight by forcing re-engagement with interrogation mechanics, which primes her search for mercy's algorithm. Cost: each surge is painful and overwhelming. Friction: the method is more passive trigger than active technique—she doesn't choose to remember through responses; they happen to her. Her agency is in not fighting them, which is closer to acceptance than method deployment. Mid-6s: mechanically present, causally relevant, but not protagonist-controlled enough for higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is essential across all beats. Setup immediate: violet glow, bioluminescent bark, trees responding to movement. Development: the forest triggers trauma (violet light matches interrogation room), provides carving surface (tree trunks), and reveals the transformation model (trees dimming where touched, glowing where tears fall, absorbing pain). Closure: dawn violet light frames her completed work. The setting constrains by triggering surges and enables by modeling biochemical transformation, which becomes her mercy equation. Causal pressure: without the forest's molecular responsiveness, she couldn't move from abstract algorithm to biological metaphor. Cost: returning to "the world that didn't glow" underscores what she's losing. Irreplaceable: no other setting provides both trauma trigger and transformation model. Three gates; high causal pressure; closure-shaping; visible cost; specific mechanics matter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening (four hours since) and establishes post-surgical immediacy. The night's duration is tracked (working through the night, dawn breaks). Setup clear; closure participation present (dawn marks completion). Friction: the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—she has no clock pressure, no deadline forcing trade-offs. The "four hours since anesthesia wore off" detail situates her in early recovery but doesn't constrain tactics. Duration matters thematically (one night's work yields incomplete equations) but not causally. The hike back is prepared for but not on the page, so time doesn't narrow options. Mid-band: coherent, tracked, thematically relevant, but not a live pressure that alters moves. Swappable: "days after extraction" or "first night able to walk" could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover the mathematics of mercy" is stated early ("I'm here to find something") and drives all choices: entering the forest, processing surges, carving equations, working through the night. Setup clear; development shows her testing formulas (crossing out, trying again); closure: she accepts incompleteness as sufficient penance. The desire is conflicted—she seeks mercy while processing her own betrayal (giving names, dates, keys under torture). Cost: the work requires enduring surges and accepting permanent change. Friction: the motivation is told more than shown—we see her carve but don't witness an initial precipitating event where the desire crystallizes on the page. The therapist's context and her remembered interrogation provide backstory stakes, but the present urgency ("drawn her here for a reason she couldn't articulate") is slightly vague. Two beats; shapes tactics; closure linkage strong; cost present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone "displaced rooted" (evaluator infers: alienated yet grounded in sensory overload) is coherent throughout. The proprioceptive precision and ultraviolet strangeness create displacement; the physical bracing, tree-carving, and biochemical grounding provide rootedness. Tone modulates with pressure: clinical precision during calm ("three weeks since extraction"), fragmented and overwhelmed during surges ("Too much information. Always too much"), reflective and measured at closure ("would always be incomplete. But they were a beginning"). The final image—touching the pewter strap gently—charges the ending by fusing displacement (the strap as alien graft) and rootedness (acceptance, no longer fighting). No static mood; tone tracks emotional progression. The combination of hyper-awareness and trauma creates a consistent, voice-specific texture. Coherent through turns; modulates purposefully; charges closure.</comment>
