<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is well-anchored in her daughter's loss and embodied through her professional choices under pressure. The ghost's transformation from perpetual confession to remembered laughter shows earned micro-change through the protagonist's action. Internal contradiction appears briefly ("modestly fearless") but doesn't complicate choices in scene. The crocodile's tooth functions more as prop than constraint; Mara's use feels explanatory rather than wrestling with its implications under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered confessions, the harp's "wrongness," and the tooth's symbolic weight, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost glows and moves on). Orientation is swift (who, where, when by ~60 words). One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost breaks script and laughs. Cost is legible but oblique—the ghost's release rather than Mara's sacrifice—which keeps this just below 8.0. The closure image reweights prior material (laughter threaded through tears) but Mara herself pays no visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is vividly realized through acoustic peculiarities that trap confessions, and the cold breath creates immediate atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, flat stone, deeper shadows). The setting constrains Mara's method (distorted notes slip between confessions) and charges the final image (canyon rim painted gold). Sensory hierarchy is strong, filtered through Mara's professional lens. Minor gap: the harp's physical handling and the stone's texture could ground the peak beat more tactilely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: freeing trapped souls by reintegrating joy with grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost breaks from her script and remembers laughter, narrowing her options (stay trapped or move on). The protagonist's agency drives the turn through music and the crocodile's tooth. Visible cost is present but muted—the ghost pays by releasing guilt, but Mara's own forfeiture or risk isn't dramatized beyond carrying a damaged harp. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices, but the lack of personal jeopardy for Mara limits escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief and joy are companions, not opposites, and healing requires both. The misaligned harp functions as a motif that shifts meaning (broken becomes right), and the crocodile's tooth anchors the concept of biting into life. The final image—"wrong notes made right by their very imperfection"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The ghost's laughter breaking through decades of guilt embodies the theme through action. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, anchored in Mara's professional filter ("shepherd of the wandering"). Perceptual signature is consistent—spectral voices, cold breath, translucent forms. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Mara's questions to the ghost carry subtext and advance the turn. Diction occasionally elevates ("luminous ache," "crooked wing") in ways that feel slightly authored rather than character-native, but the effect is coherent. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the ghost's transformation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Sentence variety supports momentum, and information density is high ("distorted notes...slip between the confessions like a hand through water"). Minor overwriting appears in the final paragraph: "luminous ache of dawn, healing sounded like laughter threaded through tears, wrong notes made right" stacks metaphors without adding causal detail. One paraphrase loop: "misaligned harp" recurs frequently without functional variation. No major loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Grammar and punctuation are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—lost soul collector using a damaged harp—is fresh and specific, avoiding stock ghost-story tropes. The crocodile's tooth as a reminder of hunger and living is an unusual, non-obvious detail. The misaligned harp's "wrongness" becoming "right" offers a thematic transformation that feels earned. However, the core emotional arc (guilt + laughter = release) follows a familiar therapeutic logic. The final image is resonant but not fully surprising. Specificity and world-building elevate above generic, but the emotional calculus is recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (lost soul collector) is present throughout, drives the pursuit, and her choice to play the harp and use the tooth creates the ghost's release. Setup is immediate, development shapes the middle confrontation, and payoff is direct (the ghost moves on because of Mara's action). Causal pressure is strong; her professional method narrows the ghost's options. Specificity is high (shepherd of the wandering, misaligned harp). Cost is tied to her backstory (daughter's laughter stolen by illness) but not paid on the page in this scene. Two beats (playing, using the tooth) plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears twice: withdrawn from Mara's pocket and held up to the ghost. Setup occurs early (mentor's instructions), development happens mid-scene when Mara clutches it, and payoff occurs when she shows it and the ghost laughs. However, its function is largely symbolic—Mara could have used any reminder of life's vitality. The tooth doesn't constrain her method or alter tactics under stress; it's a catalyst but not irreplaceable. Two beats, but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spectral confessions are the story's engine: they trap souls, create the acoustic peculiarity of Echo Gorge, and define the problem Mara must solve. Setup is immediate ("I stole from my brother," layered voices), development drives the middle (pursuing the woman's "I never forgave her"), and payoff occurs when the confession disappears from the chorus. The concept shapes stakes (souls bound by guilt) and tactics (Mara must break the repetition). Irreplaceable; the entire plot depends on this exact phenomenon.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is labeled early and briefly illustrated ("moving with the careful certainty of someone who'd learned that fear acknowledged was fear diminished"). It doesn't constrain a choice or create visible cost on the page—Mara proceeds without hesitation or tradeoff. The attribute is present and consistent but doesn't pressure her actions. One beat (descent into the gorge), but it could be swapped for generic competence. Setup exists, development is weak, and it doesn't charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Pursue" structures the narrative: Mara follows the nearest voice deeper into the gorge, tracking it until she can see the ghost. Setup is clear (pursuing voices), development shapes the middle movement, and payoff occurs when she reaches and transforms the ghost. The action defines her method and drives spatial progression. However, "follow" or "track" could replace "pursue" without major structural change. Two beats plus closure linkage, but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is signaled immediately and its mechanics matter throughout: distorted notes "slip between the confessions," find harmonies in wrongness, and weave laughter into the ghost's script. Setup is early (damaged in the last collection), development is robust (Mara plays a melody "deliberately imperfect," music pursues the voice), and payoff is direct (the ghost glows and moves on). The harp's specific brokenness enables the transformation; a standard instrument wouldn't work. Three beats, irreplaceable, and charges the final image ("beautiful, broken truth").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge supplies the acoustic peculiarities that trap confessions, creating the problem Mara must solve. Setup is immediate (gorge exhaled cold breath, confessions echo and multiply), development pressures Mara's descent and method (distorted notes interact with echoes), and payoff occurs when the confession disappears from the chorus. The setting is not merely backdrop—its acoustic properties are load-bearing. However, another resonant location (canyon, cave) could serve similarly. Two beats plus closure participation, high specificity, but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" appears in the opening line and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("sunrise had climbed higher, painting the canyon rim gold"). It establishes atmosphere but doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency—Mara has "dozens more" to collect, and no clock pressures her current encounter. Setup and payoff exist, but development is absent; time doesn't alter tactics. The timeframe is lyric and resonant but replaceable with any liminal hour.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Integrating laughter into healing drives Mara's method and the story's thematic core. Setup is clear (daughter's laughter stolen, "joy woven back into suffering"), development occurs when Mara asks the ghost about laughter and changes her melody to "something lighter," and payoff is direct (laughter bubbles up, becomes inseparable from confession). The motivation shapes her professional identity and the ghost's release. Cost is tied to backstory (daughter's illness) but not paid on the page. Three beats, irreplaceable, charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is tonally consistent throughout: cold twilight depths, spectral grief, and the harp's "beautiful, broken truth" sustain a mood of melancholic beauty. The tone modulates appropriately—sorrow in the confessions, tender surprise in the ghost's laughter, resonant closure in "laughter threaded through tears." Setup is immediate, development holds across beats, and the final paragraph names and embodies the tone explicitly. Coherent and purposeful, though the final naming ("luminous ache of dawn") risks over-articulation.</comment>
