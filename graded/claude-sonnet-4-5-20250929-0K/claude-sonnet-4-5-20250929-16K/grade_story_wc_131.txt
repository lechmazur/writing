<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to emerge from hiding is concretely embodied through her eleven months of survival tactics, the caching behavior, and the decision triggered by finding the boy. The interiority is specific—"the desperate calculation in his eyes"—and the final choice to reveal herself carries visible cost (leaving safety). Minor slip: the boy's reaction "didn't run" feels slightly thin for the stakes; a micro-choice showing his internal conflict would strengthen the mutual risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): two hidden people begin "the harder work of being seen" with the cost explicit in the renunciation of invisibility. The causal chain from power outage → security down → Maren's reveal is clean, and the orientation anchors (library, dawn, 4:47 AM) arrive early. One tightening: Maren's months of invisible survival versus her decision to matter. The lens is Causal with a lyric texture; it holds through the ending without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sapphire-blue dawn light, pipe chases, ventilation grate, and children's-section table provide concrete spatial grounding. The ferromagnetic tape's smell triggering her grandmother's voice is a strong sensory anchor that charges her purpose. Slight miss: the "crawl spaces beneath the old building" and "narrow passages between floors" remain architecturally vague—specific ductwork or beam dimensions would add constraint. The setting enables her reveal (security down, accessible supplies) but doesn't force a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Maren's shift from survival to mattering, tested by revealing herself to the boy. The outage provides one meaningful tightening (systems down, opportunity window) and her agency drives the turn. Visible cost: she positions herself "only partially" hidden, risking discovery. The boy's presence and his choice not to run crystallize the stakes. Minor gap: no immediate external pressure (library staff, time limit) to force a harder trade-off in the reveal itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tape fragment sense-memory → crystallized purpose → the note "You're not alone" → the ending image of two people learning to be seen. The final line—"the harder work of being seen"—reweights invisibility as survival versus connection without stating a moral. The tape reel as "evidence that hidden things could resurface when the time was right" risks slight symbolic convenience, but it's anchored in her grandmother's voice and earned by Maren's eleven-month arc. No thematic echo in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Maren's perceptual signature: "practiced silence," "kindly methodical care," "desperate calculation in his eyes." The focalization is clean, and the prose modulates from her survival mode ("cache supplies in the pipe chases") to the sensory turn (tape fragment smell) to the lyric final beat. Minor texture issue: "the sapphire hush that filled the space felt sacred" drifts slightly elevated for someone living in ducts, though it tracks the dawn's transformative effect. Dialogue is minimal, purposeful, and on-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density: "eleven months," "pipe chases," "heating ducts on the third floor" anchor survival specifics. Rhythm varies well—short urgency ("The boy didn't run") and longer reflective beats. Minor loop: "kindly methodical care" appears twice with identical phrasing, and "the sapphire hush" / "sapphire-blue light" recur without reweighting. The final line's syntax—"two people who had learned to hide began the harder work of being seen"—lands cleanly. No major artifacts; one paraphrase slip lowers momentum slightly in the middle ("She had become invisible by necessity" after prior survival detail).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—homeless woman in library crawl spaces during power outage—transforms a familiar setup through the pipe-chase caching detail and the ferromagnetic tape as memory trigger. The shift from survival to connection via a second hidden child is specific and earned. Slight predictability: the "You're not alone" note and the mutual emergence follow an expected arc without a final surprise or harder moral calculus. The emotional truth is strong, but the turn feels comfortably resolved rather than risky.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's crawl-space dwelling drives setup (eleven months of hiding), middle choice (deciding to reveal herself after finding the boy), and closure (emerging through the grate). Her cached supplies and navigation of pipe chases depend on this status. Without it, the survival tactics and the reveal's risk collapse. Two beats: caching behavior, final emergence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape appears once in a single beat (science section, smell triggers grandmother memory) and is placed beside the note as "a token, a promise." It seeds the sense-memory motivation but doesn't constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning in the closure. The ending focuses on Maren and the boy; the tape is left behind on the table. Present in setup and contributes to her crystallized purpose, but absent from closure participation. Swappable with another nostalgic object (photo, book).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sense memory shapes the dominant turn: the tape's oxide smell triggers her grandmother reading aloud, which crystallizes "her purpose" to matter rather than merely survive. This memory enables the middle choice (setting up the cache, writing the note) and primes the closure stance. The concept is on-page and alters tactics. Minus: it operates in one beat and doesn't recur or constrain the final reveal itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" appears twice: "moved between the shelves with kindly methodical care" (early) and at the ending ("moving with that same kindly methodical care"). It characterizes her approach—careful, non-threatening—and enables her non-frightening reveal to the boy. The trait doesn't create visible cost or a trade-off; it's consistent but not tested under conflicting pressure. Lyric reprise reweights it slightly (survival care → connection care) but remains descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Caching supplies is seeded across the first half (water behind heating ducts, protein bars in plumbing, blankets and stove) and becomes the pivot: the outage lets her uncover hidden resources, which she then arranges in the children's section to signal help. The cache enables the reveal and provides the material proof of her offer. Two beats: hiding phase, outage assembly. The ending hinges on this preparation; without it, her message lacks credibility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uncovering supplies in pipe chases is signaled early ("cached supplies in the pipe chases," "bottles of water behind the heating ducts," "plumbing ran through the staff bathroom walls") and executed during the outage ("reaching into pipe chases where she'd secreted away resources"). The method is specific and architectural, enabling her reveal. Minus: the mechanics don't face resistance or constraint; she retrieves everything smoothly. Present in setup and middle, shapes one turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn provides spatial pressure: "sapphire hush," tall windows, ventilation grate, children's section table. The outage removes security systems, enabling free movement—a tactical enabler. The dawn light returns in the closure ("sapphire-blue light that still lingered"). Setting alters tactics (where she positions herself, where she places the cache) and charges the final image. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The outage (4:47 AM, lights flicker back at ~9:15) provides a timed window that enables Maren's movements and tracks the boy's arrival. Time is legible and creates urgency ("library opened late, chaos from the outage delaying everything"). Minus: the flicker-back doesn't tighten the ending beat or force a faster decision; the reveal happens after systems are restored, reducing the time pressure's closure impact. Present in setup and middle; weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to become visible is dramatized through the tape-fragment epiphany ("she wanted to matter"), the note ("You're not alone"), and the physical reveal ("I've been invisible too"). It conflicts with eleven months of practiced hiding and carries visible cost (risk of discovery, vulnerability). The desire drives both the caching action and the final emergence. Strong friction: survival versus connection. All three gates; causal across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" is established in the opening ("sapphire hush that filled the space felt sacred") and reprised at closure ("sapphire-blue light that still lingered in the shadowed corners"). The tone is coherent—quiet, reverent, tentative—and modulates slightly from isolation to shared vulnerability. Minus: the tone doesn't deepen under pressure; the ending's emotional register matches the opening without a cadence shift or charged intensification. Lyric reprise without escalation.</comment>
