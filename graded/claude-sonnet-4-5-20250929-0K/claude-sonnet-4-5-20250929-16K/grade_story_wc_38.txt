<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her skills are specific (lyrical code-breaking, dance-encryption), but her interior life remains abstract—vulnerability, hope, and defiance are catalogued rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The three-year captivity lacks embodied cost; no injury, fatigue, or micro-choice reveals genuine struggle. The final escape feels inevitable rather than earned by dramatic tension, and the calm defiance reads more as authorial theme than lived friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative lens: Mira layers encoded journal entries and dance movements across years, building toward escape. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (sunken lab, spiral staircase, captivity). The closure—doors opening after the final dance—lands on the page as a Decisive Change, and the cost (leaving journals, three years encoded) is legible. However, the escape mechanism (motion-responsive locks) arrives late without prior dramatization, weakening causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vivid and specific: corroded walls, kelp hymns, bioluminescent algae, coral-encrusted floor. The environment constrains Mira's methods (guards above, sealed doors, tidal rhythms) and charges the final image (ancient water rushing in). Sensory detail is filtered through her lyrical perspective (cathedral/prison duality, "kelp seeking light"). The setting directly enables the climactic dance and lock response, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's liberation—is signaled early and builds through accumulative pressure (each journal entry, each dance). The lowest tide in seventeen years creates a ticking clock. However, no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the plan unfolds as designed without friction. The guards never detect her, the dice never fail, and no micro-choice forces a trade-off. The escalation is declarative rather than dramatized, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: encryption-as-autonomy, calm defiance versus direct rebellion, vulnerability transformed into lattice of strength. The spider-web motif recurs purposefully and reweights at closure ("as steadily and inevitably as a spider spins"). The final image—ascending with journals left behind—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "liberation had never been about breaking free" edges toward thesis statement, though the metaphor cluster largely earns the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a lyrical, metaphor-dense register that fits Mira's code-breaker perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: oceanographic terminology, musical pattern-seeing, dance-as-language. However, the elevated diction ("liminal space between thought and action," "mysterious familiarity") drifts above character interiority into narrator philosophy. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly purposeful (kelp hymns, spider-web closure). However, several lines loop conceptually: "calm defiance" appears three times with minimal variation; "encoding her own liberation/autonomy" restates across paragraphs. "Mysterious familiarity" in the penultimate paragraph feels ornamental. Template cadence in the opening: "its corroded walls draped... each bloom a syllable... She was what they called..." creates rhythmic monotony. The metaphor stack in peak beats ("lattice of strength," "frequencies only she could generate") blurs concrete action. Apply −0.8 for density and loops; no closure-beat artifacts prevent deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—dancer-cryptographer encoding liberation through journals and movement—offers fresh synthesis. The dance-as-key mechanic and motion-responsive locks are inventive. However, the "patient captive secretly prepares escape" frame is familiar, and the story does not fully transform it; Mira's three-year plan succeeds without setback or moral cost. The spider-web simile is apt but conventional. Emotional truth is present but not deeply particular; the arc would function in a different setting with similar metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; code-breaking shapes her method. She decodes the dice weeks prior and choreographs the escape sequence. However, her choices are retrospective narration rather than dramatized decisions under pressure; no on-page turn pivots on her agency. She performs the final dance, but the outcome feels preordained. Causal role in one beat (final dance) and early setup, but no middle development choice alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced on the workbench early; Mira "cracked their meaning weeks ago" and rolls them a "final time" at closure to confirm the sequence. They map to dance movements and reappear in the climactic choreography. However, the dice are described more than handled; we never see her decode them or practice the movements in failed attempts. Two-beat presence (workbench, final roll) with closure linkage, but the mechanics remain abstract. Swappable with another symbolic cipher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shapes the entire arc: Mira refuses direct rebellion in favor of patient subversion. The concept governs her tactics (metaphor encryption, dance as pacing) and is embedded in the closure image (ascending after years of encoded work). "Calm defiance" is named three times, reducing subtlety, but the behavior is shown: cultivating algae, performing eccentric dances the guards find amusing, steady accumulation. The final paragraph restates it overtly, yet the story's structure enacts it. Causal pressure across beats and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dance is present in two beats: described as "restless pacing" the guards observe, and performed in the climactic sequence where "her arms rose like kelp" and "her feet traced the symbols." However, the trait is told more than shown; we never witness a single choreographed move in detail or see her struggle to perfect it. The cost (three years of hidden practice, guards' amusement) is narrated, not dramatized. One-beat causal role (unlocks doors) with setup and closure, but no middle development where dance constrains or fails.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action drives the entire plot: Mira encodes her escape across three years and executes it in the final scene. The doors open, she ascends, and she leaves captivity. The action is irreplaceable; no minor edit could substitute another goal. However, the liberation occurs in a single paragraph without complication, and we never see a prior failed attempt. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the on-page execution is compressed into summary ("the laboratory's sealed doors finally groaned open"). Three beats (encoding, final dance, ascent) with visible cost (three years, journals left behind).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Journals are introduced early and recur: Mira writes "clinical observations" that embed encrypted choreography; each entry is "a syllable in her silent vocabulary." The method is signaled and shapes her daily work. At closure, she leaves the journals behind as evidence ("truth hidden in plain sight"). However, we never see her write an entry on the page or witness the guards read and dismiss one. The mechanics remain abstract. Two-beat presence (workbench routine, closure artifact) with setup and closure linkage, but no middle scene where the method is tested or nearly fails.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken lab is established in the opening line and pressures every beat: corroded walls, guards above, sealed doors, tidal rhythms. Mira cultivates bioluminescent algae for light, traces symbols on the coral floor, and times her escape to the lowest tide in seventeen years. The environment is not backdrop; it supplies the lock mechanism (walls hum, doors respond to dance frequencies) and the final image (ancient water rushing in). The setting constrains her methods (must work in secret, must sync with tides) and enables the climax. Indispensable; three-gate integration with strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The spider-web simile appears twice: mid-story ("As a spider spins its web—patiently, instinctively, with perfect geometric certainty—Mira had been weaving her exit") and in the final line ("as steadily and inevitably as a spider spins"). The metaphor conveys patience and inevitability, and the final reprise reweights the accumulated work. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; three years pass in summary, and the seventeen-year tidal cycle is declarative rather than felt. The simile charges the closure image but does not constrain tactics. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band; no mid-scene causal work lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "transform prescribed weakness into a lattice of strength" is stated and enacted: she uses captivity as the condition for encoding autonomy, practices vulnerability as a cultivated trait. The motivation governs her methods (metaphor encryption, patient accumulation). However, the desire is told more than dramatized; we never see her wrestle with doubt, fear of failure, or the cost of three years in isolation. The final realization ("liberation had never been about breaking free") restates the motivation without friction. Two beats (journal work, final insight) with setup and closure, but no conflicted choice where wants clash with costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent: the lab "felt more like a cathedral than a prison," kelp sways in "the current's hymn," and the deep sea offers "mysterious familiarity" that teaches Mira "to breathe differently." The lyrical, reverent register holds across turns and modulates at closure (ancient water, newer possibilities). The tone charges the final image: ascending from a place that "tried to drown her but had instead taught her." However, "mysterious familiarity" is named rather than sustained through image alone, and the tone's lushness occasionally obscures concrete action. Strong closure linkage and consistent modulation under pressure; minor tell-over-show reduces the score.</comment>
