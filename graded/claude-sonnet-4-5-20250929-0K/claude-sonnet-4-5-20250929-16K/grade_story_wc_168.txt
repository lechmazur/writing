<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus carries adequate interiority through memory and scarred hands, but critical beats lean heavily on abstraction ("bargained innocence," "pain journals," "universal language") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The father's suicide is told entirely in retrospect, and Marcus's decision to continue firefighting arrives as summary epiphany rather than a present choice under pressure. The final act—placing the box and writing his entry—reads as symbolic closure without visible cost that forecloses a live option. Embodied emotion appears (tracing words, scarred fingers) but therapy-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("translation of his father's pain," "syntax of survival") flatten peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors adequately (Marcus, ridge, porcelain box, moonlight) by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/reflective lens: Marcus walks the ridge, reviews his father's writings, and reaches understanding. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (placing the box, adding his own entry, walking down with new understanding), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the "bargain continues, but now I choose it knowingly" reads as thematic claim without visible consequence. The drive lens holds, but the ending lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, Douglas fir, and valley lights below provide coherent spatial anchors. The cracked porcelain box is handled twice (opening it, placing it at the tree) and its surface details (webbed fractures catching moonlight) recur purposefully. Sensory selection—silver light on clay, ash settling, embers below—filters through Marcus's professional firefighter lens. The ridge setting constrains the final choice (returning the box to where his father died) and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3, but the valley and celestial bodies remain postcard elements without tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus seeking to understand his father's sacrifice and his own compulsion toward firefighting—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through reflection rather than reversal, consistent with the accumulative lens. The ridge walk and box-opening deepen understanding, but no live option is tested or narrowed on the page. The final act (placing the box, writing his entry) is a symbolic gesture without visible cost or tactical shift; Marcus walks down "sure," suggesting resolution rather than foreclosure. Escalation reads as density increase in thematic material, meeting the lens minimum, but agency remains passive contemplation rather than a choice that alters stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the father's sacrifice, Marcus's scarred hands, and the recurring "bargain" motif. The porcelain box shifts meaning (mother's pressed flowers → father's pain journal → Marcus's continuation), and the celestial convergence frames the thirty-year span without overt symbolism. However, the final paragraph ("syntax of survival, the grammar of going on") and the interior claim "something almost like grace" veer into thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance. The piece invites reflection on inherited trauma and chosen duty, but the ending articulates the thesis ("The bargain continues, but now I choose it knowingly") rather than allowing it to emerge from action, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (firefighter's eye for burns, scars, tactical movement). Diction is elevated but mostly coherent ("gently skilled precision," "topography of trauma"), though phrases like "hard softness" and "syntax of survival" drift toward abstract poeticism under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance narrows appropriately at emotional peaks. No dialogue present. Register occasionally slips into workshop language ("pain journals," "translation") that feels externally imposed rather than Marcus's own idiom, but the effect is minor and does not fragment focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies adequately; sentence openings shift between subject-verb and participial. Information density is moderate—many lines do double work (scars as metaphor and plot fact, box as heirloom and symbol)—but several beats paraphrase without advancement: the "bargained innocence" concept is restated three times across paragraphs without new pressure. Template stems appear ("Marcus had come to," "Marcus understood now," "Each [X] was [Y]") in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild cadence monotony. Mixed metaphor: "absorbing shame" and "burned out, fuel exhausted" apply incompatible vehicles (sponge vs. combustion). No loops touch the closure beat, capping deductions at −0.8 per the artifact pack, but cumulative scaffold prevents entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The firefighter-son-inheriting-trauma premise is familiar, and the execution follows a meditative template: protagonist visits significant location, reviews past writings, achieves epiphany, performs symbolic act. The cracked porcelain box and celestial convergence offer specific detail, but the emotional arc (guilt → understanding → acceptance) proceeds without resistance or surprise. The "bargain" framing and "universal language of pain" risk abstraction over lived particularity. No close echo of famous lines, and the ridge setting is concrete, but the transformation test suggests the plot and arc could transfer to other professions (soldier, doctor) with minor edits, indicating insufficient synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus appears throughout and his firefighter background shapes perception (walking burned earth, scarred hands, professional lens on risk). His choices—walking the ridge, opening the box, placing it at the tree—are present but contemplative rather than under pressure. The scarred hands return in the final image, reweighting the motif with mild charge. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is thin (no mid-story choice that alters tactics). Causal pressure is low; the character enables reflection but does not drive a turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in two beats (opening it on the ridge, placing it at the tree), and returns in the final third with Marcus's own entry inside. Its history (mother's pressed flowers, father's pain journal) shifts meaning across the story. The box participates in closure (placed at the Douglas fir, completing the cycle) and carries thematic charge (vessel for grief, container of translated pain). Strong setup, middle use, and payoff meet all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate—it frames the quest but does not narrow options—and specificity (webbed fractures, porcelain walls inscribed) is high, justifying mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Bargained innocence" is introduced in paragraph two (father's scapegoat trade) and recurs as thematic claim throughout (father's sacrifice, Marcus's continuation). It shapes the dominant stake (understanding the inherited cost) and is referenced in the closure paragraph ("bargained innocence transformed finally into something like understanding"). However, it remains abstract—no on-page choice dramatizes Marcus bargaining or refusing a bargain. The concept is told and reflected upon rather than enacted, keeping it functional but replaceable with similar framing (e.g., "inherited duty"). Setup and payoff present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" appears once in the opening line ("gently skilled precision") and again in the final paragraph ("gently skilled footsteps"). It labels Marcus's movement but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—his navigation of the ridge is unopposed, and the trait does not alter tactics or outcomes. The adverbial phrase is voice-consistent (professional competence under control) but ornamental. Setup and closure reprise present; no middle beat where the trait matters. Swappable with "careful," "practiced," or similar descriptors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Enlighten" (paragraph six: "Marcus had come to enlighten himself") frames his quest to understand his father's suicide and his own compulsion. The verb motivates the ridge walk and box review, and the ending delivers understanding ("Marcus understood now"). However, the action is passive contemplation rather than a choice under pressure, and the enlightenment arrives as summary ("began to see the pattern," "understood now") rather than dramatized discovery. Setup and payoff clear; middle involvement thin. The verb is structurally important but does not redefine options or create visible cost, capping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By reflecting deeply" (paragraph five: "By reflecting deeply on his father's words, Marcus began to see the pattern") names the method and is enacted on the page—Marcus opens the box, reads the inscriptions, traces the entries, and reaches conclusions. The method shapes multiple beats (paragraphs 3–6) and delivers the closure insight. However, it is told as process ("began to see," "understood") rather than shown as struggle or contradiction, and no cost or friction accompanies the reflection. Setup, middle mechanics, and payoff all present, but the method feels effortless, lowering causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "moonlit ridge path" anchors the entire story spatially and temporally. Marcus walks it at the opening and returns down it at closure, and the ridge is where his father died (the Douglas fir landmark). The setting constrains the final choice (placing the box at the tree) and charges the closure image (moonlight on scars, valley lights below). Setup, middle presence (ridge as pilgrimage destination), and payoff all solid. The path itself does not create tactical friction—Marcus's walk is unopposed—but the location's history and the ridge-as-memorial function supply thematic pressure and closure charge, justifying mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The slow dance of celestial bodies" (Jupiter and Mars alignment, thirty-year convergence) is mentioned in paragraph one and recurs in the closure paragraph ("celestial bodies wheeled overhead"). The timeframe provides symbolic resonance (thirty years since the Coldwater Fire, since Marcus last walked the ridge as a boy) but exerts no pressure on choices or tactics. The alignment is ornamental—removing it would not alter Marcus's quest, the box placement, or the ending. Setup and closure cameo present; no middle development. Swappable with any other anniversary marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To translate pain into a universal language" is stated explicitly in paragraph three (father's pain journals) and again in paragraphs five and eight ("translation of his father's pain," "translated grief"). The motivation shapes Marcus's quest—he seeks to understand his father's inscriptions and his own scarred continuation—and is present at closure ("carrying forward the translated grief"). However, it is told as concept rather than dramatized as conflicted want. No on-page moment shows Marcus struggling to articulate or failing to translate; the desire is asserted and fulfilled without friction. Setup, thematic presence, and payoff clear; missing middle conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is named in paragraph seven ("The hard softness of that truth settled over Marcus like ash") and recurs in the final image (scars catching moonlight, "something almost like grace"). The tone blends brutality (scarred hands, father's burnout, roof beam kiss) with tenderness (love, duty, carrying forward), and this duality modulates across beats—harsh memory, gentle closure. The phrase crystallizes the tone but appears late (second-to-last paragraph), reducing setup credit. Closure participation is strong (scars as punctuation, moonlight acceptance), and the tone is coherent under pressure, but the late explicit naming and the oxymoron's slight abstraction cap the score in mid-band.</comment>
