<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"seven years of watching people arrive shattered and leave slightly more whole"—with embodied motivation tied to the job. The young man's grief is shown through posture and breath rather than labels, and the brief exchange about his sister avoids over-articulation. The final gesture (palm on storm glass) reads as earned recognition. Minor: the piece leans heavily on reflective summary of Mara's experience; while BRR allows ~30% when anchored and choices are present, the ratio here edges close to exposition, though micro-choices (guiding, pointing, checking monitors) ground each reflective block in present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the man's brief palm-press on the storm glass and Mara's final log notation reweight the premise (teaching silence to comfort) with visible professional ritual. Cost is oblique but legible—Mara's ongoing work carries the weight of "difficult passages, handled with care." Orientation is clean by ~120 words (gondola operator, floating terrace, seven years). The piece teaches its pattern (vignette of one arrival, bracketed by Mara's reflection) and the closure image reconfigures the storm glass from atmospheric device to emblem of shared transit. One meaningful deepening: the man's breathing slows, and his departure gesture converts observation into recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drifting terrace is vividly particular—floating three hundred meters above the valley, anchored to nothing, sound behaving differently—and the prisms' light-breaking function shapes the man's experience on the page. The storm glass vial appears in multiple beats (Mara checks it, shows the man, he touches it at departure) and constrains her professional judgment. Spatial choreography is coherent: gondola docking, western edge, prisms, descent. The train whistle echo provides a sensory anchor that recurs and charges the quiet. Environment actively pressures the emotional arc rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mara's professional task (guiding the man through grief toward intentional quiet) is signaled early and coheres. The man's question "Does it get easier?" and Mara's response constitute the story's one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens—his breathing slows from 42 to 28 decibels, and the palm-press on the storm glass forecloses his prior shattering with visible, if quiet, cost. No explicit antagonist is required; pressure accumulates through the juxtaposition of the man's posture, the noise levels, and Mara's practiced attention. The stakes remain modest and observational, appropriate to the vignette structure, and the cost is legible in the man's altered state and Mara's ongoing labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (grief, transit, the work of silence) emerges organically from the storm glass motif, the noise-level mechanics, and Mara's line "Silence isn't the absence of sound—it's what remains when we stop fighting the echo." The piece resists moralizing: Mara's reflection on "teaching silence how to comfort" is dramatized through her actions (checking instruments, guiding, pointing) rather than asserted. The final image—crystals forming fern patterns, forecast for difficult passages—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. The storm glass recurs purposefully and reweights the opening atmospheric detail as a symbol of invisible transformation. The thematic question (how to hold grief in transit) is inextricable from Mara's professional arc and the man's brief passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and aptly close, filtered through Mara's professional lens (she notices decibel readings, storm glass formations, breath patterns). Perceptual signature is consistent: "the air held memories of noise like water holds salt." The man's single line of dialogue ("My sister," then stopping) feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without over-explanation. Mara's brief spoken response fits her role. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the man's breathing check, wider during the reflective framing. Vocabulary remains within Mara's register; no unmotivated diction shifts. Purposeful elision (the man's fuller story) imposes cost that the scene honors rather than filling in.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the man's arc. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled: "the hush vaulting upward into the pale sky" and "fluidly logical as breath, as grief" are specific and voice-coherent. Minor: "catalyze effect" reads as a near-typo (likely "catalyst"); filter verbs ("she had learned," "she had tried") cluster in the reflective blocks but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats. The final sentence's triadic rhythm ("as breath, as grief, as the slow work") charges the closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and storm glass vial are fresh, specific details that avoid genre cliché. The premise (a floating grief-processing station) is transformed through occupational specificity (monitoring noise levels, forty-two decibels as the nervous-system threshold) and the protagonist's professional stance. The ending avoids tidy resolution; Mara's final log entry and the rising gondola signal ongoing work rather than closure for her. Transformation test: the plot and emotional arc depend on this exact setting and its mechanics. Proximity check clear. Minor: the core arc (guide arrives shattered, leaves slightly more whole) follows a familiar template, but the execution elevates it through vivid world-building and restrained voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (gondola operator) is present in setup, development, and closure. Her choices—opening the door without speaking, guiding the man to the western edge, showing him the storm glass, offering her reflection on silence—shape the man's arc. Her final act (noting readings in the log, watching the next gondola rise) participates in closure by reweighting her work as ongoing ritual. The role is irreplaceable: remove her professional lens and the story collapses. Causal pressure is present but modest; the man's transformation is collaborative rather than purely driven by Mara's decisions. Two distinct beats (initial guidance, final exchange) plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm glass vial appears in setup (first paragraph: "crystals forming delicate ferns"), development (Mara shows the man, explains the mechanism), and closure (man presses his palm against it; Mara checks it again in the final paragraph). Its crystalline formations guide Mara's professional judgment (fern patterns = difficult passages) and the man's palm-press converts it from atmospheric device to emblem of recognition. Three distinct beats, clear causal pressure (shapes Mara's attention), and closure linkage (the dissolving/reforming crystals charge the final image). The object is irreplaceable; no near-synonym could perform the same function. Specificity and cost both present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"In transit" (core concept) is signaled in the opening (gondola system, ascent through sound layers) and shapes stakes throughout: Mara's task is to monitor the "crucial transition period," and the man is described as someone "in transit between their old life and whatever came next." The concept constrains tactics (Mara's careful attention to noise levels, the seven-minute threshold) and charges the closure (another gondola already rising, carrying someone else in transit). The piece literalizes transit as both geographic and internal, and the final image reweights the opening's mechanical description as existential metaphor. Present in all three gates, with clear causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" appears three times: gondola system described as "fluidly logical in its design," Mara's predecessor's phrase ("abstract then, even cryptic"), and the closing line ("fluidly logical as breath, as grief"). The term is signaled early and returns at closure to reweight the opening's technical description as emotional metaphor. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—it functions as thematic gloss rather than tactical pressure. The attribute is present in setup and closure but lacks middle development; its role is primarily lyric rather than causal. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, lifting the score into the mid-6s, but the lack of mid-scene use and causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears once in the middle as "catalyze effect" (likely intended as "catalyst effect"), describing how watching the storm glass helps people understand their own transformations. The action is present in development (Mara's explanation to the man) but not in setup or closure. It does not drive a major turn; the man's transformation is shaped more by the quiet, the prisms, and Mara's guidance than by this specific mechanism. The term is replaceable with "transformative" or "enabling" without structural loss. Functional but not essential. Two gates (development, partial thematic presence) but no strong closure linkage or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" (method) is signaled early (Mara's task is to "monitor noise levels during the crucial transition period") and used in two distinct beats: checking the man's compartment (forty-two decibels during ascent) and later confirming his calmer state (twenty-eight decibels, mostly wind). The method constrains Mara's professional judgment and provides objective evidence of the man's shift, shaping tactics and validating the outcome. Present in setup, development (two beats), and indirectly in closure (the final log notation references "readings"). The specificity (forty-two decibels as nervous-system threshold) is irreplaceable. Clear causal pressure and cost connection (the man's breathing slows, validated by the decibel drop).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is established in the opening (floats three hundred meters above the valley, drifts in slow circles, sound behaves differently) and supplies resources that affect the outcome: the prisms break sunlight into colors that move across the floor, the quiet expands after the train whistle, and the western edge provides a specific location for the man's watching. The setting constrains Mara's work (she must guide gondolas in and out, maintain quiet) and charges the final image (the terrace as a recurring station for grief). Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment is irreplaceable—remove the floating terrace and the story's logic collapses. Present in all three gates with strong causal and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"In the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" (timeframe) appears in the opening as a descriptor of when and where the terrace operates, and the train whistle itself sounds on the page ("the train whistle sounded from the valley below, its echo climbing the mountain face"). The timeframe shapes the man's experience (the moment after the whistle fades, "the terrace seemed to expand") and charges the closure (the hush as a recurring condition Mara cultivates). The whistle provides a temporal anchor and modulates pressure. Present in setup, development (the on-page whistle), and thematically in closure. The timeframe is specific and contributes to the story's rhythm, though it does not tighten decisions in the way a live countdown would. Two clear beats plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To teach silence how to comfort" (motivation) is introduced in the first third (Mara's predecessor's instruction) and dramatized through Mara's choices: opening the door without speaking, guiding the man to the prisms, checking his breathing, offering her reflection on silence. The motivation is tested when the man asks "Does it get easier?" and Mara's response ("Silence isn't the absence of sound—it's what remains when we stop fighting the echo") enacts the teaching. The final log entry ("forecast for difficult passages, handled with care") reaffirms the motivation as ongoing work. Present in setup, development (multiple beats), and closure. Friction between the abstract goal and the concrete labor is visible. Strong causal pressure and cost connection (Mara's sustained attention, the man's partial recovery).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" (tone) is established early through phrases like "the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" and "the air held memories of noise like water holds salt." The tone modulates with pressure: the man's initial tension, the expanding quiet after the whistle, his slowed breathing, and the final image of crystals dissolving and reforming. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the closure—"fluidly logical as breath, as grief, as the slow work of teaching silence its forgotten purpose." The hush is not static; it deepens as the man's state shifts. Present in all three gates, with clear modulation and a final image that crystallizes the tone. Diction and rhythm support the tone without overwriting.</comment>
