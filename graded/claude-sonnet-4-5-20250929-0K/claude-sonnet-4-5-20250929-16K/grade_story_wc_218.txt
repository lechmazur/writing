<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's arc from terminal diagnosis to purposeful caretaker is clearly motivated, and her "brazen calm" manifests in concrete actions—mapping, planting, documenting. Internal contradiction is present: she has "nothing to lose" yet builds a legacy for the next caretaker, revealing a simultaneous acceptance and denial of death. The final choice (peaceful death against a pillar) feels earned by her months of engagement. Minor deduction: the shift from self-focus to interspecies philosophy could show more embodied struggle; the insights arrive somewhat cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates understanding through incremental discoveries (diary notes, pillar-tree symbiosis, copper technique) and closes with Resonant Reconfiguration—Marina's death becomes Earned Stasis where her renunciation of extended life is reweighted as integration into the system she restored. Orientation anchors cleanly (island, temple, Marina, terminal prognosis) by ~80 words. Cost is visible: she exceeds prognosis but dies, having traded treatment for purpose. The pattern of discovery-to-restoration coheres and the final diary entry charges the closure image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living stone pillars that "breathe through mineral pores" and release mist constrain Marina's choices throughout: she must plant where pillars lack trees, drill holes for copper threading, read mist color as feedback. The orchard-as-structure concept charges the final image when Marina dies "against her favorite pillar," completing the human-stone-tree integration. Spatial choreography is clear across temple, orchard, and nursery grove. The micro-setting (copper wire, pillar pores) directly shapes her restoration tactics and the closure's meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the failing temple before death. Pressure accumulates through discovery (hairline fractures → pattern revelation → planting solution → mist color shift → renewed vitality). One meaningful tightening: the fractures "stopped spreading" after copper installation, validating her method and narrowing her path to full restoration. Agency is clear: Marina decides to remodel despite terminal diagnosis, choosing legacy over treatment. The cost is legible—she dies having exceeded prognosis but forfeiting mainland care. No antagonist required; the temple's decay and her body's clock supply coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "interspecies respect" is dramatized through copper-wire symbiosis, not declared until the final diary entry reweights prior material ("roots and stone and breath all twisted together"). The architectural secret—cooperation rather than domination—answers the unstated question of how to die well. Subtext operates in Marina's "brazen calm," which reads as acceptance earned through engagement rather than resignation. The final image (Marina against pillar, diary open) offers a resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. No thematic echo in peak beats; the philosophy is discovered, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and clear perceptual signature: Marina notices botanical and structural details ("hairline fractures," "mineral pores," "pale green" mist) filtered through her new role. Diction remains consistent—calm, methodical, slightly formal—matching her "gently systematic" approach. No head-hopping; the new caretaker's brief final-paragraph POV is section-separated and reads as intentional handoff. Narrative certainty matches Marina's on-page learning; inference reads as inference ("she understood what needed to happen"). Prose rhythm modulates appropriately: longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action beats. Minor slip: "brazen calm that surprised even herself" is slightly tell-heavy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance understanding, action, or atmosphere without padding. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. The copper-wire sequence is concrete and propulsive. Minor deductions: "bones within bones" and "roots that remember" are atmospheric but slightly vague; "methodical grace" and "seamlessly integrated" edge toward stock phrasing. The final diary entry risks thematic summary but earns its place by reweighting prior material. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core premise—dying caretaker restores living architecture through botanical symbiosis—offers a fresh synthesis of terminal-illness narrative and eco-fiction. The copper-wire acupuncture detail is specific and memorable, avoiding generic "nature heals" tropes. Transformation test: the emotional arc (purpose amid dying) could theoretically transplant, but the pillar-tree-human integration is sufficiently particular to resist easy swapping. Risk: the piece commits fully to its premise without hedging or false complexity. Minor limitation: the "learning to listen" closure gesture is emotionally honest but edges toward familiar wisdom-through-nature territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina's choices create all key turns: accepting the caretaker position, deciding to remodel despite terminal prognosis, mapping the pattern, planting three oaks, drilling pillar holes, threading copper. Her final choice to remain (dying against the pillar) rather than return for treatment completes the arc. Early signal (first paragraph), middle development (planting sequence), and closure participation (dies integrated with the system) all present. Causal pressure: her actions restore the temple and redefine her death's meaning. Specific cost: she exceeds prognosis but dies, having foreclosed mainland treatment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in three distinct beats: Marina discovers it and reads margin notes ("bones within bones"), uses its measurements to guide oak planting, and writes final observations for the next caretaker. Setup, development, and payoff all present. It enables tactics (measurement-guided planting) and charges the final image (open in Marina's lap at death, embodying legacy). Causal pressure: the diary's cryptic notes prompt her realization about integrated structure. Minor limitation: the diary itself is not irreplaceable—another record could function similarly—but its three-century lineage and Marina's addition of the final entry elevate its resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Architectural secrets" frames the inciting problem (fractures, lost blueprints) and shapes all tactics: mapping, overlaying patterns, reading pillar-tree relationships, drilling and threading copper. Marina's realization—that secrets are "written in living wood and breathing stone" rather than documents—reweights the premise at closure. The concept is indispensable: removing it collapses the restoration logic and the interspecies-respect theme. Setup (failing temple, lost builder knowledge), development (pattern revelation, copper technique), and closure (seamless integration, philosophy articulated) all hinge on this exact concept. Specific cost: she trades her remaining time to decode the living architecture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is shown through Marina's process: documenting everything, mapping pillars, overlaying tree positions, spending weeks preparing copper wire, following diary measurements. The trait enables her success (methodical observation reveals the pattern) and constrains her pace (weeks of preparation). Setup present ("worked in a gently systematic way"), development (copper-wrapping sequence), but only indirectly present at closure (the restored temple reflects her method). One visible trade-off: systematic patience delays results but ensures correctness. The trait is swappable with minor edits ("meticulous" or "methodical" could substitute), limiting the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Remodel" is the decisive action that redefines Marina's arc and the temple's fate. She decides to remodel in the first third, the action structures all middle beats (mapping, planting, drilling, threading copper), and the closure displays the remodeled temple standing solid. Removing this action collapses the plot: without remodeling, Marina becomes passive observer and the temple continues failing. The remodel is irreplaceable—"repair" or "restore" would miss the conceptual shift from imposing will to fostering cooperation. Causal pressure and cost both hinge on this exact action. Specific cost: she invests her remaining months in physically demanding work that accelerates her decline but completes the legacy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around oak branches appears in setup (Marina reads about it in the diary: "conducted electrical whispers"), development (she spends weeks preparing and wrapping, then threads it into drilled pillar holes), and immediate payoff (mist changes color, cracks stop spreading). The method's mechanics matter: copper conducts signals between root and stone, enabling symbiosis. It's present across two distinct beats and causally necessary—no copper, no restored connection. Limitation: while the method is specific, a similar conductive material might function with minor edits, and the method itself doesn't reappear at closure. Cost tied to method: drilling and threading require physical effort during terminal illness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard set within living stone pillars supplies resources (nursery grove, copper wire materials), pressures choices (three pillars lack trees, fractures spread), and structures all tactics (where to plant, where to drill). The setting is indispensable: the pillar-tree symbiosis is the story's engine, and Marina's death "against her favorite pillar" charges the final image with integration meaning. Setup (living pillars, seventeen tree species, symbiosis), development (spatial relationships guide planting, pillar pores enable copper threading), and closure (Marina dies within the restored system) all present. Removing this exact setting collapses plot logic and thematic resonance. Specific cost: the setting's decay creates urgency; its restoration demands Marina's remaining strength.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The six-to-eight-month prognosis is signaled in the opening line, tightens Marina's decision to accept the caretaker role (forfeiting mainland treatment), and returns at closure ("exceeded her prognosis by two months"). The timeframe creates urgency ("weeks became months") and shapes tactics (she prioritizes documentation for the next caretaker). Cost is visible: she chooses purpose over extended life. Minor limitation: elapsed time is tracked loosely ("first week," "weeks," "months") rather than with a live clock that pressures individual choices. The timeframe constrains the arc but doesn't alter beat-level tactics as sharply as it could.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To foster interspecies respect" is dramatized through Marina's choices: she learns the pillar-tree language, plants to restore symbiosis, rejects human domination ("The secret isn't domination. It's listening"). The motivation is indispensable—it redefines "remodel" from imposing will to fostering cooperation and charges the closure with philosophical weight. Setup (diary's "interspecies respect" margin notes prompt her approach), development (copper threading enacts the principle), closure (final diary entry articulates the learned philosophy). Friction between wants and costs: Marina wants understanding and gives her remaining time to achieve it, forfeiting treatment. The motivation could be stated more obliquely, edging toward theme-label territory in the final entry.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is established early ("surprised even herself"), modulates through beats (methodical work, "peacefully against her favorite pillar" at death), and charges the final image by framing her death as acceptance rather than defeat. Tone is coherent under pressure: she remains calm while documenting, planting, drilling, and facing her prognosis. The tone enables her systematic approach and contrasts with expected fear or urgency, creating thematic resonance. Minor limitation: "brazen" is asserted more than shown through specific choices that risk consequences; the tone reads as predominantly "calm" with only one explicit "brazen" moment (deciding to remodel with "nothing to lose").</comment>
