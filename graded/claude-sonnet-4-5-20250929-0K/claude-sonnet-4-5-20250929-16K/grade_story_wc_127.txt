<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is embodied through her fingertip reading of emotional frequencies and her deliberate professional distance, creating a credible working contradiction. The client Thomas functions as necessary pressure but remains thin—his desperation is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices. Maren's final self-application of the blotter demonstrates cost, but her internal contradiction (caring genuinely while eroding her own authenticity) is told rather than shown colliding in a single scene moment. The piece avoids therapy-speak in peak beats and grounds emotion in the static-electricity mechanic, keeping interiority concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, what) within the first two paragraphs. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren files the petal and prepares for the next client, accepting the cost to her own authenticity with visible resignation—"professionally thorough as always" gains ironic weight. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the blotter's symbolic charge, Thomas's transformation, and Maren's final self-application, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights her role. One meaningful deepening (the turn from helping Thomas to confronting her own erosion) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible in the final paragraph's half-truth structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent walls create liminal atmosphere that supports Maren's threshold work and dual purposes ("beauty and function"). The blotter petal as recurring object charges the closure—its return to Maren's wrist makes the cost tactile. Sensory detail (amber light, static electricity, fragrance molecules) is filtered through Maren's professional priorities and the honeyed-tone dusk mirrors her manufactured peace without shouting. Spatial choreography is clean (worktable, entrance, temple touch) and the setting's dual-purpose design constrains her choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's professional service versus the erosion of her own authenticity—is signaled early and tightens through Thomas's transformation. The piece provides one meaningful deepening: Maren's realization that "each counterfeit emotion she dealt carved away a small piece of her own authenticity" arrives with felt weight. Agency is endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in the final gesture of filing the petal and preparing for the next client. No major reversal occurs; pressure accumulates through texture and the final image reweights the opening claim of professional precision, sufficient under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (half truths, authenticity versus function, the cost of compassionate commerce) emerges through concrete action: the blotter application, the static-electricity reading, the dual-purpose grotto design. The final paragraph delivers a non-literal answer—Maren's self-deception ("professionally thorough as always") charges the closure without stating a moral. "Half truths" operates as both concept and thematic spine, driving her justifications and the story's structure. The piece resists tidy resolution; Maren's ambiguity (helper and eroder) persists with earned complexity, and the returning blotter petal reweights prior material without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Maren with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: she catalogs clients "alongside hundreds of others," notices static electricity as "distinct voices," and filters the grotto through professional design choices. Diction stays within her controlled, measured register even under pressure. Dialogue (minimal, functional) carries subtext—Thomas's "Will it last?" and Maren's reply layer honesty and omission. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The phrase "affectionate detachment" is articulated once as narratorial summary but matches her enacted stance throughout, and the prose rhythm modulates from honeyed opening to the clipped finality of "professionally thorough as always."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or theme (the grotto's dual purposes, static electricity as diagnostic tool, blotter mechanics). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "half truth, technically accurate" in paragraph two is restated as "another half truth forming" in paragraph nine, and "professionally thorough" recurs four times with diminishing marginal pressure. The metaphor "purple lightning" and "amber current" is vivid but slightly strained when extended to "subsume the purple chaos." Opening and closing lines bracket cleanly. Minimal filter-verb stacks; syntax is purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The counterfeit-emotion dealer premise and sensory mechanic (static electricity reading emotional frequencies) offer a fresh angle on grief commodification. The grotto's bioluminescent dual-purpose design and the fragrance-blotter delivery system are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—professional helper confronting the cost of her work—follows a familiar template, and the final turn (filing the petal, preparing for the next client) does not surprise. The static-electricity mechanic and amber/purple frequency contrast provide textural originality, but the thematic resolution into "half truths protect you from complete darkness" edges toward abstraction. Transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren appears throughout; her decisions (pressing the blotter, listening to Thomas, applying residue to her own wrist, filing the petal, preparing for the next client) drive all major beats and the closure. Early signal, beat involvement across the arc, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (her own authenticity erosion) all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blotter petal is introduced in the opening line, applied to Thomas's temple (beat one), and returns with reweighted meaning when Maren presses it to her own wrist and files it (closure beat). Three distinct touches, charged reprise, causal role in transformation, and closure participation. Specificity high (fragrance chemist's tool, stained with essences).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Half truths" is named in paragraph two and structures Maren's justifications throughout (paragraph nine: "another half truth," final paragraph: "the nature of half truths"). It shapes her internal tactics (what she tells herself versus what she omits) and charges the closure irony. However, it operates more as thematic lens than on-page constraint that alters a single pivotal choice. Early signal, thematic integration, closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is mentioned four times and enables her business model design (counterfeit degradation as escape route) and her cataloging of clients. It informs her listening to Thomas and her preparation for the next client at closure. However, the trait is more label than dramatized tradeoff; no single beat shows her thoroughness costing her an alternative path. Functional but replaceable with "meticulous" or "systematic" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Subsume" is the mechanic of transformation: the counterfeit amber current "subsumes" Thomas's purple lightning grief, and each counterfeit "subsumes" authentic feelings entirely (paragraph two). The action drives the central beat (Thomas's transformation) and is implicit in the closure when Maren accepts that her own authenticity is being subsumed. Early signal, causal centrality, closure linkage. Swapping to "replace" or "overwrite" would slightly dilute the conceptual charge but not break structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Static electricity sensing is introduced in paragraph four, used to diagnose Thomas's "jagged purple lightning" and track the shift to "amber regularity," and returns in the penultimate paragraph when Maren senses "the residue of his pain mixed with her careful craftsmanship." Two distinct diagnostic beats, method shapes her service, and closure callback. Mechanics are signaled and matter; specificity high (nerve endings, electrical frequency).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk is established in the opening line, supplies the bioluminescent liminal atmosphere in paragraph eleven, and frames the emotional color palette (honeyed tones, amber light filtering through resinous walls). The setting supports tone and symbolism but does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Lyric reprise and thematic resonance present; causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" anchors paragraph eight and the shift from Thomas's arrival to his departure. Dusk deepens into twilight (paragraph eleven). Time is tracked in broad strokes (six months since daughter's death, "tonight" in final paragraph) but does not tighten a decision. The transformation's completion is more spatial marker than pressure device. One gate (middle reference), closure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to fuse insight with empathy" is stated in paragraph five and enacted in her listening to Thomas and her self-aware acceptance of cost at closure. The motivation drives her professional design (witnessing as true service) and underlies her final resignation. However, it is more narrated ethos than on-page friction; no beat shows insight and empathy pulling her in conflicting directions with a visible tradeoff. Early signal, thematic coherence, closure linkage; dramatized friction moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named in paragraph six and sustained throughout: Maren's "kind but measured" voice, her caring "in her way," her "professionally thorough" repetition, and the closure phrase that repeats the descriptor with ironic weight. Tone modulates cleanly from honeyed opening to clinical middle to resigned ending without breaking coherence. The final image (filing the petal, preparing for the next) crystallizes the detachment with visible cost. Coherent through turns, charges closure.</comment>
