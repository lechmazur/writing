<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marisol's grief and anger are clearly motivated, and her final forgiveness feels earned by the lace revelation. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The memory of turning away at sixteen provides concrete grounding, but the epiphany arrives through exposition rather than a dramatized micro-choice under present pressure. Takeshi remains a wise-guide archetype without pressure of his own.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic weight through compass, lace, and memory, arriving at a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Marisol whispers forgiveness and the compass "points toward a horizon where understanding finally lived." Cost is felt—she relinquishes the demand for a spoken apology—and the lens holds. Orientation is clean. One deduction: the climactic revelation depends on Takeshi's exposition rather than Marisol's discovery through interaction with the objects, which softens causal agency at the peak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The islet, mist, wet stones, and breezy post-rain air are vivid and consistent. The compass and lace function as micro-setting objects that constrain Marisol's understanding and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (cliff edge, grasses, pocket, palm) remains clear. No occupational depth is required here. The setting supports tone and choices without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding her mother's final intention and forgiving the mutual silence. The lace pattern revelation tightens understanding, and the whispered forgiveness forecloses the demand for a spoken apology with visible emotional cost. The escalation is more accretive than causal—Takeshi's explanations do the work rather than Marisol's choices—but the trade-off (letting go of resentment for peace) is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies and the space between intention and words emerges organically from the lace instructions, the compass needle's redirection, and the mother's aborted goodbye. The final image—"pointing toward a horizon where understanding finally lived"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "tides of remembrance" and "cerulean regret" veer toward prompt-label echo rather than earned metaphor, and the phrase "apologies can exist in the space between intention and words" in the penultimate paragraph flirts with thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Marisol's grief-laden perception. Takeshi's dialogue ("The tides of remembrance don't follow logic") carries a distinct, aphoristic cadence. Focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Two slips: "rhythmically placid" and "cerulean regret" feel like authorial register rather than Marisol's idiom under stress, and the closing sentence's elevated diction ("the knowledge that apologies can exist...") drifts from the embodied voice established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many images are vivid ("honey dripping from a spoon," "something dredged from deep water"). However, multiple phrases loop conceptually: "tides of remembrance" recurs without added meaning, "rhythmically placid" appears twice in identical phrasing, and the penultimate paragraph summarizes the epiphany already shown. Template cadence in dialogue tags ("came a voice, slow and measured") and filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Paraphrase loop: "severance wasn't the storm—it was every moment they'd both waited" directly restates the prior reflection without pressure gain. Deductions: −0.6 for loops and scaffold, −0.3 for filter stacks in the revelation beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of nautical navigation and lace-pattern instruction is fresh and specific. The emotional truth—mutual silence as severance—feels earned. However, the wise-elder-on-island frame and the magic-compass-pointing-to-understanding closure follow familiar templates. The lace revelation arrives through Takeshi's exposition rather than Marisol's active decoding, which reduces ingenuity at the pivot. The "cerulean" color as apology's hue reads as ornamental rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Takeshi is present in setup, provides the lace that drives the middle revelation, and his final line about the mother's navigation appears in the closure sequence. However, his own choices are limited—he delivers information rather than facing a dilemma. His decisions do not create turns; Marisol's realizations do. Two beats (lace reveal, explanation of mother's intent), closure participation via dialogue, but no agency cost. Lyric allowance applies: purposeful late-reveal mentor can score mid-band when the element charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The compass appears in the opening beat (Marisol gripping it), returns when the needle steadies after the lace insight (middle), and is held with the lace in the penultimate paragraph, then glows and points in the closing image. Three beats, closure linkage strong, and the needle's shift reweights "north" as emotional understanding. Cost: it no longer points literally north, mirroring the irretrievability of her mother. Swappability: another keepsake could serve, but the navigation metaphor is purposeful. High 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is named twice by Takeshi, framing the thematic question, but it does not constrain Marisol's tactics or alter a choice on the page—she does not navigate tides, she receives Takeshi's explanation. The concept functions as theme label rather than mechanical pressure. Present in setup and closure echo, but ornamental. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" appears twice as descriptor (Takeshi's movements, the tides of remembrance) but does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. It colors tone but remains label-only. No tradeoff dramatized. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears in the lace instruction ("To diffuse the pain, you must first acknowledge its source") and Marisol's realization that her mother was "trying to diffuse years of distance by finally closing it." Setup (lace text, middle), payoff (understanding the mother's intent, final third). The action is cognitive rather than physical, and it shapes the forgiveness moment. Swappable with "resolve" or "dissolve" without major edits, capping mid-6s. Two-gate lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lace pattern is introduced early (Takeshi's pocket), Marisol traces it to decode the instruction (middle beat), and Takeshi explains it was the map her mother followed (closure). Three beats, causal role in the revelation. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—Marisol does not use the pattern to navigate or make a choice; she listens to Takeshi's explanation. Setup, middle touch, closure participation, but the method constrains understanding retrospectively rather than shaping an attempt. Mid-5s to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The islet setting is present throughout (mist, cliff, wet stones, grasses, post-rain breeze) and frames the reflective mode. The cliff edge provides spatial staging. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it could be any reflective location. Micro-setting allowance: the compass and lace function as object-setting. One-gate (setup pervasive) with lyric resonance (breezy air in closing), but no middle constraint. Mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the severance" anchors backstory (three days post-storm, the memory of sixteen-year-old Marisol), but the present timeline is loose—no clock tightens decisions. The severance is conceptual (mutual silence) rather than a time constraint driving tactics. Present in setup and thematic payoff, but does not escalate pressure. Functional context, but time does not alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marisol's desire to understand "the color of unspoken apologies" (implicit in her study of the compass, the lace, and the memory) is dramatized through her tracing the lace and whispering forgiveness. Setup (compass/grief), middle (lace decoding), closure (forgiveness as the answer). The motivation is clear and conflicted (anger vs. need for closure). Friction: she must release the demand for a spoken apology to achieve peace. Cost visible. Two strong beats, closure participation, but the revelation is received rather than fought for, capping high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" appears explicitly when the compass points "toward a specific shade in the sky... that particular blue that sits between sorrow and acceptance, the color of unspoken apologies." Setup (tone established through mist, grief), middle (cerulean named), closure (horizon image). The tone modulates from raw grief to acceptance and charges the final image. However, "cerulean" reads as authorial rather than POV-organic—Marisol would see "blue," not "cerulean," under stress. Lyric reprise with closure charge, but register slip. Mid-6s.</comment>
