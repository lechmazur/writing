<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to decode the inscriptions is clear, but her interior life remains fairly abstract—"healing tangible" and carrying nightmares are asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Kove's grief is more concrete, especially through the telegram beat, and his progression from guilt to shared burden reads earned. The final choice to collaborate feels motivated but lacks a visible cost that forecloses another path; the weight simply becomes "bearable" without showing what Mira or Kove surrender in exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Mira at the observatory, tracking Algol, with the telegram inciting Kove's confession. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative hybrid—Kove's revelation triggers collaborative decoding, and the dawn realization that the temple language requires multiple observers constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is conceptual: fifteen years of solitary study obscured the answer, and Chen's death underscores isolation's price. The closure reweights prior material (variable stars as chorus, shared burdens) with felt pressure, though the cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early (dome, telescope, red light) and the setting constrains action: Mira tracks Algol, Kove climbs stairs, dawn marks the breakthrough. The telegram with dried daylilies functions as micro-setting, charging the final desk scene. Sensory detail is selective (winter sky, rust-colored petals, lightening sky) and filtered through urgency. The environment enables the collaborative revelation and the final image of the shared vigil, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraint on closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions—is signaled early and tightens when Kove reveals Chen's death and his guilt. The midnight conversation deepens pressure by introducing the shared-burden theme, and the collaborative overlay of star cycles narrows options: decode alone and fail, or witness together and succeed. However, the escalation is more additive than agonistic; no live option is visibly foreclosed with on-page cost. The resolution feels like discovery rather than a choice that trades one path for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—shared burdens, collaboration over isolation—emerges organically from the variable stars' harmonization and Chen's unheeded telegram. The final image (stars fading, shared vigil, daylilies as reminder) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Kove's touch of the telegram and Mira's hand over his. The piece resists tidy closure by acknowledging years of work ahead, yet the essential teaching is clear. Minor slip: "wisdom lives not in lonely stars but in the spaces between them" edges toward thematic summary in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV (Mira) holds cleanly with stable third-person limited distance. Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices symbolic patterns (Algol's dimming, variable stars as breath) and interprets through her lucid-dream lens. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Sit with me" shifts the scene; Kove's "A chorus, not a solo" advances discovery). Minor filter-verb density in the opening ("had spent," "refused to yield," "was accustomed") slightly dulls immediacy, and some diction ("healing tangible," "midnight solace") tilts elevated without full POV grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong images (telegram pressed with daylilies, stars harmonizing, dawn approaching). Information density is high in the collaborative-decoding beat. However, paraphrase loops appear: "some weights grew lighter when held between two pairs of hands" / "shared burdens" / "burdens halved" recycle the same concept across paragraphs. Template cadence in the opening: "Mira had spent," "she was accustomed," "she adjusted." The final paragraph's thematic summary ("wisdom lives not in lonely stars…") reads as scaffold rather than image-driven closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—temple inscriptions encoding variable-star cycles that require collaborative observation—offers a fresh synthesis of astronomy and ancient knowledge. The emotional arc (solitary obsession vs. shared witness) is earnest but not wholly original; the grief-and-collaboration framework is familiar. Transformation of tropes is solid: the observatory setting and variable-star mechanics ground the theme in specific, verifiable detail. Risk is modest; the piece stays within safe literary-fiction conventions without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as lucid dream chronicler is mentioned twice (opening exposition, midnight conversation) but does not create key turns. Her skill at "translating the symbolic into the coherent" is told rather than shown in action. The breakthrough—overlaying star cycles—arises from pooling data, not from her dream-chronicling ability. Present and thematically relevant, but functionally replaceable with "researcher" or "pattern-seeker."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in three beats: Kove's delivery, the midnight conversation, and the final desk scene where it remains as a reminder. Its message ("The burden is too great to carry alone") seeds and payoffs the shared-burden theme. Kove touches it at the dawn realization, and it charges the closure image. Specific, irreplaceable, and causally active across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shared burdens shapes stakes and tactics on the page: Kove's guilt over Chen's solitary death drives his confession, Mira's offer to "sit with me" enacts the concept, and the collaborative star-tracking demonstrates it in action. The concept reweights the ending—"burdens halved"—and the temple inscriptions' mechanics (multiple observers required) literalize the theme. Causally indispensable and present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is asserted in the line "there was something in her voice that made healing tangible, as if words themselves could knit torn things." Mira then listens to Kove's grief, and the shared conversation lightens his weight. However, the attribute is more metaphorical than mechanically constrained; no visible cost or tradeoff accompanies her listening. Present in one key beat (midnight vigil) and thematically relevant, but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Witness" drives the major turn: Mira and Kove's collaborative observation reveals the variable stars' harmonization, and the temple inscriptions are reframed as "an invitation to witness together." The action shapes the ending image (shared vigil) and the thematic payoff. Present across setup (Mira tracking Algol), development (pooling observations), and closure. Causally essential, though the mechanics could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Variable stars are signaled early (Algol's dimming cycle, "language written in celestial breath") and their mechanics matter: brightness changes encode patterns, and multiple stars (Delta Cephei, Mira, Betelgeuse) must be tracked to harmonize. The method enables the collaborative breakthrough and charges the closure. However, the overlay process is summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, limiting causal granularity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory is anchored early (dome, telescope, stairs, red light) and supplies resources: the telescope tracks Algol, Chen's desk holds the telegram, the space enables the midnight vigil. The setting pressures Mira's and Kove's choices by isolating them and framing the work as solitary until they collaborate. Dawn's approach marks the breakthrough. Environment constrains and charges the ending, meeting strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" operates literally (sunrise marks the breakthrough) and figuratively (realization arrives). The timeframe tightens decisions: "through the long midnight hours," "as dawn approached," "stars faded." However, the clock is more atmospheric than urgently constraining; no ticking deadline forces the collaborative choice. The temporal marker charges the closure image but does not alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desire to decode temple inscriptions drives Mira's presence at the observatory, Kove's guilt over Chen's obsession, and the collaborative breakthrough. The motivation is dramatized through action (tracking Algol, pooling notes) and conflicted (Chen died pursuing it, Kove fears repeating the pattern). Friction between wants and costs is visible: fifteen years of solitary work failed, and the new approach requires surrendering individual credit. Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" coheres through the nocturnal observatory setting, red light, and the shared vigil's quiet intimacy. Tone modulates with pressure: Kove's exhaustion and grief darken the opening, the midnight conversation softens into mutual bearing, and dawn's approach lifts without erasing weight. The final image—"midnight solace of that shared vigil"—explicitly names the tone, which charges the ending but edges toward summary. Coherent and purposeful, though the label in the closing paragraph is on-the-nose.</comment>
