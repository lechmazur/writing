<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is sharply embodied through concrete detail—"tasting copper and mountain air," the jealousy toward past selves, the "animal hunger" for innocence. Internal contradiction operates continuously: she chronicles to find pattern yet suspects documentation is futile; she craves her past self's linearity while accepting time's collapse. The choice to continue writing despite "jaded wonder" reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost—she remains shattered, continuing a task she knows may be pointless. Minor slip: the jealousy toward past selves and the feral nostalgia occasionally blur into summary rather than live contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Mara, lucid dream chronicler), where (ranger cabin, eight thousand feet), and when (after finding her grave, time now scrambled) within the first two paragraphs. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through density of impossible moments—grave sighting, shuffled time, dream-waking bleed—culminating in the final image where the lamp's status itself becomes uncertain, reweighting all prior documentation with conceptual cost. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the final line "or had already burned out, or would never be lit at all" reprices the entire chronicling enterprise, making the cost undeniable. One minor tension: the middle loses slight traction in a catalog of impossibilities before the ending tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cabin (pine sap, old smoke, lamplight, birch bark preference) constrains Mara's choices—she uses organic materials for "organic memory," isolates at altitude, and the lamp's flicker marks time's uncertainty. The valley cemetery and the grave are handled with purpose, the headstone discovery charging all subsequent action. Spatial choreography is clean: cabin interior, valley below, pines outside. The micro-setting (birch bark, lamp, floor where she wakes) charges the final image when even the lamp's state becomes uncertain. Scope fits this length; no occupational detail overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: distill chaos into narrative, find pattern in time's collapse. Pressure accumulates through escalating impossibilities—grave discovery, shuffled days, dream-waking bleed—and the protagonist's agency is continuous documentation despite futility, an Earned Stasis with cost (isolation, fragmentation, "jaded wonder"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the text moves from past scrolls to present writing to the final existential uncertainty about the lamp itself, reweighting all prior attempts. Minor issue: the middle catalog of time distortions feels slightly static before the ending tightens; the escalation reads more as accumulation than a sharp turn narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: feral nostalgia as "rabid for moments you couldn't re-enter," the jealousy toward untouched past selves, the desperate human need for forward-marching story when time refuses to hold still. The birch bark scrolls, grave, and lamp operate as image-driven subtext, not statement. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—the lamp's ontological uncertainty reprices the entire chronicling project, making the impossibility of narrative order undeniable without moralizing. "Jaded wonder" and "amazed by horror" layer complexity without false equivalence. No thematic echo or sermonic final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Mara's perceptual signature: birch bark "brown and brittle as October," "twin-edged feeling," "jaded wonder." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer in present beats, slightly wider in reflective passages about past selves. Diction remains consistent (no register drift), and the recursive, self-questioning rhythm ("or was it next week?" / "or would bury herself") mirrors the chronological confusion without becoming gimmick. Free indirect style is clean. Minor cost: a few filter verbs ("felt that familiar bite") slightly dull immediacy in two beats, though voice remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high (nearly every line advances character or atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated: "tangled fishing line," "origami," "feral nostalgia." A few near-synonyms appear ("shattered," "fragmented," "chronologically confused") but each serves a distinct nuance. Minor deduction: one scaffold-like moment in the middle third where "small impossibilities accumulated" feels slightly summary rather than showing accumulation through fresh detail. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, and the final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, time collapse, and feral nostalgia feels specific and earned rather than template; the birch bark scrolls and the chronicler's isolation anchor universals in particulars. The grave-as-memory twist and the lamp's final ontological uncertainty offer non-obvious angles. "Jaded wonder" and the jealousy toward past selves are emotionally particular. Minor friction: the chronologically confused protagonist reading her own grave is a recognizable time-loop motif; the story transforms it through the chronicling frame and the accumulative texture, but the core premise echoes familiar territory. Risk-taking in the final image's tripartite uncertainty elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (lucid dream chronicler) is present from the opening, her past profession frames her current compulsion to document, and her choice to continue writing despite futility shapes multiple beats and the ending. The chronicling trait enables her response to time collapse and constrains her to isolation. Her decision to pick up another strip of bark after acknowledging the futility charges the ending with Earned Stasis. Setup, development (scrolls accumulate), and payoff (final writing act) are all present. Swappability is low—"researcher" or "diarist" would lack the lucid-dream/reality bleed resonance. Cost is visible: isolation, fragmentation, jealousy of past selves. No late arrival or ornamental use. Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in the opening beat (Mara reads an old one), returns in the middle (she prefers bark for "organic memory"), and closes the story when she picks up another strip after the lamp's uncertainty. The material choice is specific (not generic paper) and tied to her fragmented state. It constrains her documentation method and charges the ending by literalizing the attempt to record what cannot be fixed. Setup, development (preference explained), and payoff (final strip) are present. Swappability is moderate—parchment could work but lacks the organic decay resonance. Cost is conceptual: the bark itself is "brown and brittle," mirroring her state.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is named explicitly ("That was the trouble with feral nostalgia") and drives Mara's jealousy toward past selves, her "animal hunger" for lost innocence, and her ongoing documentation despite knowing it's futile. It shapes her stance—she craves what she's lost or hasn't found, which motivates continued writing. Setup is present (jealousy reading old scroll), development (named and explored mid-story), and payoff (the lamp image embodies impossible temporal longing). The concept alters tactics (isolation, chronicling) but leans toward thematic echo rather than on-page choice divergence. Cost is felt but implicit. Swappability is moderate; "temporal grief" might substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Chronological confusion is present from the opening ("Three years ago, or was it next week?"), constrains every beat (waking on floor, watching herself sleep, finding tomorrow's dinner eaten), and charges the ending when even the lamp's state becomes uncertain. It enables her isolation (she can't function linearly) and shapes her documentation tactics (Theory 47, accumulating scrolls). Setup immediate, development continuous (shuffled memories, grave as both prediction and memory), payoff undeniable (final tripartite lamp uncertainty). Swappability very low—generic "confusion" or "disorientation" would lack the temporal mechanics. Cost visible: fragmentation, isolation, inability to move forward. The trait is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Soaring appears in the opening scroll (dream-memory of flight), returns as "remembered how to soar—or prophesied it" in Theory 47, and is mentioned in the final catalog ("Last week she'd soared again in a dream so lucid it left her regular life feeling like the fantasy"). Setup present, development weak (it's mentioned but does not drive a turn), payoff absent (does not shape the ending image). The action illustrates her lucid dreaming and time bleed but is swappable with another dream phenomenon. No visible cost tied specifically to soaring; it functions as supporting detail rather than pivotal action. Cap at 4.8 for missing strong middle and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves appears early ("Mara felt the familiar bite of jealousy reading it"), drives the middle reflection on the Mara who never saw the grave, and motivates continued documentation (craving innocence she's lost). Setup strong, development present (she "envied the Mara of five years ago"), payoff moderate (the ending's continued writing despite futility embodies the jealousy-fueled compulsion). The method shapes her stance and isolation but does not create a sharp turn. Cost is felt (isolation, "animal hunger") but implicit. Swappability moderate; "regret" or "longing" could substitute with edits. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ranger cabin (eight thousand feet, pine sap, old smoke, lamplight, radio she ignores) anchors every beat and enables her isolation, which is necessary for the chronicling. The valley cemetery is handled as a key past location (grave discovery), and the cabin's remoteness constrains her to solitary documentation. Setup immediate, development continuous (lamp, birch bark stored there, floor where she wakes), payoff present (lamp's uncertain state in final image). Swappability low for the isolation it provides; "hermit shack" might work but "ranger cabin" adds occupational texture. Cost visible: isolation, altitude, sensory deprivation. Closure linkage strong via the lamp.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The grave discovery is signaled early ("the weathered headstone with her own name, her own birth year, and a death date still three months away—or three months ago") and frames all subsequent action. It is the inciting cause of her time collapse and drives her documentation compulsion (reconciling memory versus prediction). Setup strong, development present (she references "I have already died, am currently dying, will die" in Theory 47), payoff moderate (the ending's uncertainty embodies living in all tenses). Cost is conceptual and existential. Swappability low—another omen would lack the specificity. The timeframe shapes tactics (isolation, scrolls) but does not create a sharp on-page turn. Closure linkage indirect but thematically strong.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to distill chaos into narrative is stated explicitly in paragraph five ("She had one purpose left: to distill chaos into narrative") and drives every beat: reading old scrolls, writing Theory 47, picking up another bark strip at the end. Setup strong, development continuous (scrolls accumulate, she writes despite futility), payoff direct (final act of picking up bark after acknowledging the lamp's uncertainty). The desire is dramatized through action (writing, not just thinking about it) and conflicted (she suspects it's futile yet continues). Cost visible: isolation, fragmentation, jaded wonder. Swappability low; "document" or "record" lack the narrative-order emphasis. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jaded wonder is named explicitly ("jaded wonder, she'd started calling it") and operates throughout: "amazed by horror," "roll your eyes while gasping," "bitter, knowing, yet somehow still capable of awe." The tone modulates with pressure—tighter in the opening, expands in reflection, tightens again at the ending's lamp image. Setup present (jealousy and brittleness in opening), development strong (the millionth impossible still steals breath), payoff direct (final "twin-edged feeling" and the lamp's uncertainty charge the ending with both exhaustion and persistence). Coherence high; the tone is consistent and charges the final image. Swappability very low; no single synonym captures the simultaneous fatigue and wonder. Cost felt throughout.</comment>
