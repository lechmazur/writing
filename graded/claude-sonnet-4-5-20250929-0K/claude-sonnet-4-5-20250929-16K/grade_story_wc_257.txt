<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's progression from shattered to salvaged is traced through concrete work, but her interior life runs diagnostically smooth—"quiet passion that burned without consuming" and "teaching withering to bloom" read as writerly thesis rather than embodied contradiction. The commission night yields careful craft sequences but no meaningful choice under pressure; she proceeds methodically without friction. Vincent's loss and the studio collapse anchor backstory, yet the present tense offers no competing pull or micro-decision that tests her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's sustained nocturnal work and the finished pendant crystallize her rebuilt equilibrium with visible emotional cost ("finally, like she was learning their language"). Causality is clean—materials arrive, she transforms them, the pendant ships—but pressure remains flat; no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece runs Accumulative/Textural in method, yet the final image reweights prior grief without a sharp turn or deepening that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory's copper dome, spiral stairs, and open telescope frame every beat and supply the starlight that charges the pendant at closure ("the Pleiades distorted into new constellations"). Spatial choreography is clear—worktable under the dome, observation platform above—and the setting's timeless quality mirrors Mira's collapse of past and future. The toolset (diamond-tipped carvers, resin cure) constrains her method and anchors occupational credibility without drifting into catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the commission and honor the mother's grief—is signaled early and pursued without complication. Mira heats silver, transfers the stencil, mixes ash into resin, and seals the pendant; each step proceeds as planned with no reversal, resource scarcity, or tactical shift. The mention of Vincent's death and the studio loss establishes emotional ground, but those backstory anchors do not introduce live friction in the present scene. No on-page choice narrows options or imposes visible cost scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—transformation without betrayal, beauty coexisting with loss—emerges through the craft sequence and the recurring cherry-blossom/ash pendant rather than via direct statement. The final starlight image and "honestly artificial resurrections" phrase reweight the premise with quiet resonance. However, lines like "teaching withering to bloom" and "curtains of intention" tilt toward abstract philosophizing, and the closing paragraph ("felt, finally, like she was learning their language") asserts earned wisdom without anchoring it in a specific on-page struggle or renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose sustains a lyric, observational distance with controlled diction—"copper dome green with age," "dawn through fog," "ash-infused resin catching celestial light"—and the perceptual signature (grief filtered through craft detail) remains character-specific. Filter verbs ("watching metal transform," "thought about curtains") appear frequently but read voice-motivated rather than dulling. Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and no head-hopping or POV leakage disrupts focalization. Under peak craft moments, syntax tightens without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high across the craft beats. Minor scaffold appears: "After Vincent's death, after the creditors, after waking on her sister's couch" is clean parallelism, but "genuinely artificial" and "honestly artificial" repeat the oxymoron without reweighting it. The phrase "curtains of intention—how people hung barriers" paraphrases itself across the dash. No loops obscure causality, and the figurative load (cherry blossoms as resurrection, stars as language) remains coherent. Line-level clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mourning jewelry as profession offers fresh occupational ground, and the observatory-as-studio frame is specific. The tattoo-stencil commission and ash-in-resin technique ground the premise in concrete craft rather than generic symbolism. Yet the emotional arc—solitary artisan finds peace through transformative work—follows a familiar template, and the resolution (she feels she's learning the stars' language) arrives without a non-obvious turn. The origami-message method and coordinates-inside-crane detail add textural specificity but do not alter the arc's shape.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira appears in every beat and performs the entire craft sequence, but her choices are procedural execution rather than decisions under pressure. She heats, transfers, carves, pours, and seals without friction, setback, or competing impulse. The backstory collapse (Vincent's death, studio loss) is recounted, not dramatized as a present choice. No key turn traces to her agency; the commission arrives pre-solved.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vellum stencil is introduced early ("delicate as spiderweb"), handled at midpoint (pressed against warmed silver, image transfer with "painstaking precision"), and its cherry-blossom pattern charges the final pendant image. The object enables the central craft beat and its ghostlike transferred lines become "small resurrection." Not indispensable—another memorial image could substitute—but the stencil's translucency and the daughter's unrealized tattoo add specificity and tie the mother's grief to the ending's visual charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" appears once as abstract reflection ("how people hung barriers between themselves and their pain, how mourning jewelry was both veil and window") without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The concept is described rather than dramatized; Mira does not wrestle with how to lower or raise such a barrier on the page. It reads as thematic gloss rather than a stake that shapes the action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" and "honestly artificial" label the jewelry twice but do not enable or constrain an on-page action. The terms describe the oxymoron of beauty-from-death without imposing a visible tradeoff or forcing Mira to navigate tension between authenticity and construction. The attribute is asserted rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" recurs: the mother's note asks to "illuminate the darkness of her loss," and the final pendant "seemed to illuminate from within" as starlight filters through ash-infused resin. The action shapes the commission's goal and charges the closure image. Not causally indispensable—another verb (honor, preserve) could anchor the same arc—but the light/darkness contrast threads through the ending and reweights the grief motif with visible result.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Origami figures appear twice: the client's crane delivers coordinates and instructions at the start, and Mira folds a return lotus with completion details at the end. The method frames the commission exchange and signals a communication ritual between "grief-stricken souls," but its mechanics do not constrain a middle choice or complicate the craft process. The lyric reprise (crane → lotus) reweights the exchange with slight thematic cost (reciprocal care), lifting the score modestly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory anchors every scene: spiral stairs, copper dome, open telescope, starlight streaming onto the worktable. The setting supplies the celestial light that charges the pendant's final appearance ("the Pleiades distorted into new constellations") and embodies the "timeless place where past and future collapsed." The environment enables the craft work and shapes the closure image. Not causally unique—another studio with skylight could serve—but the observatory's abandonment and Mira's claiming of it tie her rock-bottom recovery to the space with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is narrated in backstory: Vincent's death, studio loss, sister's couch, then finding the observatory. The timeframe establishes Mira's salvaged state but does not tighten present decisions; the commission night proceeds without clock pressure or resource scarcity tied to her recovery. The phrase "months of creating for others" and "finally" in the ending gesture at elapsed time without making it constrain a tactic or choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Teaching withering to bloom again" appears twice as thesis: once in reflection ("she'd learned that teaching withering to bloom again meant understanding that transformation wasn't betrayal") and once summarizing her method ("teaching withering to bloom by showing that death and beauty could occupy the same small space"). The motivation is told and explained rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Mira proceeds without friction between this ideal and another competing desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is named once ("Mira's subdued ardor for this work—this quiet passion that burned without consuming") and the prose sustains restrained lyricism throughout: observational distance, controlled metaphor, no exclamatory beats. The tone modulates slightly—backstory collapse carries heavier diction, the craft sequence lightens to precise description, the ending lifts to celestial imagery—but remains within a narrow emotional band. The final image ("felt, finally, like she was learning their language") charges the tone with quiet resolve, and the coherence across pressure points elevates the score modestly.</comment>
