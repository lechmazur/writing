<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's dedication and sensory methodology are established early, but her interiority remains surface-level—we see practiced certainty and calm satisfaction without contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The repair sequence demonstrates competence but never tests her limits or forces a choice with visible cost. The "magnetic calm" at the end reads as a static trait rather than an earned state emerging from pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply completes a task and prepares for the next.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with sensory density, but closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—the hummingbird is simply fixed, and Mara returns to her starting stance with no felt cost or foreclosed path. The Mercantile's departure offers atmospheric parallelism but does not reweight the repair stakes. The final image ("preparing for whatever came next") restates the opening rather than transforming it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rail depot, harbor sounds, mist, and workbench tools are vivid and purposefully filtered through Mara's non-visual perception. Sensory hierarchy is strong—thermal feedback, water vibrations, and sound replace sight consistently. The copper pitcher, glass basin, and microwelder constrain her repair method across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment charges the atmosphere without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the drone—is signaled early but remains low-tension throughout. Mara encounters two obstacles (cracked wing, stuttering motor) and solves each methodically without escalation, trade-offs, or visible cost. No reversal narrows her options; competence proceeds unimpeded. The repair's completion does not foreclose a path or alter her stance. Agency is present but never tested by genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from damage to wholeness emerges through the repair metaphor and is reinforced by the water-refraction method and the Mercantile's departure. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("damage transformed into direction") rather than trusting the particulars to carry it. The basin and light motif recur but do not shift meaning at closure. The ending offers reflection without a non-literal answer or conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's sensory experience. Perceptual signature is distinct—thermal feedback, vibration, sound—and vocabulary fits her artisan world. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose modulates appropriately from technical focus to quiet satisfaction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Voice is clear and character-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the repair beats—each action advances understanding of method. Minor template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("The day would bring...," "Outside, the mist...") and a paraphrase loop between "magnetic calm" and "small miracles commonplace" slightly flatten momentum. The phrase "heartfelt dedication" in paragraph five reads as authorial assertion rather than dramatized state. No major loops or figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The blind artisan using non-visual sensory methods to repair delicate technology offers a fresh synthesis. The water-refraction diagnostic and thermal-feedback welding are specific and grounded. However, the repair-as-metaphor frame and the "broken things become whole" arc follow familiar templates without transformation through moral calculus or a non-obvious turn. The Mercantile's maiden voyage runs parallel but does not intersect causally. Risk-taking is present in the sensory specificity but stays within safe emotional territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her artisan identity shapes every beat. However, her choices are technical implementations rather than decisions that create turns—she diagnoses and repairs without conflict or cost. "Heartfelt dedication" is asserted in paragraph five but not tested. She begins and ends in the same stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drone is handled across four distinct beats: initial assessment, basin positioning, wing patching, motor debris removal. Its evolving state (cracked → patched → stuttering → humming) drives the repair sequence. It shapes the middle and ending but does not return with reweighted meaning or impose visible cost on Mara.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The repair shop frames the setting and Mara's role from the opening. The workbench, tools, and basin are on-page and shape her method. However, "repair shop" as a concept remains atmospheric—it does not constrain a choice or introduce friction. The shop is backdrop rather than a stakes-altering force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Blindness is established in paragraph two ("had not relied on ordinary sight for seven years") and constrains Mara's method across all repair beats—she uses touch, thermal feedback, vibration, and sound. The trait enables her unique diagnostic approach and appears in the closure beat. However, no visible tradeoff or cost is shown; competence is seamless.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The patch appears in paragraph six and resolves the wing fracture. It is one step in a two-problem sequence but does not create a turn or redefine options—Mara identifies the need, executes, and moves on. Easily swappable with another repair verb without altering stakes or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Light refraction through water is signaled in paragraph three, demonstrated in paragraph four ("refraction patterns"), checked again in paragraph seven, and used implicitly for the motor diagnostic in paragraph nine. The method is specific, irreplaceable, and shapes multiple beats. It does not impose cost or constrain a failed attempt, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rail depot is anchored in the opening line and provides sensory texture (fog, rusted tracks, high windows) throughout. Harbor sounds and the Mercantile's movement are woven into the repair beats. However, the setting does not pressure Mara's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The Mercantile's maiden voyage is mentioned in paragraph four, its horn sounds in paragraph ten, and its departure is sensed in paragraph eleven. However, this timeframe does not tighten Mara's decisions—she works at her own pace. The anchor lifting runs parallel to the repair without intersecting causally or imposing urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to decode sensory feedback into repair direction is dramatized across all repair beats—she interprets vibrations, thermal echoes, and sound. However, this desire is never conflicted or tested by friction. She succeeds smoothly without trade-offs between competing wants or visible costs, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Magnetic calm is asserted in paragraph twelve and sustained through the measured pacing, sensory focus, and lack of overt conflict. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from technical attention to quiet satisfaction. However, it remains static—no pressure forces a shift, and the final image restates rather than charges the opening mood.</comment>
