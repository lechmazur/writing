<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's interior life is vivid and embodied through selective attention—her small hands grinding ink, her reverence for crumbling books—and the final renunciation (dissolution alongside the library) is earned by her centuries-long guardianship and the escalating collapse. The emotional logic of contentment at closure reads credible given her arc from guardian to witness to "unmaker of lies." Minor weakness: her contradictory impulses (preservation vs. destruction of the library itself) could press harder in scene; the shift from tending to releasing feels more stated than dramatized in micro-choices. No relationship crucible is present, which fits the solitary scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by ~100 words; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly as Kael's task-driven moves—grinding ink, inscribing runes, sending the Chronicle—accrue pressure toward the library's dissolution and Orian's unmasking. Closure lands on-page: Kael fades into memory while Orian reads the rune and "understood that he had already lost"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the cost (Kael's dissolution, the library's end) is visible and the false king's defeat is crystallized. One meaningful deepening (the final message to Orian) tightens options and forecloses her continued existence with felt cost. The causal chain (each inscribed message plants doubt → final Chronicle triggers recognition) is legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is not postcard description; its "luminous cracks," "gossamer scrolls," and translucent walls function as a ticking clock that narrows Kael's window to three cycles and forces urgency in her messaging campaign. The backward-flowing spring and the ink's "purple-black iridescence" are selective, POV-filtered details that feel rooted in her ancient expertise. Spatial choreography (columns, archives, her small stature, the void beyond) remains clear. The library as micro-setting charges the final image: its dissolution is simultaneous with Kael's fade, making environment and protagonist inseparable at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmask Orian before the library dissolves—is signaled early and tightens across beats as walls become translucent and Kael counts down cycles. One meaningful escalation: the final message to Orian (the Chronicle on his desk) raises the gamble from planting doubt in scattered readers to direct confrontation with the pretender himself. Agency is consistent (Kael's inscriptions and her acceptance of dissolution) and the cost is legible: she cannot leave without destroying all proof, so her method forecloses survival. The resolution is driven by her renunciation and tactical ingenuity, not coincidence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each inscribed rune accumulates weight until the Chronicle forces recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth as irrevocable once released, and the nobility of action without recognition—emerges through Kael's arc and the library's mechanics rather than declaration. The final image ("nobility enough") avoids moralizing by grounding resonance in her dissolution and Orian's instant recognition; the rune functions as both plot device and thematic proof that particulars (star patterns, bloodlines) hold immutable authority against lies. The returning motif (the library's graceful collapse) reweights from preservation context to willing sacrifice. Subtext operates in the phrase "regally unpretentious purpose" and her contentment at erasure, which undercuts triumphalism. One minor slip: the line "had moved the world without ever leaving" edges toward explicit theme statement, though it remains character-interior rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Kael's perceptions ("ageless eyes," her knowledge of the Starborn Dynasty) and diction appropriate to her ancient, scholarly register ("temporal mathematics," "genealogy," "drift"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices crumbling texts, constellation configurations, and temporal currents rather than generic sensory detail. The prose modulates with urgency as walls become translucent, sentence rhythm shortening near closure. One minor issue: filter verbs ("She could see through them now") appear at a high-pressure beat where immediacy would serve better, though the usage remains legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates appropriately as the library dissolves ("She had perhaps three more cycles…"). Grammar and pronoun references are clean. Two issues lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop—"The diminutive titan had tended" and "She stood barely three feet tall" restate her size across adjacent beats without added pressure; (2) elevated diction in peak beats ("temporal mathematics," "sunder the lies") is voice-consistent but borders on explaining the premise rather than trusting image. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks beyond the single instance noted in Q6. Clarity at closure is intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—a librarian outside time using inscribed runes to unmask a pretender—synthesizes familiar tropes (last guardian, false king, dying sanctuary) through the specific mechanics of temporal displacement and textual intervention. The particulars (iron gall ink, backward-flowing spring, the rune of drift as "temporal mathematics") feel grounded rather than ornamental. The turn where Kael must dissolve with the library to preserve proof is earned in hindsight by the established rule that leaving would destroy the archive. One friction: the "diminutive titan" frame and the constellation-birth imagery echo high-fantasy templates without fully transforming them through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications, but the synthesis feels more well-executed than genuinely fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael is present from the opening, drives all major beats (grinding ink, inscribing runes, sending the Chronicle), and her final choice (accepting dissolution) forecloses survival with visible cost and redefines the closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Two beats: inscribing messages across texts, sending the final Chronicle. Causal pressure: her decisions narrow options and force the library's dissolution. Closure linkage: her fade and Orian's recognition are simultaneous. Irreplaceability: her ancient knowledge and willingness to dissolve are unique. Cost: she ceases to exist. No late introduction, no swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellets appear in one extended beat: Kael grinds them, mixes with backward-flowing water, and uses the resulting ink to inscribe runes. Setup gate met (early). Development: the ink enables her messaging campaign. Payoff: implied (the Chronicle's rune was written with this ink). Causal role: the ink is the medium for all her interventions. Two frictions: (1) the pellets themselves are mentioned once and do not return with reweighted meaning—only the resulting ink is used; (2) they could be replaced with "ancient ink" or similar without breaking logic. The specific detail (iron gall) adds verisimilitude but does not constrain choice beyond "ink that can traverse the boundary."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rune of drift is introduced early (first third), shapes multiple beats (inscribed in treatises, star charts, the Chronicle), and is causally indispensable: it plants doubt, transmits proof, and triggers Orian's recognition. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Three beats: inscribing in scattered texts, marking star charts, burning bright on the Chronicle's frontispiece. Causal pressure: the rune is "temporal mathematics" that narrows Orian's options and forces his defeat. Closure linkage: Orian reads the rune and "understood that he had already lost." Irreplaceability: no generic message could achieve this effect; the rune's mechanics (drift, temporal proof) are load-bearing. Cost: its release forecloses recall and seals Kael's dissolution. Swapping it for "magic symbol" would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is assigned in the opening and colors her manner (simple robes, reverence without grandeur, contentment at erasure). Setup gate met. Development: the trait is implied in her methodical, unshowy approach to the messaging campaign. Payoff: the final line ("nobility enough") echoes the attribute's thematic weight. One friction: the trait is more asserted than dramatized in on-page choices with visible cost—her actions read as competent and self-sacrificing, but no specific beat hinges on the tension between regal bearing and unpretentious execution. The attribute enriches voice but does not constrain a key decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Sunder" is the action verb threading the piece: Kael labors "to sunder the lies," and the final message warns "the false king's shadow sunders from his flesh." Setup and payoff gates met. Development: the messaging campaign is the sustained attempt to sunder Orian's claim. Closure linkage: the Chronicle's rune completes the sundering by forcing recognition. Two beats: the opening stake declaration, the final message. Causal pressure: without this verb's metaphor of separation/rupture, the mechanics (inscribed doubt → forced truth) lose thematic charge. Irreplaceability: "unmask" or "reveal" would function, but "sunder" ties the library's physical dissolution to the conceptual breaking of lies. Cost: the action forecloses Kael's survival. Minor friction: the verb is more thematic load-bearer than distinct physical action, but its double use (lies, shadow from flesh) charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The method (cryptic messages in library books that traverse the boundary) is signaled early, explained ("the only objects that could still traverse"), and governs all of Kael's tactics. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Four beats: explanation of the method, inscribing in treatises/philosophy/star charts, sending books to scholars/priests, delivering the Chronicle to Orian's desk. Causal pressure: this is the sole means available; leaving would destroy the library, so the method is her only path. Closure linkage: the Chronicle's delivery and Orian's reading complete the method's arc. Irreplaceability: no alternative (direct emergence, sending a proxy) would preserve the library or proof. Cost: the method's success requires the library's dissolution and Kael's fade. Swapping for "letters" or "visions" would break the boundary logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is present throughout, supplies the backward-flowing spring and the boundary-crossing books (resources), and imposes the ticking-clock constraint (graceful collapse, three cycles). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Three beats: initial description, the translucent walls escalating pressure, Kael's dissolution simultaneous with the library's final breath. Causal pressure: the library's impending end forces urgency; its unique properties (temporal suspension, books that traverse) enable the method. Closure linkage: Kael and the library exhale together, making setting and protagonist inseparable at the ending. Irreplaceability: no generic "hidden archive" would supply the same mechanics or charge. Cost: the setting's dissolution is the price of victory. The library alters tactics (she cannot leave) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" and "perhaps three more cycles" anchor the timeframe. Setup gate met (the constellation moment is tied to the true heir's birth). Development: the three-cycle countdown creates urgency. Payoff: Kael uses her final cycle to send the Chronicle. One beat with pressure: the three-cycle limit. Causal role: the timeframe narrows her window and forces the final gamble. Two frictions: (1) "the pause of shifting constellations" is more poetic anchor than tracked clock—it signals a rare celestial moment but does not constrain moment-to-moment tactics; (2) the cycles are mentioned but not felt as a live countdown (we do not see her racing against the second or third cycle's end). The timeframe tightens decisions but does not alter moves beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation (unmask Orian) is stated in the opening, drives every beat (grinding ink, inscribing runes, sending the Chronicle), and structures the entire plot. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Four beats: declaration of purpose, tailored messages to scholars/priests, star-chart marking, Chronicle delivery. Causal pressure: the desire to expose the pretender is the reason for all actions and the source of conflict with the library's dissolution. Closure linkage: Orian's recognition fulfills the motivation and Kael's contentment flows from success. Irreplaceability: no other motive (preservation, revenge, scholarship) would generate the same tactics or closure image. Cost: achieving the goal forecloses her existence. The motivation is conflicted (preservation vs. destruction of the library) and that friction charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Graceful collapse is coherent from the opening ("the library itself was dying—gracefully, inevitably") through the ending ("The library exhaled its last breath, and she with it, content in her dissolution"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Tone modulates with pressure: elegiac and measured in the opening, sharpening slightly as walls become translucent, settling into serene acceptance at closure. Three beats: opening description, escalating translucency, final exhalation. The tone charges the final image by framing dissolution as beautiful rather than tragic, consistent with "regally unpretentious" and "nobility enough." One friction: the tone is stable rather than dynamically shifting—the piece maintains one mood (dignified decline) throughout, which fits the concept but does not surprise or reweight meaning at the end. Still, the tone constrains the emotional register and makes the closure legible.</comment>
