<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's interior life is concrete and embodied—her relationship with the parasol shows contradictory impulses (cherishing/breaking, gripping/releasing) acting simultaneously. The shift from suicidal tourist to patient volunteer is earned through accumulative micro-choices (carrying the parasol, database work, boat rescue). Minor slip: the grandmother's observation "eyes of someone who has already crossed over" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's filtered through translation. The final choice to stay through summer feels motivated by prior causality with visible cost (appointment remains, but she defers).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Vera suspends between cancellation and commitment, the fold in patience crystallized in the final image with felt cost (appointment still waiting, but urgency dissolved). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs: the rescue scene reweights her stance from "useful before the end" to discovery that "letting go and holding on were sometimes the same gesture." Cost is legible in the laptop scene and her decision to defer without canceling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina supplies concrete sensory grounding (cracking bergs, blue-white channels, ancient ice scent) and constrains action (shrinking ice pan forces the rescue). The parasol functions as micro-setting, recurring with shifting weight (intact heirloom → broken tip → "delicate and improbably strong"). Spatial choreography is clean (dock, boat, shelter). The ice itself mirrors the theme of dissolution/persistence without becoming overt symbolism. Minor note: "prefab shelter" is generic; one interior detail would sharpen the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Vera's relationship with her planned death. One meaningful tightening: the rescue scene forces her to inhabit the liminal space she sought, which reweights the appointment. The grandmother's touch and song deepen the pressure without reversing it. Agency reads as Earned Stasis with a twist—she neither cancels nor proceeds, a renunciation of urgency that forecloses the original timeline with visible cost (summer commitment, appointment still open). Coincidence (the rescue) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the parasol's fracture, ice dissolution, the "fold in patience," gripping/releasing. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing—the parasol's crack hasn't spread, mirroring Vera's suspended state. Subtext operates in the grandmother's song and Vera's deferral (not cancellation). The piece resists binary resolution; Vera's crossing-over-while-breathing is neither recovery nor commitment to death. Minor slip: "letting go and holding on were sometimes the same gesture" edges toward thematic statement, though it's earned by prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance. Voice is distinct—"symphony of cracking bergs," "goodbyes distributed like unwanted gifts," "windborne solace"—and diction remains controlled. Marcus's dialogue feels functional but brief; Vera's perceptual signature (interpreting marina sounds "like sheet music," noticing the parasol's tip in lamplight) is consistent. The grandmother's translated line is clean. One minor slip: "relationship with reality had loosened, like a knot finally surrendering to patient fingers" uses elevated register at a reflective beat but remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., parasol establishes heirloom,break, prophetic feeling in one beat). Rhythm varies purposefully—longer reflection in shelter, shorter action on boat. Two minor artifacts: "she simply opened her eyes and found that her relationship with reality had loosened" leans scaffold-like (the "simply...found" construction); "sounds like ice breaking, like spring approaching, like the earth itself exhaling" stacks three similes in sequence, diluting specificity. No paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary. The final paragraph delivers clean propulsion without summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise is recognizable from contemporary discourse, but the arctic disaster-relief frame and the "fold in patience" (neither advancing nor retreating) offer a fresh synthesis. The parasol as wounded heirloom that persists is specific and non-obvious. Emotional arc—crossing over while breathing—feels earned rather than gimmicky. Risk: the reflective mode and open ending commit fully without hedging. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would not work unchanged with generic names/places. One reservation: the setup (assisted death, disaster relief, parasol) reads as carefully assembled rather than inevitable; the synthesis is strong but the seams are faintly visible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera as euthanasia tourist frames the opening and shapes the laptop scene (finger hovering over cancellation). Her choice to defer the appointment is the story's key turn. Present in setup, middle (rescue complicates her stance), and ending (decision to stay through summer). Causal pressure: the identity constrains her initial worldview and the shift forecloses the original timeline with cost. Swappability check: "terminally ill volunteer" could substitute with minor edits, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The parasol appears in three beats: opening (broken tip feels prophetic), boat scene (she folds it carefully), ending (examines the crack, finds it hasn't spread). Setup and closure presence are strong; middle beat is brief but purposeful. The final image reweights the parasol from symbol of her own fracture to emblem of persistence. Cost connection: carrying the broken object embodies her liminal state. Slight deduction: middle beat is observational rather than action-driven, and the parasol doesn't constrain a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fold in patience" is named explicitly ("something had shifted, a fold in patience she hadn't known existed") and shapes Vera's ending stance (suspended, neither advancing nor retreating). It alters her relationship to the appointment (doesn't cancel, doesn't proceed). Present in setup (the shift after waking), invoked at closure (the decision to stay). Friction: the phrase itself is abstract and closest to label-only usage; the concept is dramatized through the deferral choice but not through a concrete action that tests it under pressure mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is introduced explicitly ("She gripped reality loosely now, like holding water in cupped palms") and linked to her increased effectiveness (database work with "unexpected grace"). It enables the rescue scene (she inhabits liminal space) and the ending deferral (no urgency). Causal role is present but the trait is more told than shown in action. Visible tradeoff: her original tight grip led to her crisis; loosening permits survival but costs her the certainty she once sought. Middle beat is weaker; the trait is asserted more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Trawl" (through databases of displaced families) is present in setup, active in the middle (rescue boat extends the relief work), and echoes at closure (she decides to stay, "so many families to reconnect"). The action shapes her daily routine and provides the mission that reweights her death plan. Causal pressure: without the trawling work, the summer extension lacks stakes. Cost connection: choosing to continue this work forecloses the spring appointment. Irreplaceability is moderate; "aid work" could substitute, though trawling/reconnecting carries specific resonance with her own reconnection to life.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is established in paragraph two ("disaster relief posting in Qaanaaq") and active in the rescue scene (supply boat, stranded family). It provides the means by which Vera encounters the grandmother and discovers the fold in patience in action. Present in setup and middle; closure references it ("so many families to reconnect"). Mechanics matter: the boat, the outer floe, Marcus's coordination all derive from the relief context. Slight deduction: the method is more backdrop than active constraint at closure; it enables but doesn't pressure the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored immediately (opening line) and returns throughout: dock, boat channels, rescue on shrinking ice pan, shelter within earshot of the marina's "song of dissolution and persistence." It constrains the rescue (outer floe, blue-white channels) and charges the final image (marina sings outside as Vera listens). The ice's dual nature (cracking/persisting) mirrors theme. The setting shapes tactics (boat required, ice limits time) and the ending's sensory envelope. Strong integration across all three gates with causal and atmospheric weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" anchors the story's present (three months post-arrival, post-transformation). The timeframe is signaled in paragraph four and brackets the action. The ending decision (stay through summer) extends the frame with cost (appointment in spring still waits). Friction: the "after" is vague—no on-page moment of waking, no clock pressure during the rescue or laptop scene. The transformation is told in summary. Time enables the shift but doesn't tighten tactics in the present scene. Lyric resonance (before/after) is present but the lack of live clock lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation ("to learn the sound of approaching endings") is explicit in paragraph two and drives her choice of posting ("she wanted to learn the sound of approaching endings—not just her own, but the world's"). It's active in the boat scene (listening to ice, to the family's survival sounds) and at closure (she listens to the marina, "learning its language"). Cost: pursuing this learning keeps her in Qaanaaq and defers the appointment. Friction: the want is articulated but not deeply conflicted on the page; no moment where it collides with a competing desire under pressure. The ending fulfills it smoothly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears twice: once on the boat ("windborne solace wash over her—the clean scent of ancient ice, the salt spray") and at closure ("The windborne solace wrapped around her like a blessing"). Tone is coherent—quiet, meditative, spacious—and modulates with scene pressure (action on boat, reflection in shelter). The final invocation charges the ending without stating a moral. The tone supports the fold-in-patience concept and sustains through the rescue without deflating. Strong closure linkage; the tone reweights the opening's symphony metaphor into something lived rather than observed.</comment>
