<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erasmus shows consistent interiority through his methodical seed-planting and linguistic facility, but his choices never face meaningful opposition or cost. The work remains observational—he executes a plan without internal conflict or tradeoffs. Embodied detail is present (weathered hands, kneeling, scattering seeds) but the character never struggles or changes; he simply completes a task he's prepared for. No decisive shift or renunciation occurs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: layered imagery and linguistic fragments build toward a final vision of "beauty learned to swim." However, closure lacks visible cost—the garden's future arrival is asserted, not earned through on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when emerge gradually across the first third), applying a −0.4 penalty. The accumulative pattern is legible but the ending remains a poetic wish rather than a reconfiguration with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vivid and specific: morning glory wrapping pilings, barnacle hollows, soil pockets between planks. Sensory filtering reflects Erasmus's ecological priorities (nitrogen pockets, tide patterns). The jetty constrains his seed placement and charges the final image of submersion. Spatial choreography (jetty edge, water, shallows) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield with growth—is signaled early and pursued methodically. However, no opposition or tightening occurs: Erasmus encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and the birds confirm rather than complicate his plan. The work proceeds as reconnaissance and execution without escalation. One meaningful pressure point (low tide tomorrow prompting a return) appears but adds logistics, not cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—beauty reclaiming violence, translation as stewardship—emerges from imagery (seed pods as oracle bones, Sumerian address to plants) without overt statement. The final line "beauty learned to swim" offers a resonant image but verges on tidy encapsulation. Subtext operates in the juxtaposition of dead languages and living plants, though the accord between dissolution and growth is declared ("submerged concord") rather than fully dramatized through friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register consistent with Erasmus's scholarly-ecological perspective. Diction (oracle bones, Linear A, Etruscan, Sumerian) is purposeful and character-specific. No dialogue appears; the piece maintains contemplative rhythm without momentum drag. Perceptual signature (linguistic translation, ornithological attention) is distinct. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he murmured," "he thought") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("narrow vastness," "twilight stained the horizon purple"). Information density is high in botanical and linguistic detail. However, two adjacent sentences in the opening third paraphrase the obsolescence of coaches ("No one hired coaches anymore" / "he had driven passengers between words"), triggering a −0.2 loop penalty. Figurative language occasionally clusters ("oracle bones," "keyhole that opens onto an ocean") without muddle, but the accumulation slightly thickens texture in early beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead-language translation, bird-call navigation, and battlefield reclamation is specific and non-obvious; the coachman-as-translator frame transforms the gardening premise. The premise avoids template plotting and offers fresh conceptual terrain (linguistic stewardship of ecology). Risk-taking in lyric pacing and speculative backstory (reef people, coral singing) elevates without obscuring. The ending image feels earned in hindsight, though the lack of on-page friction keeps the piece from full inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Erasmus is present throughout but makes no choices that alter tactics or foreclose options. He executes a predetermined plan (scatter seeds, read bird calls) without opposition. Setup and development are present; closure involvement is observational only. Late penalty does not apply, but the character remains a vehicle for the premise rather than an agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seed pods appear in setup (leather satchel, rattling like oracle bones), development (scattering, pressing into crevices), and closure (last pods into barnacle hollow). They enable the core action and recur with purposeful specificity (lupine, columbine, dead-language names). Causal pressure is moderate—seeds are tools, not constraints. Closure linkage is direct but lacks reweighted meaning; they complete the task without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is named explicitly mid-story ("a submerged concord between violence and dissolution") and echoed thematically in the peace/growth juxtaposition. It shapes the conceptual frame but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics. The concept is told rather than enacted through friction. Present in setup (battlefield submerged) and thematically at closure, but lacks middle causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Speaking dead languages (Sumerian, Etruscan, Linear A) is demonstrated in setup (translating botanical names) and used in development (addressing plants in Sumerian). It colors perception and enables the translation work but does not constrain a choice or incur visible cost. The trait is executed with specificity but remains ornamental to the seeding action. No tradeoff or failure tied to linguistic limits appears.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fertilizing the battlefield is the story's spine: Erasmus identifies nitrogen pockets, scatters seeds, and presses them into soil enriched by bodies. Setup, development, and closure all revolve around this action. However, it proceeds without complication or reversal; the act is methodical rather than transformative. Removing "fertilize" would break the premise, but the execution lacks friction or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Bird-call interpretation (pelican, gull, heron, owl) is seeded early ("interpreting the calls of cormorants and terns") and used in three development beats to guide seed placement and predict tides. The method shapes tactics (where to plant, when to return) and appears in closure (owl's "remembering" pattern). However, the birds always confirm Erasmus's plan; the method never constrains or complicates. Mechanics are clear and relevant but lack cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is anchored in setup (twilight, pilings wrapped in morning glory), pressures micro-choices throughout (crevices, soil pockets, barnacle hollows guide placement), and charges the closure image ("garden would reach the water's surface"). Its dual nature—decayed battlefield and fertile substrate—is essential to the story's logic and thematic weight. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The reef's death is mentioned in setup ("since the great reef died and the coastal roads crumbled") and establishes backstory, but does not tighten present decisions. The timeframe contextualizes the world but does not function as a live constraint or deadline. Present thematically (extinction, remembering) but not causally active in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Letting the garden reclaim the battlefield is Erasmus's explicit goal, signaled early and pursued throughout. The desire is clear and consistent but never conflicted—no competing want, cost, or obstacle challenges his commitment. The motivation drives action but lacks friction or dramatized tradeoff. Functional across beats but not deepened by complication.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" (the peculiar emptiness confined yet infinite) is named explicitly and evoked through imagery: submerged battlefield, jetty stretching into water, keyhole onto ocean. The tone is contemplative and elegiac, coherent through all beats, and charges the final image of submersion. It modulates subtly (twilight to darkness, reflection to action) without breaking. Strong lyric fit, though the phrase itself is slightly over-explained.</comment>
