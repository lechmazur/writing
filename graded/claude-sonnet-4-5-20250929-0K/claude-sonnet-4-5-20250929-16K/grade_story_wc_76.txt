<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to escape "forward motion's tyranny" reads clear, but his interior life during the three-tide workshop sequence feels summarized rather than embodied—"bleak exhilaration" is told, not shown through contradictory impulses. The final wrist-snap decision lacks visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; he smiles "free" without dramatizing what he renounces. Diagnostic label-speak ("latent radiance," "radiance made solid") appears in peak beats without embodied pressure, pulling −0.4.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (lighthouse keeper, rocks, hunger stone). The story operates under a Hybrid lens—causal discovery (yoyo disassembly) braids with Accumulative/Textural pattern (backward clocks seed the final reversal). Closure unit is Charged Poise: the yoyo returns, time shudders, Silas feels his life "becoming unmade"—options reconfigure with conceptual cost (fate's design unraveling). However, the exact on-page cost remains oblique; the final image asserts freedom without showing what specific path he forecloses or what he loses in the reversal, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse, hunger stone, and tide cycle anchor space and time effectively. The yoyo's bronze axle and crystal seed constrain the climax choice—Silas must reconstruct the mechanism to activate reversal. Sensory detail (slick rocks, salt wind, corroded bronze) filters through POV priorities. The recurring backward clocks and the hunger stone's dual appearance (emergence, then blazing beneath waves) charge the final image with purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escaping fate's forward pull—is signaled early and tightens when Silas discovers the yoyo's compressed moments. One meaningful turn occurs when he reassembles the device and throws it, snapping his wrist backward to reverse the pull. Agency is present (decision to activate), but the cost of that reversal remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized with visible trade-off or loss on the page, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—time as spiral, fate as constructed—emerges from the backward clocks, yoyo mechanism, and hunger stone inscriptions without overt moralizing. The final image (yoyo returning, design unmade) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, "latent radiance" and "expending stored time" veer toward abstract concept-speak rather than lived particulars, and the crystal seed's thematic payload is told more than dramatized, preventing higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Silas's perceptual signature (clock-maker focus on gears, axles, mechanisms) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled, though elevated register ("neatly inventive rebellion," "bleak exhilaration") occasionally drifts above the focalizer's natural lexicon during peak beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional. Phrase "latent radiance" recurs as a concept-label rather than sensory anchor, but voice coherence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; the yoyo disassembly sequence compresses three tide cycles efficiently. However, paraphrase loops appear: "latent radiance—energy waiting, coiled in time itself" and "radiance made solid, time made tangible" restate the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the workshop passage ("Coffee went cold. Rain hammered. Wind screamed. Silas barely noticed.") reads as list-like stacking (−0.4). Figurative phrases ("hunger stone emerged like a gray tooth," "trailing light like a comet") are vivid but cluster without pattern-teaching, nearing overwriting in the final third (−0.3). Cumulative artifact penalty totals −0.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper who crafts backward clocks discovers an ancient time-reversing yoyo—synthesizes clock-making craft with metaphysical stakes in a fresh register. The yoyo's "string wound through dimensions" and "compressed moments pressed into bronze" offer specific, non-obvious world logic. Risk-taking (literal time reversal via yo-yo throw) heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the "fate as spiral" theme and hunger stone's drought-as-time-expenditure backstory echo familiar time-manipulation templates; transformation through lived detail is present but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: Silas introduced immediately as counter clockwise clock maker. Development: his twenty-year craft of backward clocks enables recognition of the yoyo's resonance and guides his reconstruction. Payoff: his wrist-snap decision to reverse the yoyo's throw enacts the closure turn. Two distinct beats (recognition, reconstruction) plus closure participation; causal pressure evident. However, the trait feels more thematic anchor than lived constraint—removing "clockmaker" and substituting "tinkerer" would require only minor edits. Cost tied to the trait is conceptual rather than visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: hunger stone emerges in paragraph one, wedging the yoyo. Development: its ancient markings prime Silas's understanding of "expended radiance" and the yoyo's purpose mid-story. Payoff: the stone "blazed with latent radiance beneath the rising waves" in the final paragraph, charging the closure image. Three beats with evolving meaning; the stone's dual state (warning carved, then blazing) reweights prior material. Strong causal and closure linkage; irreplaceability high—no generic rock would carry the inscriptions and the blazing return.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "latent radiance" named when Silas first touches the yoyo. Development: the concept structures his interpretation of the crystal seed and the hunger stone's history (people "expending their latent radiance"). Payoff: the stone "blazed with latent radiance" at closure. Present across three beats, but the concept remains largely thematic—label-speak that explains rather than constrains choice. Silas's tactics (disassembly, reconstruction) would proceed identically if the energy were called "compressed time" or "stored moments." Scores mid-band for presence and thematic coherence but lacks mechanical irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: "neatly inventive" appears twice in early paragraphs as a label for Silas's rebellion and his modifications. Development: the trait surfaces again when he reassembles the yoyo "with his neatly inventive modifications." Payoff: absent from the closure image. The trait is mentioned but not dramatized with visible cost or enabling constraint—his modifications (gears, wire, crystal) are functional choices any skilled maker might attempt. Swappable with "clever" or "resourceful" without structural loss. Caps at 4.6 for missing closure participation; late-phrase introduction and ornamental use subtract further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to step beyond fate's design required initiation" signals the action midway. Development: Silas's understanding that he must activate (not merely study) the yoyo shapes the reconstruction sequence. Payoff: the wrist-snap throw and return ("something fundamental clicked counter clockwise") enacts the initiation and delivers the closure turn. Causal pressure high; the action redefines Silas's agency from passive study to active reversal. Irreplaceability strong—removing "initiate" would collapse the story's metaphysical stakes. Early signal (~40% mark) and closure centrality justify high score; slight late introduction relative to word count prevents ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "through reverse-engineering the puzzle of an ancient yoyo" appears explicitly in paragraph three, framing the method. Development: the disassembly sequence (layers, inscriptions, crystal seed discovery) occupies two full paragraphs and structures Silas's knowledge gain. Payoff: the method's product—the reconstructed yoyo with modifications—becomes the tool for the closure act. Two distinct beats; causal pressure evident. However, the mechanics of reverse-engineering (how he reads inscriptions, how he knows which gear to add) remain summary rather than dramatized, reducing irreplaceability slightly. Strong integration but not indispensable—another discovery method could yield similar closure with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "mysterious lighthouse on a rocky island" anchors the opening. Development: the workshop (backward clocks, largest clock for resonance test) provides tools for reconstruction; the tower rail supplies the launch point. Payoff: Silas stands "at the lighthouse rail" to throw the yoyo, and the setting's isolation underscores his solitary initiation. Three beats with purposeful micro-setting (workshop, rail). The lighthouse's verticality and isolation charge the final image but are not mechanically irreplaceable—a clifftop or tower would serve similarly. Scores solidly for presence and atmospheric coherence; lacks unique constraint that only a lighthouse could provide.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "under the slow exhale of low tide" opens the story; tide cycle frames Silas's descent to the hunger stone. Development: "three tide cycles" compress the workshop sequence, signaling duration. Payoff: "the tide had turned again" and "the hunger stone would soon disappear beneath dark water" in the penultimate paragraph reintroduce the clock. Timeframe present across three beats and tracks causally, but it does not tighten tactics—Silas works "barely noticing" external pressure, and the final throw occurs after the tide turns without urgency. The clock is legible but passive; no decision is forced by its constraint. Scores mid-band for coherent tracking without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setup: Silas's twenty-year rebellion against "the tyranny of forward motion" establishes the desire early. Development: discovering the yoyo's power to "retrieve what was thrown forward" dramatizes the possibility of stepping beyond fate. Payoff: the wrist-snap reversal enacts the motivation's fulfillment; Silas feels "the design of his life becoming unmade." Desire is legible and conflicted (he trembles, works through exhaustion), but the friction between wanting freedom and fearing its cost remains understated—no visible trade-off or loss dramatized on the page. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage; lack of embodied cost in the final choice caps the score at 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "bleak exhilaration" appears in paragraph four during the discovery. Development: tone modulates through the workshop sequence (rain, wind, cold coffee) and again at the final throw ("bleak dawn"). Payoff: the closing line ("He smiled in the bleak dawn, exhilarated, initiated, free") directly reprises both adjectives, charging the closure image. Coherent through turns; the oxymoronic pairing (bleak + exhilaration) reflects Silas's contradictory state. Strong pattern and closure resonance. Slight deduction for the tone being asserted via label in the final line rather than fully embodied through sensory or behavioral detail, but overall integration is high.</comment>
