<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interior grief is embodied through specific physical acts—kneeling, pressing palms, following the ring's pull—and her journey shows contradictory impulses (the drive to map grief versus accepting its unmappability). The wife's death three seasons ago anchors motivation, and the final choice to remain kneeling reflects earned acceptance with visible cost: she stops seeking escape. Minor slip: the shift from "determination to map her way through the unmappable" to discovering "there was no map" reads slightly over-articulated for peak realization, edging toward diagnostic clarity rather than embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through gathered musical notes, intensifying vibrations, and deepening sensory absorption until the stillpoint arrival reweights all prior material. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara kneels, accepts coexistence of love and grief, and stops fleeing—with felt cost: she forgoes further cartographic mastery and embraces presence over control. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when notes accelerate and the melody completes, narrowing her search to a single coordinate. Cost is visible in the final image: "her inner cartography finally complete" signals renunciation of endless mapping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest constrains perception (Mara absorbs frequencies through skin, not ears) and the platinum ring functions as a tactile navigation tool across multiple beats. The clearing's "absolute silence" charges the final image, making the stillpoint spatially legible. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—touch and vibration dominate—and the moss, stones, spider's web, and fallen log supply concrete anchors for the note-gathering sequence. The forest's resumed symphony in the closing line bookends the silence, reinforcing the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to survive grief—is signaled early and tightens through the ring's intensifying pull and accelerating note-trail. One meaningful turn: Mara recognizes her wife's hummed melody, raising emotional cost and forcing her to continue rather than retreat. The final kneeling enacts agency through endurance (Earned Stasis) and forecloses the path of endless mapping with on-page cost: she accepts coexistence rather than resolution. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each absorbed note deepens investment without requiring multiple causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief as unmappable, stillness as coexistence—emerges through concrete particulars: the ring's cooling, the melody's completion, the forest's silence/song oscillation. The final image offers a non-literal answer to "Can sorrow be charted?" by showing Mara's acceptance that love and grief occupy the same coordinates without need for escape, avoiding moralizing. The wife's melody functions as a recurring motif that shifts from memory to present guide, charging closure. Subtext operates in Mara's physical choices—kneeling, spreading fingers, absorbing notes—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's blindness filters all description through touch, vibration, and embodied sensation ("tasted of November rain"). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular throughout; no head-hopping. The prose compresses purposefully at peak moments ("The ring blazed…") and the sentence rhythm accelerates as notes come faster, then slows at the stillpoint. Minor texture note: "a syntax of sorrow, a grammar of waiting" and similar paired abstractions recur frequently enough to approach template cadence, though they remain voice-consistent and do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character state, spatial position, or stake. The opening grounds voice and the final image reconfigures prior motifs cleanly. However, multiple abstract doublets ("syntax of sorrow, a grammar of waiting" / "not a place but a moment, not an absence but a presence" / "love for her wife and her grief for her wife") create a mild template-cadence effect across the piece, reducing propulsive variety in peak beats. One paraphrase near the end: "no map through grief, no chart that could contain it" restates the unmappability claim without adding pressure. These patterns lower Q7 but do not obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of tactile cartography, ultrasonic perception, and grief navigation is specific and non-obvious; the stillpoint as coexistence rather than resolution transforms familiar mourning-journey material. The melody-as-breadcrumb trail and skin-absorption of language bring fresh sensory logic. The wife's coffee-humming tune anchors emotional truth in domestic particularity. The piece commits fully to its premise—blindness as epistemic advantage—and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking in sensory narration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a small within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—kneeling to dowse, following the ring's pull, absorbing each note despite emotional cost, continuing after recognizing the melody, finally kneeling at the clearing—create every key turn. Her blindness enables rather than decorates the premise: she charts what others cannot see. The attribute "blind since birth" appears early, constrains her perception method throughout, and charges the final image ("her blind eyes turned toward stars she had never seen"). Two-beat minimum satisfied; closure depends on her sustained agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in the opening paragraph, warms/pulls in multiple dowsing beats, "blazed" at the melody's acceleration, then "cool and quiet" in the final image—reweighted from active tool to resting marker of completed journey. It enables the dowsing action and signals emotional state shifts. Three distinct beats; closure participation through the cooling image that mirrors Mara's achieved stillness. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stillpoint is named in paragraph two as the target ("hidden center where all emotional turbulence ceased"), shapes every tactical choice (following the ring, absorbing notes), and is discovered on-page in the clearing where "her love for her wife and her grief for her wife occupied the same coordinates." The concept drives stakes, alters Mara's understanding ("there was no map through grief…but there might be a stillpoint"), and supplies the closure image. Indispensable to logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Absorbs languages through skin" is demonstrated early ("through her skin she absorbed the forest's language") and used repeatedly: touching bark to read sorrow-syntax, fingertips detecting musical notes, notes entering through palms and forearms. The trait enables the note-gathering method and constrains her to tactile navigation. It appears in at least three beats and shapes the mechanics of her search. However, the final beat emphasizes emotional acceptance over the mechanic itself, slightly reducing closure-scene indispensability compared to the stillpoint or melody.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dowsing is introduced early ("She knelt…and began to dowse"), drives the ring-following and hand-positioning beats, and structures the entire search sequence. The platinum ring functions as dowsing tool; the action cannot be swapped without collapsing the navigation logic. Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and implied in the final kneeling posture. The story's mechanics depend on this exact action; removing it would eliminate the method by which Mara finds the stillpoint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The musical-note trail is signaled early ("discrete musical tones scattered like breadcrumbs"), mechanics detailed (each note absorbed through skin, clinging to objects), and the method accelerates pressure as notes come faster and the melody forms. Recognition of the wife's hummed tune is the key emotional turn; the final note completes the song and delivers the stillpoint. Drives at least three beats, essential to closure, and irreplaceable—no other method would tie personal memory to spatial navigation with this specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest provides the unmappable environment that necessitates Mara's tactile navigation, supplies the objects (bark, stone, web, log) where notes cling, and creates the silence/song oscillation that defines the stillpoint's presence. The forest's "language" (sorrow-syntax, mourning-notes) drives her interpretive method. Setting appears in every beat, constrains choice (she must touch to perceive), and the clearing's "absolute silence" is the spatial marker of closure. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "pause of shifting constellations—that rare hour when the winter stars hesitated before surrendering to spring's pattern" anchors the opening and returns in the final paragraph ("the constellations exhaled and shifted into their new pattern"), creating a lyric frame. The cosmic pause mirrors Mara's search for a stillpoint. However, the duration is not tracked in-scene and does not tighten tactics; the clock functions thematically rather than as escalating pressure. Two-gate participation (early seed, closure reprise) with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "navigate uncharted emotional depths" is stated early, dramatized through every beat (following the ring despite pain, absorbing notes with "breath caught," continuing after recognizing the wife's melody), and the final acceptance—"nothing needed to be escaped"—shows the motivation resolved with cost: she relinquishes the drive to map and control. Internal friction is visible: determination versus despair, mapping versus unmappability. Drives choices across the arc and charges the closure. Indispensable to the emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone coheres as restrained intensity throughout: "quiet intensity," "controlled fire burning in her chest," "blazed…not with heat but with…quiet intensity." The prose maintains lyric compression without melodrama, and the final image ("becoming still") completes the tonal arc from searching fire to achieved quietness. Modulates appropriately—calm opening, accelerating middle, still ending—and charges the closure without breaking register. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation across beats.</comment>
