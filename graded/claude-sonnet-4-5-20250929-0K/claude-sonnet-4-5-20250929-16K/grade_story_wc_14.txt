<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stationer's motivation is clear—collecting temporal textures through lamp frequencies—and her invention of the child's history demonstrates consistent craft. However, her "earnestly studious nature" is told rather than shown through choices under pressure. The invented girl's story carries more embodied emotion than the stationer's own arc, and the final walk into the labyrinth feels passive rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. No meaningful internal contradiction drives her decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (stationer, workshop, post-silence mountain town) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates detail—lamp hum, bonsai labyrinth, invented histories—but the closure (placing the invented history in the maze to "age") reads as continuation rather than a decisive tightening or reweighting. The invented girl's compressed-time journey offers a more charged image than the stationer's own action, and no on-page cost makes the before/after legible. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration attempted, but the final beat lacks the pressure or trade-off to land it cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cherry blossoms, wisteria, miniature geometries) and the fluorescent lamp anchors the workshop. Spatial choreography remains coherent across workshop and labyrinth. However, the labyrinth does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the stationer's final action—it functions primarily as backdrop and thematic mirror. The invented girl's encounter with the labyrinth (time compression, aging seven years) is more causally integrated than the stationer's walk through it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving invented histories—is signaled early but never tested. The stationer's morning work proceeds without obstacle, and her decision to place the history in the maze faces no opposition or cost. The invented girl's story (entering at dawn, emerging aged at dusk) carries escalation that the frame narrative lacks. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows the stationer's options; the lamp's frequency shift modulates her notation but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (histories that never were, small things containing infinite worlds) emerges organically from the bonsai labyrinth and the stationer's craft. The invented girl's realization—"reality compressed until it achieved new properties"—carries conceptual weight. However, the final paragraph's overt thematic summary ("the luminous architecture of things that never were") replaces scene pressure with statement, lowering the score by −0.5. The piece invites reflection but the closure paragraph edges into moralizing about the nature of invention rather than earning resonance through a final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the stationer filters the world through temporal texture and miniature scale. Diction is elevated and consistent ("gilded script," "granular feel," "phantom moments") without unmotivated register drift. The lamp-hum notation system and the invented girl's emotional states are rendered with specificity. However, some phrases edge into stock lyricism ("silver tributaries," "pink snow") and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("her more honest twin") pulls slightly out of the established voice into authorial summarizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the workshop and labyrinth passages. However, paraphrase loops appear: "infinite worlds" recurs across paragraphs without reweighting, and the closure's three-sentence thematic summary restates the premise with synonym churn ("collect and preserve what had never occurred" / "give weight to invention"). The lamp-hum notation is described but not shown in action on the page, creating a told-only effect. No line-level opacity at closure, but the final paragraph's summary reduces propulsion by −0.4 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and lamp-frequency notation offer fresh synthesis, and the frame of a silent town adds specificity. However, the invented-histories premise reads close to writing-craft meta-fiction templates without a non-obvious transformation. The stationer's discipline—leaving invented histories to age—executes the premise literally rather than complicating it through contradiction or cost. The invented girl's compressed-time journey is the story's boldest idea but remains nested and summarized rather than the main pressure line.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer is present throughout and makes two choices: to invent the girl's history (middle) and to place it in the labyrinth (end). However, both choices proceed without opposition or visible cost, and the lamp-frequency charting (her defining method) is described rather than shown altering her tactics. She observes and narrates more than she decides under pressure. Functional but swappable with a generic archivist or curator; the gilding and stationery trade do not constrain her arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears in three beats: dawn charting, midday cross-reference, and the remark "lay open beside her" at completion. Its warped pages and three years of data establish its history, and it anchors her method. However, it does not evolve in use or return with reweighted meaning at closure—the stationer carries the new history folded in her pocket, not the notepad. The notepad enables but does not constrain or charge the final action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Invented histories frame the stationer's goal from the opening and drive the middle act (inventing the girl's story) and the ending (placing it to age). The concept shapes her daily work and the closure's thematic resonance. However, the concept is executed rather than tested; no friction arises between invention and truth, cost and preservation. The concept is integral but operates at the theme layer more than the tactical pressure layer, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is mentioned once in paragraph four as a label ("Her earnestly studious nature had always set her apart") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. The stationer's careful charting and note-taking could be read as studious, but the trait itself does not create a visible trade-off or cost. Told-only and swappable with "diligent" or "meticulous" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Refract" appears in three contexts: the bonsai labyrinth refracts moonlight into silver tributaries, competing fragrances refract through her concentration into metaphors, and the final line restates the labyrinth refracting morning light into "something that resembled memory." The verb carries thematic weight (transformation through compression) and links setting to the stationer's cognitive method. It shapes the invented girl's realization and charges the final image. However, it does not drive a turn in the stationer's own arc; the refracting remains descriptive rather than a pivot in her choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Charting the lamp's hum is introduced early (paragraph one) as the stationer's method and reappears in paragraph seven when the frequency shifts and she "translated it into the emotional texture of the fictional girl's realization." The method grounds her craft and enables the invented history. However, the mechanics remain abstract—we are told she transcribes oscillations but never see the notation on the page or witness a constraint imposed by the lamp's behavior. The method shapes one beat (translating frequency to emotion) but does not alter tactics or create cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The blooming labyrinth is vividly rendered across multiple beats (opening perfume, cherry blossoms, wisteria corridors, final walk) and anchors the story's central metaphor (small things containing infinite worlds). The monks' planting and the stationer's role as keeper provide history. However, the labyrinth does not constrain the stationer's choices—she walks into it at the end to leave the history, but the maze's geometries do not pressure her decision or alter her tactics. The invented girl's compressed-time journey shows the labyrinth's properties more actively than the frame narrative does. Early setup, thematic payoff, but limited causal pressure on the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and recurs in paragraph three (the silence drifted up three years ago) and the penultimate paragraph ("The town below remained silent"). The silence sets the story's contemplative tone and signals the stationer's isolation. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—the silence is static backdrop rather than a live pressure, and the stationer welcomes it rather than resisting or adapting to it. Functional setup but no escalation tied to the timeframe's progression.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to collect the textures of different times—is stated in paragraph four and dramatized through the stationer's daily charting and invention of the girl's history. The invented history is completed by noon and placed in the labyrinth, fulfilling the desire on the page. However, no friction arises between the want and a competing need or cost; the stationer's work proceeds without obstacle. The motivation drives action but is not conflicted or tested, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Incandescent restraint is sustained through elevated but controlled diction ("gilded script," "phantom moments"), vivid sensory detail held at slight remove (the labyrinth's perfume, the lamp's hum), and the stationer's quiet discipline. The tone modulates subtly—dawn's careful charting, midday's invention, the final walk's contemplative resonance—without melodrama. The lamp-hum metaphor and the final image's "luminous architecture" echo the incandescence without overstating. However, the final paragraph's overt thematic summary reduces restraint slightly. Tone charges the ending and remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
