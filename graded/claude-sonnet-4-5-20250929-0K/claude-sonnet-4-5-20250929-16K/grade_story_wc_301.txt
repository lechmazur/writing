<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her interior life shows embodied contradiction—the medication detail grounds her altered perception. The accordion functions as witness, and her brother's death drives consistent choices. However, the final epiphany ("her methodical chronicling had been leading her here all along") edges toward over-articulated insight, and the playing scene resolves internal conflict too smoothly without visible renunciation cost. The backstory block is substantial but anchored; it primes the closure without flattening present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the graffiti moment intensifies her reckoning, and playing the accordion marks a meaningful deepening that reweights her stance from documentation-as-penance to embodied presence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she commits to continuing her work while releasing what can't be changed, with cost legible in "raw solace" and the accordion's wheezing imperfection. One friction: the graffiti as catalyst feels slightly convenient, though it does shift tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The disused station, ivy, and river are rendered with specific, POV-filtered detail that supports atmosphere. The accordion's patched bellows and the ancient pump provide tactile grounding. The bathroom graffiti constrains her path by triggering the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (river moving through ruins) without becoming a postcard. Minor: occupational detail (river chronicler's methods) is mentioned but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens through the graffiti encounter and the decision to play. The move from "protective distance of pure documentation" to embodied action narrows options with visible cost (accepting imperfection, ending her flight). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present. The price is legible: she must bear raw grief without medication's cushion. Pressure coheres, though the escalation curve is gentle and the final choice feels more like acceptance than a forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness, truth-seeking, embodied presence vs. documentation) emerges organically from the accordion, the graffiti, and the river imagery. The river-as-metaphor recurs without shouting, and the final image—watching the water move through ruins—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the accordion's wheezing and the patched tape. Minor slip: "forgiveness did flow both ways" in the penultimate paragraph borders on explicit statement, though it echoes the graffiti rather than imposing a new moral. The ending avoids sermonizing and sustains complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature: "ivy cascading over the crumbling platform like green waterfalls frozen in time." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the graffiti moment, slightly elevated during reflection). Diction remains within Maya's lexicon, and filter verbs ("she understood," "she thought") fit the reflective mode. One friction: "daringly methodical precision" in the opening reads slightly authorial rather than character-voiced. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("ivy cascading," "green waterfalls frozen in time"). Minor loop: "the truth was" repeated three times in quick succession in the bathroom scene creates mild redundancy. The patched-bellows detail recurs with purpose. Sentence openings vary, and no major scaffold artifacts appear. Clarity and propulsion are strong. The loop deduction is modest (−0.3) because it doesn't obscure causality, and the closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The river-chronicler premise and the accordion-as-witness motif offer fresh specificity, and the graffiti-as-catalyst is an earned surprise. The emotional arc (from medicated distance to raw presence) transforms a familiar forgiveness story through concrete detail. However, the core structure—returning to the site of trauma, finding a message, choosing embodied grief—follows a recognizable template. The bathroom-wisdom delivery reads slightly convenient. Transformation is present but moderate; the story commits fully to its premise without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The truth-seeking river chronicler frames Maya's identity and her penance work. Her methodical documentation is mentioned and shapes her past tactics, and at closure she marks "new map references—not for the river, but for herself," a lyric reprise that reweights the trait. However, the chronicler role doesn't constrain a middle choice under pressure; it's more thematic than causal. Present in setup and payoff, but limited middle development. Band ~5.5–6.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accordion appears in three beats: left on the bench (setup), carried as witness (middle reflection), and played at the river (closure). The patched bellows detail recurs with reweighted meaning—first as symbol of holding together, then as embodied imperfection when Maya plays. The act of playing is the key turn that enacts her shift from witness to participant. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement. Minor: the object enables rather than constrains earlier choices. Band ~7.0–7.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Map references anchor Maya's chronicler identity and appear in setup (her journal practice) and payoff (writing new references for herself). The concept shapes her past tactics (obsessive accuracy as penance) but doesn't constrain a present choice under pressure. The lyric reprise reweights the concept at closure, but it remains more thematic resonance than causal driver. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development absent. Band ~4.5–5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is mentioned once in the opening as a descriptor of her precision. It doesn't constrain an on-page action or create a visible trade-off. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. Setup only; no middle or closure participation. Swappable with similar labels. Band ~3.0–3.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Allude" appears once: "She wasn't trying to allude to her brother's skill." The phrasing feels authorial and doesn't drive a turn or shape tactics. The playing action itself is the key move, but "allude" as an element is ornamental and late (final third). One mention, no causal pressure, no closure shaping beyond the sentence it appears in. Band ~2.0–2.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bathroom graffiti ("Forgiveness is a river that flows both ways") is discovered in the middle beat and triggers Maya's crack-open moment. It shapes the key turn: from external documentation to internal reckoning. The method is signaled, dramatized, and pays off when she echoes it at closure ("The bathroom graffiti had been right"). Strong middle and closure participation. Minor: slightly convenient arrival, and the wisdom itself is on-the-nose. Band ~6.5–7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The disused railway station is present throughout, provides the bathroom with graffiti, and houses the river's edge where Maya plays. The ivy and ruins charge the final image ("watched the river move through the ruins"). The setting constrains access (overgrown steps, ancient pump) and shapes atmosphere. Setup, middle, and closure all present. Moderate causal pressure; stronger atmospheric contribution. Band ~6.0–6.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Three weeks had passed since she stopped the medication" anchors the timeframe early and explains her raw perception ("the world had regained its sharp edges"). The element shapes her present state but doesn't tighten decisions or create a live clock. Timeframe is setup context rather than a pressure device. Present in two beats (opening, brief closure echo in "raw solace"). Band ~5.0–5.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to find self-forgiveness is signaled early, drives the bathroom-graffiti turn, and is tested in the choice to play the accordion and accept imperfection. Maya's internal conflict (grief vs. protective documentation) creates friction, and the cost—bearing raw emotion, ending her flight—is visible. Strong setup, middle friction, and closure participation. The motivation is the spine of the story. Band ~7.5–8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is established through diction (sharp edges, wheezing bellows, discordant notes) and modulates with pressure: from pain to crack-open moment to tentative acceptance. The tone charges the final image ("the raw solace of finally standing still") and coheres across beats. The oxymoron (raw + solace) is earned by the narrative's simultaneous grief and release. Strong coherence and closure linkage. Band ~7.5–8.0.</comment>
