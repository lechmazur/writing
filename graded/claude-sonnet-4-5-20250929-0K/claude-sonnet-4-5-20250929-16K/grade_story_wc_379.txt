<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's professional eye and healing philosophy are established early, but her internal contradiction feels thin—she acts primarily as a compassionate facilitator rather than someone wrestling with competing impulses. The mother's silence backstory provides motivation but reads as exposition rather than embodied tension shaping present choices. Iris's grief is more bodily ("shoulders shaking," sinking to floor), yet her arc compresses months of avoidance into instant receptivity without visible resistance at the crucial turn. The courtyard gathering functions more as ambient support than a crucible that tests Maya's method against genuine failure or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—Maya follows threads of neighborhood storytelling that build a portrait of Iris, culminating in their meeting and Iris's reintegration into the courtyard rhythm. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Iris "didn't look like she was running" signals a stance shift, and the cost is implied in the months of sealed grief now opened. However, the turn from "raw, exhausted sobbing" to hearing others "the way plants hear rain" happens almost entirely off-page between paragraphs; the key reversal—Iris's willingness to stay and listen—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible friction. Orientation is clear early. One modest tightening occurs when Maya offers the locket, but the escalation feels more like gentle accumulation than pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored: bougainvillea "the color of fresh wounds," fountain gurgle, terra cotta walls, dawn light, mosaic tiles. Spatial choreography is clean (mailbox in basement, courtyard above). The setting functions as gathering space that holds the community's healing rituals, and the final image explicitly uses the courtyard's "gentle rhythm" to support Iris's return. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome—it serves as backdrop and thematic amplifier rather than active pressure. Mr. Hernandez's tai chi and Mrs. Okoye's herb garden add texture but remain illustrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving that listening (via neighborhood stories) can unlock sealed grief and reintegrate Iris. The mailbox mystery provides a concrete goal, and Maya's method—arriving early, asking neighbors—shapes her approach. Yet there is no genuine obstacle or escalation: every neighbor willingly shares, Maya finds Iris by coincidence ("heard crying"), and Iris accepts the locket without resistance. The scene with the letters and the courtyard gathering unfolds as smooth accumulation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No visible cost appears on the page—Maya risks nothing, Iris's shift from flight to presence is told rather than tested, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief requires witnesses, listening heals—emerges from action and image (letters unopened, courtyard as communal space, the locket as heirloom/key). The sandstorm metaphor recurs and shifts meaning ("pain was a sandstorm" / "no storm lasted forever"). Yet the final paragraph crosses into overt thesis: "Listening…wasn't passive. It was following where pain led…proving through presence…" and "the discerning curation of compassion" reads as authorial summary rather than dramatized discovery. The courtyard's "vibrant" and "liminal" descriptors are repeated without fresh charge. Iris's shift to "really hear them, the way plants hear rain" carries some lyric resonance, but the explain-everything ending undercuts the image with direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Maya with clean access. Perceptual signature is present: "objects that whispered stories," "sandstorm calm," her thrift-curator lens. Dialogue is functional and carries goal pursuit ("I have something of yours," Iris's confession about inability to speak). However, voice drifts toward workshop register in peak moments: "liminal hours," "discerning curation of compassion," "embodying that sandstorm calm—purposeful and serene despite the chaos." Free indirect style is generally clean, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("Listening…wasn't passive") sounds more like narrator thesis than Maya's embodied thought. Iris's "The pain was a sandstorm. Speaking felt impossible" reads slightly over-articulate for raw grief but remains within bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images (bougainvillea, dawn light, fountain). However, prose artifacts cluster: "sandstorm calm" appears three times with identical phrasing; "vibrant courtyard" and "liminal hours" recur as stock descriptors; the final paragraph stacks exposition ("Listening…wasn't passive. It was following…holding space…proving through presence") in a tell-heavy summary that dulls momentum. "The way plants hear rain after drought" is fresh, but "discerning curation of compassion" elevates diction beyond the scene's needs. Template cadence appears in the neighbor-interview sequence ("Old Mr. Hernandez…Mrs. Okoye…the teenager"). No major loops, but repetitive framing and the scaffold-heavy ending lower density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox mystery paired with thrift-store curator and neighborhood oral history offers a modest fresh angle. Yet the core arc—isolated griever reintegrated by compassionate listener—follows a familiar template without transformation: no genuine obstacle tests Maya's method, the crying coincidence delivers Iris on cue, and the resolution unfolds as predictable comfort rather than an earned, non-obvious synthesis. The sandstorm metaphor and dawn courtyard provide texture, but swapping names and setting would leave the emotional beats unchanged. Risk-averse choices (everyone cooperates, no failure or friction) keep the piece in the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's "discerning" eye is present early (locket arrives, she follows its clue), she adopts her "usual method" of following through listening, she asks neighbors, she offers the locket to Iris. Her choices create two key turns: deciding to investigate the locket's address and choosing to approach Iris with the locket. However, her curatorial skill itself (thrift-store eye for "objects that mattered") does not constrain or enable the resolution—any compassionate neighbor could have returned the locket. The discernment feels more like thematic label than causal lever. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but the specific professional trait is ornamental to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locket is handled early (arrives in estate box, Maya examines it, finds key and address inside), returns at the climax (Maya offers it to Iris, "My grandmother's"), and rests in Iris's palm in the final image ("The locket rested in Iris's palm"). It provides the concrete inciting object (key and address) that launches Maya's quest and serves as the emotional heirloom that reconnects Iris to her past. The locket's brass key unlocks the mailbox, driving the middle beat. Strong setup, development, and payoff; the specific object matters. However, the locket itself does not constrain a difficult choice or impose cost—it is a gift that solves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The locked mailbox (7B, perpetually sealed, mail piling up) is introduced early and provides the mystery Maya pursues. The key from the locket unlocks it at the midpoint, revealing letters that become the catalyst for Iris's shift. The concept shapes tactics (Maya asks neighbors about 7B, eventually uses the key) and appears in the resolution (letters on the floor, Iris reading). Present in setup, development, and payoff. However, the mailbox itself is a passive container; the true driver is the locket/key and the community conversation. The "mystery" is thin—no false leads, no locked-door pressure—and the unlocking happens without friction or cost. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is stated as Maya's method ("she would follow where the story led through listening") and demonstrated in the neighbor interviews. She arrives early, asks questions, listens to fragments, and pieces together Iris's story. The trait enables her investigation and reflects the thematic claim. However, it does not impose a visible cost or create friction—every source cooperates, no dead ends or misinformation test the method, and the payoff (finding Iris crying) happens by coincidence rather than through following. The attribute is told and illustrated but not constrained or traded off against an alternative approach. Mid-band: functional but replaceable with any patient inquiry.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hear" is foregrounded thematically and in action: Maya listens to neighbors, Iris "used to sit…always alone but seeming to hear something," Iris couldn't "make words" but needed to "hear that others survived," and the final image shows Iris beginning to "hear them, really hear them." The verb shapes the method and the resolution. However, the major turn (Iris's willingness to stay and listen) is asserted rather than dramatized—we are told she hears, not shown the moment of breakthrough. Swapping "hear" for "witness" or "receive" would require only minor edits. Present across all three gates and tied to closure, but the action itself does not redefine options with visible cost. Solid integration, mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (Maya's method: "follow where the story led through listening") and executed in the middle third (Mr. Hernandez, Mrs. Okoye, teenager from 3A each contribute fragments about Iris). The method enables Maya to understand Iris's situation before meeting her. However, the mechanics are simple and uncontested—everyone shares willingly, no conflicting accounts or silences test the approach—and the method does not shape the climax (Maya finds Iris by hearing her cry, not through a storytelling clue). Present in setup and development but only thematically echoed at closure. Functional but not essential; generic inquiry could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard is established early and vividly (bougainvillea, fountain, dawn gatherings, mosaic tiles), serves as the consistent location for Maya's investigation, and returns in the final scene where neighbors gather and Iris is reintegrated. The setting provides the communal space that embodies the healing theme and supplies the witnesses Iris needs. The courtyard's "gentle rhythm" and "liminal hours" charge the closure image. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome—it functions as symbolic container rather than active pressure. Strong setup, development, and payoff; thematic resonance; but lacks the causal leverage for the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is explicitly cued ("The outside world intruded on a Thursday morning") at the moment Iris appears crying in the courtyard. This marks the shift from investigation to resolution. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—no clock pressure, no deadline, no cost for delay. The phrase functions as a section marker rather than a constraint. The intrusion itself (Iris's return) happens by coincidence, not as a result of Maya's actions or a time-sensitive choice. Present at the turn but ornamental; easily removable without structural loss. Low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—to prove that listening heals—is stated in backstory (her mother "disappeared into silence," Maya learned "grief needed witnesses") and demonstrated through her choice to investigate the locket and approach Iris. The desire drives her actions and is validated by the resolution (Iris begins to hear and stays). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized with internal friction—no scene shows Maya doubting her method, no cost or tradeoff tests her conviction. The want versus need tension is absent; Maya proceeds smoothly from belief to confirmation. Present in setup and payoff, but the desire does not face on-page conflict or force a difficult choice. Mid-band: functional but not charged with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is introduced via Mr. Hernandez's tai chi ("that sandstorm calm—purposeful and serene despite the chaos"), echoed in Iris's description of her pain ("The pain was a sandstorm"), and invoked in the final paragraph ("no storm…lasted forever"). The phrase attempts to unify tone—measured, patient, purposeful—and modulates slightly (from external observation to internal experience to thematic closure). However, the tone itself remains static rather than charging the final image; the sandstorm metaphor is told more than embodied in rhythm or diction. The prose does not dramatize calm-within-chaos through syntactic control or sensory pressure. Present across all three gates, but the effect is thematic label rather than tonal lived experience. Mid-band: coherent but not indispensable.</comment>
