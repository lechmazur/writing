<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Helena's motivation is clear and consistent—her commitment to truth against authority—but her internal conflict is largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The "emotionally rational" trait appears as a label ("her colleagues often mistook this for coldness") without constraining an on-page choice with visible cost. Her decision to sacrifice her career reads as straightforward rather than genuinely torn, and the trembling hands are the only embodied emotion in a pivotal beat. The final choice feels inevitable from the premise rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The causal lens is clear: Helena discovers evidence, recognizes the parallel to her suppression, and decides to publish. The closure—her decision to deliver the manuscript and accept career loss—constitutes a Decisive Change with stated cost ("Her career at the state archives would end"). However, the cost remains abstract assertion rather than felt consequence on the page, and the Orientation Test reveals mild debt: "who" and "where" anchor quickly, but "when" (contemporary setting) emerges only through contextual clues like "state archives" and "independent university press" rather than direct grounding. The escalation from discovery to decision is linear without meaningful complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The disused station is vividly rendered with selective detail (pigeons, broken glass, ivy, cracked windows) and the rosebush provides a recurring frame. However, the environment remains primarily atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint: Helena moves freely through the space, and no physical feature alters her tactics or complicates her goal. The illuminated letter's discovery location (loose brick) is the only moment where setting enables plot, but this feels convenience-driven. The micro-setting test is not met; the body, tool, or recurring object does not constrain a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing both medieval and modern censorship—is clear from the manuscript discovery forward. One meaningful tightening occurs: Helena recognizes the parallel and commits to publication despite career cost. However, no reversal or complication tests this commitment; the path from discovery to decision is unobstructed. The cost is declared ("Her career at the state archives would end—she was emotionally rational enough to accept that certainty") but remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Agency is present but unchallenged, trending toward inevitability rather than hard-won choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus authority's "noble lies" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The rosebush's final petal appears twice as a symbolic marker but performs no thematic work beyond ornamental bookending. The parallel between 1347 and the present is explicitly explained ("The parallel was devastating in its clarity") rather than dramatized through image or choice. The closing lines moralize directly: "The truth, she thought, was always worth rescuing. Even when it cost everything." The story asserts its theme rather than earning it through concrete action and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture through Helena's professional lens ("historians give to endings," "trained to listen to whispers from history"). However, diction drifts toward elevated abstraction ("emotional rationality," "devastating in its clarity") that feels authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. The narrative distance remains consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Helena's way of noticing reads generic rather than distinctly historian-inflected. Filter verbs ("she noted," "she understood") appear frequently without voice-driven purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with some rhythmic variation, but several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("truth was dangerous, so authority must recapture and contain it" / "recapture her narrative... bury her findings"), stock metaphors ("strangled by decades of ivy," "fingers from the past"), and template cadence in the reflection blocks ("The parallel was devastating... The Council had tried to recapture... Now she would recapture"). The closing paragraph stacks figurative language without fresh synthesis ("pit of lies," "whispers became shouts"). Information density is moderate; many sentences restate stakes rather than advancing them. No severe clarity breaks, but cumulative scaffold lowers momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—historian finds suppressed medieval manuscript paralleling modern censorship—follows a familiar template of discovery-validates-protagonist's-prior-stance. The parallel structure is overtly explained rather than trusted to resonate through juxtaposition. No element transforms expectation: the station holds exactly what was promised, the manuscript confirms Helena's worldview, and her decision follows inevitably. The rosebush and ivy provide atmospheric detail but no fresh angle on historical recurrence. Emotional specificity is limited; Helena's arc could transfer to any principled professional without altering the story's logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Helena as fictional historian is present throughout, frames her goal (expose censorship), and drives the key turn: photographing the manuscript and deciding to publish. Her professional expertise enables discovery and interpretation. However, her choices are not genuinely tested—no complication forces a harder trade-off. The decision at closure is hers, but reads as inevitable extension of her introduced stance rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in three functional beats: discovery behind the brick, examination and interpretation, and wrapping/transport at closure. Its specific content (Brother Aldric's testimony about 1347 falsification) enables the parallel that drives Helena's decision. The gilt edges and medieval hand provide texture. However, the object's role is primarily informational; it does not constrain tactics or return with reweighted meaning—it functions the same way throughout. Solid integration across setup, middle, and ending, but lacks the irreplaceability or charged reprise that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Noble lies" structures both the historical discovery (church authorities in 1347) and the modern parallel (Historical Preservation Council). The concept shapes Helena's interpretation and justifies her risk. However, it operates primarily as thematic gloss rather than altering on-page options: Helena's choice to publish would remain identical if framed as "censorship" or "propaganda" without the "noble" qualifier. The phrase "noble lie" appears twice, but the moral calculus it implies—authority choosing comfort over truth—is told rather than dramatically tested through a scene where Helena must weigh competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is introduced early as character summary ("her colleagues often mistook this for coldness, but she simply refused to let sentiment cloud her judgment even when her heart ached at injustice") and returns once in the decision beat ("she was emotionally rational enough to accept that certainty"). The trait is label-only; no on-page moment dramatizes the tension between emotion and reason constraining a choice. Her trembling hands and "breath caught" are generic stress markers, not demonstrations of rational discipline overriding feeling. Swappable with "principled" or "determined" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recapture" appears explicitly twice: Helena will "recapture the truth they'd stolen" and no authority could "recapture or suppress" her revelations. The action frames her goal reversal—taking back what was buried. However, the mechanics are abstract: photographing and delivering a manuscript is standard procedure, not a dramatized act of reclaiming. The verb choice adds thematic resonance but does not redefine tactics or options; "expose," "publish," or "reveal" would function identically in the plot's causal chain. Present in setup (implied by "rescue truth") and closure, but middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is signaled early ("Drawing parallels came naturally to her trained mind") and executed on the page: Helena explicitly connects Brother Aldric's 1347 suppression to the Council's modern censorship, and this parallel directly drives her decision to publish. The method appears in at least two beats (recognition, composition of the article) and shapes her interpretation of the manuscript's significance. However, the parallel is told in exposition rather than demonstrated through a scene where Helena works through the comparison, weighing specifics and discovering the match. Solid middle integration, but the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy is introduced in the opening line, provides vivid atmosphere (broken glass, pigeons, cracked windows, stationmaster's office), and bookends the story with the closing mirror image. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric container rather than constraint: Helena moves freely, the loose brick is a convenience setup, and no spatial feature alters her tactics or complicates her goal. The station "holding its secret" is metaphorical rather than mechanical. Present across setup and closure, but lacks middle development where the environment pressures a choice. The rosebush (part of the setting complex) is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" is mentioned in the opening ("that morning") and returns in closure ("had dropped its final petal this morning, marking an ending"). The petal establishes a symbolic before/after but does not function as a live clock constraining Helena's decisions or tactics—she is not racing time, and the story's duration is unspecified. The detail marks narrative symmetry (ending as beginning) but remains decorative rather than causal. Present in setup and closure with thematic intent, but no middle pressure or urgency tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To rescue truth from a pit of lies" is the message that brings Helena to the station, drives her interpretation of the manuscript, and explicitly reappears in her decision to publish ("a pit of lies, noble only in name"). The desire is dramatized through her photographing the manuscript, composing the article mentally, and accepting career sacrifice. The motivation is conflicted by the stated cost ("Her career at the state archives would end") though the conflict is more asserted than enacted. Strong integration across setup, middle action (examination and decision), and closure invocation. The phrase itself shapes her framing and charges the final image.</comment>
