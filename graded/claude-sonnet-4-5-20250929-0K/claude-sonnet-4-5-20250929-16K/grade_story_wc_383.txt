<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's arc from "charmed skeptic" to breakthrough researcher carries clear motivation, and her sister's choice provides emotional weight. However, interiority leans abstract ("tragically radiant in their perfect stasis") and diagnostic ("stubborn refusal to accept isolation as an ending") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice feels more conceptual triumph than earned personal cost—we see intellectual discovery but minimal visible trade-off that forecloses a path with felt consequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors early (velvet garden, Archive tower, Mara's seashell) and follows accumulative/textural logic: resonance structures build through demonstration until the flowers respond. The closure delivers a conceptual repricing—memories as living architectures rather than specimens—with thematic cost (isolation reframed as foundation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell sings and the flower pulses in harmony, reweighting prior material. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt, and Chen's immediate buy-in deflates some earned tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden functions as micro-setting, its phosphorescent mist and memory-flowers providing tactile atmosphere. The seashell's calcium chambers and fractured edge ground sensory detail. The garden constrains Mara's demonstration choice (she kneels beside specific blooms) and charges the final image as flowers pulse in response. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: pathways, tower, shadows, kneeling positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving quarantined memories can survive through resonance—is signaled early and tightens when Mara demonstrates the shell-to-flower connection. The discovery narrows options: "Everything we've archived is wrong" forecloses the old preservation method. However, Chen's instant cooperation and Mara's unopposed success reduce friction; no visible price is paid on the page for this paradigm shift, only anticipated trials ahead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete pattern: memories as living resonance vs. specimens in amber. The seashell's evolution from keepsake to demonstration tool, and the flowers' shift from frozen to singing, create non-literal answers without stated morals. "Translating loneliness into a new kind of belonging" risks abstraction but the resonance-structure mechanics ground it. The ending image (archive humming with ghostly resolve, flowers learning to sing) reweights isolation as transformation with undeniable conceptual cost to prior methods.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: "resonance structures that bypassed language entirely," "thought made flesh." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("The resonance structures?" / "They could remain alive"). Some register drift into elevated abstraction ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") competes with grounded moments (seashell pressed to chest, heartbeat). Filter verbs ("could feel it") appear but don't dominate. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong opening line and purposeful final image. Information density is high, especially in the demonstration beat. However, repetitive phrasing appears: "tragically radiant" recurs three times, "resonance/resonance structures" echoes across many sentences without varied texture, and "through resonance" becomes template-like. Paraphrase loop at "Memories aren't meant to be stored like data. They're living architectures" / "preserve the pattern, not the thing itself" restates without pressure shift. These artifacts accumulate but don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Memory-as-architecture vs. data-storage offers a fresh angle on consciousness preservation, and the seashell-half as demonstration tool rather than mere keepsake shows specificity. The velvet garden setting and phosphorescent imagery create texture. However, the core "memories need connection to survive" premise trends familiar in speculative fiction, and the antagonist-free resolution (Chen immediately agrees, no institutional resistance) reduces risk. Transformation is present but doesn't radically reframe expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara begins as "charmed skeptic" dismissing the Archive's claims, then proves quarantined memories can live through resonance. This frames expectation and drives the closure demonstration. However, the skepticism is past-tense backstory; on-page she arrives already converted ("I've found the pattern"). The arc from skeptic to believer happens off-page, so the attribute shapes premise more than present choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Seashell appears in opening (pressed to ear, sharp edge detail), middle demonstration (brought close to flower, begins to sing), and ending (pressed to chest, resonating with heartbeat). Each use is functionally distinct and escalates: keepsake → demonstration tool → embodied resolve. The fractured edge and calcium chambers provide specific texture. Removing it would collapse the resonance-proof mechanics and Anya connection. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quarantined memory frames the central problem (Fade spreading, isolation vs. integration choice), defines Mara's work (translate isolation into independence), and the closure solution (archive through resonance structures instead). It shapes every tactic: why she came to the Archive, why the seashell matters, why the demonstration reweights all prior preservation. Removing this concept breaks the story's logic entirely. Specificity and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears three times describing memory-flowers but functions as atmospheric label rather than constraint. The flowers are frozen yet dimming, then pulsing in harmony—radiance changes state but doesn't enable or block a choice with visible cost. The tragedy is told (sealed in time, slowly dimming) not dramatized through a trade-off Mara must navigate. Present but ornamental; swappable with "hauntingly beautiful" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archiving memory appears in premise (Archive tower, stored consciousness), Mara's stated work, the failed method (quarantine kills living architectures), and the closure solution (convert existing quarantines through resonance). The discovery that "everything we've archived is wrong" redefines the entire approach. Two distinct beats: critiquing old method, demonstrating new. Removing "archive" removes the professional frame and stakes. Strong causal role and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Through resonance structures" is signaled early (seashell's vibrations carry architecture of preserved moments), mechanics are demonstrated (shell sings, flower responds in harmony, memory rebuilds through space between), and the method shapes closure ("through resonance, the quarantined could become architects"). It differentiates failed preservation (sealed like specimens) from living survival. The phrase recurs with mounting specificity across setup, demonstration, and resolution. Removing it collapses the how.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Velvet garden appears in opening, provides memory-flowers for demonstration, and pulses in ending image as flowers learn to sing. The oldest blooms supply the test case; Mara kneels beside one "the exact shade of Anya's eyes." Garden functions as micro-setting that enables the demonstration beat and charges the final image. However, the scene could relocate to an Archive lab with stored flowers; the "twilight" and "indigo petals" are atmospheric more than tactical. Two gates plus lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Last star fades into morning light" bookends the piece: Chen notes it hasn't faded yet in opening, and closure occurs as "morning light claimed the last star." This creates a temporal bracket and liminal tone (night releasing grip, transformation moment). However, no urgency tightens choices; Mara could demonstrate earlier or later without consequence. Time marks transition more than pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but doesn't constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's stated goal—"translate isolation into independence"—appears in exposition and closing lines. Her work at the Archive and refusal to flee the Fade dramatize it. The demonstration proves isolation can become "foundation of something stronger." However, the motivation is told more than tested; no on-page moment forces her to choose between connection and autonomy with visible cost. Functional but the friction between wants remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" appears in the final line ("archive began to hum with ghostly resolve") and suits the piece's quiet determination and spectral imagery (phosphorescent mist, whispering shell, memory-flowers). Tone remains coherent through Mara's steady certainty and Chen's cautious hope. The resonance-breakthrough modulates from questioning to demonstration without melodrama. Tone charges the final image but doesn't shift meaningfully under pressure; it's consistent rather than dynamic.</comment>
