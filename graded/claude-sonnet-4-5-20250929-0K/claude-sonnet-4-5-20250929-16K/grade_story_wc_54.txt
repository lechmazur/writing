<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's professional curiosity and engineering mindset are consistent, and her observation-driven approach to the terminal feels character-particular. However, her interiority remains largely analytical without embodied contradiction or emotional friction—she moves from curiosity to vision to satisfaction without meaningful internal conflict. The autumn-to-winter work montage compresses agency into summary ("They worked through autumn's shortening days"), flattening what should be pressure-filled choices into recounted accomplishment. The final paragraph's "stoic wonder" registers as an asserted state rather than an earned emotional shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Maya's realization that "hope...was a flow you redirected" reweights the terminal from failed infrastructure to living system, charged by the sextant's presence and the community's embodied use. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maya, terminal, post-carnival). The cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized—which keeps the ending from the high band. The week-long resurrection montage tells rather than shows the tightening, weakening causal density in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terminal's physical systems—water stains, ducts, solar panels, heat buildup—constrain Maya's choices and enable her solution, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (concourses, executive lounge, atrium, gate areas), and sensory detail is selective ("dust motes danced in shafts of light," "calliope music"). The micro-setting of the sextant piece functions as a recurring charged object. Minor cap: the carnival's physical traces (cotton candy wrappers, ticket stubs) are mentioned but never used, and the children playing tag in the final scene arrives without prior spatial setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—adaptive reuse of the terminal—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation occurs off-page: "filed permits, called in favors...recruited volunteers" summarizes what should be pressure-filled complications. No on-page reversal tests Maya's commitment; the solution unfolds as intended without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The autumn-to-winter montage compresses the work into summary, and no antagonistic force (funding, opposition, failure) dramatizes cost. The ending's community flourishing feels like outcome rather than earned closure under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of redirection versus solved equations emerges organically from Maya's engineering work and the terminal's flows, and the sextant's engraved plaque "Navigate toward what sustains you" offers a resonant non-literal answer. The final image of roots, water, and energy "completing circuits that had waited decades to close" reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit theme statement—"Hope...wasn't an equation you solved. It was a flow you redirected"—edges toward articulation rather than dramatized discovery, reducing the reader's inferential work. The piece resists simplistic resolution but leans slightly didactic at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Maya's perceptual signature—engineering-focused, noticing "water stains mapped the walls like ancient rivers" and "defunct air circulation ducts"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within her professional register ("adaptive reuse," "building's envelope," "constructed wetland") without jarring elevation. Minor slip: "stoic wonder settle over her like snow" in paragraph two feels authorial rather than character-generated, and the final paragraph's "vast as the space stations that had never been" shifts into a more lyric register that, while purposeful, slightly loosens the tight POV control established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong specificity ("brass sextant piece, the navigator's arc still gleaming") and purposeful compression. Information density is high in the systems-mapping passage. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "questions" (end of paragraph two) and "puzzle out new equations" (paragraph six) restate the same curiosity without added pressure; "maze of intentions" appears three times with minimal functional shift. Template cadence in the montage section: "They worked...They channeled...The solar energy was rerouted...The excessive heat...warmed" stacks passive and list-like constructions. No artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting penalty under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—adaptive reuse of abandoned infrastructure—follows a well-worn template (failed utopian project finds second life), and the "hope through redirection" theme trends toward motivational-poster territory without a sharp moral calculus or cost to complicate it. The sextant piece offers a fresh inflection (terrestrial navigation tool in a spaceport), and the specific systems-engineering detail (water infiltration, solar panels, heat buildup) provides texture. The carnival frame remains ornamental, never integrated into the resurrection work. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the template through lived friction or a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya (curious civil engineer intern) is present throughout and her professional lens frames all observation. She makes one key choice—proposing the thesis and recruiting volunteers—but most agency is summarized ("filed permits, called in favors"). Her curiosity drives setup and her vision drives the ending, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff) but with minimal middle development. The trait "curious" is more temperament than constraint; her engineering role enables rather than complicates. Score reflects functional presence across beats but limited on-page decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The explorer's sextant piece appears in three beats: discovery (paragraph four), mounting in the atrium with engraved plaque (paragraph nine), and the final image where it "gleamed in the gathering dusk." The object's meaning shifts from relic ("talisman from Earth's sailing days") to navigational metaphor to charged closure anchor. However, it is described and mounted rather than used; Maya never handles it under pressure or makes a tactical choice involving it. The engraving "Navigate toward what sustains you" tells rather than shows reweighted meaning. Strong setup and closure linkage, but middling causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" is named explicitly three times (paragraphs three, ten, seventeen) but functions primarily as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping constraint. The terminal's "layer upon layer of abandoned dreams" and "each group of planners leaving their ghost-blueprints" establish the concept in paragraph three, and paragraph seventeen claims "the maze of intentions had finally aligned," but no on-page choice navigates competing intentions or resolves a tactical dilemma arising from the maze. The concept remains metaphorical background rather than dramatized pressure. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with "layers of history" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is labeled once ("in the way that made her professors both frustrated and impressed") but the trait's mechanics—seeing stains as flows, repurposing ducts—are demonstrated on the page in paragraphs six and seven. This enables the solution but imposes no visible cost or constraint; her creativity succeeds without friction or trade-off. The attribute appears mid-story (paragraph six, past the first third) and shapes one extended beat (the mapping and puzzle-solving), satisfying middling development. No closure linkage. Functional but not indispensable; "observant" or "systems-thinking" could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the governing action from paragraph seven onward: "They worked through autumn's shortening days to resurrect the terminal." The wetland, grow lights, maker space, and greenhouses all enact resurrection, and the final image shows the terminal "hummed with quiet purpose." However, the action is summarized in montage rather than dramatized through beats with reversals. Major turns (permits, recruitment, construction) are recounted, not shown. The action defines the story's arc and closure unit, but its execution lacks on-page causal texture. Strong setup and payoff, minimal middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" is signaled in paragraph seven ("She spent the next week mapping the terminal's hidden circulatory systems") and executed in paragraph eight: water channeled into wetland, solar energy rerouted, heat redirected to greenhouses. The method's mechanics matter—each flow solves a specific problem (infiltration, failed batteries, heat buildup)—and the method reappears in the thematic payoff ("a flow you redirected"). It shapes two extended beats (mapping, implementation) and charges the ending. Strong integration, though the implementation is told rather than shown, reducing causal granularity. The method is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal provides all spatial constraint and enables the solution: water infiltration, solar panels, heat buildup, concourse space, and gate areas are used on the page. The setting supplies the resources (flows, spaces) that Maya redirects, and the terminal's transformation is the story's outcome. Early setup (paragraphs one–three), continuous development (mapping, building), and closure payoff (children playing, co-op, studios) satisfy all three gates. The departures board and executive lounge add texture but do not constrain choices, keeping the score below the indispensable band. Specificity is high and the setting drives tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" anchors the opening ("three days ago") and the children playing in the final scene echo the carnival's "brief joy before moving on," but the timeframe imposes no urgency or tightening. The week of mapping and autumn-to-winter construction are mentioned without time pressure altering tactics. The carnival's departure is setup only; no clock or seasonal constraint forces choices. The piece uses time to measure change (autumn to winter) rather than to escalate stakes. Present in setup and thematic reprise, absent from middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in paragraph six and dramatized through her mapping and design work (paragraphs seven–eight). The motivation drives her thesis proposal and the resurrection project, shaping the arc. However, the desire faces no friction—no competing want, no cost, no moment where hope is tested against sacrifice. The final realization ("Hope...was a flow you redirected") is articulated rather than earned through conflicted choice. The motivation is present in setup, development, and closure but remains frictionless, reducing felt stakes. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is named twice (paragraphs two and eighteen) and modulates the narrative stance throughout: the terminal "stretched vast and quiet," "dust motes danced," "quiet purpose," "patient observation." The tone remains coherent through the mapping and building phases, never breaking into anxiety or frustration. The final image—"stoic wonder again—quiet, certain, vast"—charges closure by reprising the opening affect with accumulated meaning. However, the tone is static rather than dynamic; it does not shift under pressure or tension with competing affect. Strong setup and payoff, limited modulation, but the reprise meaningfully reweights the opening.</comment>
