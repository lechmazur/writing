<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("equations in tidal patterns," "theorems in the arrangement of stars") that remain decorative rather than embodied. The core motivation—proving hope via parallel timelines—is told through exposition rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her "lucidly watchful" observation mode keeps her passive: she watches three versions of herself but makes no difficult trade-off on the page. The formula she derives feels like a summary of the premise rather than an earned insight from struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (grotto, gauge, Maya's work) but the closure unit—Maya writing the formula and understanding hope—arrives as intellectual summary rather than a decisive change with visible cost. The parallel-timeline mechanics are asserted rather than taught through causality: we're told the gauge measures "depth of convergence" but never see how that measurement alters her tactics or forecloses an option. The ending offers thematic statement ("hope equaled the probability...") instead of an image that reweights prior material with felt pressure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece gestures toward resonance but the final beat abstracts rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The grotto's three arching mouths and limestone walls provide a vivid frame, and the tide's presence bookends the piece purposefully. The gauge appears in Maya's hands multiple times and its needle movements track the convergence mechanics. The decorations (shells, glass, driftwood) are arranged with specificity, though their physical presence never constrains a choice—Maya places the silver sea glass "where mathematics suggested maximum resonance" without dramatizing what that placement costs or enables. The setting charges the atmosphere but doesn't pressure tactics at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revitalizing her collapsed research and proving her theory—is signaled early but never tested with a live trade-off. Maya experiences no reversal: the gauge climbs, she writes, she smiles. The "other Mayas" in parallel timelines synchronize rather than conflict, removing tension. The piece withholds any cost: no material sacrifice, no renunciation of an alternate path, no visible price paid for her breakthrough. The ending declares success ("she had found what she was looking for") without dramatizing what she gave up to earn it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme—hope as a variable across parallel attempts—emerges cleanly from the grotto mechanics and is rendered through the formula Maya derives. However, the final paragraph states the theme directly ("proof that trying mattered") rather than trusting the image to carry it. The decorations and gauge function as thematic ornaments rather than constraining symbols: they illustrate the concept without charging the closure with ambiguity or cost. The piece offers a tidy thesis about persistence instead of a resonant question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and carries a poetic-scientific texture ("equations in tidal patterns," "sum of every trial balloon"). POV remains stable in third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. The diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels essayistic rather than Maya-particular ("the integral of infinite attempts," "observer's willingness to keep trying"), especially in peak beats where embodied perception would sharpen pressure. No dialogue present; interiority is clean but leans toward summary of insight rather than fragmentary thought under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing images frame the piece cleanly. However, the middle section contains paraphrase loops: "hope wasn't a constant. It was a variable..." followed immediately by "Hope was the integral..." restates the same insight. Template phrasing recurs: "She'd learned to observe," "She felt rather than saw," "She had found what she was looking for." The formula paragraph ("hope equaled the probability...") reads as exposition rather than scene pressure, flattening momentum at the closure beat. Figurative language is dense but sometimes strained ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful") without pattern-teaching or payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The parallel-timeline premise combined with a repurposed altitude gauge offers a fresh synthesis, but the execution leans on familiar beats: rejected scientist finds vindication through mystical experience in isolated locale. The "trial balloons" concept is more metaphorical than causal—Maya's decorations function as symbolic gestures rather than mechanically necessary tools. The formula she derives feels like a restatement of the prompt's theme rather than an insight earned through specific struggle. The piece does not take risks with structure or voice that would elevate the material beyond template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maya's "logical dreamer" trait is present throughout (she sees equations in patterns, calibrates the gauge, arranges decorations mathematically) but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, arranges, writes—none of which narrows options or imposes cost. The trait is functional but replaceable: the story would work with "intuitive scientist" or "contemplative mathematician" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The altitude gauge appears in multiple beats: Maya holds it (needle dancing), watches it spike (2,847 feet), observes it climb (3,001), sees it settle (2,999), and gathers it at the end. Its readings track the convergence but never constrain her tactics—she doesn't adjust her pattern based on the gauge's feedback. The object is involved across beats and present at closure but its mechanics don't pressure her choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" is framed metaphorically in paragraph 4 ("testing whether intentional pattern-making could strengthen the barriers") and echoed at the end ("launch new trial balloons into the space between timelines"). The decorations function as symbolic experiments rather than causal tools whose success or failure alters Maya's approach. The concept labels the activity but doesn't shape on-page stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is labeled once ("Maya remained lucidly watchful, her eyes tracking the changes") but doesn't constrain or enable action with cost. The trait describes her passive observation mode rather than a trade-off: she watches calmly instead of acting impulsively, but the story doesn't dramatize what this restraint costs her or how a different trait would yield a different outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Revitalize" frames the backstory (she's been trying to revitalize her work for months) and returns at the end ("she had revitalized not just her work but the fundamental mathematics of persistence"). The action is the dominant stake but not the driver of turns—Maya doesn't fail and retry; she succeeds in a single session. The element shapes thematic framing but doesn't redefine options mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Creating patterns with decorations is signaled in paragraph 5 (shells, glass, driftwood arranged according to mathematical principles) and enacted when Maya adds the silver sea glass in paragraph 9. The method is shown twice across beats but its mechanics remain abstract: we're told the glass is placed "where mathematics suggested maximum resonance" without seeing how she determines that location or what happens if she places it elsewhere. The method appears and reappears but doesn't alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto with three arching mouths frames the entire piece and the tide's turn prompts Maya's departure. The setting provides atmosphere and a plausible mechanism for the parallel-vision effect (three arches = three timelines) but doesn't constrain her choices—she could arrange her decorations anywhere. The grotto is integral to the concept but doesn't pressure tactics at micro-level.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" is central to the premise (three Mayas seen through three arches, formula about "probability of success across parallel timelines") but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions. Maya observes alternate versions synchronously, not sequentially; there's no sense that the window is closing or that she must choose before timelines diverge. The element is thematically present but doesn't function as a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in paragraph 4 (her theory collapsed, colleagues called it useless) and fulfilled at the end (she writes the formula, finds proof). The desire drives the scene's purpose but isn't dramatized through conflicted choices—Maya doesn't weigh competing methods or sacrifice an alternate path. The motivation is functional but told rather than embodied in friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is labeled once ("letting the serene upheaval wash through her like the tide itself") and the tone attempts to balance calm observation with metaphysical destabilization. The gauge "trembled," the walls "seemed to breathe," yet Maya remains untroubled. The tone is coherent but static—it doesn't modulate with pressure or charge the final image with a felt shift. The phrase appears mid-story without recurring to reweight the closure.</comment>
