<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is embodied through seventeen winters of mapping and her sister's death, creating a credible drive toward patient revolution. Her interiority remains concrete—"water beneath ice, powerful but controlled"—and her choices (timing the escape via magnetic windows, teaching restraint to her people) arise from established character logic. The crowd lacks individual differentiation beyond Kael, but at this length the collective functions adequately as secondary pressure. Minor slip: the sister's death is told rather than shown affecting a present micro-choice, though it does anchor the patience-over-passion stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Kael, basalt sanctuary, post-freeze). The piece follows a causal lens: because Kael mapped for seventeen winters and discovered the magnetic window, she can time the escape; because the viaduct hums after rain, the Directorate's scanners falter. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the group reaches the first waypoint, the prison recedes, and Kael marks the next course with visible cost (days of vigilance ahead, sustained restraint required). The cost is felt in "how long until they realize?" and her reply that frames ongoing tension. One meaningful tightening occurs when the magnetic window opens and they move, narrowing options from wait to act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, basalt columns, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and purposeful. The viaduct's iron-rich hum after rain directly enables the escape by masking the exodus, constraining both timing and route. Spatial choreography tracks clearly: sanctuary → beneath viaduct → ten miles north to the next basalt formation. Sensory detail is selective (boots silent on frozen basalt, breath clouds, magnetic pull felt) and filtered through Kael's professional lens as a horizon mapper. The frozen lake's mirror image bookends the piece, shifting from prison reflection to beautiful impassability at dawn, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape from Directorate confinement—is signaled early and tightens when the magnetic window opens. The piece escalates causally: Kael's mapping → discovery of magnetic windows → timing the full moon and post-rain viaduct convergence → moving the group through the first leg. Agency is clear: Kael's patient preparation and navigation choices drive the outcome. The cost is visible—"days, perhaps" until discovery, ongoing need for restraint, and the explicit trade-off of wild freedom deferred ("But not yet"). One meaningful tightening occurs at the viaduct crossing, and the resolution is earned by Kael's years of preparation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the sister's death teaches that revolution can be a glacier rather than wildfire, and Kael's maps "whispered of the spaces between, the thresholds where change became possible." The frozen lake as mirror and the magnetic viaduct both serve double duty, literal and thematic, without overt symbolism. The final image—"their patient revolution unfolding like moonlight across ice—beautiful, inexorable, and free"—answers the central question (how to sustain uprising) through a non-literal synthesis of prior material. The piece resists tidy morals; patience is both strategy and ongoing cost, not triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices ridges, moon paths, magnetic pull—filtered through her mapper's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "restrained wildness of water beneath ice," "unyoke ourselves tonight." Dialogue is sparse but functional, pursuing goals (gathering consensus, checking timeline) with natural rhythm. Minor slip: "horizon mapper by trade and necessity" and "vigilance flows both ways" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, though they remain within a plausible intellectual voice. Psychic distance is intentional, close enough for contradiction ("hot fury" vs. "sculpt patience") without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the viaduct crossing and breathing at waypoint arrival. Information density is high: most sentences do double work (advance plot and world or character and theme). Two minor loops appear: "the sensation of the world's hidden forces becoming tangible" restates the magnetic pull already shown, and "their prison transformed into a mirror" echoes the earlier lake-as-reflection image without adding pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Figurative language ("revolution like moonlight across ice") appears sparingly and remains coherent. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of patient revolution, magnetic navigation windows, and horizon mapping as defiance feels specific and non-obvious. The magnetic viaduct after rain is a fresh enabling constraint, not a stock plot device. Kael's profession (mapper) integrates organically with the escape mechanism and theme. The story transforms the familiar "oppressed group escapes" template through the glacial-revolution motif and the technical specificity of lunar meridians intersecting magnetic fields. Risk is present in the quiet, process-driven approach to a high-stakes escape, avoiding the expected action-movie beats. Slight derivative echo: the patient-vs.-impatient binary and "sculpt patience from impatience" phrasing approach template language, though grounded detail mitigates this.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael the horizon mapper is introduced in paragraph four, present across all major beats. Her mapping creates the escape route (causal pressure), she unfurls the map and explains timing (middle beat), and at closure she "mark[s] their next course by the fading moon," sustaining her role. Her choices—when to move, how to teach restraint—drive key turns. Removing her profession would break the logic of how the Directorate underestimated her and how she discovered the magnetic windows. Cost is visible: seventeen winters of defiance, ongoing navigation burden. All three gates met; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct after rain is seeded in paragraph three (setup), its mechanics explained (iron-rich basalt hums when wet, creates scanner-confusing windows). It is used at the crossing ("felt the familiar pull of its magnetic field... rain three days prior had activated it perfectly") and again at the waypoint ("magnetic signature would continue to shield them"). The element constrains timing (requires recent rain + full moon), enables the escape route, and appears in closure discussion. Removing it would collapse the escape mechanism. High irreplaceability and beat involvement; closure participation is indirect but clear in the waypoint shielding mention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Patient revolution" is named in paragraph six and shapes on-page tactics: the group walks with restraint, children suppress exuberance, families carry only what they can bear. Kael's internal contrast (glacier vs. wildfire, her sister's death as lesson) dramatizes the concept's cost. The concept reappears in closure: "their patient revolution unfolding like moonlight across ice." It is not merely thematic echo—it alters how they move (softly, deliberately) and the stakes (sustainability over speed). Removing it would shift the escape to a standard flight. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate to strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears twice as a descriptor of Kael's steps and the group's movement. It reflects the patient-revolution concept but does not independently constrain a choice with visible cost—the restraint itself (pacing, silence) is the operative trait, and "softly purposeful" labels it rather than enabling a distinct beat. The phrase charges tone and mirrors theme but remains somewhat replaceable with "quiet," "deliberate," or "restrained." Setup and payoff present; middle development weak. Lyric reprise noted but not enough to elevate past mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is spoken by Kael at the moment of departure ("We unyoke ourselves tonight") and frames the escape as liberation from imposed restraint. The word choice is specific—more pointed than "free" or "leave"—and the line precedes the group's movement through the viaduct. The action defines the story's hinge: pre-unyoke preparation vs. post-unyoke exodus. Removing it would weaken the pivot but could be replaced with a near-synonym ("break free"). Present in setup and middle turn; closure participation indirect (they are in the unyoked state). Strong thematic and tonal fit, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is introduced early (paragraph one: "track moon paths across its mirror"), explained in paragraph three (lunar meridians align with magnetic field), and executed in the escape (paragraph eight: "the moon traced its ancient path"). At closure, Kael "mark[s] their next course by the fading moon," sustaining the method. The method enables navigation and timing; removing it would break the logic of how Kael compensates for confiscated instruments. All three gates met; high causal linkage and closure participation. Irreplaceability strong—lunar navigation is specific to the frozen-lake setting and Kael's skill.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary by the frozen lake is anchored in paragraph one (opening line) and recurs throughout: the sanctuary's columnar rock houses the people, the frozen lake's surface allows moon-path tracking (enabling method), and the basalt's iron-rich properties activate the magnetic viaduct. At closure, "the sanctuary receded behind them, its dark stones standing like sentinels over the frozen water," recharging the setting as both prison and landmark. The setting supplies the escape mechanism (magnetic basalt) and navigation tool (lake mirror). Removing either basalt or frozen lake would collapse plot logic. All three gates met; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"After the lake froze over" appears in paragraph one and tightens stakes: freezing creates the mirror surface for moon-path tracking and signals the seasonal window. The timing is reinforced ("this year," "tonight, with the full moon ascending") and shapes urgency—Kael "knew the time had finally arrived." At closure, dawn marks the end of the night crossing, and "days, perhaps" frames the next phase. The timeframe constrains preparation and movement, though the clock is more seasonal than minute-by-minute. All three gates met; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to sculpt patience from impatience" is dramatized through Kael's sister's death (the lesson: passion without strategy fails) and her years of mapping. It creates friction in the final third: Kael teaches restraint to a group that wants to run and shout, and at closure she reaffirms "But not yet," deferring wild freedom with visible cost. The motivation shapes every tactical choice (timing, route, restraint) and charges the ending image. Removing it would flatten Kael to a technician. All three gates met; high causal pressure and irreplaceability. Cost is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is embodied early ("water beneath ice, powerful but controlled") and modulates across the piece: Kael's voice carries it, the group's suppressed exuberance shows it, and the final image ("their patient revolution unfolding like moonlight across ice—beautiful, inexorable, and free") synthesizes restraint and wildness in a charged reprise. Tone is coherent through turns—no melodrama at the crossing, no flat summary at closure. The duality pressures every beat: the people want to be wild but must remain restrained. Removing the tonal calibration would collapse the thematic tension. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>
