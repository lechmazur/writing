<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's interior life is concrete and specific—her choice to remain, the family custom grounding her, the shift from confusion to mapping as defiance. The motivation crystallizes on the page: "to turn confusion into exploration, to map what everyone else had abandoned as unmappable." Embodied contradictions are present (isolation as freedom, pariah as witness) and her renunciation of extraction is earned by prior setup. Minor: the passage "blessed by proximity to something incomprehensible, but marked as a pariah" reads slightly label-heavy, but the cost of her choice—timeline divergence, eternal solitude—lands visibly in the anniversary passage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (observation deck, time dilation, sketching custom) and accumulates density through charged repetitions of the compass rose and sketching act. Orientation anchors (who, where, when, why) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kira's final choice to continue sketching "the night sky that would never stop changing, creating constellation maps for a future that would never arrive" forecloses reunion and accepts solitude with visible cost—her family now "dust for millennia." The cost is conceptual and temporal, undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "True north wasn't a fixed point…it was whatever you chose as your reference."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observation deck setting constrains Kira's action throughout: the glass bubble's transparency enables her witnessing, the temporal stretch traps her, the compass rose applique provides both physical anchor and thematic charge. Sensory details are filtered through her POV (warm metal, echoed silence, supernova light reflecting off gold). The deck's temporally stretched nature is not mere backdrop—it creates the unmappable sky she chooses to map. The final image ("Inside, temporally stretched and impossibly isolated") directly charges the closure choice. Micro-setting via the sketchbook and compass rose both constrain and enable her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: survive isolation by finding purpose. One meaningful tightening: Kira's confusion transforms into a mapping project, which then crystallizes into the realization that "true north was whatever you chose as your reference." Agency is clear—she refuses evacuation, chooses to sketch, redefines orientation—and the cost is legible: permanent temporal exile, family lost to millennia. The escalation under Accumulative lens works via density increase (sketching days/weeks, filling pages, the anniversary date ritual) and a cadence shift at the compass-rose epiphany. No reversal needed; the deepening suffices. The price paid (timeline divergence) alters her final stance from exile to expedition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the family custom of mapping stars becomes a method for orienting in unmappable time; "true north" shifts from inherited tradition to self-chosen reference. The compass rose motif evolves from decorative object to conceptual anchor without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: orientation is an act of attention, not a fixed point. Subtext operates in the "blessed pariah" phrase, the anniversary ritual performed for an audience millennia gone, and the smile at the supernova's "temporary brilliance." No theme summary; the final sketch of "constellation maps for a future that would never arrive" reweights prior material with quiet devastation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Kira notices warmth, silence, light on metal—textures filtered through isolation and scientific observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("gilded," "echoed silence," "elastic fabric"). Narrative certainty matches her knowledge; no withheld facts. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during epiphany, wider during cosmic description). Register remains consistent—no corporate intrusion. Free indirect style is clean. Minor: "blessed by proximity to something incomprehensible, but marked as a pariah" reads slightly expository in the second paragraph, though it establishes context efficiently. Rhythm varies across reflective and observational beats without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (frozen supernova, time-lapse film, cosmic clock) is coherent and POV-appropriate. Minor: "Days passed, or perhaps weeks—duration meant nothing here" is a small scaffold phrase, but it serves the temporal-stretch premise. One run of "She sketched…She drew…She began" in mid-story compresses without adding pressure, costing ~−0.2. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph's stacked clauses ("to witness…to map…finding her way") create purposeful rhythm without obscuring sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—temporal isolation as laboratory for redefining orientation—feels fresh and the family sketching custom provides specific texture. The "blessed pariah" frame and the compass-rose-as-anchor synthesis are non-obvious. Emotional specificity (anniversary ritual for a family millennia dead) avoids generic template. Minor: the setup (abandoned research station, time dilation) leans on familiar SF furniture, though the sketching-as-navigation angle transforms it. The final move (curiosity as true north) is earned in hindsight by the grandmother's teaching and Kira's escalating commitment. No close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking is moderate—unconventional pacing and reflective density without mid-scene dialogue—but coherence holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira ("blessed pariah") is setup in paragraph two, drives the middle choice (sketching as defiance), and shapes closure (choosing curiosity as true north). Her refusal to evacuate and decision to map the unmappable are causal turns. Cost is visible: permanent exile, family lost. Touches all three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage present. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5 = base 7.1. Minor swappability (could be "exile" or "outcast" with edits) −0.3 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Compass rose applique appears three times: central console (paragraph one), glints beside her (paragraph six), catches supernova light (paragraph nine). It provides thematic anchor ("orientation was possible") and charges the "true north" epiphany. Setup gate met; development gate partial (referenced during epiphany but not directly handled); closure gate met (reflects light, reinforces theme). Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5 = base 5.3. Rounded 5.4. Cap at 6.0 (two gates); lacks middle causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"True north" is seeded in grandmother's teaching ("creates its own true north"), drives the epiphany ("True north wasn't a fixed point…it was whatever you chose as your reference"), and anchors the final image ("her true north holding steady"). It shapes stakes (how to orient in chaos) and alters tactics (sketching becomes navigation). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7 = 7.1. All three gates met; concept constrains choices and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is setup early (paragraph two: "pocket of distorted spacetime—minutes here meant years outside"), enables the cosmic time-lapse that she sketches, and creates the irreversible cost (family "dust for millennia"). It constrains her choice (cannot leave without dying) and enables her witness role. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +0.8, cost +0.5 = 6.2. All three gates met; attribute drives isolation and opportunity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is core action: she glimpses the universe through the walls (paragraph four), the act becomes sustained observation (paragraphs six–eight), and the final line references "looking up." It enables her mapping project and charges the ending. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9 = 5.9. Could be replaced by "observe" or "witness" with minor edits (swappability −0.4 applied within band). Two-gate participation (setup + closure, middle is continuation not distinct turn).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Family sketching custom is setup early (paragraph three: grandmother's teaching, seven generations), drives middle beats (filling pages, sketching anniversaries), and shapes closure (anniversary date ritual, final sketch). It provides both motive and method, constrains her tactics (must use charcoal, must mark anniversaries), and reweights meaning (tradition for an absent audience). Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8, cost +0.5 = 7.6. All three gates; method is indispensable to logic and emotional charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observation deck is setup immediately, constrains all action (glass bubble enables viewing, temporal pocket traps her), supplies the compass rose and cosmic view, and anchors the final image ("Inside, temporally stretched…"). It is the sole location; removing it collapses the story. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.8 = 7.8. All three gates; micro-setting (deck, console, sketchbook) functions as full setting at this length and constrains every choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" is setup in paragraph two and frames the isolation premise, but timeframe does not tighten decisions within the narrative present—days or weeks pass without urgency. It enables the situation but does not create a live clock that alters moves. Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6 = base 4.5. Late signal (second paragraph) −0.2 = 4.3. Rounded up for enabling context: 4.8. Missing development and closure gates (no escalating deadline); cap at 4.6 waived slightly for framing function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("to turn confusion into exploration") is dramatized across the arc: confusion (paragraph four), transformation into mapping (paragraph six), crystallization into expedition (paragraph eight), and final embrace of curiosity as true north (paragraphs nine–ten). It drives the sketching choice and shapes the closure stance. Setup +0.6 (implicit early, explicit mid), three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5 = 7.3. All three gates; desire is conflicted (isolation vs. freedom) and paid for (permanent exile).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in the opening atmosphere ("echoed silence"), returns mid-story ("The echoed silence of the observation deck wasn't absence—it was space for concentration"), and is implicit in the ending's solitary witnessing. Tone modulates with pressure: isolation becomes clarity, silence becomes concentration. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4 = 5.9. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (silence as resource, not void) +0.8 = 6.7. Two gates (setup + development reprise); closure participation is ambient rather than charged image.</comment>
