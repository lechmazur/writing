<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nasreen's interiority is embodied through somatic markers ("pulse a drum behind her eyes," "legs going rigid") rather than clinical labels, and her freeze response is contradictory—she must both surrender to and manage terror simultaneously. The "pearl of stillness" technique shows lived coping strategy with visible micro-choices (smell of rosemary, lemon oil on fingertips) that orient her back to the present. The backstory photograph provides concrete motivation without sentimentality, and her final steadiness is earned through the on-page freeze-and-recovery cycle. Minor deduction: the therapist's somatic-marker explanation reads slightly expository, though it's quickly grounded in her lived weather.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Nasreen, arboretum, morning routine) land within the first two paragraphs; the Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent—pressure builds through the photograph's weight, the helicopter trigger, and the freeze response, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where her hands remain steady and she moves forward despite the cost of carrying terror. The closure image ("the garden is awake, and that is enough") reweights the opening's "Quietly talented" and the photograph's "annihilation" with visible endurance cost. Causality is clean: the helicopter sound triggers the freeze because of the drone-strike past, and the pearl technique enables her return to work. No plot amnesia or convenient resets; the decommissioned lighthouse provides a subtle parallel (outlived purpose vs. ongoing purpose).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cliff garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: salt wind tilts saplings, brine-tasting soil challenges cyclamens, the sea's roar triggers somatic memory, and the lemon tree's oil grounds her recovery. The wren in the Monterey cypress she staked four winters ago ties past labor to present refuge. Spatial choreography is clear (gravel path, cliff rail, lighthouse below) and sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (rosemary smell, fog damp, lemon oil acidic). The arboretum's exposed ground and the ocean eating limestone anchor her realism about impermanence, directly serving the theme. The setting charges the final image: the cypress now breaks "the hardest wind off the Atlantic," a concrete result of her labor that mirrors her internal windbreak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Nasreen's need to anchor optimism in realism while managing trauma responses. The helicopter sound provides immediate external pressure that triggers the freeze, and her internal conflict (body's terror vs. mind's knowledge that "it's just a helicopter") creates genuine tension. The pearl technique is her on-page agency—she must find orientation inside paralysis, forecloses panic, and the cost is visible (breath locked, pulse drumming). One meaningful tightening: the freeze-recovery cycle narrows to a single sensory anchor (lemon oil) that allows her to finish the cut and move forward. The final image ("hands are steady") shows earned endurance with felt cost; she does not smile, acknowledging the ongoing price. No convenient resolution; the photograph still presses against her ribs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the charged particulars: the photograph as document of annihilation, the trees as living architecture against wind, the pearl of stillness as orientation inside terror. "Anchor optimism in realism" is dramatized through her refusal to pretend the blast didn't happen while still planting trees that may outlast the cliff. The lemon oil and wren singing provide non-literal answers to the story's central question (how to endure after annihilation) without stated morals. The decommissioned lighthouse (outlived purpose) counterpoints her ongoing work, and the final image ("the garden is awake, and that is enough") offers conceptual repricing—sufficiency measured in present steadiness rather than healed wholeness. No thematic echo or late moralizing; the closing paragraph integrates sensory present (bakery bread, thinning fog, tall cypress) with her embodied state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is specific (hands knowing which beds need turning, soil that "tasted of brine"). Nasreen's interior vocabulary is concrete and particular: "weather she lived inside," "pearl of stillness," avoiding therapy-speak except when attributed to the clinic therapist. The narrative modulates distance purposefully—zooms into embodied sensation during the freeze ("metallic taste," "legs going rigid") and pulls back for the final panorama (bakery, fog, cypress). Diction remains character-bound; no register drift into clinical or literary artifice during peak stress. The photograph's description ("blur of motion...one second before the roof became sky") compresses horror into image without melodrama. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and accelerates during the freeze beat ("She freezes. Shears open...") then breathes in the recovery. Information density is high: "A drone strike wedding survivor. That was the language the relief workers used. Nasreen never used any language for it at all" does character work, backstory, and thematic setup in three sentences. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "Quietly talented was how the town described her, if they described her at all" employs a common literary construction, and the therapist's somatic-marker explanation, while necessary, slightly stalls momentum in paragraph four. The final paragraph balances micro-images (bread, fog, cypress height) with her state without overwriting. One filter-verb stack in paragraph five ("She breathes. She finds it") is acceptable as the technique's rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The refugee-gardener premise is familiar, but the story transforms it through the pearl-of-stillness technique (specific invented vocabulary), the crumpled photograph kept in her jacket (grounded particular), and the somatic-marker framework that remains embodied rather than clinical. The arboretum's lack of official keeper and the decommissioned lighthouse provide fresh structural parallels (unofficial purpose, outlived purpose, ongoing purpose). The freeze-as-weather metaphor avoids the triumph-over-trauma template by ending in sufficiency rather than resolution. Minor deduction: the coastal-refuge setting and gardening-as-healing are well-worn, though the salt-wind constraints and limestone erosion add specificity. The final image's restraint ("She does not smile, but her hands are steady") resists sentimentality and feels earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nasreen's survivor status frames the entire piece (setup paragraph three) and drives the key turn: the helicopter sound triggers her freeze because of the drone-strike past (causal pressure). Her decision to find the pearl rather than fight the freezing alters tactics on the page, and the photograph's presence in every move charges the closure image where it still "presses against her ribs." The trait is irreplaceable—swap "survivor" for generic trauma and the specificity of the blur-of-motion photograph and the somatic response to rotor sounds collapses. Visible cost: she carries the photograph always, her body does not consult her mind, and she does not smile at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in paragraph three (setup), presses against her ribs during the freeze beat (middle pressure), and remains in the final image, maintaining its weight. Its specific content (Farah mid-laugh, blur of motion one second before impact) is irreplaceable and charges Nasreen's realism about annihilation. However, it is not handled or used in distinct beats—it is carried and referenced but not examined, shifted, or otherwise manipulated on the page. The reweighting is present (from backstory document to persistent weight at closure) but the object itself remains more talisman than tool. Solid integration with closure linkage, but static in function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pearl of stillness is introduced as her invented phrase (paragraph four), defines her method during the freeze beat ("She called this finding the pearl...a point of orientation"), and is enacted twice on the page (rosemary/fog/wren, then lemon oil). It directly shapes stakes: she must find orientation inside terror or remain paralyzed. The concept drives the climax—"Today it is the lemon oil...She lets it expand until the helicopter sound is just a helicopter sound"—and the closure depends on this technique succeeding (hands steady, she moves to the next tree). Irreplaceable: swap for generic "grounding" and the specificity of searching inside stillness for "one small thing that was true and present" dissolves. The cost is legible: she must freeze first, and the terror does not vanish.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is mentioned in paragraph two as the town's description, demonstrated through grafting skill and the windbreak trees she planted, and echoed in the final paragraph where her hands are steady and the cypress has grown tall. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a key choice on the page—her talent is backdrop competence rather than a live trade-off. The freeze-and-recovery beat hinges on her somatic technique, not her horticultural skill. Present and thematically consonant (quiet endurance), but not causally active in the story's pressure system. Mid-band: shapes atmosphere and supports theme without driving decisions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The freeze is the story's hinge: triggered by the helicopter (setup via body knowledge paragraph four), executed on the page during the climax (shears open, pulse drumming, breath locked), and resolved through the pearl technique, allowing the final image where her hands are steady. The action is irreplaceable—swap for generic "panic" or "startle" and the somatic-marker logic, the deliberate non-fighting ("She had learned not to fight the freezing"), and the pearl's function as orientation-inside-paralysis all collapse. Major turn: the freeze forecloses immediate action and forces the micro-choice to search for the pearl. Cost: time suspended, vulnerability, ongoing bodily mistrust ("her body does not consult her mind"). Early signal, middle enactment, closure consequence—fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Somatic markers are explained by the therapist (paragraph four), demonstrated in the freeze beat (pressure in sternum, metallic taste, legs rigid), and enacted through her pearl technique (smell, damp, bird song as sensory anchors). The method shapes her tactics: instead of fighting the freeze, she searches for sensory truth, and that micro-choice enables the climax resolution. However, the mechanics are partly told via the therapist's explanation rather than fully dramatized discovery. The method is signaled early and matters at the key turn, but the exposition slightly weakens the sense of lived invention. Strong integration with visible payoff, minor deduction for the clinical framing that slightly distances the reader from her embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum pressures every beat: salt wind tilts saplings (ongoing labor), brine soil challenges plants (her skill), the cliff's exposure necessitates the windbreak (her architecture), the sea's roar triggers somatic memory (stakes), and the lemon tree near the cliff rail provides the grounding oil (closure resource). The garden's lack of official keeper (paragraph one) frames her unofficial purpose, and the ocean eating limestone each decade sharpens her realism about impermanence. The setting is irreplaceable—move the story inland or to a stable garden and the wind constraint, sea-sound trigger, and erosion threat vanish. Early setup, middle pressure (gravel path, cliff rail proximity), and closure charge (the cypress now breaks the Atlantic wind). The micro-setting (body, tools, recurring plants) also qualifies and is causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The eleven-year gap since the lighthouse went dark anchors the setting (paragraph one) and the three years Nasreen has tended the garden establish her tenure, but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions. The morning routine and the April fog signal present time, yet no clock or deadline pressures her choices during the freeze-and-recovery beat. The timeframe is present and consistent (past trauma, recent labor, current moment) but does not escalate—the helicopter could arrive at any hour with the same effect. Setup present, mild thematic support (accumulated endurance over three years), but no middle or closure pressure tied to time as a resource or constraint. Functional background, not a live stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The motivation is articulated in paragraph five ("to anchor optimism in realism") and dramatized throughout: Nasreen does not pretend the blast didn't happen (photograph as document of annihilation) yet plants trees anyway (the windbreak, the cypress). The friction is on the page—her body freezes despite her knowledge ("her body does not consult her mind"), and she must find the pearl to act. The cost is visible: she carries the photograph always, does not smile at the end, and measures success as "enough" rather than healed. The final image enacts the motivation—hands steady (optimism in action) while the photograph still presses (realism about cost) and the ocean eats limestone (realism about impermanence). Early setup, middle conflict, closure demonstration. Irreplaceable: swap for generic "healing" or "hope" and the precise trade-off (belief without honesty is cruelty) dissolves.</comment>
