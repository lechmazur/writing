<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Yelen's interiority is embodied and specific—scars as "pale ridgelines," crystallization under stress driving her retreat to superstition. Her contradiction (scholarly ambition versus brittleness) acts simultaneously in scene as she writes, breathes, releases. The final shift from crystalline to "living, pliant, warm" is earned by the tea-writing ritual and forecloses her mentor's path with visible cost. Minor: the mentor's dismissal is told rather than felt in a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tea-writing glows and holds against rain, a Resonant Reconfiguration (damage becomes legible language/light) with visible cost (she kneels in the storm, scarred body exposed). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through tea ceremony → scar stories → glowing runes, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights her scars from failure to proof. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat. One meaningful deepening (release, glow, persistence) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating platform, chain-bridge, canyon, and amber silence constrain and charge every beat. The ceremonial bowl, stone grain catching the quill, and rain sheets are tactile and purposeful. The platform's magnetic tether and pre-storm air pressure choices (held breath, swaying bridge). The final image—runes glowing in rain—is inseparable from setting. Sensory selection (saturated hush, bruised purple, impossible green lichen) filters through Yelen's urgency and release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform scars/reclaim craft) signaled early. One meaningful tightening: crystallization rises → breath/release → tea-ink glows, narrowing options from scholarly failure to living record. Agency is decision and endurance (she picks up the quill again, kneels in rain). The cost is legible: she sheds the crystalline skin, accepts her grandmother's "wrong" method, and her scars become permanent luminous marks. No reversal required under Accumulative; deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (damage as language, rigidity versus fluidity, listening over forcing) emerges from tea ceremony particulars and scar-writing without statement. The final image—stories that "hold" rather than wash away—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (can gentleness live inside her craft?) and reweights her grandmother's superstition with conceptual cost (the stories must stay, not be carried to sea). Quiet ending charged by prior material. No thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "arguments the sky kept having with itself," scars as "ridgelines," concentration "crystallizes." Psychic distance stable; register appropriate (scholarly yet embodied). Reflection anchored to present stimuli (quill, tea, rain) and tilts stance via micro-choices (dip quill, breathe, let it rest). No head-hopping. Diction coherent under stress. Purposeful compression ("She breathed") heightens rhythm without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diverse. Information density high: lines layer character, world, and pressure without padding. Figurative language (crystallization, snake shedding skin) coheres and pays off. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold: "Not a rune of power. A rune of record" and "Not soft exactly, but living, pliant, warm" read slightly instructional but remain voice-motivated. Propulsion clean; clarity sustained through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis (magic-scholar seeking gentleness via grandmother's tea superstition) feels specific and non-obvious. Risk: tea ceremony on a floating platform during storms, runes that glow and hold rather than wash away, transforms the mentor-dismissal trope through embodied ritual. The turn (stories stay, luminous) reweights prior material without gimmick. Derivative premise avoided by grounding magic in personal cost and ritual specificity. No echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early; her choices (carry ceremony set, write scars with tea, pick up quill again after release) create key turns. Decision to continue writing after the chest release alters tactics (tea-ink glows, absorbs) and drives closure. Cost visible: she sheds crystallization, accepts scars as permanent record.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (grandmother's house); used in two beats (dip in tea, write scar stories; pick up again after release, write rune of record). Charged reprise: the severe angle and dense scriptwork enable the glowing runes. Specificity matters: old instrument for "abandoned" dense scriptwork, not a generic pen.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shapes stakes and tactics throughout: the amber silence frames her held breath, the timeframe compresses world and choice, and the "breath between storms" becomes the literal moment she writes and releases. The second storm breaking as runes pulse ties concept to closure image. Indispensable: remove it and the pressure window collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Constrains on-page action: crystallization under pressure drove prior failures (scars), threatens again mid-ceremony ("the old tightness rising"), and its shedding (not shattered, but shed like skin) is the story's hinge. Visible tradeoff: she must breathe, rest the quill, and let the trait transform rather than force through it. Cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Central turn: "something in her chest released. Not shattered, not forced open, but shed." This action redefines options (from brittle to pliant) and enables the glowing runes. Not swappable: the story's entire arc traces crystallization → shedding → transformation. Major beat, irreplaceable, drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (grandmother's tea fortune method as superstition); shapes middle choice (she writes with tea-ink rather than scholarly runes); mechanically matters (tea-writing enables different outcome). Present at closure (tea-writing glows, holds). Cost: she accepts "childish" method after scholarly failure. Causal across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating rock pressures choices (swaying chain-bridge, pre-storm timing, amber silence, stone grain catching quill) and charges the final image (runes shimmer on stone in rain). Micro-setting (ceremonial bowl, platform surface) alters tactics (tea pools, absorbs). Remove it and the story loses physical constraint and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tightens decisions: "During that held breath, the world compressed." The breath frames her writing attempt and release. Time tracked: first storm passed, second waiting, breath held, exhaled at last. The clock alters moves (she must act in the still window). Present at closure (exhale swallowed by thunder as runes pulse).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dramatized early (carry ceremony set, write scar stories on stone) and conflicted in choices (fear of crystallization versus need to try). Friction between want (reclaim craft) and cost (accept scars as permanent, luminous marks) drives the arc. Final choice: she lets stories stay rather than wash away, accepting transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coherent through turns: "saturated hush," "amber silence," "thickening color," all support the pressurized stillness. Tone modulates with pressure (tightness rising, release, rain breaking) without losing coherence. Charges final image: the pulsing runes in thunder marry hush and storm. Distinct, purposeful, elevates closure.</comment>
