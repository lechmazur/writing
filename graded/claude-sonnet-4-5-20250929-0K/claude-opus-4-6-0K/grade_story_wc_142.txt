<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's dual allegiance creates internal tension, but her "orderly intuitive" trait remains label-only—never constraining a choice or creating visible trade-offs on the page. The graffiti solution emerges cleanly but lacks embodied struggle; we're told she's careful and intuitive, yet never see her wrestle with a genuine mistake or blind spot. The foundation stone chip is handled twice but functions as a comfort object rather than forcing a difficult micro-choice. Emotional states are asserted ("hopeful desperation," "chest ache") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and follows a causal through-line: Authority announces privatization → Maren encodes counter-charter in murals → community presents document. The closure lands on the page with a visible cost (the fight will continue, developers will return), satisfying Charged Poise—options are crystallized and reweighted. However, the central reversal (graffiti campaign succeeds) happens off-page between "She chose a third path" and "At dawn, three hundred raft citizens paddled"; we lose the pressure of organizing, the risk of discovery, and the embodied cost of walking that tightrope. The lens reads Causal but the key escalation beat is summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The raft city is vivid and particular: tethered pontoons, hand-painted facades, lantern-draped stalls, rope bridges connecting ethnic quarters. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere is strong. The Junction Platform recurs as a spatial anchor, and the carnival's perpetual motion charges the final image ("The carnival lights spun on"). The foundation stone chip and murals function as micro-setting that partially constraints Maren's tactics (she avoids digital channels, uses surfaces the Authority can't monitor). One missed gate: the environment could have pressured a mid-story choice more directly—spatial access or proximity shaping a tactical decision would have lifted this into the 8-range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve affordable moorage and community voice against privatization) is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: Maren's dual allegiance forces her to choose a third path. However, the escalation and cost occur largely off-page; we're told she "was careful" and that the campaign succeeds, but we don't witness a near-miss, a discovered message, or a moment when her Authority role and resistance work collide with visible price. The final image acknowledges ongoing threat ("developers would return with sharper lawyers"), satisfying cost legibility, but the peak pressure beat—organizing three hundred citizens under surveillance—is summarized in a single sentence rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (community self-determination vs. commodification, dual allegiance as lived contradiction) emerges organically from the raft city's material particulars and Maren's encoded-message strategy. The foundation stone chip ("rough and smooth… Authority and community") recurs with shifted meaning at closure, and the final image—Maren planning the next message, grandmother's rock still bearing weight—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One friction: "hopeful desperation—the feeling of reaching for something you're not sure your arms are long enough to grasp" edges into abstracted articulation rather than trusting the image to carry the complexity. The counter-charter's success reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the fight continues), satisfying CR criteria.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries a distinct texture ("kaleidoscope of light," "soothe the communities into acceptance"). Focalization is clean—no head-hopping—and perceptual signature is consistent (Maren notices political seams, material anchors, the tremor of conflict). Two frictions lower the score: (1) "orderly intuitive, a paradox her mother had named" is tell-only exposition that could anchor in a present micro-choice, and (2) the phrase "hopeful desperation" in paragraph nine reads as authorial gloss rather than Maren's own idiom under pressure. Register remains stable, and the narrative stance modulates purposefully from scene description to tactical summary to charged final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is clean and imagistic, with strong opening and closing lines. Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Three distinct line-level issues accumulate (Non-closure Cap applies: −1.5 for two distinct issues, −2.0 for three or more): (1) filter-verb stacks in key beats ("she could feel," "she needed to remember," "she knew that") dull immediacy; (2) paraphrase loop in paragraph two ("translating not just languages but entire ways of being" / "she could feel the tremor of a conflict before it surfaced and file it neatly"); (3) stock metaphor "cut the ropes and let the poorest rafts drift" is vivid but unearned by prior imagery. The closure beat itself is clean, so the cap holds at −1.5 total within Q7, but these artifacts touch high-pressure moments and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-stack rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The raft-city setting and graffiti-as-resistance premise offer a fresh synthesis, and the "orderly intuitive" mediator navigating dual allegiance is a specific, non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc (grassroots organizer finds third path, wins temporary reprieve, prepares for next battle) follows a recognizable template without deep transformation. The Transformation Test is borderline: swap "raft city" for "ethnic neighborhood coalition" and "graffiti" for "community bulletin boards," and the plot and emotional beats hold unchanged. The foundation stone chip and carnival imagery add texture but don't fully individuate the premise. No proximity echoes or derivative reliance, and the story commits fully to its world logic, but the stakes and resolution trend toward median rather than bold, specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren appears in every beat and her mediator role shapes the dominant stake (navigate dual allegiance, facilitate or resist privatization). She makes the key turn (choosing the encoded-message path) and her final action (planning the next message) drives closure. Setup is immediate, middle development shows her implementing the graffiti strategy, and closure participation is clear. However, her decisions feel inevitable rather than costly; we don't see her wrestle with a choice between competing goods or pay a visible relational or professional price on the page. The role is indispensable to the premise but her agency could be sharper—one dramatized moment of risk or sacrifice would push this into the 8-range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three beats: Maren carries it in her vest (paragraph four), rubs it for memory (paragraph five), presses it between palms before the charter presentation (paragraph ten), and tucks it back at closure (paragraph thirteen). Setup is early, and the object recurs with a charged reprise ("rough side out") that subtly mirrors her stance. However, the chip is never constrained by its presence—it's a comfort token, not a tactical tool or object that alters a choice. The lyric early-to-final pattern reweights meaning (rough/smooth = dual allegiance made legible), satisfying the allowance for purposeful resonance without mid-scene use, but the lack of causal pressure or visible cost tied to its handling caps the score in the mid-5s to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is named explicitly (paragraph six) and structures the entire plot: Maren serves the Harbor Authority as licensed mediator while serving the raft communities who trust her. The concept forces her key choice (paragraph seven: "She chose a third path") and shapes her tactics (avoid digital channels, use invisible-in-plain-sight cultural festival framing). Closure acknowledges the allegiance remains live ("The rafts held together"). Setup is early, middle development shows the concept constraining her methods, and closure participation is clear. The concept is causal and irreplaceable—swap it for "reluctant leader" or "insider with a conscience" and the plot breaks. The only friction: the on-page cost of walking that line is told more than shown; one dramatized moment of professional risk or relational fracture would push this into the 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is introduced early (paragraph two) as a character label but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. We're told Maren "could feel the tremor of a conflict before it surfaced and file it neatly into a plan of action," yet we don't see her intuition fail, her orderliness slow her down, or the paradox create friction in a key beat. The trait is present in closure framing ("She was careful, orderly in her intuition") but functions as narrator assertion rather than dramatized tradeoff. Setup is early, but middle development and closure participation are label-only. Swappable with "strategic and empathetic" or "methodical and insightful" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reorganize" appears explicitly as the Authority's plan (paragraph four: "reorganize the raft city's governance") and as Maren's counter-tactic (paragraph eight: "She reorganized the resistance into something that looked… like a cultural festival"). The action is signaled early, drives the middle beat (encoding messages, festival framing), and shapes closure (counter-charter establishes community land trusts, a reorganization of governance from below). The dual use—Authority's top-down plan vs. Maren's bottom-up response—creates thematic pressure and tactical specificity. Remove this exact action and the plot loses its structural hinge. The only friction: the campaign itself (three hundred citizens mobilized) happens off-page between paragraphs eight and ten, so the reorganization's mechanics remain summary rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Graffiti as encoded-message method is introduced at paragraph seven and detailed in paragraph eight (compass rose with coordinates, crane mural with meeting dates, coral mural embedding counter-charter text). The method is specific, purposeful, and irreplaceable—swap it for "encrypted emails" or "word-of-mouth" and the carnival setting loses tactical integration. Setup occurs at the story's midpoint (late but still within the window), middle development shows three distinct examples, and closure participation is present (Maren walks toward the nearest mural to plan the next message). However, we don't see the method tested or its mechanics create friction—no discovered message, no failed encoding, no moment when the art itself constrains her options. The method shapes attempts but doesn't generate visible cost or a mid-story reversal, capping the score in the mid-6s to low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The raft city is introduced in the opening line, named and detailed across every beat, and indispensable to story logic. The perpetual carnival setting enables Maren's resistance tactic (paragraph eight: "invisible in plain sight"), supplies the graffiti surfaces as infrastructure, and charges the final image ("The carnival lights spun on. The rafts held together"). Setup is immediate, middle development shows the setting constraining tactics (avoid digital channels, use painted surfaces the Authority can't monitor), and closure participation is strong (the lights and held-together rafts carry thematic weight). Spatial choreography is coherent (Junction Platform, rival neighborhoods, Raft Sixteen). The setting is causal, specific, and irreplaceable—remove the floating carnival and the plot, method, and closure all break. One friction: the carnival's perpetual motion could have pressured a mid-story choice more directly (e.g., a platform drifting during a key meeting), which would push this into the 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The privatization deadline is introduced early (paragraph four: "a narrow window—weeks, maybe less") and creates urgency throughout. Time pressure is named again at paragraph nine ("The night before the charter deadline") and drives the climactic beat (dawn presentation of counter-charter). Setup is early, middle development shows the countdown shaping Maren's tactics (speed of organizing, choice of visible festival framing), and closure linkage is clear (the charter arrives "at dawn" to beat the deadline). The timeframe is causal and tightens decisions. However, the clock itself is not tracked beat-by-beat—we jump from "weeks, maybe less" to "the night before" without intermediate pressure points or a moment when time runs shorter than expected. A mid-story check-in (e.g., "five days left," a missed assembly) would make the time constraint felt rather than told, pushing this into the 8-range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (navigate gentrification, preserve affordable moorage and community voice) is introduced early (paragraph four), grounds her key choice (paragraph seven: third path via encoded messages), and persists to closure (paragraph thirteen: planning the next message, knowing developers will return). The motivation is personal and specific (grandmother's foundation stone, Raft Sixteen origins) and creates friction with her Authority role. Setup is immediate, middle development shows the desire shaping tactics, and closure participation is clear (the fight continues, stakes reweighted). However, the motivation is more univocal than conflicted on the page—we're told about dual allegiance, but Maren's internal friction (serve the Authority paycheck vs. fight for the rafts) is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly micro-choice. One beat showing her tempted by compliance or penalized for resistance would sharpen the felt cost and push this into the 8-range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is named explicitly at paragraph nine ("hopeful desperation—the feeling of reaching for something you're not sure your arms are long enough to grasp") and modulates across beats: opening civic exhaustion ("never stopped trying to hold its fractured pieces together"), middle determination (careful organizing, "orderly in her intuition"), peak charge (musicians playing together, "made her chest ache"), and closure resilience ("The carnival lights spun on… steady as a promise"). The tone is coherent, charges the final image, and fits the stakes. Setup is early via mood cues, middle development sustains the balance, and closure participation is strong. One friction: the phrase "hopeful desperation" itself reads as authorial gloss rather than emerging from Maren's embodied perception—show the ache and reach without naming the paradox, and the tone would feel less managed. Still, the modulation under pressure and final-image charge are effective, placing this in the 7.0–7.5 range.</comment>
