<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction—burying her gift to avoid pain while seeking meaning in meaningless words—operates consistently across the story. The moment she stops looking away from her reflection ("She did not look away") earns the shift from avoidance to acceptance through eleven years of established behavior and the concrete discovery sequence. The body work is strong: "mercury-glass eyes," "finger reads the texture of a feather," "hidden thunder in her chest" all ground state in physicality. Minor slip: the final vision of herself teaching feels slightly convenient, though the resonance framing ("not warning... resonance") rescues it by reinterpreting rather than resolving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat (mountain, Athenaeum, forty-third level, eleven years). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maren's nightly ritual seeds the discovery, the stone's texture triggers memory, and months of translation deepen until the final reweighting—home as pattern, not place—reconfigures her relationship to both her gift and her isolation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): "She had been living inside the shape of home her entire life and had been too afraid to read its walls. Now, finally, she could." The cost is visible—eleven years of self-imposed exile, the mother's death unprocessed—and the final image crystallizes a new stance with undeniable pressure. The causality of discovery (stone → memory → translation → insight) holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sixty-first level with collapsed stairs, the directional grain of the glyphs ("smooth one way and resistant the other"), and the lamplight workspace all constrain Maren's access and method. The architectural sentence metaphor—"every passage... a syllable"—charges the final image by making the mountain itself a legible text she can now read. Sensory detail is purposeful: "air tasted of iron and old paper," the stone's Braille-like texture. The micro-setting (stone, lamp, shelf between folios) functions as the primary spatial anchor and drives the central turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren's need to escape painful foreknowledge. The stone discovery narrows options by offering an alternate use for her gift—reading the past's grain rather than the future's. The tightening occurs when she begins translation ("It took months"), foreclosing her nightly ritual of meaningless reading, and the final reweighting ("resonance" not "warning") reconfigures the cost of her mercury-glass sight. Agency is clear: she chooses to translate, to look at her reflection, to interpret the vision as invitation rather than dread. One visible price: abandoning her protective routine for vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—home as relational pattern rather than fixed place—emerges through the glyphs' encoding, the mountain's architecture, and Maren's shift from avoidance to recognition. The feather-grain metaphor deepens across the story: first tactile ("barb of a feather"), then conceptual ("reading the grain of time"), finally visual (her gift reads directionality). The ending offers a non-literal answer to "What is home?" through the image of Maren teaching the old language, embodying the pattern rather than stating it. The "hidden thunder" recurs as misinterpreted dread transformed into resonance, charging the closure without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the stone discovery, slightly elevated during the translation summary). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "the long unspooling of that foreknowledge," "forests with grammar for roots, oceans conjugating themselves." The perceptual signature is consistent—Maren notices texture, direction, pattern—and intensifies under pressure without register drift. The compression of months into "It took months" is efficient strategic telling that preserves momentum. No dialogue to judge; interiority remains legible and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and syntactic variety. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery. Minor loop: "She had been living inside the shape of home... had been too afraid" in the penultimate paragraph slightly echoes earlier phrasing without adding new pressure, though the reweighting justifies the return. The metaphor chain (feather-grain, architecture-as-sentence, mercury-glass) remains coherent and propulsive. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line resolves by image that recharges the "walls" motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mercury-glass seer, lost language, and architectural pattern feels specific and non-obvious; the feather-grain metaphor linking texture to temporal directionality is a fresh inflection. The transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would collapse the logic (the mountain *is* the sentence). The ending's resonance—gift reinterpreted as tool for decoding home rather than predicting disaster—arises inevitably from prior particulars (the nightly ritual, the mother's death, the stone's texture). Risk-taking in the extended backstory and reflection (~35% of text) heightens rather than stalls, meeting the BRR exception tests.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mercury-glass seer drives setup (establishes her gift and its burial), middle choice (she traces the glyphs and allows the memory), and closure (she looks at her reflection without looking away, reinterpreting the vision). Her decision to translate and then to accept the future vision as resonance rather than dread creates the final turn. Specific cost: abandoning her protective avoidance ritual. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lost language stone appears early (sixty-first level discovery), enables the memory trigger through its texture, sustains months of translation work, and reappears in the closure beat ("looked at her reflection in its polished surface"). The directional grain matters specifically—it teaches her that her gift reads bidirectionally. Four beats, high causal pressure, charged reprise at closure, irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Buried talents shapes the dominant stake from the opening ("she hadn't used that gift in years... buried it deliberately") and drives the resolution (unearthing the gift to read backward rather than forward). The translation work dramatizes the un-burying process across months. Visible cost: she must abandon her protective numbness. Causal pressure across setup, middle, and closure; specific enough that a generic "hidden skill" would collapse the mercury-glass logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Substitutes reality nightly enables her survival mechanism (reading meaningless scripts to avoid memory) and constrains her middle choice (the stone breaks through that substitution by triggering real memory). The ritual's abandonment when she begins translating represents a visible tradeoff. Two beats, clear cost. Not quite indispensable—a different avoidance mechanism could work—but well-integrated and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seed action operates at multiple scales: the nightly reading "seeded strange dreams," the stone discovery seeds memory, each decoded glyph "seeded another connection," and the translation itself seeds her future teaching role. The verb unifies the accumulative method and charges the closure image (she becomes the teacher who seeds language in others). The action redefines her relationship to growth, knowledge, and home. Three beats, high specificity, closure-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Via the texture of a feather is signaled early ("that directional grain, smooth one way and resistant the other"), becomes the method by which she reads the glyphs and unlocks memory, and is elevated to metaphor in the explanation of her gift's mechanics ("reading the grain of time the way a finger reads the texture of a feather"). The bidirectional property is irreplaceable—it's why she can read past as well as future. Setup, middle use, thematic payoff, and closure participation; fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore/mountain supplies the setup (hollowed chambers, spiraling corridors, deepest floors), the discovery site (sixty-first level with collapsed stairs limits access), and the thematic payoff (the architecture itself is a sentence saying "you are not lost"). The spatial logic—deeper = older, more dangerous—structures Maren's eleven-year descent and the stone's placement. Removal would break the home-as-pattern closure. Three beats, causal and thematic pressure, charges final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>After remembering becomes painful frames the entire narrative: Maren's three-year foreknowledge of her mother's death triggers the gift's burial, which triggers the eleven-year descent, which creates the conditions for the stone discovery. The timeframe shapes every tactic (nightly substitution, translation as slow reclamation) and charges the closure (she can finally remember and look forward simultaneously). Setup, middle constraint, closure payoff; removing it collapses causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>To understand the shape of home is dramatized through the translation work ("pattern of relationships between light, stone, breath, and belonging"), conflicted by her fear of looking (she's been inside home but too afraid to read it), and drives the closure choice (she looks at her reflection and accepts the teaching vision). The friction between desire and avoidance creates authentic tension. Three beats, visible cost (years of self-imposed exile), closure-active, irreplaceable stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hidden thunder appears explicitly ("The hidden thunder in her chest—the thing she had mistaken for dread all these years—was not warning. It was resonance") and operates implicitly throughout as the suppressed charge beneath her nightly rituals and avoidance. The tone modulates from dread to discovery to acceptance, intensifying at the translation and crystallizing at closure. The metaphor charges the final reweighting but is slightly stated rather than fully embodied in the closing image. Strong coherence, clear modulation, good closure linkage.</comment>
