<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sable's trembling hands and fear of losing her gift create clear internal stakes, and her passage through the mirrors earns the restoration through concrete embodiment ("she felt it enter her fingers, her wrists, the quiet architecture of her bones"). The character remains consistently motivated by craft anxiety rather than generic self-doubt. Minor issue: the eclipse-locksmith backstory occupies substantial space without directly pressuring the present choice until the gear moment, though it does prime the thematic register. The final stabilization feels earned by the mirror-watching and gear-oil sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Sable, frozen library, dawn) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through prophecy fragments, mirror discovery, and gear cascade, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the trembling stops) with visible cost (she must carry the rhythm forward, "again and again"). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—she has learned repair is not perfection but iterative breaking and mending. One tightening (oil drop activates gears, mirrors respond) is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library's "frost that refracted...into prismatic arcs," salt-smell driftwood mirrors, and gear assortment all constrain Sable's learning. The hauntingly bright frost-light charges the eclipse oil's glow and the mirrors' response. The body cue "small ghosts" of breath and the tactile trailing of fingers along icy spines ground the POV. The setting supplies the prophecy scraps and gears that enable the closure action. Spatial choreography (corner debris, central mirror ring, small table) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regaining locksmith ability) is signaled early via trembling hands and fear of losing her gift. The tightening occurs when the oil drop initiates the gear cascade, narrowing options to watching and absorbing the rhythm. The mirrors' response—showing break/mend pulse—forces recognition that her trembling is not failure but rhythm. Cost is legible: she must accept repair as iterative, not perfection, and carry forward the "salt-worn patience" with visible humility. One meaningful deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (repair as iterative pulse, not perfection) emerges through concrete gear mechanics, mirror reflections, and the prophecy's "tempo at which things come apart and...return." The final image—"break and choose, again and again, to be repaired"—reconfigures the opening trembling without stating a moral. The driftwood mirrors' "salt-worn patience" and eclipse oil as vocabulary reweight craft anxiety into acceptance of fracture. Subtext operates in the gear assortment as "anatomy" and the mirrors showing "every state of fracture." No thematic echo or sermon mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV (Sable) with stable deep third; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: "pages fused together by decades of cold," "small ghosts" of breath, "vocabulary" of gears—all filter setting through craft lens. Diction remains consistent ("hauntingly bright," "salt-worn patience") and purposeful. Distance modulates appropriately (close at trembling hands, wider at library description). Free indirect style is clean: "She understood. The gears were not for clocks." No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Rhythmic control tightens at the oil-drop beat and releases in the descent paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with vivid specificity ("onion skin," "liquid moonrise," "quiet architecture of her bones") and varied sentence rhythm. Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor deduction: "hauntingly bright" recurs three times without added pressure (opening, gear table, oil moment), risking decorative echo. "Break, mend, break, mend" reads as purposeful compression rather than paraphrase loop. No filter stacks, template cadence, or scaffold sentences. Propulsion remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The eclipse-locksmith premise and frozen library setting offer fresh synthesis, and the gear-as-vocabulary metaphor transforms craft-loss trope through concrete mechanical detail. The prophecy's "tempo at which things come apart" and mirror hall showing "every state of fracture" feel specific to this voice. Potential derivative element: the mentor-less vision quest in a magical archive has wide template presence, though the salt-driftwood mirrors and eclipse oil as active agent add specificity. The ending's "choose, again and again, to be repaired" resonates without cliché.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith appears in opening paragraph (setup), drives Sable's trembling-hands fear (motivation), and her craft vocabulary enables her to read the gear assortment at the table (middle beat). The final paragraph references her "working hours" and positions her to return to eclipse work with restored rhythm (closure linkage). Her specific craft constrains how she interprets prophecy and gears. Two distinct beats plus closure participation; causal pressure is moderate (the trembling must stop for her to continue work). Swappability: a different artisan type could replace this with modest edits, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Gear assortment appears mid-story on the table (setup slightly delayed but within first half), Sable recognizes it as "vocabulary" (middle interpretation beat), she applies eclipse oil to activate the cascade (action beat), and the turning gears teach her the break/mend rhythm that stops her trembling (closure causality). She gathers the gears into her satchel with "reverence" (closure participation, physical possession with cost). Three distinct beats; high causal pressure (without the gears' mechanical rhythm, closure fails); irreplaceability is strong (gears as craft vocabulary ties to her locksmith identity). Cost: she must carry them forward, binding her to iterative repair.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hall of mirrors is discovered mid-story via prophecy (setup), the prophecy explains its function ("every reflection showed a different stage of breaking and mending"), Sable enters and watches her hands in every state (middle action), and the mirrors ripple to show the break/mend pulse that enters her bones (closure causality). The mirrors' response to the gear cascade is the pivot that stops her trembling. Three beats; essential causal pressure (without mirrors showing the rhythm visually, the learning does not transfer to her body); high irreplaceability (mirrors as multi-state reflection tool). Present in final third resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" describes the library interior's frost-refracted light (setup, second paragraph), reappears when the gear table is described, and the eclipse oil "caught the hauntingly bright frost-light" (middle beat connection). The attribute does not constrain a choice but charges the visual atmosphere that makes the oil glow like "liquid moonrise," enabling Sable to see the mirrors respond. Two touches; moderate thematic reinforcement (brightness as revelation); swappable with "ethereal" or "luminous" with minor edits. No visible cost tied to this trait; label-level use reduces score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Uncap" appears when Sable withdraws the eclipse oil vial and breaks the seal (middle beat), the oil drop onto the gear initiates the cascade (action turn), and the mirrors respond, completing her learning (closure causality). The uncapping whisper "echoed strangely among the mirrors," cueing their activation. Two beats with tight causal linkage; removing this action breaks the gear mechanism and mirror response. Moderate irreplaceability (could substitute "pour" or "release" with edits, but the seal-breaking ritual fits the craft formality). Cost: she spends a finite resource (eclipse oil collected "drop by drop").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prophecy scraps are discovered "behind a toppled reading stand" in the library's corner (setup, mid-story), Sable pieces them together to learn about the hall of mirrors (middle interpretation), and the scraps "warmed in her hands as she approached" the mirrors, then she folds them into her coat where they "continued to radiate...faint warmth" (closure participation, physical keepsake with thematic charge). Two beats; the prophecy enables discovery of the mirrors and explains their use. Moderate causal pressure (Sable could have found mirrors without prophecy, but the prophecy teaches her what to watch for). Swappability: an inscription or voice could replace scraps with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frozen library above clouds is anchored in opening line (setup), its frost and ice fuse book pages (constraint detail), the corner debris hides prophecy scraps (resource supply), the central mirror ring provides the learning chamber (middle and closure space), and Sable "descended through the clouds as morning deepened" (closure exit image). Three beats; high spatial integration (the library's verticality and isolation pressure the solitary quest; its preservation of prophecy and mirrors supplies the solution). Moderate irreplaceability (another remote archive could substitute, but "above the clouds" and "frozen" add specificity). The setting enables closure without forcing it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Soft hush of a distant morning" appears in the opening and "morning deepened" in the closing paragraph; "dawn" is mentioned once mid-opening. Time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the progression from dawn to deeper morning is atmospheric rather than tactical. No beat count toward pressure. The timeframe provides tonal continuity (quiet, liminal) but does not constrain Sable's choices or alter the stakes. Swappable with "twilight" or "evening" without structural impact. One lyric reprise (early/final) without middle development or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("to learn the rhythm of repair") is stated in paragraph two, dramatized through her trembling hands and fear of losing her gift (setup conflict), drives her to piece together the prophecy and approach the mirrors (middle choices), and is fulfilled when she watches the break/mend pulse and "felt it enter her fingers" (closure satisfaction). Three beats; high causal pressure (her desire structures every action from library entry to gear activation). Cost: she must accept repair as iterative ("again and again") rather than permanent fix, visible in the final image's "steady, salt-worn patience." Irreplaceability is strong (craft-specific learning motive).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" tone: driftwood mirrors "carved from pale driftwood that smelled faintly of salt and distant summers" (middle beat), the closing image invokes "salt-worn patience of things that break and choose, again and again, to be repaired." Salt/sea imagery recurs; "nostalgia" reads in "forgotten thought," "years" of closure, "decades of cold," and the elegiac rhythm of the prose. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet opening, focused middle, reflective close) without static mood. The driftwood-salt motif charges the final image with temporal layering. Two material touches plus tonal consistency; moderate irreplaceability (coastal/weathered imagery could vary). The tone supports rather than drives the closure.</comment>
