<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—"Her left hand trembled now — nerve damage from the bombing at Kessith"—and her operational gentleness is shown through listening and precision under pressure. Her hierarchy of values (peace over personal cost) drives the final descent with the clipboard held "like a shield, like a child, like proof." Internal contradiction surfaces in "operatively gentle...not soft, never soft," and her flaws (dissolved marriages, estranged daughter) accumulate without safety-hedging. Minor slip: the closing line's triple simile reads slightly over-articulated for peak emotional compression.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the terrace climb opening. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Maren's reflections and the ritual context build density until the moons' conjunction seals the oath, reweighting all prior compromises into a single moment of "chains of celestial iron." Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she descends alone again, carrying proof "that the broken could still build something that held"—with the felt cost of recurring loneliness and embodied trembling. One structural artifact: the backstory proportion (~30%) stays anchored to the present altar/clipboard and primes the closure's weight, meeting BRR exception tests. The cost is visible in the final image's triplet and the moons' parting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terrace setting constrains the ritual (moons' conjunction every 43 years, acoustics carved into stone, blood-stained limestone) and charges the closure: the hum "felt in the teeth, the chest, the marrow" makes the oath's binding physical. The clipboard—ebony, "scratched and nicked from decades of use"—functions as micro-setting and tool, appearing in three beats (placement, signing, descent) with evolving pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "Midsummer light poured across the limestone like honey" grounds the scene, and the twin moons' "strange luminance that erased shadows" alters perception at the peak moment. The final descent's spatial choreography (alone, down ancient steps) completes the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the Forever War via the Accord of Vashan—is signaled early and pressured by the moons' conjunction deadline. Escalation tightens through Maren's speech ("surrender of the thing you clutch tightest"), Ilessi's furious signature, and Tohn's unreadable steadiness, narrowing to the moment "the moons touched" and the oath sealed. The reversal occurs when both delegations sign despite visible resistance (Tohn's jaw, Ilessi's fists), driven by Maren's agency and the ritual's celestial iron constraint. Cost is legible: Maren's shaking hands, recurring loneliness, and the knowledge that redemption demands sacred sacrifice from both sides. The piece lacks a second on-page complication or counter-move after the signing, keeping escalation in the strong but not exceptional band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core theme—redemption's price as daily practice, not ideal—emerges through Maren's scars (trembling hand, dissolved marriages, daughter who calls her by title) and her insistence that "Peace is not an ideal. It is a practice." The clipboard motif recurs with shifting weight: office tool → altar object → shield/child/proof, charging the final image without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Tohn and Ilessi's silence, the "flawed beauty" insult-turned-truth, and the terrace "held together by root and ruin" mirroring Maren. The ending offers a resonant answer—she carries the architecture of compromise alone, the moons part, the daily cost remains—without moralizing. One minor tell: "It is mundane and daily and it will bore you" edges toward thematic summary, though rooted in her voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters through her diplomat's precision ("operatively gentle," "careful tenderness") and embodied fatigue. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Maren's speech pursues ratification under ritual pressure, and both delegations' silence/body language (Tohn's medals, Ilessi's wire-thin fury) carry subtext. Diction stays character-appropriate ("conviction," "architecture of compromise"), and the rhythm modulates from reflective climb to clipped peak moment ("Sign now") to elegiac descent. One artifact: "like a shield, like a child, like proof" stacks three similes in the final beat where a single charged image would tighten closure voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines layer world-building, character history, and present action. Figurative language is mostly controlled ("light poured...like honey," "chains of celestial iron"), though the closing triple simile ("like a shield, like a child, like proof") inflates a peak moment with synonym churn. A paraphrase loop appears: "She was operatively gentle, had always been — not soft, never soft, but precise in her gentleness" recycles "gentle/gentleness" across adjacent clauses without new pressure. The template cadence "She had negotiated...She set...She pressed...She descended" creates rhythmic monotony in high-stakes beats. No grammar errors; clarity remains high. These patterns lower momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ritual-binding peace negotiation premise is familiar (diplomat ends ancient war), but the piece personalizes through specifics: the ebony clipboard as prosaic anchor, the moons' 43-year conjunction, Maren's nerve-damaged hand, and the "flawed beauty" reframe. The insight that peace is "mundane and daily" and "will bore you" offers a fresh inflection on the cost-of-peace trope. Transformation test: swapping names/places would hollow the terrace's acoustics, the clipboard's decades of treaties, and Maren's particular scars, yet the emotional arc (lonely diplomat secures treaty, descends alone) remains structurally derivative of the diplomat-as-Christ-figure template. No close echoes of famous lines, and the piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren (forever war peace negotiator) appears in all beats: climbs, reflects, places document, delivers ultimatum, witnesses signatures, descends. Her agency drives the key turn—forcing both delegations to sign by articulating the price and leveraging the ritual deadline. Her operational gentleness (listening, precision) shapes tactics throughout. Closure hinges on her choice to carry the clipboard alone again, accepting the recurring cost of her role. Strong causal presence across setup, middle, and ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in three beats: placed on altar, used to hold the Accord, carried against her chest at descent. Its "scratched and nicked" surface from "decades of use, every mark a treaty" charges it with history. The final reprise—"like a shield, like a child, like proof"—reweights it as both burden and validation. Development beat: it anchors the ritual signing. Closure linkage is strong, though the triple simile dilutes specificity slightly. Not strictly indispensable (another object could hold treaties), but its recurring presence and final transformation earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The price of redemption is articulated on-page: "surrender of the thing you clutch tightest," the Selt opening camps and acknowledging displacement, the Achori disarming militias and allowing settlers to remain. Maren names it explicitly ("That is the price of redemption") and the cost is felt in her trembling hands, loneliness, and the delegations' visible resistance (Tohn's jaw, Ilessi's fists). It shapes the dominant stake and the final image: she pays the recurring price of carrying the proof alone. The concept is both thematic and tactical—it structures the Accord's terms and charges the closure. Strong setup, middle pressure, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is defined early ("not soft, never soft, but precise in her gentleness the way a surgeon is precise with a blade") and shown through her method: listening first, approaching every warlord "with the same careful tenderness." It enables her negotiation success but costs her personal relationships (marriages, daughter). The trait constrains her speech at the peak—she does not rage or coerce, but names the price calmly. One on-page tradeoff is visible: her precision under pressure versus the loneliness that "rushed back in" afterward. Present in setup and closure, with middle beats implied rather than dramatized. Mid-band for demonstrated constraint and cost, but not indispensable—another temperament could reach the same outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muster" appears in "Now she needed to muster everything she had left" at the midpoint, signaling the peak effort. The signing turn traces to her speech and the ritual's pressure, but "muster" itself is a label for internal resolve rather than a distinct dramatized action. It primes the peak but does not redefine options—the moons' conjunction and her ultimatum do the causal work. Present in middle development, contributes to escalation, but swappable with "gather," "summon," or similar resolve-verbs. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early: "oaths sworn on this terrace could not be broken" during moons' conjunction, which "occurred once every forty-three years." The mechanics matter throughout: the terrace's acoustics, the altar stone, the hum "felt in the teeth, the chest, the marrow" when the moons touch, and the oath sealing "into the stone, the sky, the two names." The ritual constrains the timeline (midsummer, convergence window) and shapes Maren's tactic—she leverages celestial binding to enforce the Accord. Setup, middle pressure, and closure all depend on the ritual's binding power. The piece would collapse without this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is present from the opening climb and supplies resources that affect the outcome: "grooves worn by ten thousand years of feet," acoustics that carry Maren's voice "without effort," the altar stone at center, and the blood-stained limestone that lends gravity. The twin moons' alignment overhead provides the ritual's celestial constraint. The setting is integrated across all three gates—setup (climb and description), middle (altar and acoustics during the speech), and closure (descent down ancient steps)—and its properties (ritual binding, acoustic design) enable the treaty signing. Strong causal presence; not merely postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—moons' slow dance toward conjunction—is signaled early ("beginning their slow dance toward conjunction") and tracked through the scene: "the moons drew closer, their edges nearly kissing," "The moons touched," and finally "the moons began their long, slow parting." The conjunction tightens the decision window ("Sign now, or walk down those steps") and its completion seals the oath with physical pressure ("hum...felt in the teeth"). The 43-year cycle adds stakes. Time shapes tactics and charges the peak moment, though the slow pace means urgency is ritual rather than immediate peril. Strong setup and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to anchor ideals in practice" is articulated on-page: "I have spent my life trying to anchor ideals in practice. Peace is not an ideal. It is a practice." The desire is dramatized through her accumulated costs (marriages, daughter, nerve damage) and the choice to descend alone again carrying the clipboard "like proof that the broken could still build something that held." Friction between want (to build lasting peace) and cost (recurring loneliness, trembling hands) is visible. Present in setup (career history), middle (speech), and closure (proof-carrying descent). The phrasing edges toward thematic summary, but the cost is felt. Solid integration with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is introduced as an insult ("the Achori ambassador had once called her") that Maren accepts as truth, and the tone coheres through imagery: the terrace "held together by root and ruin," limestone cracks "gilded...into something almost beautiful," Maren "riddled with flaws, held together by conviction." The tone modulates under pressure—reflective during the climb, clipped at the peak ("Sign now"), elegiac at descent—and charges the final image: she carries the clipboard "like proof that the broken could still build something that held." Coherent across turns, purposeful modulation, and strong closure linkage. The tone is indispensable to the piece's emotional architecture.</comment>
