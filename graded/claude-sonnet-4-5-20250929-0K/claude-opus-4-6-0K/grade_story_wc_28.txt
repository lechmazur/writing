<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elif's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing the tessera, renaming via cipher, facing the soldier). The retrocognitive visions provide genuine internal contradiction—she experiences Davut's ancient terror alongside her own present fear. Minor wobble: the soldier's past (kind boy who wept over a bird) feels like a convenient softening device rather than earned character work. The final choice to give a false name carries visible cost (renunciation of identity) scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered historical visions, present-tense renaming work, and the soldier encounter, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elif remains kneeling, the sky shattered, the mercy aberrant. Cost is legible in the final image—her endurance forecloses safety and commits her to continued illegality. One meaningful deepening occurs when the soldier's approach tests her cipher system on-page. The closure reweights "aberrant mercy" through the shattered-sky motif without requiring a decisive physical act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shattered sky, scorched flagstones, and ancient mosaic anchor the scene immediately and return charged at closure ("sky remained shattered...she remained kneeling"). The tessera functions as micro-setting, constraining her retrocognitive method and charging the final survival image. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, soldier approaching, hand-to-hand paper transfer). Minor gap: the plaza's physical layout beyond "central path" remains vague, limiting tactical pressure from environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the vulnerable through renaming) is signaled early and tested on-page when the soldier asks her name. One meaningful tightening: she must use her own false-name cipher under direct interrogation, narrowing options with visible risk. The choice is hers (giving the false name, calibrating her expression via the vision) and forecloses the path of honesty. Cost is unmistakable: continued illegality punishable by death, plus the psychic toll of carrying Davut's terror. Agency through renunciation and endurance fits Accumulative lens; no need for multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (compassion that breaks law, categorization as violence) emerges organically from Elif's renaming work and the regime's ethnic lists without authorial moralizing. The tessera/shattered-sky motif recurs purposefully: both are "broken but still holding together, still forming a pattern if you knew how to read it." The final image—"mercy remained aberrant, and therefore the only kind that mattered"—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question without stating a tidy moral. Subtext operates in the soldier encounter (her softened expression, his past glimpsed) and the warm-coldness voice. Minor slip: "aberrant mercy" label appears twice in narration, edging toward echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elif; distance tightens during the retrocognitive vision and soldier encounter. Voice carries distinct texture: "warm coldness she had perfected," "cradling empathy in arms of steel." The prose modulates under pressure (shorter clauses when the soldier approaches). Psychic signature is selective—she notices the tessera's blue light, Davut's hope, the soldier's childhood kindness. Minor wobble: "warm coldness" and "arms of steel" phrases feel slightly over-constructed for the POV's interior register during peak stress, edging toward authorial framing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening line anchors voice and stakes with vivid specificity ("sky hung shattered...like a dome of cracked black glass"). Information density is high—most lines do double work (plot + character or atmosphere). Clarity remains strong through the vision and soldier encounter. Deductions: the phrase "gentle radical" in paragraph two reads as label-speak rather than dramatized trait; "aberrant mercy" recurs as a thematic claim rather than earned subtext; minor template cadence in the backstory block ("she called herself necessary" / "they had burned her clinic"). No loops touch the closure beat, so cap non-closure accumulation at −0.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The retrocognitive+renaming+cipher synthesis feels specific and non-obvious; removing any element would collapse the plot. The warm-coldness voice and shattered-sky motif provide fresh texture. Risk: extended backstory and lyric patterning heighten thematic weight without obscuring causality. Deduction: the "gentle radical who whispered revolution while bandaging wounds" framing and the regime-psychologist backstory feel closer to archetype (resistance-healer under authoritarian threat) than fully transformed. The cipher-via-mosaic method adds ingenuity, lifting the piece above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elif's choices (tracing tessera, renaming via cipher, giving false name to soldier, handing papers to survivors) drive all major beats and the ending. She is on-page throughout, making decisions under direct pressure. The "gentle radical" label appears early but her radicalism is dramatized through illegal renaming and direct confrontation, not merely observed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tessera appears in beat one (triggers vision of Davut), beat two (cipher work), beat three (residual pull during soldier encounter), and charges the ending ("beneath the rubble, Davut's hope persisted in a single blue tessera"). Its specific properties (blue, thumbnail-sized, historical artisan mark) enable the cipher method and the retrocognitive trap. Removing it would break causality and closure. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (she must touch it to access the cipher, re-experiencing trauma).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" shapes stakes (illegal renaming) and tactics (false-name generation, warm-coldness performance) on-page. It constrains her method—she cannot use force or openly defy, only deceive with kindness. The concept is dramatized in the paper-passing and soldier encounter, not merely thematic. Minor gap: the phrase "aberrant mercy" appears twice in narration as a claim rather than fully implicit subtext, edging toward label-only at those moments. Still, the concept redefines options throughout and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trait enables the tessera/cipher discovery (she sees Davut's artisan marks) and constrains her method (she must endure the visions to access the code). Cost is visible: "every act of historical cruelty she touched became personal, became hers to carry." It appears in beat one (Davut vision) and beat three (soldier's childhood glimpsed). Tradeoff: touching the tessera grants access but inflicts psychic trauma. Solid causal work, though the trait could have been tested more directly in the soldier encounter (e.g., vision interrupting her response).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Renaming is the dominant action driving all major turns: she generates false surnames from the mosaic cipher, hands them to survivors, and uses one herself when interrogated. The ending hinges on "one renamed life at a time." Removing or swapping this action would collapse the plot and thematic closure. The specificity (ethnic/religious markers → false armor) ties directly to the regime's list-based violence. High integration across setup, development, and payoff with clear cost (treason, punishable by death).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chipped-pattern cipher is signaled in beat two ("she had built a code that generated new surnames"), used on-page to generate papers, and shapes the interrogation tactic (she gives a cipher-generated name). The method's mechanics matter: artisan marks → old-script letters → dominant-group surnames. Removing the mosaic-cipher link would require a different method and lose the thematic resonance (ancient beauty → present survival). Strong specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plaza supplies the tessera/mosaic resource, stages the survivor gathering and soldier patrols, and recurs charged at closure ("she remained kneeling" in the plaza). The shattered sky appears in opening and ending, reweighting the "broken but holding together" motif. The setting constrains tactics (public space where soldiers patrol with lists) and charges the final image. Solid integration, though the plaza's physical layout (exits, cover, crowd density) could have sharpened tactical pressure in the soldier beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After the great fire" and "three days ago" anchor the timeframe early. The fire's aftermath supplies urgency (ruins, regime lists, survivor need) and Elif's motive (burned clinic). "Two days" of renaming work establishes her sustained illegality. The timeframe tightens the decision to continue despite detection risk. Minor gap: no on-page clock during the soldier encounter (how long does she have? when will he return?) to sharpen immediate pressure. Still, the post-catastrophe window shapes all choices and the ending's endurance stance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cradle empathy in arms of steel" is dramatized through the warm-coldness performance (tender voice, hard eyes) and the choice to rename illegally despite death penalty. Friction is visible: her gentleness (bandaging, whispering) conflicts with the unyielding refusal to stop, requiring deception and hardness. The motivation drives the tessera-touching (to access the cipher despite trauma) and the soldier encounter (calibrated softness as tactic). The phrase appears twice in narration, edging toward tell, but the choices embody the contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is coherent through turns: tender lullaby voice + hard ceramic-like eyes in the soldier beat; gentle radical + steel-armed empathy in framing; the final "shattered sky" + "kneeling" poise balances fragility and endurance. Tone modulates with pressure—lyric texture in vision beats, tighter syntax during interrogation—and charges the ending's paradox (aberrant = necessary, broken = holding). Minor slip: the phrase "warm coldness" is stated rather than purely enacted, reducing subtlety. Still, the tonal paradox integrates across the arc.</comment>
