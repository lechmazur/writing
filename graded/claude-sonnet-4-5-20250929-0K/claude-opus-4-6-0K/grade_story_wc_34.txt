<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is coherent and particular—she seeks connection through decoding and song, articulated through concrete micro-choices (holding the plate, singing without her own composition). Internal contradiction is light; her loneliness and need to be heard drive action consistently. Interiority is vivid ("driftingly alert," sensory specificity), though peak emotional moments veer toward abstraction ("the particular relief of someone finally understood"). The final choice to return and the shift in relationship feel earned by prior pattern, foreclosing isolation with felt warmth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early; the misty courtyard, Lira's identity, and the ghost premise are clear by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs: the ghost's plea becomes legible, Lira sings, and the murals shift from desperate encoding to open image—a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief, mutual understanding) with felt cost (the ghost's long loneliness, Lira's years of labor). The accumulation of lightning-triggered glowing, tactile bolt-plate reading, and song braids tightly to the closure image. Closure cost is visible: "something had shifted… carefully, gratefully, against the dark."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard pressures all action: flagstones, luminous murals, lightning-and-thunder intervals that trigger peak visibility. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice with tactile specificity (warm, raised dots) and constrains the decoding process. Sensory detail is selective and anchored to POV—mist, condensation, cloud-churned gold. The courtyard functions as both setting and character (the ghost persists in paint and stone), charging the final image when the graffiti "settled into stillness." Micro-setting (wall, metal plate, sky) alters tactics and stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: mutual articulation of unspoken need. One meaningful tightening: Lira lifts the plate, reads "SING WHAT I CANNOT SAY," and sings—the ghost's desperation becomes legible, enabling the shift from hidden plea to open relief. Agency is clear (Lira chooses to sing the ghost's story). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no reversals are required, but the moment between lightning and thunder narrows the window and the song forecloses isolation. Cost is felt: years of loneliness resolved, "silence that felt full." No antagonist needed; situational and internal pressure suffice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—connection across silence and code, longing to be heard—emerges from the murals, the bolt plate's tactile translation, and the sung ballad. No overt statement; the final image (shared language held "like a lantern holds its flame") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture (palm on warm wall), silence intervals, and the ghost's shift from encoded desperation to plain luminous face. The plate and song are not symbolic convenience but causal particulars that enable the closure. Quiet ending earns its resonance through accumulated sensory and conceptual weight; avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Lira. Perceptual signature is distinct: "driftingly alert," sensory focus on mist/metal/sound. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"tinkersong wonder," "graffiti… luminous, intricate"—though occasional elevated register ("liminal space," "cascaded") nudges beyond strict voice consistency under peak pressure. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close on tactile dots, wider on thematic reflection). One filter-verb cluster ("she'd learned," "she'd discovered") compresses backstory efficiently without dulling immediacy. Compression and lyric cadence are taught early and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high—most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("code can weep," "wall can hold a soul as gently as a cupped hand holds water"), though density in the singing paragraph ("tinkersong wonder," "paint and stone," "liminal space") approaches pattern-taught lyricism without crossing into muddle. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One minor scaffold: "the ghost in the code had no name that she knew" slightly restates prior implication. Proofreading clean; action order clear. Final image recharges prior motifs (lantern, flame, mist) with fresh weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—ghost encoded in graffiti, decoded via tactile flower-press plate, voiced by a balladeer—synthesizes folklore, code, and sensory translation in a non-obvious combination. The courtyard-above-clouds and lightning-interval mechanics are specific and memorable. Tropes (lonely ghost, wandering artist) are transformed through the bolt-plate's second purpose and the grammar of shared language. Emotional specificity (particular relief, silence that felt full) avoids generic templates. Risk is moderate: the lyric mode and accumulative pressure could flatten, but escalation and closure remain legible. No close echoes of famous work detected. Transformation test: swapping names/places would lose the alpine flowers, bolt-plate heritage, and cloud-setting particularity—integration is strong.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's choices—setting the plate, reading the wall, singing the ghost's story, pressing her palm to the wall—create the key turn from encoded desperation to open relief. Setup early (paragraph one), development (decoding and singing), and payoff (shared language established). She drives two beats (reading, singing) and the closure hinges on her voice. Cost is tied to her years of labor and the risk of being unheard. Swappability is low; a different character type would alter the closure's tone and mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate is handled in three beats: set down (warm from ascent), held against the wall to encode raised dots, and hummed smooth at closure. Its dual purpose (grandmother's flower press turned tactile decoder) is specific and irreplaceable. Development: enables the ghost's message. Payoff: "surface now smooth, the message received and answered." The plate constrains decoding mechanics and charges the final image with heritage and warmth. Removal would break the translation method and tactile closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code concept shapes all stakes: Lira decodes murals, the ghost encodes loneliness in paint, and the shift from desperate encoding to plain image is the story's hinge. Setup early (paragraphs three and four), development (binary sequences, hexadecimal heart, "SING WHAT I CANNOT SAY"), and payoff (face "neither old nor young, smiling"). The concept defines tactics (reading walls, singing translation) and the closure (mutual understanding via code-to-voice). Swapping for generic haunting would lose the encoding mechanics and thematic grammar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears once at the peak singing moment, describing her awareness between physical and liminal space. It colors her perceptual state but does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost; the singing would proceed without the label. No setup or development beats tied to this trait. Payoff is tangential (she senses fullness in silence). Functional but replaceable; a generic "focused" or "open" would serve similarly. Scores mid-band for atmospheric presence without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Encoding drives the ghost's existence and Lira's life work. Setup: "consciousness… uploaded into… carved channels and painted surfaces," "she'd spent… learning to decode." Development: the ghost encodes unspoken needs (open mouth, hand through static, hexadecimal heart). Payoff: Lira's song encodes the ghost's story in voice, and the murals stop encoding—"no longer desperate." Major turn traces to this action; removal would collapse the premise and closure. Two beats (ghost encodes plea, Lira encodes song) and causal pressure throughout. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Graffiti-art encoding is signaled early (paragraph three: "luminous, intricate murals… spirals of code nested inside painted vines") and its mechanics matter throughout. Development: Lira reads the shifting symbols, the bolt plate translates raised dots. Payoff: murals cascade into plain images, then settle. The method constrains her approach (she must read walls, not hear voice) and shapes the closure (visual relief replaces encoded desperation). Two beats (reading, final cascade) and causal necessity. Swapping for generic haunting medium would lose tactile and visual specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is present in every beat. Setup: "floated above… flagstones slick with condensation." Development: the courtyard's perimeter murals are the ghost's medium; lightning below triggers peak glow; cloud-top thunder rolls. Payoff: "clouds churned in silver and gold… courtyard… held their shared language like a lantern." The setting supplies the ghost's substrate, the lightning clock, and the isolation that charges Lira's return. Removal would eliminate the story's spatial and atmospheric logic. Three beats, high irreplaceability, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lightning-and-thunder interval is signaled early (paragraph five: "Between lightning and thunder… murals always glowed brightest"), shapes the reading attempt (she counts heartbeats, waits for glow), and returns at closure ("sang until the lightning came again… pause before the next thunder"). The timeframe tightens the window for peak visibility and marks narrative rhythm. Development: she times her reading to the glow. Payoff: the interval frames the shift to "silence that felt full." Two beats, causal pressure moderate (the glow is peak visibility but not a hard deadline), closure linkage present. Specific and purposeful, though not strictly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Articulating unspoken needs is the dominant stake. Setup: Lira is "seldom-heard," her songs "drifted… only when the fog was thick enough to hide her face." Development: the ghost tries to articulate ("open mouth, but silent… hand reaching through static") and sends "SING WHAT I CANNOT SAY." Payoff: Lira sings the ghost's loneliness, the ghost's face appears smiling with relief, and they find "the grammar for what neither could say alone." Motivation is dramatized in every beat, friction between desire and isolation is constant, and cost (years of solitary decoding, the ghost's long plea) is visible. Three beats, closure hinges on this need, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tinkersong wonder—whimsical, reverent curiosity—is coherent throughout and modulates with pressure. Setup: "misty courtyard floated… like a forgotten balcony of heaven," "luminous, intricate murals." Development: "discovering that broken things can still make music, that code can weep, that a wall can hold a soul as gently as a cupped hand holds water." Payoff: "carefully, gratefully, against the dark" and "humming a melody… something finally free." Tone charges the final image without static repetition. One slip: "liminal space" and "tinkersong wonder" as on-page labels nudge toward overt declaration rather than pure atmospheric effect. Two beats, closure linkage strong, slight label-reliance in peak moment.</comment>
