<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The painter exists as pure concept without interiority, contradiction, or embodied emotion. No on-page choices alter her state; she performs the same ritual every spring with "perceptively calm awareness" that reads as diagnostic label rather than lived tension. The borrowed-heartbeat cost is asserted but never dramatized through hesitation, physical toll, or micro-choice that would make it felt. Children and townspeople appear as scenery rather than pressure; no relationship forces a decision that changes anything.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece operates in pure summary mode across an unspecified number of springs with no single dramatized event. Orientation is delayed—who she is, when this specific visit occurs, and what singular stake drives this telling remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The "borrowed heartbeat" mechanism and her inevitable departure are established facts rather than causally linked turns. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the final paragraph offers lyric closure but the cost (one heartbeat less) was pre-declared, not earned through a decision made under pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism parapet and echoing terrace are vividly rendered with light, sound, and water-beaded stone. Sensory hierarchy supports the painter's method, and the vespers-to-twilight window is consistently invoked. However, setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint—no locked door, missing tool, or spatial limit alters a choice. The body as micro-setting is absent; the painter's ink-stained fingers are mentioned but never used to grip, fumble, or fail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early or tested on the page. The painter arrives, hums, paints mirages, and leaves in identical ritual across unspecified springs; no escalation or tightening occurs. The borrowed heartbeat is a pre-set price, not a dilemma faced in scene. Children see visions, but no child's reaction complicates the painter's method or forces a choice between competing goods. The piece reads as explanatory legend rather than escalating conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of possibility versus mortality emerges clearly, and the borrowed-heartbeat metaphor is evocative. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "One borrowed heartbeat less. One possibility more." This moralizing summary replaces scene pressure and earned resonance. The children's laughter and the priest's disapproval remain abstract; no particular child's vision reweights the painter's understanding or cost in a way that complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and distinct, with purposeful compression in "she graced Vellara each spring like weather, like swallows." POV is stable third-limited on the town's collective memory; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is appropriate for legend-telling. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic register ("perceptively calm awareness," "afterimages," "dusky harmony") that sits oddly against the folk-tale frame. Dialogue is absent, so conversational tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean and rhythmically varied. Some figurative language is strong: "her hands alive with purpose," "seeds of what could be, rooted in the briefest, most sacred silence." However, the opening runs a paraphrase loop across adjacent sentences explaining her elusiveness (children/old women/priests each describe her differently without adding pressure). Stock phrasing appears: "the quality of someone who moves through the world without disturbing its surface" reads as unearned abstraction. Filter verbs are appropriately sparse. Closure image ("One borrowed heartbeat less. One possibility more.") is thematically clear but structurally inert—no new image charges prior material.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mirage-painter and coded-lullaby premise is fresh and the borrowed-heartbeat cost is evocative. However, the piece reads as explanatory backstory for a character who might anchor a dramatized story rather than a complete narrative. The legend-telling mode, while executed cleanly, is a familiar frame (mysterious visitor, seasonal ritual, cost paid offstage). No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for safety by summarizing many springs instead of dramatizing one.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She performs the same ritual every spring; her "perceptively calm awareness" is asserted, not tested. Missing middle development and closure participation as agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prism parapet is seeded early, used as the workspace where light refracts through rainwater droplets, and reprised in the final third ("pressed their palms flat against the balustrade"). It enables the mirage-painting method and carries sensory specificity. However, it does not constrain a choice or shift meaning at closure—children feel a vibration, but this is aftermath, not reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Borrowed heartbeat is explained mid-piece as the cost mechanism and named again in the final line. It frames the stake conceptually but is never dramatized—no scene shows her pausing, hesitating, or paying the pulse in real time. Missing middle development as on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears once as a descriptor ("perceptively calm awareness") and colors the legend's tone, but it does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. Label-only trait without micro-choice pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Grace is invoked explicitly ("Grace was not a word the townspeople used lightly, but they used it for her") and described as "motion, as presence." It characterizes her method but does not drive a turn—no moment where she must choose grace over force or where its cost is tested. Present in theme, absent in causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are explained in paragraph two, demonstrated when she hums and children sing along, and tied to the mirage mechanism. The method is specific and integral to the concept. However, it is described rather than tested—no failed note, no child who sings wrong and forces adaptation. Functional but not causal across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Echoing terrace in spring is seeded early, amplifies sound (footsteps, birdsong, drip), and recurs in the children's final touch. Spring timing and the terrace's acoustics enable the coded-lullaby method. It does not tighten a choice or shift under pressure, but the lyric reprise (children pressing palms, feeling vibration) reweights the space with residual presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled early ("over the hush before the evening bells rang") and reprised at closure ("The bells would ring"). It brackets the ritual and creates a ceremonial rhythm. However, the clock does not tighten tactics—no race against the bells, no mirage left unfinished. Atmospheric frame without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Motivation is stated clearly ("to persuade mirrors to show possibilities") and enacted repeatedly. However, it is never conflicted on the page—no moment where she doubts the gift, weighs a refusal, or confronts a mirror that resists. Told and demonstrated, not dramatized under friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is invoked explicitly in the final stretch ("the dusky harmony of twilight") and the prose sustains a lyric, reverent tone throughout. Tone is coherent and supports the legend-telling mode. It does not modulate meaningfully under pressure (no scene tightens or fractures the harmony), but the final image of bells ringing and spring continuing carries the tone into closure with gentle resonance.</comment>
