<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal logic is consistent and her obsessive attention to detail drives choices throughout. The interiority is concrete—touching the singed patch, hands going cold at the discovery—and her decision to call the journalist is earned by the accumulation of evidence. Minor slip: her motivation feels more procedural than emotionally conflicted; the stakes remain cerebral rather than viscerally personal, which prevents entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Maren finds the truth and chooses to release it, with the cost implicit in what she's about to set in motion. The causal lens holds—each discovery links to the next through motivated search—and the final breath-released image reweights the archive's hum from forgetting to witness. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph. One tightening (the draft message) narrows options decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive as cathedral is vivid and its hum recurs with purpose. The singed patch is handled twice and charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean within Maren's workstation. Minor deficit: the archive itself doesn't constrain a choice—it enables all moves equally—so the setting functions more as atmosphere than tactical pressure, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go, which becomes finding the suppressed truth—is clear early and tightens through the draft message discovery. That discovery forecloses Maren's initial procedural audit and forces her to become a whistleblower. The cost is legible: she's about to break corporate silence. No second reversal is required at this length, but the price could be more viscerally felt on the page to enter the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erasure, corporate complicity, and the persistence of truth in digital memory. The patch and the recurring number 7-4-1-1 accumulate meaning without overt statement. The final image—silence as construction versus release—offers a resonant answer to "where do deleted files go" without moralizing. The line "which, unlike a person, could still be brought all the way home" reweights the premise with quiet force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices "when a picture frame shifted two degrees," when numbers recur. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent under pressure. The dialogue is minimal but purposeful—"I found her" carries subtext and goal. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("she had wanted," "she meant") slightly dull immediacy in the final beats, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm and strong momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Two artifacts lower the score: "the kind of person who noticed" is scaffolding exposition, and "through the quiet, sensed absence" late in the piece is slightly overwrought. The opening and closing lines are strong, and the patch description is economical and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The digital-archive cold case is a fresh synthesis of familiar elements, and the recurring number as breadcrumb is a specific, non-obvious choice. The piece commits fully to its premise. However, the corporate cover-up and whistleblower arc follow a recognizable template without a bold subversion or surprising complication. The emotional truth is present but the arc is somewhat predictable, keeping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren as corporate memory keeper is indispensable: her role grants archive access, her trait (noticing patterns) drives the discovery, and her final choice to call the journalist is the story's decisive act. She appears in every beat and her unique position makes the plot possible. High integration across setup, development, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patch appears early (pinned above her workstation), is touched during late-night work, and returns in the climax ("She stared at the patch, its melted edge a scar"). However, it functions more as a memorial talisman than a tactical constraint—removing it would not break the plot logic. It charges the emotional tone but doesn't alter choices, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The missing-persons cold case is the story's engine: Diane Okoro's disappearance frames the audit, the deleted profile generates the quest, and the draft message containing "7411" is the key turn. The concept shapes stakes, tactics, and closure. Without this exact cold case, the story collapses. Irreplaceable across all three gates with causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is dramatized early ("noticed when a picture frame shifted two degrees") and enables the core discovery—spotting the recurring 7-4-1-1 pattern that everyone else missed. It constrains her social life (implied obsession) and drives the plot. Strong setup and development, though the cost of this trait could be more visible on the page to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lie (Gregory Lam's falsified inspection results) is the story's moral hinge and the climactic discovery. It redefines the entire case from accident to cover-up, motivates Maren's whistleblowing, and provides the felt cost (three crew recovered, Okoro was not). The lie appears mid-story but transforms all prior material. Removing it collapses both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recurring number 7-4-1-1 is introduced early (metadata string, timestamp, pixel coordinates), shapes Maren's search tactics across multiple beats, and proves to be the maintenance log number in the climactic discovery. It's the structural spine linking all investigative moves. Specific, irreplaceable, and causally essential to closure. High integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The social network archive is indispensable: it grants the fragments that enable the investigation (cached replies, tagged photos, message drafts), provides Maren's access and authority, and its metaphorical hum frames the opening and closing. The setting supplies the resources and constraints that make the plot possible. Strong causal presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once as a lyric phrase describing the archive's hum and Maren's late-night work. It establishes atmosphere but does not constrain choices or tighten decisions. The timeframe itself (eight years since the crash, unspecified audit duration) is present but vague. Functional but replaceable; no clear causal pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where deleted files go" is established early in the official audit framing, dramatized through Maren's search actions, and answered in the ending: "they go where Diane Okoro went, into a silence that someone with authority deliberately constructed." It drives beats and shapes closure. Minor friction: the intellectual curiosity could show more visceral conflict or cost on the page to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone of "sensed absence" is coherent throughout—Okoro "should have left more traces," the archive hums with residual warmth, the final breath "released" after years of holding. It modulates appropriately from procedural to moral urgency and charges the final image. The tone shapes atmosphere and thematic resonance but does not directly constrain a choice, placing it in the upper-7s rather than indispensable range.</comment>
