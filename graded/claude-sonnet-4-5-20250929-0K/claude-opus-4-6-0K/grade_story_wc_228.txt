<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eloise's internal progression from repetition to risk is grounded in concrete micro-choices: she walks past her usual spot, follows a path that crumbles, enters the cave, and abandons the quay entirely. The mirror's crack serves as embodied pressure rather than mere symbol, and her whispered promise anchors the decision with visible cost (eleven years of safe work discarded). Interiority remains specific—"intimately aloof" smile, the confession-like painting strokes—without sliding into diagnostic labels. Minor deduction: the epiphany about "temporary eternity" arrives quickly and could have been tested by one more on-page friction before full acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Eloise abandons the quay (eleven years of identity) and returns to the cave, forgoing her established role. The causal chain is clean—mirror cracks → promise recalled → wrong turn → cave discovery → painting completed → quay abandoned—and the lens (Causal with lyric texture) holds. Orientation anchors promptly (Tuesday/Wednesday mirror, harbor wall, south coast path). One tightening occurs when the light shifts and the moment passes, forcing her to carry only the painted board and shell forward. Cost is legible: "She did not return to the quay the next morning" forecloses her public identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave supplies mineral pigment colors (ochre, verdigris, iron red) and the shifting daylight shaft that creates the fleeting reflection, directly enabling the painting and charging the closure image. The scallop shell with mineral stain becomes a tactile anchor across beats and a talisman carried out, constraining her return by its physical presence. Spatial choreography (ledge crumbles, ivy curtain, pool edge, light from ceiling crack) guides movement and discovery without postcard padding. The cave's inaccessibility and hourly light changes shape her decision to return daily, making setting indispensable to the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keeping the nineteen-year-old promise to paint something true) is signaled early via the cracked mirror and intensifies through the cave discovery, which offers the first real test in eleven years. One clear tightening: the daylight reflection vanishes mid-painting, forcing Eloise to complete the work from memory and embodied understanding rather than direct observation. The cost is visible—she walks away from her established identity as "the quay painter" and the steady tourist income. Agency drives closure: her choice to return to the cave rather than the quay forecloses safety and publicness. Slight deduction: the ledge crumbling feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choice, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (the promise to paint truth, the paradox of capturing fleeting permanence) emerges from the cave's physical properties and Eloise's embodied struggle, not authorial summary. The insight "temporary eternity" is earned by the literal reflection disappearing while she paints it, making the concept concrete. The shell as "proof that even the smallest thing could carry the signature of deep time" integrates motif with action. Final image—returning to the cave where "the temporary eternity renewed itself, waiting for no one, revealing everything to whoever arrived"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor penalty: "It had done its work" in the final line edges toward thematic summary, though it remains tied to the mirror's causal role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays clean with close psychic distance; all perception filters through Eloise's artistic eye (barnacled stones, mineral color names, "strokes that felt like confessions"). Narrative certainty matches her knowledge; the cave's history is inferred, not declared. Diction remains character-specific: "intimately aloof," "the thing beneath it," "signature of deep time" feel lived-in rather than imposed. Register holds steady under pressure; no filter-verb stacks or corporate drift. Voice modulates purposefully—compressed syntax during the painting ("She used her fingers when the brush was too slow") accelerates against the reflective passages. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no algorithmic stems or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: "The mirror had held her reflection that night, and she had whispered the promise into it like a spell" does three jobs (history, motive, stakes) in one line. Minor deduction for two instances of mild overwriting: "a version of forever that existed only because she was here to witness it" and "the promise she had made to herself was never about producing a single masterpiece" both tilt toward abstraction in peak reflective beats, though they remain voice-coherent. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong; the cave description integrates action (kneeling, turning the shell) with sensory detail efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (artist stuck in repetition discovers hidden place that unlocks creative risk) follows a recognizable template, but the execution personalizes it through the mirror's crack as causality trigger, the cave's mineral palette mirroring her materials, and the choice to abandon public identity rather than integrate both practices. The "wrong turn" mechanism and the temporary reflection are specific enough to avoid generic placeholder status. The ending resists tidy resolution—she doesn't return triumphant or synthesize old and new—but the risk of abandoning eleven years' identity feels more asserted than tested on the page. Solid craft with fresh details, but the arc's inevitability doesn't fully surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eloise ("nostalgic quay painter") is introduced in paragraph two, drives the middle discovery (enters cave, paints the pool), and makes the closure choice (abandons the quay to return to the cave). Her decision to walk south past her usual spot, then to enter the cave, then to paint it "raw," and finally to skip the quay entirely creates three key turns. The nostalgia is embodied in eleven years of repetition and the whispered promise, not merely told. Cost is visible: she forecloses her public role. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears first as "a scallop shell already wearing a faint pattern of mineral stain" that Eloise picks up and turns, then is painted into the foreground of her board, and finally carried out "in her coat pocket, a talisman." Two distinct beats (discovery and painting; exit as talisman). It charges the theme (small things carry deep time) and is handled on the page. Missing: it does not constrain a later choice or reappear in the ending image with reweighted meaning. Present in closure (carried out) but not causally active there; the cave and light do more work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is named at the cave pool discovery ("a version of forever that existed only because she was here to witness it"), immediately alters her painting approach (she works fast to capture it before the light shifts), and frames the closure choice (she returns to the cave "where the temporary eternity renewed itself"). The concept shapes stakes: she must paint truth that outlasts yet depends on her presence. It redefines what she's been attempting for eleven years and makes her abandonment of the quay necessary. Early signal, causal pressure, closure participation, and specificity all strong; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" appears once as a descriptor for her smile to tourists ("warm yet revealed nothing"). It characterizes but does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost. The trait is consistent with her withdrawal from the quay at the end, but that choice is driven by the promise and the cave discovery, not by this attribute. Label-only mention without beat involvement; swappable with "guarded" or "private" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "reveal" occurs when Eloise ducks through the ivy curtain and discovers the underground pool with its mineral walls and shifting light. This discovery enables the raw painting and triggers her insight about temporary eternity, driving the middle turn. The reveal also precipitates the closure: without the cave, she has no alternative to the quay. Setup and development strong; payoff present (she returns to the cave). Not unique—"stumbled discovery" is common—but the specific mechanism (crumbling ledge, ivy curtain, light shaft) gives it enough texture to resist easy swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"A wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis" is signaled early ("the path forked, and she took the left branch out of habit") and the mechanics matter: winter storms shifted the ground, the ledge crumbles, depositing her onto unseen rock. The method is causally active—without the wrong turn, no cave; without the cave, no raw painting or closure choice. It shapes the middle beat (discovery and painting) and the ending (daily return to the oasis). Specificity high (crumbling ledge, ivy curtain); irreplaceable within this plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network pressures every key choice: mineral colors on the walls supply palette inspiration; the daylight shaft through the ceiling crack creates the temporary reflection that must be captured before it vanishes; the pool's stillness enables the mirrored sky; shells at the pool's edge provide the talisman. The cave's inaccessibility (reached only by wrong turn) and hourly light changes force Eloise to return daily, shaping the closure. Setup, development, payoff all strong; removal would collapse plot and theme. Setting here is indispensable causal agent and image anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mirror cracks" is anchored (Tuesday crack noticed Wednesday, Thursday she walks south) and brackets the action. The mirror's prior history (kept since age nineteen, eleven years painting the quay) establishes duration and cost. Time does not tighten tactics on the page—no live clock during the cave painting—but the eleven-year span charges her decision to abandon the quay. Present in setup and closure (she skips "the next morning"), functional but not a tactical pressure within scenes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to keep a hidden promise to oneself" is dramatized early (whispered into the mirror at nineteen: "paint something true, not safe, not repeated") and creates friction with eleven years of safe repetition. The cracked mirror reactivates the promise ("time is up"), driving her to walk south. The cave painting fulfills it ("something raw… strokes that felt like confessions"), and the closure choice (abandon the quay, return to the cave) enacts the cost of keeping it. Desire, friction, cost all on the page; irreplaceable stake.</comment>
