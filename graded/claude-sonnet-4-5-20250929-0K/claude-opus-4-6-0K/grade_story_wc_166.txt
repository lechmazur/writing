<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ereth's interiority is vivid and voice-specific ("weeping without understanding why," the somatic anchor in her sternum), but her shift from tide dancer to cosmic transcendence feels more asserted than earned through competing impulses. The spontaneous anchoring and her weeks of study lack visible internal friction or cost that forecloses a path; she simply proceeds. The final ascension reads as reward rather than struggle with a visible price, weakening the felt cost requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by the garden's midpoint (gaps, glyphs accreting nightly) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the basin holds her reflection as "proof that stillness and motion were never opposites." Orientation anchors are solid (exile → inland → plateau garden by the second paragraph). The escalation is a pattern of density increase (glyphs accumulating), but the final "fledging" arrives without on-page resistance or a visible choice that narrows options, softening the felt cost and capping the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden is rendered with textural specificity (nightshade, lunar jasmine, granite basin, violet permanence) and the recurring basin constrains perception and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (stone paths, plateau, sky). The garden's constraint—spontaneous anchoring—shapes Ereth's choices across weeks, and the basin's reflection at closure reweights stillness/motion, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle; minor elevation into lyric mode without a second on-page choice or resource-driven tactic caps at 8.1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exilic survival and learning a new dance vocabulary—is signaled early and deepens through accumulation (glyphs, nightly practice). One meaningful tightening occurs when the final glyph settles and the anchor dissolves, but this arrives more as fulfillment than as a choice under competing pressures. No visible trade-off or cost forecloses a path; the ascension feels granted rather than won, preventing high-band entry despite coherent escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—transformation through stillness, exile as invitation—emerges from the recurring basin, gaps as grammar, and the glyphs as "stanzas in the same unfinished verse." The final image offers a resonant answer (stillness and motion as co-stanzas) without moralizing. However, the closing line ("a tide moved without knowing why it wept") edges toward overtly thematic sentiment rather than earning the emotional charge through prior particulars, and the cosmic-verse premise risks abstraction. The particulars of gaps and glyphs anchor well, keeping the score solid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("obsidian grace of a shadow sliding from a wall at dawn"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Ereth notices gaps, silence, light-years—and the diction matches a dancer attuned to rhythm and space. Minor register elevation ("neurochemical scrubbing," "gravitational whisper") occasionally drifts toward exposition rather than felt perception, and the final paragraph's coordinated clauses risk a manufactured symmetry, but the voice remains coherent and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere). The opening and closing images are strong. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("mooring…threaded through her sternum," "obsidian grace of a shadow") and in the final paragraph's near-paraphrase loop ("not as nostalgia, but as proof" and "never opposites, only stanzas"). The climactic glyphs-ignite sequence avoids artifacts, but the poetic density in non-peak moments (e.g., "exhalations of ancient light") skirts decoration without cost, capping the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tide dancer, exile, and cosmic inscription is specific and non-obvious, and the twilight garden as permanent dusk is a fresh inflection on liminal space. However, the ascension-via-glyphs structure echoes familiar transcendence arcs (exile → trial → apotheosis), and the nostalgic-ban premise, while conceptually intriguing, remains largely offstage backdrop rather than a lived constraint on the page. The transformation is coherent but the emotional calculus is more lyric assertion than earned friction, keeping the piece in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ereth's skill frames expectation in the first paragraph and her nightly dancing across weeks drives the middle beats (observing gaps, pulling starlight), but no single tide-dance choice creates a key turn or visible cost. The skill enables rather than constrains; she proceeds without friction. Present across beats but replaceable with "exiled artist."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears mid-story (discovery beat), dissolves into the first glyph, and seeds the nightly accumulation that culminates in the final ignition. It returns with reweighted meaning at closure (glyphs ignite, enabling fledging). Two beats (discovery, closure), causal pressure (enables transformation), but the speck itself could be swapped for any luminous particle without breaking logic, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elective exile is named in the opening and contextualizes Ereth's inland walk, but it functions as backstory premise rather than an on-page choice under pressure. Once she reaches the garden, exile becomes static condition; no moment where she weighs return, tests the boundary, or pays a cost tied to the exile decision itself. Present and thematically apt but does not shape a middle or closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Spontaneously anchored is dramatized on-page ("body refused to go further," mooring in sternum, weeping for an hour) and constrains her initial movement, forcing stillness. This enables the weeks of garden study. The anchor dissolves at closure, permitting fledging—a two-gate structure (setup, payoff) with felt cost (weeping, forced pause). Missing middle development where the anchor complicates a choice; the trait acts passively after setup.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fledging is signaled early (exile walk), prepared by the glyphs and star-shift recognition, and enacted in the final paragraph (rising from the garden floor). The action redefines options (earthbound → skyward) and delivers the closure image. Present in three beats (early hint, preparation, climax) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Slightly swappable with "ascend" or "transform," but the avian/detachment resonance with "newborn wave" tightens specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>By observing gaps is named mid-story ("studied the garden…by observing gaps") and its mechanics matter: gaps between leaves, silence, fractures become "the grammar of the world" that she learns to read, shaping her new dance vocabulary. The method enables middle beats (studying gaps → dancing with starlight) and charges the final image (grammar of gaps she learned). Three gates (setup, development, closure participation) with causal work, but the method could be replaced with "stillness" or "patterns" without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden is established early (second paragraph), supplies the granite basin and stone paths that Ereth uses across weeks, anchors her spontaneously, and provides the glyphs. The garden pressures her choice to stay, enables nightly practice, and the basin's reflection charges the closure image. Three gates, multiple beats (arrival, study, nightly dancing, closure), causal constraint (anchoring), and micro-setting (basin, paths) alters tactics. Strong integration; "garden" itself slightly generic but the violet permanence and specific flora elevate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the nostalgia ban is named in the opening and motivates Ereth's flight, but the timeframe remains offstage backdrop. No on-page moment where the ban's enforcers threaten her, where she weighs return under its rule, or where the ban's clock tightens a decision. The "weeks" in the garden lack a live urgency or deadline. Present and coherent but does not constrain a key choice or shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin is named mid-story ("what the garden was offering") and motivates the nightly dances that yield glyphs. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost (no friction between cosmic ambition and earthly loss). The glyphs accumulate passively; no beat where she risks something to gain one or weighs stopping. Functional across middle beats but lacks the friction required for high scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Obsidian grace appears once, in the anchor-dissolve image at closure, charging the moment with dark elegance and smooth inevitability. The tone across the piece—elevated, lyric, deliberate—modulates subtly from exile grief (weeping) to curiosity (studying gaps) to transcendent readiness (glyphs ignite). Coherent and purposeful, but "obsidian grace" as a phrase feels ornamental rather than arising from prior tonal work; the grace is asserted in one line rather than built through rhythm and pressure across beats.</comment>
