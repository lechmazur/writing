<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Della's interiority is concrete and particular ("the silences between sounds"), with clear motivation driving escalating attempts (buy, trade, threat, appeal). Her micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values, and the final decision to keep the fob after Maren's refusal of payment feels earned. Maren remains somewhat underdeveloped—her refusal pivots on stated principle rather than visible internal conflict—keeping the grade from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates through false starts that deepen mutual recognition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Maren gives Della the cylinder after hearing her insight ("It doesn't make a sound. It just stops"). Closure carries felt cost—Della receives her ghost but must carry its weight into "the ordinary, terrible morning." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening through the listening truce suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("brine and kerosene and the particular human musk") and the setting pressures the negotiation through its illicit commerce context. The watch fob as micro-setting object constrains Della's trade attempt and charges the final refusal. Spatial choreography across the market stalls is clear, though the rotting pier's physical menace remains more atmospheric than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop the cylinder's sale—is signaled immediately and pressure coheres through Della's escalating tactics (purchase, barter, threat, appeal). The meaningful deepening occurs when she asks to hear it, shifting from transactional to emotional ground, and the final exchange forecloses her attempt to pay, reweighting the encounter from commerce to human recognition. Cost is visible in her tears and the "ordinary, terrible morning" she must face. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cylinder's content: trust breaks in silence, not sound. The final image—Della climbing into morning with the ghost against her chest, the fob "keeping time for a world that did not deserve such precision"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; Maren's gift reweights the transaction from art-collector grotesque to returned dignity, and the watch fob's return with shifted meaning ("curiously steadfast") charges the ending without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "by the silences between sounds," "a wound that had learned to sell things," "the particular human musk of people who had decided laws were suggestions." Distance remains stable; dialogue feels natural and goal-driven with subtext ("I don't need payment for giving someone back their own ghost"). Rhythm modulates with pressure—shorter beats during negotiation, longer reflective movement at closure. Diction stays character-particular; no register drift or head-hopping. The prose signature is confident and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful rhythm variation and zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and voice-specific ("a truce of hush," "grief...like taxidermy"). Sentence openings vary; clarity is maintained throughout. Minor density slip: "Each approach was a false start, a door opened and shut" borders on summary of what we've just witnessed, and "curiously steadfast" recurs three times as a phrase-template, but neither touches closure or creates momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—stopping a recording's sale in an underground market—transforms familiar elements through specific, grounded choices: the wax cylinder as "The Sound of Trust Breaking," the pirate market's texture, the insight that trust's break is silent. The false-starts negotiation structure and the mutual recognition between two listeners feel earned rather than convenient. However, the moonshiner's-daughter-versus-art-collector frame and the underground-market-with-deadline setup trend toward recognizable templates, kept fresh primarily through voice and the thematic insight about silence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Della as moonshine runner's daughter is signaled early (paragraph 2), shapes her approach throughout (understanding of silences, distrust of laws), drives all negotiation attempts, and her choices create the key turn when she asks to hear the recording. Her background informs tactics and the final decision to accept Maren's gift without payment. Strong causal involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watch fob appears early (paragraph 2), is offered as trade (paragraph 9), and returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("curiously steadfast, keeping time for a world that did not deserve such precision"). However, its middle use is primarily transactional; Maren admires and refuses it without the object's properties constraining her choice. The lyric reprise charges the ending but the fob doesn't drive a second beat with distinct pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"A truce of hush" is introduced by name at paragraph 10, but the concept shapes the entire negotiation structure—Della's listening skill, the lengthening silences, the mutual recognition between two people "who lived by listening." It alters tactics (from threat to listening), enables the final exchange, and the story's thesis ("It doesn't make a sound. It just stops") directly interrogates the concept. Integral to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" describes Maren's calm (paragraph 7), recurs as the watch fob's final description (twice in closing paragraph). The trait enables Maren's refusals and her final gift, but it functions more as consistent characterization than a constraint with visible cost. The phrase's lyric return charges the ending image, qualifying for mid-band under the resonance allowance, but no on-page moment shows the trait forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Thwart" is the stated goal from paragraph 6 and structures all of Della's attempts. The action defines the negotiation sequence, and the story's ironic reversal—she thwarts the sale not by stopping it but by becoming the recipient through emotional honesty—redefines the verb's meaning. The major turn (asking to hear it, then Maren's gift) traces directly to this action's failure and transformation. High causal integration and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"False starts" is named explicitly (paragraph 9) and the method is demonstrated on the page through four distinct attempts (buy, trade, threat, appeal). Each attempt narrows options and deepens the impasse, building pressure that forces the shift to listening. The method shapes the story's accumulative structure and makes the final gift feel earned rather than convenient. Strong development and closure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market is established early with vivid detail and provides the illicit-commerce pressure that frames the stakes. Maren's stall location "where the pier's rot was worst" adds atmospheric menace. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature (proximity, exits, other vendors, the tide) alters a tactical choice. The market supplies context and tone but doesn't constrain moves the way a ticking resource or spatial obstacle would.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is stated in paragraph 6 ("Della had until sunrise") and invoked in the final paragraph ("Sunrise was coming"). However, time pressure remains abstract—no moments track the clock tightening, and the Charleston buyer never materializes to raise urgency. The timeframe frames the window but doesn't alter Della's tactics or force a rushed choice. Present but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" belongs to Maren (her art project's title), not Della. Della's motivation is to stop the sale and reclaim her father's voice. The phrase appears as Maren's concept and Della's refutation of it ("You can't capture the sound of trust breaking...It just stops"). This is thematic content, not Della's driving desire. The element is present but misattributed; it doesn't shape Della's goal-pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is explicitly named (paragraph 10: "a comforting unease, like sitting beside a fire you know will eventually go out") and the tone is sustained throughout—the market's menace paired with Della's quiet competence, the lengthening silences that feel both safe and loaded. The oxymoron charges the truce and modulates appropriately when Della cries. The final image ("ordinary, terrible morning") extends the tonal signature into closure. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
