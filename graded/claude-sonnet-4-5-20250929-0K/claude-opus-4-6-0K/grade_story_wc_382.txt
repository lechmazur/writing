<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand buildings is consistent and embodied through weekly study, but her interior life remains largely abstract—no contradictory impulses complicate her acceptance of the role. Mrs. Voss functions more as archetype than character; her "mysterious familiarity" is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final handoff feels ceremonial rather than earned by visible internal conflict. The ending forecloses a path (Elara becomes translator) but the cost—what she loses or renounces—is never made concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: weekly lessons build density, the rooftop scene deepens stakes through the quiz format, and the seal handoff reweights the opening sugar-borrowing into a deliberate recruitment. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts custodianship with the seal's warmth and the building's legibility as the final image. Orientation anchors early (Harwood Building, apartment 4C, three weeks prior). One persistent weakness: the cost of accepting this role is implied but never specified—what does Elara forfeit or risk by becoming the next translator?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Harwood's limestone facade, cracked mortar, and bricked-over east wall are filtered through Elara's architectural lens and constrain her study choices. The rooftop garden supplies a spatially distinct stage for the handoff; jasmine and meteor light charge the final image. The obsidian seal's warmth and the building's "breath" beneath Elara's feet anchor the closure moment with tactile specificity. Minor slip: the building's "eloquence" is asserted more than shown through concrete on-page choices it forces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the building's true language—is signaled early and tightens through the quiz interrogation ("What does the east wall say?"). The rooftop scene deepens pressure by making Elara's comprehension the test for receiving the seal. However, the escalation is largely question-and-answer; no live obstacle or competing want complicates the transfer. The cost of accepting custodianship (time, isolation, the weight of the chain of hands) is hinted at but not made legible as a present choice or forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth hidden beneath agreed-upon lies—emerges concretely through the bricked window, the cornerstone's dual inscription, and the seal's encoded message. The "chain of hands reaching back" reweights the initial sugar-borrowing as part of a lineage without stating a moral. The final image of the facade standing "proud and silent" while truth murmurs underneath offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction: "the keeper passes the tongue to the next who listens" leans slightly didactic, though it is framed as translation rather than authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (architectural metaphors, "whispered in a dialect she couldn't yet parse") is distinct and purposeful. Diction modulates appropriately: measured in lesson scenes, heightened under meteor light. Mrs. Voss's dialogue ("Every building tells agreed upon lies") carries subtext—she is testing and recruiting, not merely teaching. One minor slip: "spectral quietness that made Elara wonder" tells the narrator's uncertainty rather than showing a specific gesture that prompts the thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (long reflective sentences in early beats, shorter exchanges during the quiz). Information density is high: most sentences do double duty (e.g., "She taught languages that no living population spoke" establishes both profession and thematic ground). Two minor artifacts lower the score: "patiently nimble fingers that moved like a pianist's" stacks modifiers awkwardly, and "as it always had, waiting to be read" in the final paragraph loops the "waiting" motif without adding new pressure. No loops obscure causality, but these reduce propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—dead-language tutor as building translator, weekly tea as apprenticeship ritual—is specific and non-obvious. The obsidian seal as lineage token and the mason's encoded message offer fresh inflection on mentor-handoff tropes. Risk-taking is moderate: the rooftop quiz and meteor-lit transfer heighten ceremonial stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the emotional arc (eager student → chosen successor) is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or personal cost that surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mrs. Voss drives two key beats: the initial tea invitation (setup) and the rooftop interrogation that determines Elara's readiness (development and payoff). Her choices—withholding the seal until Elara proves comprehension—create the central turn. However, her interiority is opaque; she functions more as gatekeeper than a character with competing wants. Causal pressure is present but one-directional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian seal appears early (Mrs. Voss's desk), is translated by Elara mid-story (shaping her understanding), and is physically handed over at closure with reweighted meaning ("warm as though it had been held moments before by someone else"). Its warmth and engraved symbol constrain the handoff—Elara must decode the cornerstone message to earn it. Three beats, strong causal role, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept "agreed upon lies" is named explicitly in Mrs. Voss's dialogue and demonstrated through the bricked window (grief vs. permanence) and the cornerstone's dual inscription. It shapes Elara's study tactics and charges the final image (facade vs. murmuring truth). However, it does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page; it remains more thematic frame than on-page constraint. Present across beats but mid-integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is applied to Mrs. Voss's tea-pouring fingers and echoed in the phrase "patient and nimble enough to speak" at closure. It functions as a character label and a thematic callback but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The trait is ornamental—swappable with "careful" or "practiced" without structural impact. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The interrogation on the rooftop ("What does the east wall say?") is the pivotal action that tests Elara's readiness and triggers the seal handoff. It structures the climax and makes the transfer conditional on her answers. Removing it would require a different mechanism to dramatize her qualification. Strong causal role, closure-adjacent, but the quiz format itself is slightly swappable (could be a different test).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sugar-borrowing → weekly tea is signaled early, recurs across "a month" of lessons, and reappears in the final paragraph ("weekly cups of tea") as the medium through which truth is shared. The method shapes the pacing (gradual trust-building) and encodes the recruitment as neighborly ritual. However, the mechanics—why tea specifically—do not constrain choices; another recurring meeting would serve similarly. Present across beats, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The rooftop garden supplies the stage for the handoff and is charged by meteor light and jasmine scent in the final image. It enables privacy and ceremonial weight. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices—the quiz and transfer could occur elsewhere with minor edits. Present in setup (Elara didn't know it existed) and payoff (closure scene), but middle development is weak. Lyric participation rather than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to learn the building's language is established in paragraph one, drives her weekly study, and is tested on the rooftop. The motivation faces one visible friction: the cornerstone message reveals custodianship as the hidden cost of comprehension. This realization shifts her want (to translate) into a larger obligation (to become keeper). Causal across three beats, closure-linked, and the final image makes her new legibility concrete ("the truth went on murmuring").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is embodied in Mrs. Voss's expression ("as though she had been expecting Elara...for years") and sustained through the piece's ceremonial pacing and the building's "murmuring" voice. Tone modulates slightly—warmer during tea, more formal during the quiz—but remains coherent. The meteor light and the seal's ancestral warmth charge the final image with layered mystery. Tone supports closure without becoming static; slight deduction for assertion ("spectral quietness") over dramatization in one beat.</comment>
