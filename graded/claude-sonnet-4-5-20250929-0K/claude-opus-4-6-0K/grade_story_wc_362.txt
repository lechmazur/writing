<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's interiority is specific and embodied—"the shifted hush" vocabulary, rigorous notebooks, thermal coffee—grounding her mysticism in concrete action. Her motivation (proving emotional residue) drives choices throughout, and the ending's quiet acceptance ("you would be wrong, and she would not blame you") earns a stance of endurance with visible cost: she'll present data and be dismissed. Minor deduction: her internal contradiction (wanting proof vs. accepting unprovability) could press harder in a peak beat; the resolution feels forecast rather than forced into crystallization under new pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story gathers sensory particulars (frost patterns, quartz arbor, eleven years of sunsets) and reweights them in the final image where melting frost becomes "something no instrument on earth could name but every grieving daughter already knew." Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Sera, Tuesday, quartz arbor). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the prism's warmth and streaming frost charge prior setup with felt cost—her life's work remains unprovable yet undeniable. One tightening (placing prism, observing frost, measuring) deepens the dominant stake (proof vs. invisibility). The lens holds; cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quartz arbor in mist, frost-feathered windshield, and the prism on the dashboard anchor spatial choreography and constrain Sera's method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "mist curled through the lattice," "feathering outward in long, slow arcs." The recurring object (prism) shifts meaning at closure when it's discovered warm, charging the final image. Minor limitation: the arbor itself becomes decorative after the opening; it sets atmosphere but doesn't constrain a mid-scene choice or reappear to pressure the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prove Delia's emotion remains in the prism. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera observes frost branching in formations "never seen near emotionally neutral objects"—this deepens the question without reversing it. Agency is attention and endurance: she chooses to measure, photograph, and accept the contradiction ("you would be wrong, and she would not blame you"). Cost is felt: she'll be called a liar, and the data will remain true. No sharp reversal, but accumulative pressure coheres under the Textural lens and forecloses the path of easy proof.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (objects hold us back invisibly, unprovably) emerges from frost patterns, Delia's eleven-year ritual, and the prism's warmth without direct statement. The "truthful lies" frame recurs purposefully, reweighting the opening premise in the final image: melting frost as "tears, like rain, like something no instrument on earth could name." Subtext operates in Sera's quiet acceptance and the daughter's challenge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: proof exists but remains illegible to consensus reality. Minor slip: "the nature of truthful lies" phrase in the opening edges toward thematic summary, though it's voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable close-third. Perceptual signature is distinct: Sera notices "when a room's silence shifted—not broke, but shifted," tracks "the hush" like meteorologists track pressure. Diction ("attentive mystic," "sustained emotion," "emotional charge") fits her worldview without diagnostic label-speak. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight on her measuring, wider on the thematic frame. Purposeful compression in the opening ("That is the nature of truthful lies") teaches the pattern; the final sentence's lyric parallelism ("like tears, like rain, like something…") charges closure. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("She was an attentive mystic") anchor; longer accumulative sentences build texture ("Eleven years of sunsets. Eleven years of Delia's hands…"). Information density is high; lines multi-task (e.g., "She started the engine. The frost began to melt…" compresses action and shifts meaning). Minor deduction: "This was the timeframe when assumptions shatter" is a meta-commentary scaffold that tells rather than dramatizes the pivot; the line could be cut without losing causality. One paraphrase near-loop: "not with drama, but with quiet accumulation" echoes the opening's rhythm without adding new pressure. Otherwise clean; no template cadence or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise (frost patterns as emotional instruments) is specific and non-obvious; combining mysticism with rigorous measurement creates fresh tension. The prism-as-heirloom detail (eleven years, hospital window, Delia's hands) personalizes grief beyond abstraction. The frost-on-windshield method transforms the familiar (reading omens) into tactile, testable work. The ending's quiet refusal ("you would be wrong, and she would not blame you") avoids both triumphant proof and cynical dismissal, a bold middle stance. Minor limitation: the daughter's challenge and Delia's backstory feel lightly sketched; deeper friction there could elevate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera (attentive mystic) is present throughout; her choices—placing the prism, observing frost, photographing, measuring—drive the arc. Setup: established in opening. Development: her decision to commune via frost (middle beat). Payoff: she picks up the warm prism and accepts unprovability at closure. Causal pressure: her attention narrows options (measure vs. theatrics) and her stance crystallization (acceptance) forecloses the path of demanding consensus proof. Cost: she will present findings and be dismissed. The character's method and worldview are inseparable from the plot; removing her attentiveness would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass prism appears in three beats: given by Delia's daughter (setup), placed on dashboard to test (development), discovered warm at closure (payoff). Its specific history (eleven years, hospital window, Delia's hands) anchors the emotional charge. The prism enables the frost-pattern test and its warmth at the end charges the final image with embodied proof that remains unprovable. Causal role: without it, Sera has no object to test and no vehicle for the daughter's challenge. Strong integration; slight limitation: the prism is handled more than observed mid-scene, so its evolving meaning relies on bracketing beats rather than continuous transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "shifted hush" is named and illustrated early ("that strange chill in certain rooms, that inexplicable comfort near a grandmother's chair") and detected once on-page when "the hush shifted—she felt it tilt." Setup: present in first third. Development: Sera notices the shift at the arbor (one beat). Payoff: the concept frames her worldview but doesn't directly shape the closure image; the frost patterns and prism warmth carry that work. The concept enriches setting and character but remains more thematic accent than tactical constraint. It could be replaced with "emotional residue" or similar without breaking causality, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is demonstrated through concrete details: boots in frozen mud, black coffee thermos, rigorous notebook with columns and dates. Setup: established in opening third. Development: her preference for frost over tarot/pendulums (middle beat) shows the trait constraining method. Payoff: the trait charges her acceptance at closure—she remains empirical even when data won't convince others. Cost: her groundedness forecloses theatrical mysticism, narrowing her persuasive toolkit. The trait enables her credibility and differentiates her from stock mystics. Slight limitation: the trait is more character texture than a choice-altering friction; it supports rather than drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Commune" is the story's central action, signaled early ("She began to commune. Not with words. Not with prayer. Through the patterns in frost…"). Setup: named and framed by midpoint. Development: the communion unfolds across the windshield observation, driving the middle escalation as she sketches, notes timestamp, and reads "sustained emotion." Payoff: the communion's result (prism warmth, melting frost) charges the closure image. Causal role: the action generates the proof-that-isn't-proof paradox. Specific mechanics (frost, not tarot) matter; swapping for generic "meditation" would flatten the story's hinge. Strong integration; minor cap: the action is more method than dramatic turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns on the car window are signaled early as Sera's "instrument she trusted most" and their mechanics matter: "Place a cherished heirloom near a cold pane…the ice crystals branched differently." Setup: introduced and explained in first third. Development: the method drives the middle beat as she sketches "formations she had never seen near emotionally neutral objects," tightening the proof question. Payoff: melting frost becomes the closure image ("Delia's eleven years of sunsets streamed down the windshield like tears"). The method is irreplaceable; swapping for another divination tool would lose the story's tactile, testable specificity and the charged final image. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The quartz arbor in mist appears in the opening, establishes atmosphere ("pillars of raw quartz grown through with climbing roses…thorns crystallized with ice"), and motivates Sera's location choice ("quartz…held feeling the way a sponge held water"). Setup: present early. Development: she places the prism on the quartz ledge, then walks away; the arbor doesn't constrain her next moves. Payoff: the arbor "disappeared into white" and isn't mentioned at closure. The setting frames the story's mystical tone but functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure. It could be replaced with another charged location (cemetery, old house) without breaking causality, trending mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" is named once in a meta-commentary line mid-story: "This was the timeframe when assumptions shatter—not with drama, but with quiet accumulation." The phrase gestures toward the story's conceptual hinge but isn't tracked as a live clock or dramatized constraint. Setup: implied in Sera's challenge to prove the prism holds Delia. Development: the timeframe is abstract; no ticking pressure or deadline forces choices. Payoff: the phrase doesn't return at closure; the melting frost charges the ending without reference to assumption-shattering. The element reads more as thematic label than functional stake-shaper, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sera's motivation "to prove that objects absorb emotions" is established early ("She was not interested in mysticism for its poetry. She wanted proof") and tested by the daughter's challenge. Setup: clear in first third. Development: her desire drives the frost-pattern observation and measurement; friction emerges when the data won't convince others. Payoff: at closure, she accepts the paradox ("her data would be true…this contradiction would follow her like weather") with visible cost—she'll be dismissed yet persist. The motivation is dramatized through choice (measure vs. theatrics) and constrained by unprovability. Strong integration; slight limitation: the internal friction (wanting proof vs. accepting invisibility) could press harder in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" as tone is introduced in the opening ("statements too honest for the world to accept") and recurs at closure ("the truthful lie of her life's work"). The tone coheres through Sera's paradoxical stance: empirical mystic, rigorous yet invisible. Setup: framed early. Development: the tone modulates with pressure—matter-of-fact observation ("She sketched the patterns. She noted the timestamp") laced with lyric recurrence ("sustained emotion," "devotion," "warm"). Payoff: the tone charges the final image as melting frost becomes "something no instrument on earth could name but every grieving daughter already knew." The contradictory register (proof vs. ineffability) is purposeful and held without breaking. High integration; the tone is indispensable to closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
