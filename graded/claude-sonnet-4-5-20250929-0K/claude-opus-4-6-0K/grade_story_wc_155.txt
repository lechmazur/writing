<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's interiority is vivid and consistently filtered through her artistic lens—"pressing the number like a bruise," "grief had locked her hands into fists." Her shift from counting-down to counting-up at the end emerges from the discovery and memory trigger, not declaration. The mother remains offstage but her influence shapes the closure choice. Minor: the "knowledge network of connected moments" reads slightly abstract in the pivotal beat; a more embodied micro-choice showing the hands unlocking would lift this into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line two (Luma, Orchard District, post-grief). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the fragment discovery triggers a chain reaction of memory that reweights her grief-locked state. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (counter reset, hands unlocking) with felt cost (seven months carried forward, now counting up). The causal link—fragment → memory → laughter → decision to paint again—holds cleanly. One small slip: "the daydream folding closed behind her like a letter she would reread many times" leans slightly tell-y when the reset already delivered the resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fog is active, not postcard: "not weather; it was memory made visible," and it frames both the loss and the light-inside-fog logic that charges the ending. The fresco fragment is concrete and handled (knelt, brushed, traced), and its glow under her thumb becomes the tactile anchor for the unlocking. The ruined orchard's calcified stumps and damp soil ground her stumble. The phosphorescent palette, cider house wall, and satchel all constrain her final choice to return and paint. Micro-setting (body, fragment, fog) drives the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rediscovering creative agency after grief. The stumble → fragment discovery tightens her options from wandering to reclaiming. The memory chain is a single meaningful deepening that opens the "network of connected moments" and shifts her from paralysis to intent. The cost is legible: seven months of counting down, the weight of carrying grief forward, now reframed as counting up. Agency is renunciation of passivity with visible commitment (taking the fragment as seed, planning to return with tools). No reversal required under Accumulative lens; the deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—joy passing through sorrow and emerging luminous—arises organically from the phosphorescent technique, the fog-as-memory metaphor, and the fragment's glow. "Pensive mirth" is earned, not stated as thesis. The final image (fragment pulsing gold, counter reset to zero and counting up) offers a non-literal answer: grief remains (fog will remain), but light can exist inside it. The cider-and-fog taste and the "knowledge network" moment flirt with slight abstraction, but the mother's lamp-holding and the traced thumb ground it in particulars. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong and consistent: Luma filters everything through artistic and tactile language ("calcified stumps like broken teeth," "exposed film," "node of joy"). Psychic distance is stable third-limited. The phrase "pensive mirth—the particular flavor of joy that has passed through sorrow" briefly steps into essayistic voice, a small register wobble in a peak beat. Free indirect style is otherwise clean. Diction matches her practiced, aesthetic mind. No dialogue to judge. The daydream-fold metaphor and "knowledge network" lean slightly toward elevated abstraction but remain within her artist's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "Critics called her technique 'exposed film'…" conveys method, reputation, and metaphor in one move). Two minor artifacts: "her frescoes glowed at dusk, shifting hue as the sun traveled" and "building a luminous archive of time" stack poeticisms without dramatic pressure, a brief density spike. "The boundary between waking and reverie had grown soft" tells what could be shown through disoriented action. Otherwise clean, no loops, strong propulsion. The final image ("counting up this time, not down") lands with brevity and charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The phosphorescent-plaster technique and "exposed film" premise offer fresh synthesis. The grief-as-counter and the stumble-in-fog-finds-light structure are familiar but executed with specificity (cider house, lamp-holding mother, traced thumb). The "knowledge network" moment and the fold-of-a-daydream frame gesture toward originality but lean slightly abstract. The transformation is credible: swapping the fresco fragment for any generic keepsake would lose the tactile glow and the technique's logic. Solid within-genre freshness; not yet the bold structural risk or counter-intuitive synthesis that would break into 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's choice to take the fragment as seed and plan her return with tools is causally central. She kneels, traces, laughs, stands, and commits—all on-page decisions that alter her trajectory from wandering-in-grief to reclaiming-agency. Setup (paragraph one, "mural artist…had been since sixteen"), development (the fragment triggers memory and unlocking), and payoff (the studio return and painting plan) all present. The final counter reset is her act. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable given her technique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears at the stumble, is handled (knelt, brushed, turned, traced), triggers the memory chain, and is placed in the satchel as seed. Three distinct beats: discovery, tactile unlocking, closure commitment. It drives the memory "knowledge network," shifts her from grief-locked to planning, and pulses gold in the final image. Removing it collapses the causality. High irreplaceability: the glow and her mother's palette are specific to this object. Cost connection: the fragment is the seed of her return, a concrete anchor for the abstract unlocking. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Exposed film" is explained in paragraph three and supplies the metaphor for memory-as-archive. It informs her technique and the thematic logic (walls remember what people forget), but it does not constrain a tactical choice or directly shape the ending image. The closure relies more on the phosphorescent glow and the fragment itself than on the "exposed film" concept. Setup and thematic linkage present; middle and closure participation weak. Functional but somewhat replaceable by any light-memory metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is introduced early (paragraph three: phosphorescent compounds, glowing frescoes), enables the fragment's glow under her thumb (the tactile unlock), and justifies her plan to return and paint the fog-gallery. Two beats: the glow as memory trigger and the closure commitment to paint again. Cost: her grief had locked her hands; reclaiming the light-painting is the renunciation of passivity. Causal and closure-linked. Not fully indispensable (the fragment could glow for other reasons), but the specificity of light-layering elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Display" appears in the memory beat: the fragment "let the memory display itself fully, not just the image but the feeling." This triggers the knowledge network and the unlocking. It also underwrites the ending plan: she will paint the fog "until the fog itself became a gallery." Setup (her murals as public displays), development (memory displaying itself), and payoff (the gallery vision). Two beats, strong closure linkage. The verb "display" is somewhat generic; "reveal" or "show" could substitute with minor edits, preventing the highest scores, but the gallery framing is specific enough to lift it into strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Knowledge network" appears once in the unlocking beat: "a network, a knowledge network of connected moments…each one a node of joy…lit up inside her." It explains the chain reaction but is not signaled early and does not return at closure. The mechanics are told, not shown through dramatized action. Setup missing (first appears ~60% in), development present (the chain reaction enables the laugh), payoff weak (the counter reset and satchel-seed do not invoke the network language). Functional in one key beat but replaceable by "chain" or "cascade." Mid-band: one-beat causal role without closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Orchard District frames the entire piece: fog, calcified stumps, ruined walls, damp soil where she stumbles. It supplies the fragment, constrains visibility ("six inches ahead"), and anchors her mother's memory. The closure commitment—return with plaster and brushes to paint the fog—depends on this exact setting. Setup (paragraph two), development (the stumble and discovery), payoff (the gallery plan and the walk home through fog). Three beats, strong causal and closure pressure. The fog-as-memory metaphor and the ruined-walls-as-canvas logic are irreplaceable. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of that daydream" is invoked at the stumble and closed at the walk home ("the daydream folding closed behind her"). It establishes a liminal, time-soft frame but does not tighten a decision or create urgency. The seven-month counter and the stumble timing matter more to the stakes than the daydream fold. Setup and payoff present as lyric bookends, but middle development is absent—no choice depends on being inside versus outside the daydream. Functional framing device, low causal pressure. Mid-low band: lyric reprise without constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rediscovering lost joy is the dominant stake, signaled in the opening (seven months without laughter, grief-locked hands) and tested throughout. The fragment triggers remembered joy, she laughs (a concrete on-page shift), and the closure is her decision to reclaim painting. Friction: the weight of seven months, the mother's death, the "bruise" of counting. Cost: carrying grief forward while choosing to count up. Setup, development (laugh and unlocking), and payoff (counter reset, studio return) all present. Three beats, strong causal and closure linkage, visible cost. Near-indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is defined on the page ("the particular flavor of joy that has passed through sorrow and come out luminous") and charges the laugh, the unlocking, and the final counter reset. Tone modulates from grief-weight (opening) through liminal discovery (fog, stumble) to earned lightness (the laugh, the walk home with pulsing gold). The phrase itself appears only once, but the tonal blend—weighted joy, luminous sorrow—pervades the ending and justifies the counting-up closure. Strong closure linkage and coherence through pressure. Specificity and undeniable presence in the final image.</comment>
