<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific—"sanely eccentric" is embodied through the scarf handling, emotional cartography of call numbers, and her eleven-year quest. Her micro-choices (placing the scarf at the center, pressing her palm, opening her eyes) are purposeful and grounded in her obsessive project. Internal contradiction appears in her literal belief in analog memories coexisting with scientific rigor, and the final choice to return to reshelving feels earned by the moment of confirmation rather than epiphany. The patrons remain atmospheric rather than pressuring, which limits relationship dynamics, but the solitary pursuit coheres with her character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (scientific poetry library, third basement, Maren's odd-hour shift). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through hyperbolic geometry metaphors, the scarf's sensory expansion, and the final image of deeper aisles where "stories breathed." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the scarf grows warm, analog memories unfold spatially, and the library's geometry shifts perceptibly, reweighting Maren's eleven-year search with felt confirmation and leaving her poised at the threshold of discovery. Cost is conceptual and spatial: the world has changed, but she returns to mundane reshelving, the tension unresolved but reconfigured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid and purposeful: "shelves organized by the curvature of ideas," "horn torus," crocheted hyperbolic planes hanging from reading lamps. The scarf functions as micro-setting, its stains and fibers acting as coordinates that anchor the geometry experiment. The fluorescent hum, wooden chairs, and patron proximity create atmospheric pressure and witnessed solitude that Maren depends on "the way a violinist depends on the resonance of the hall." The final image—aisles containing "more room than its physical dimensions could explain"—charges the ending by making the setting's transformation legible and specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early: "to find the place where stories live." Pressure accumulates through Maren's eleven-year search, her discovery of Bolyai, months of model-building, and the patrons' witnessed silence as necessary condition. The tightening occurs when she places the scarf at the model's center and the analog memories reawaken, expanding into hyperbolic space—a meaningful deepening that narrows her search to this exact method and moment. Agency is clear: her decision to press her palm and open her eyes enacts the transformation. Cost is felt in the final return to reshelving, the threshold crossed but the full implication deferred, and the impossibility of returning to the prior state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: hyperbolic geometry as metaphor for narrative's adjacent possibilities, the scarf's analog memories as fixed coordinates, the library's curvature organizing ideas rather than authors. The final image—"somewhere in the curvature of the room, just past the place where parallel lines refuse to meet, the stories breathed"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Maren's search without moralizing. Subtext operates in the patrons' unspoken understanding, the "impossible hours" that "technically did not exist," and Maren's literal belief in perfume trapped in fabric. No thematic echo or direct statement; the concept integrates organically with character goal and world logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable, intimate distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices "the curvature of ideas," "emotional weight of specific call numbers," silk as "map quality" charting "the interior of feeling." Diction is elevated but consistent—"adjacent possibilities," "witnessed silence," "exponential expansion of narrative possibility"—fitting a librarian immersed in scientific poetry. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled. Purposeful elision of patron interiority reinforces solitude. Minor deduction: some metaphoric density ("breathing in some space between the teller and the told") approaches abstraction without immediate grounding, but the overall texture is voice-particular and rhythmically controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and length, creating natural rhythm: short declaratives anchor moments ("The scarf grew warm"), while longer constructions layer sensory detail and concept. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the hyperbolic geometry premise. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: a few figurative phrases approach overwriting ("moth who had mistaken fluorescent light for moonlight," "analog memories began to reawaken... as spatial sensations") without being incoherent, and "analog memories" recurs frequently enough to border on keyword reliance. Propulsion is steady; the final paragraph returns to reshelving without deflating the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, analog memory, and narrative theory is specific and non-obvious, grounded in Janos Bolyai and topology rather than generic mysticism. The odd-hour library, "curvature of ideas" shelving, and crocheted models are particular to this voice and premise. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details. Risk is evident in the abstract premise and quiet ending, yet the story commits fully without retreat into action or neat resolution. The final image—deeper aisles where stories breathe—feels inevitable in hindsight, earned by prior particulars rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren appears in every beat, her choices drive the narrative arc (placing the scarf, pressing her palm, opening her eyes, returning to reshelving), and her eleven-year quest frames the stakes. Her decisions alter tactics (building models, using the scarf as coordinates) and the final action reweights the world. Early signal, sustained involvement, closure linkage, causal pressure all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scarf is handled in multiple beats: wound around Maren's throat at opening, unfolded and studied for its geography, placed at the model's center, grows warm as memories reawaken, re-wound at closure. Its analog memories function as coordinates, its stains and threads are specific ("coffee ring from 1987," "streak of garden soil," "lavender hand cream"), and it returns charged in the final image. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Analog memories shape the entire premise: Maren believes stories leave "physical residue," the scarf holds "impressions recorded... in silk fibers," and these serve as "fixed points of genuine human experience" for the geometry model. The memories reawaken spatially in the climax, altering tactics and enabling the transformation. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Slight deduction: the concept borders on metaphoric rather than mechanical constraint in some passages, reducing tangible specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is embodied through specific actions (notes about emotional weight, literal belief in analog memories, eleven-year quest, crocheted models) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It enables her project and explains her approach, appearing early and coloring every beat, but remains more characterization than friction. Setup and development present; payoff indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the climactic action: "The analog memories began to reawaken, not as images or sounds but as spatial sensations, each one unfolding into the hyperbolic plane." This moment redefines options, confirms Maren's method, and transforms the library's geometry. Present in setup (goal to find where stories live), executed in climax, shapes closure. Cannot be swapped; the entire arc builds to this verb. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early ("curvature of ideas," "horn torus," Janos Bolyai), shapes Maren's method (months of sketching hyperbolic planes, crocheted models representing "exponential expansion"), and drives the climax (memories unfold "into the hyperbolic plane"). The mechanics matter: parallel lines diverge, every point has more room, narrative behaves the same way. Present across setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure evident. Minor deduction: the geometry remains more metaphoric than mechanical constraint in execution, slightly reducing tangible specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vivid and specific (third basement, shelves by "curvature of ideas," crocheted models hanging from lamps), shapes Maren's eleven-year quest, and transforms in the climax ("the space between the shelves seemed deeper"). The setting's impossible hours and patron solitude provide necessary conditions. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage all present. The micro-setting (body, scarf, models) also constrains choices and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe (while patrons browse) is established early and maintained throughout, creating witnessed solitude that Maren depends on. It provides atmospheric pressure and context but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in a causal way. The "impossible hours" add thematic resonance but function more as tone than mechanical constraint. Setup and development present; payoff indirect through "observed solitude" rather than clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation ("to find the place where stories live") is stated early, dramatized through her eleven-year search, discovery of Bolyai, model-building, and final experiment. Friction appears between the abstract goal and concrete method, and cost is visible in the years spent and the threshold now crossed. The desire drives every choice and shapes the climax when the scarf grows warm and stories begin to breathe. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is coherent and specific: patrons "drifting in like moths," browsing in "quiet, solitary orbits," creating "witnessed silence" and "low collective hum" that Maren depends on. The tone modulates subtly from catalog (opening shelves, scarf study) to charged stillness (scarf grows warm, space deepens) and returns to quiet mundanity (reshelving). It charges the final image by making the transformation feel shared yet unspoken. Setup, development, and payoff all present; tone shapes closure participation.</comment>
