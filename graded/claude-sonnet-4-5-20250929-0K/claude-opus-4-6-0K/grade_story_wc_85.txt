<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal conflict is well-embodied through concrete choices: she writes the name rather than discarding it, which earns the final turn. The backstory-heavy middle flattens present urgency slightly, but micro-choices (examining the watch hand, opening the notebook) keep her agency visible. The reflective blocks anchor to present stimuli (the watch hand, the birth certificate) and tilt her stance by the end. Emotional progression is credible: tempered regret settles into a commitment to honesty without therapy-speak intrusion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren renounces her professional reflex to "sieve the hush" and commits to finding Elise or her absence, forecloses the path of erasure with visible cost (her career methods now applied to her own pain). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered revelations (the watch hand, the birth certificate, the father's technique) until the final vow reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and the forgotten shore supply spatial grounding; the watch hand is handled twice and charges the final notebook moment. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("bruise pressed against the dying light"). The micro-setting—tools spread on the terrace railing—constrains the final choice to record versus discard. Minor: the driftwood-carving shore remains spatially vague, slightly weakening middle choreography, but the terrace itself suffices for closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or dismantle the "sieved hush"—is signaled early and tightens once: Maren discovers her father used her own technique, which forces the final choice. Agency is clear: she writes the name and closes the notebook with a vow. The tightening forecloses a live option (discarding the truth) with felt cost (honesty over mercy). No reversals are needed at this length; the single turn and visible cost meet the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the father's carved portraits and the watch hand's frozen time: silence as architecture versus silence as violence. The final image—pressing her palm to the notebook—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: she will "let the silence speak." The metaphor of "sieving the hush" deepens across beats and the closure image reweights it without abstraction. Minor: the pelican carving and other motifs could be pruned, but they support rather than distract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and profession-specific: Maren recognizes her father's forgery technique, notices the watch hand's mechanics, and filters the sea as "ancient, indifferent." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction stays controlled under pressure ("tempered regret," "gravity of silence") without drift into therapy-speak. The voice modulates purposefully from clinical observation to charged resolve. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Rhythm varies across sentence length and structure; no template cadence. The opening line anchors voice and the final line recharges the "sieved hush" motif cleanly. Minor: "sieved the hush out of a hundred histories, filtering silence through her fingers until only the convenient truths remained, discarding the rest like sediment" loops conceptually across one sentence but stays within tolerance. Zero loops elsewhere; clarity and propulsion are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of black-market genealogy and personal erasure feels specific and non-obvious; the watch hand as frozen birth-time is a fresh inflection. The father's use of Maren's own technique to erase her sister is an earned irony that grows from established particulars. Risk-taking is moderate: the reflective structure is conventional, but the moral calculus (mercy as decay) avoids safe hedging. Transformation test passes: the plot would fail with generic names or setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's guilt is dramatized through her father's erasure of Elise using her own technique. Her decision to write the name and close the notebook drives the closure turn. Present across all three gates: setup (opening paragraph), development (discovering her father's forgery), and payoff (final vow to stop "sieving the hush"). Causal pressure narrows her options and the cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in two beats: Maren examines it in the opening third and sets it down before writing. It carries symbolic weight (frozen at 4:17, the birth time) and charges the final notebook moment by priming the choice. Present in setup and payoff, absent from middle development. The lyric reprise reweights the stake but the hand does not constrain a middle choice, capping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" shapes stakes across beats: Maren's career method is named, dramatized (filtering histories), and then renounced in the closure vow ("she would stop sieving the hush"). The concept enables her father's erasure and constrains her final choice with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and payoff; the final line reweights it directly. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's skill at manufacturing false memories is demonstrated on-page: she recognizes her father's forgery technique and describes embedding fabricated histories into documents. The trait constrains her discovery (she knows exactly how he erased Elise) and shapes her final choice (to record truth without softening). Present across all three gates with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Quell" appears twice: Maren wants to "quell the ache" by discarding the certificate, then resists that reflex. The action frames the central conflict (to erase or confront) and shapes the final turn. Present in setup and payoff; absent from middle beats. The word itself is less causally essential than the choice it names, keeping it in mid-band despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is signaled in the opening third ("three weeks now") and shapes her discovery of the birth certificate inside the pelican. The method matters: the carvings are portraits tagged with initials, not abstractions, which reweights her father's silence. Present across setup, development, and payoff; the mechanics alter her understanding and drive the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace is anchored in the opening line and supplies the spatial frame for the closure beat. Maren's tools are spread on the railing, and she sets the watch hand down there before writing. The setting does not constrain a choice but provides a charged final image ("pressed her palm flat against it"). Present in setup and payoff; lyric reprise without middle pressure keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Weight of unspoken words" is named once and permeates the piece: her father's silences, the frozen watch, the eleven-year career of erasure. The timeframe shapes the dominant stake (accumulated guilt pressing toward reckoning) and charges the final vow. Present across all three gates as a thematic pressure rather than a ticking clock, which fits the Accumulative lens and meets the prompt's intent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's drive to "discover the weight of a withheld truth" is dramatized through her sifting, her recognition of the forgery, and her final choice to record rather than erase. The motivation conflicts with her professional reflex (to curate the past into something bearable) and the friction generates visible cost at closure. Present across all three gates; the final vow forecloses her old path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" is embodied throughout: not sharp but "low, persistent," settling "into her bones" without demanding immediate action but requiring honesty. The tone modulates coherently from clinical reflection to charged resolve and saturates the final image (palm pressed to notebook). Present across all three gates; the tone charges the closure without flattening into a single static mood.</comment>
