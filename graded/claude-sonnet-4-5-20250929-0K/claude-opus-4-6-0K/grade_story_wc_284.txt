<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal contradiction is well-embodied: she has avoided mirrors yet climbs the bluff to reclaim agency, and the scars physically constrain her movement throughout. The choice at closure—to go to the coordinates carrying "whatever courage had been accumulating"—reads as earned renunciation of avoidance with visible cost (leaving safety, re-entering the field scarred). Dmitri remains abstract; his voice and pressure are told rather than dramatized, which slightly weakens the relational crucible. Minor deduction for "architecture of avoidance" entering diagnostic register in a reflective beat, though it remains character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Maren, Zephyr Bluff, dawn, two years post-Varna). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: snow-code discovery deepens the dominant stake (reclaiming agency) and the final descent with spring imagery reweights her isolation into forward motion. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's decision to meet Dmitri crystallizes options and forecloses avoidance with felt cost (scars, uncertainty, re-entry risk). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; causality holds across the reflection-heavy middle because each memory anchors to present stimuli (pillbox, snow patterns, scars pulling). Cost is legible in "She was touchable...still climbing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The snowfield micro-setting constrains the decode choice (spacing, depth, angle) and the mist-to-light shift charges the final image of descent toward spring. Sensory detail is purposeful: cold tightening scars, mist softening edges, pale crocuses pressing upward all reflect urgency and filter through Maren's trained eye. Spatial choreography is clear (switchback, summit, granite outcrop, descent). The pillbox as recurring object gains weight across beats. Slight deduction: occupational detail (dead drop mechanics, cipher key) is plausible but not tested under pressure; the decode succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after trauma—is signaled early and tightens when Dmitri's message asks her to return "not as a broken agent but as the operative he still believed she was." The decode choice and erasure are protagonist-driven micro-decisions that narrow options (she will go; she leaves no trace). One meaningful tightening occurs on-page when the coordinates and phrase reframe her exile as a test of accumulated courage. The price is felt: she carries scars, uncertainty, and the risk of re-entry. No reversal is required at this length; the accumulative deepening suffices under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through endurance rather than restoration—emerges from concrete particulars: scars that pull, snow that self-destructs, spring's "quiet, relentless insistence." The thought "Fixing what's broken...means building something that can bear the weight" is abstract but earned by prior embodied struggle (favoring her side, erasing the message, descending toward light). The final image of spring waiting "with its quiet, relentless insistence on beginning again" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (memorizing, scattering stones) and the covered mirror. Minor slip: "architecture of avoidance" nears thematic echo, though it remains character-voiced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and tightly bound to Maren's perception: "her trained eye," scars that "pulled tight," mist "like a living thing." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decode, slightly wider in reflection). Perceptual signature is distinct (spy tradecraft filtering environment: "regularities," "deliberate," "measured intervals"). Diction remains within Maren's professional lexicon except for one brief elevation ("vouchsafe") that is diegetically Dmitri's phrasing, not narrator drift. No dialogue; interiority is embodied and compressed under pressure. Rhythm varies effectively (short urgent beats during decode, longer cadence in descent).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance multiple jobs (world, interiority, stake). The snow-decode sequence is propulsive and clear. Minor deductions: "She understood now" is a scaffold assertion immediately after "she had not understood then" (paraphrase loop, −0.2); "the woman I trained" and "the operative he still believed she was" restate confidence in adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). "Architecture of avoidance" is slightly elevated for peak reflection. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated (mist as "silver hush," "living thing"). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The snow-as-message dead drop is a fresh, specific synthesis that integrates spy tradecraft with environmental ephemerality. Maren's interiority—"touchable...touched by the worst...still climbing"—transforms the burned-spy trope through embodied cost (scars, mirror avoidance, climb). The premise avoids middle-ground safety: she is visibly damaged and chooses risk. Emotional truth (contradictory impulses, earned courage) outweighs surface novelty. Slight deduction: the spy-reclaiming-self arc is familiar, and while the snow-code method is ingenious, the final decision to meet Dmitri follows a predictable shape (exile → message → re-entry). Transformation is partial; the arc would function similarly with different tradecraft particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (burned spy) drives all key choices: climbing the bluff, decoding the message, deciding to meet Dmitri, erasing evidence. Her burned status constrains tactics (favoring scarred side, avoiding mirrors, two years in exile) and enables the snow-code knowledge. Present in setup (paragraph two), middle (decode and decision), and payoff (descent with renewed agency). Specific cost tied to the role: scars, lost network, agency exile. The attribute is causal across beats and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pillbox appears in three beats: initial handling in coat pocket, used to decode the snowfield message (onion-skin unfolded), and returned to pocket after erasure. Its engraved compass rose and cipher key are specific, irreplaceable properties that enable the decode and tie to Dmitri's trust. The object bridges memory (Varna night) and present choice (meeting coordinates). Strong causal role and closure linkage; it reweights Maren's relationship to her handler and her own capability. Slightly below 8.5: the pillbox itself does not visibly constrain the final descent image, though its message does.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" is stated explicitly in Maren's reflection ("does not mean restoring what was...means building something that can bear the weight") and shapes her decision to go forward scarred rather than restored. It frames stakes (reclaim agency vs. remain broken) and her final stance (carry scars, courage, cipher key). Present in setup (implicit in climb and scars), middle (decode as partial repair), and payoff (descent as beginning again). The concept is thematically resonant but primarily told; the on-page choices (decode, erase, descend) enact it without the phrase being mechanically necessary. Solid lyric integration but not indispensable to plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" describes Dmitri's snow-code method ("bold in concept, meticulous in execution") and implicitly Maren's choice to meet him (calculated risk after careful decode and erasure). The trait constrains tactics: she methodically erases evidence, memorizes rather than records, and descends without leaving trace. Present in setup (attributed to Dmitri's method), middle (Maren enacts it during decode/erasure), and payoff (her decision balances courage and caution). The attribute is demonstrated through action with visible tradeoff (boldness tempered by operational security). Slight cap: the phrase itself is told; the trait could be inferred from behavior alone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" (Dmitri's phrase: "Vouchsafe this to no one but the woman I trained") is the message's emotional core and the pivot that reframes Maren's exile as a test of trust and capability. It drives her decision to go and charges the theme of earned confidence. Present in middle (decode beat) and payoff (she will carry the cipher and courage). The archaism is diegetically Dmitri's voice, not narrator drift, and it cannot be swapped without losing the formal, covert register. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the action (entrusting a secret meet) defines the final choice. Just shy of 9.0: the word itself is pivotal, but the meet-decision would function with a synonym like "entrust."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The snow-code method is signaled early (paragraph five: "codes in accumulated snow...patterns of disturbance"), its mechanics detailed (stones, boot depths, branch angle), and it enables the decode that delivers coordinates and phrase. Present in setup (explanation), middle (decode execution with pillbox key), and payoff (erasure mirrors seasonal self-destruction). The method is specific and irreplaceable: no other medium delivers ephemeral, location-bound messages. Strong causal role across beats. Cap shy of 8.5+: the decode succeeds without friction or cost; if the method constrained her attempt (e.g., thaw pressure, missed detail), it would score higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist anchors all action and charges the final image (mist lifting as she descends toward spring). The environment supplies the snowfield (decode site), granite outcrop (shadow preserving message), and cliff edge (revelation of eastern light). Mist softens edges at open, thins at close, creating atmospheric pressure. Present in setup (title, opening line), middle (summit decode), and payoff (descent with lifting mist). The setting shapes mood and enables the snow-code but does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure (e.g., route, timing). Solid integration; just below 8.0 because the bluff is more stage than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tilt of the earth toward spring" frames seasonal urgency (thaw will erase snow-codes within days) and metaphorically charges Maren's movement from winter exile toward renewal. Time is present in setup (dawn, "two years since Varna"), middle (implicit thaw deadline), and payoff (spring's "quiet, relentless insistence"). The phrase itself is lyric and resonant but not mechanically load-bearing; Maren does not race a visible clock or alter tactics based on hour or day. Thematic reprise with moderate causal role; the timeframe pressures the method (snow must be read before thaw) but not Maren's choices within the scene. Solid but replaceable with "early spring" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is stated explicitly in paragraph four and dramatized through the climb (physical struggle with scars), decode (reclaiming tradecraft), and decision to meet Dmitri (carrying accumulated courage forward). Present in setup (stated), middle (decode enacts the search), and payoff (she descends with "whatever courage had been accumulating"). The desire is conflicted (scars vs. capability, fear vs. agency) and shaped with cost (two years' avoidance, mirror covering, re-entry risk). Slight deduction: the phrase is told and slightly abstract; the on-page friction is strong, but the motivation could be inferred from behavior without the label.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Silver hush" (opening: "mist lay over Zephyr Bluff like a silver hush") establishes a tone of muted quiet, suspension, and liminal transformation that holds through the decode and modulates at closure when mist lifts and light breaks. The tone is coherent across turns: reverent during decode, contemplative in reflection, tentative-hopeful at descent. Present in setup (opening image), sustained in middle (quiet focus, no dialogue, controlled interiority), and charged in payoff (mist lifting, "pale band of light...tentative, persistent"). The tone shapes reader experience and supports theme (emergence from stasis). Just below 8.5: while coherent and resonant, tone is atmospheric support rather than a constraint on choice.</comment>
