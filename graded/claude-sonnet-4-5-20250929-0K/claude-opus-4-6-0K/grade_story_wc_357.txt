<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is grounded through specific professional detail (orchard pilot navigating by water flow) and embodied perception ("frequency...felt in their teeth"). Her motivation—seeking resilience after witnessing seven worlds wither—anchors her journey, though the interior remains somewhat abstract. The final choice to "witness proof" rather than extract a cure carries cost (she leaves empty-handed but transformed), yet the epiphany leans toward articulated wisdom rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. Minor deduction for the somewhat declarative insight at closure, but the trajectory from searching to understanding is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: echoes layer, water flows guide, and the inversion hour tightens spatial pressure until the tree reveals itself as source. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant)—"survival was not about avoiding the arrow...about growing around it"—reweighting Maren's quest with conceptual cost (she must accept damage as integral, not curable). The orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, what). One meaningful deepening (the arrow-tip realization) shifts understanding. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps the score below 8.5, but the lens holds and the closure effect is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating arches, inverted gravity, and water-flow navigation create a vivid, purposeful setting that constrains Maren's tactics throughout. The "cathedral of stone arches" and the tree's roots "gripping nothing but air" are specific and charged. The inversion hour functions as both atmospheric constraint and escalation trigger, shaping the discovery beat. The arrow tip embedded in bark is a micro-setting detail that charges the final image. Strong across all three gates (setup, development, payoff) with sensory economy and spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and drives Maren's navigation choices. The gravity inversion provides a meaningful tightening (hour constraint, sensory escalation) that leads to discovery. The arrow-tip observation narrows understanding: resilience is incorporation, not invulnerability. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—Maren must relinquish the idea of a cure—but the final image ("growing around it") reweights her entire quest. One solid pressure point with a quiet but legible cost; the lack of a second on-page complication or failed attempt keeps this below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the arrow-tip image and the tree's adaptive growth: resilience as incorporation rather than invulnerability. The "whirling silence" and "gathering of echoes" layer atmospheric motifs that charge the closure without overt statement. The final insight—"survival was not about avoiding the arrow. It was about growing around it"—walks the line between earned wisdom and articulated thesis; the prior embodied detail (bark texture, vine unfurling) anchors it just enough. The frequency "lodged beneath her ribs" is a strong sensory close that avoids moralizing. Minor proximity to thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, but the closure image rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric-realist register with strong sensory signature: "frequency...felt in their teeth," "whirling silence—a pressure of sound folding inward." Maren's perceptual bias (water flow over magnetic fields, professional idiom) is stable and voice-specific. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The closure paragraph modulates smoothly from tactile discovery to internalized metaphor. Minor register elevation in "the refusal to let damage be the final word" feels slightly aphoristic for mid-discovery interiority, but it's brief and the voice recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high ("one of the few licensed to navigate worlds where agriculture and geology intertwined"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong throughout, with spatial choreography (skiff, arches, tree) cleanly tracked. The phrase "a gathering of echoes, layered and ancient, spiraling upward" balances lyricism with concrete action. Minor overwriting in "the quiet heart that kept every orchard alive through inversion and fracture and time"—the triad slightly inflates—but it doesn't obscure causality. A single filter-verb stack ("felt warmth...saw it...felt") in the discovery beat is brief and doesn't dull immediacy. Zero loops, strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard-pilot premise and floating-arch setting offer a fresh synthesis; the arrow-tip-as-resilience image is specific and non-obvious. The inversion-hour mechanic and water-navigation method are purposeful world-building that constrain tactics. The closure insight—growth through incorporation—feels earned in hindsight rather than imposed. Minor familiarity in the quest-for-wisdom frame and the metaphor of "growing around damage" echoes broader resilience narratives, but the execution through tactile detail (bark, vine, arrow tip) keeps it from feeling generic. Solid transformation of familiar material without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, her navigation choices (following water, threading arches, locking harness for inversion) drive the progression, and her final decision to "witness proof" rather than extract a cure reweights her quest. Setup clear by paragraph one; middle beats show her tracking water and responding to gravity shift; closure hinges on her touch and realization. The character shapes every turn, though the final act is observation-then-insight rather than a high-stakes choice with immediate external consequence. Two gates strongly met (setup, development); closure participation is internal but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears once—embedded in the tree trunk during the discovery beat—but it crystallizes the story's central insight: "Someone had once tried to cut this tree down...The tree had grown around the wound instead." This single image reweights Maren's entire quest and directly shapes the closure metaphor ("survival was not about avoiding the arrow"). Setup is late (second half), no middle development, but closure linkage is decisive and the object's specific meaning is irreplaceable. Strong payoff gate; two-of-three met when accounting for lyric reprise that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is introduced at the inversion hour ("echoes...converging ahead of her") and circles the tree, creating atmospheric escalation. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs and the echoes "softened but did not disappear" at closure, signaling persistence. The concept charges the discovery beat and the final image carries its resonance ("the frequency of that whirling silence lodged beneath her ribs"). Setup at midpoint, development through sensory layering, payoff in the ending image. Causal role is atmospheric rather than tactical—echoes don't alter Maren's choices—but the concept reweights the closure with felt presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tree's ability to accelerate plant growth is revealed in the discovery beat: "a vine on the nearest arch began to lengthen visibly...reaching toward her skiff." Maren identifies it as "the source, the engine, the quiet heart." The attribute explains why orchards survive on this planet (her original quest motivation) and provides the story's conceptual answer. Setup is late (75% mark), no middle development, but closure linkage is clear—it's the discovered mechanism. The trait is demonstrated once with visible effect (vine unfurling) rather than merely labeled. Functional but late; reaches mid-6s on closure relevance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Discovery is the story's spine: Maren searches eleven days, the inversion hour escalates pressure and funnels her through the arch, she discovers the tree and its mechanism, and the discovery redefines her understanding (witness over extraction). Setup in paragraph one ("searching for something she could not name"), middle beats show active navigation toward discovery, and closure hinges on what she learns. The action is irreplaceable—without discovery, there's no plot or closure. Three gates met strongly; the action drives causality and shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Water-flow navigation is introduced early ("Maren tracked the rivers") and explained as her primary means in chaotic electromagnetic conditions. She follows reversed water flow through the arch during inversion ("followed the reversed water flow through the arch's throat") and closes by turning her skiff "to follow the water home." Setup, development (navigation tactic during inversion), and payoff (return journey) all present. The method shapes how she reaches the tree and provides spatial coherence. Strong integration across all three gates; the method is purpose-driven and irreplaceable given the planet's conditions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is established in the opening lines, frames every navigation choice (threading between arches, ascending through them during inversion), supplies the hollow where the tree resides, and provides the tactile world-logic that makes resilience visible (roots gripping air, stone supporting growth). Setup immediate, development through spatial constraints and the inversion mechanic, payoff when the largest arch reveals the tree. The setting is causally essential—remove the arches and the story's physics, navigation method, and discovery location collapse. Indispensable across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is introduced on day twelve, creates the "whirling silence" and sensory escalation, and funnels Maren upward to the tree. The mechanic is explained, Maren prepares (locks harness, flips thrust), and the inversion ends just after discovery ("The gravity shifted back"). Setup at ~40%, development through the discovery beat, and the return to normal gravity closes the sequence. The timeframe tightens the discovery moment and adds urgency, though the hour itself isn't tracked as a live countdown. Two-and-a-half gates; solid causal role but not fully pressurized as a ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to find the source of resilience after watching seven orchards wither—is stated in paragraph two and drives every navigation choice. The final realization (resilience as incorporation) directly answers her quest, and her decision to carry "nothing but the frequency" instead of a cure shows the cost of understanding. Setup early, development through persistent search and water-following, payoff when she articulates the insight and turns home. The motivation is specific, shapes tactics, and the closure reweights it with conceptual cost (acceptance over extraction). Three gates met with visible friction between want (cure) and discovered truth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase "whirling silence" is introduced during the inversion hour, repeated at closure ("the frequency of that whirling silence lodged beneath her ribs"), and reflects the story's contemplative, accumulative register. Tone is consistent—lyric-realist, meditative—and modulates appropriately (urgency during inversion, quiet resolve at close). Setup at midpoint with "whirling silence...a pressure of sound folding inward," development through atmospheric layering, payoff in the ending image. The tone charges the final beat and holds coherence, though the phrase itself is more atmospheric label than active constraint. Solid two-of-three gates with lyric reprise that reweights the closure.</comment>
