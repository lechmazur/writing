<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior is richly embodied through her archival practice and grief-shaped devotion; the walnut-steeping ritual concretely externalizes her years of solitary work. Her decision to stay carries visible cost—eleven years of isolation—and the final choice to allow Elise back in ("Start with what you remember") is earned by her embodied constancy. The "haunted euphoria" at Elise's return is precisely layered, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor: Elise's motivation for returning arrives mostly through summary ("I was wrong") rather than dramatized contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (Maren, jetty, evening, eleven years post-covenant). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through ritual repetition, the locket image, and the covenant's history until Elise's return reweights all prior material. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"they began again"—that regenerates the covenant with visible cost (eleven years carried, the ghost of prior joy). The final image of pale flowers and darkening ink recharges the opening motif with undeniable pressure. Causality between past and present is clean; the covenant's breaking and Maren's endurance shape every choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jetty's clematis and sea lavender, the copper basin, and the twilight setting are anchored early and constrain Maren's ritual. The setting is "not quite land, not quite sea, not quite day, not quite dark"—a liminal space that mirrors the covenant's regeneration. The flowers "bloomed each spring in defiance of salt and storm," supplying a tangible metaphor for endurance. The walnut husks steeping in rainwater provide a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (Maren at basin's edge, Elise kneeling beside) is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to preserve memory as justice, tested by Elise's return. Pressure accumulates through eleven years of solitary work (Maren's endurance under the broken covenant) and tightens when Elise arrives with her letter acknowledging wrongness. The final choice—"Start with what you remember"—narrows options: Maren accepts Elise back into the work, foreclosing the path of refusal with visible emotional cost ("haunted euphoria... the body still remembered how to be inhabited"). The tightening is singular but meaningful; no second reversal is required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the covenant as memory-as-justice, the walnut ink's "gently thorough" process mirroring devotion, and the jetty's blooming as regeneration. The piece asks how to hold the thread of small moments against erasure, and the ending answers not with a statement but an image—Maren and Elise writing together, "gently and thoroughly," in twilight. The "unbearable chain of nearness, cause touching cause like dominoes made of breath" is specific and non-obvious. The locket photo and ink's "exact color of everything they had almost lost" charge the final image without overt moralizing. No thematic echo mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays anchored to Maren; distance is consistent. Voice is distinct: "the exact slant of rain the morning the old lighthouse keeper died alone" exemplifies her archival attention. Elise's dialogue ("You kept going") is spare and older, distinguishing her from Maren's interior. The prose modulates with pressure: the opening's patient ritual rhythm accelerates slightly at Elise's arrival, then breathes into the final image. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Perceptual signature is archival and layered ("haunted euphoria" over "happiness"). One minor slip: "the feeling that moved through her" is slightly generic for this otherwise precise voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; the opening's long, layered constructions shift to shorter beats at Elise's arrival. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (setting, character history, thematic charge). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "the process was gently thorough, like grief, like devotion" is purposeful and embodied. Minor deductions: "Not grand conspiracies. Just the unbearable chain of nearness" feels slightly scaffolded, and "the ghost of joy returning to a body that had learned to survive without it" runs long without adding pressure. Proofreading is clean; no syntax errors or simultaneity problems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of walnut-ink archiving, the regenerated covenant, and the jetty's liminal twilight setting offers a fresh synthesis. The "unbearable chain of nearness, cause touching cause like dominoes made of breath" is a non-obvious articulation of causality-as-justice. The piece resists the easy reconciliation trope by anchoring the reunion in embodied cost ("haunted euphoria," eleven years). Transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would lose the archival specificity and the jetty's defiant blooming. Risk: the eleven-year ellipsis and the covenant's mechanics are signaled but not fully dramatized on the page, keeping this in the high-7s rather than 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as walnut-ink archivist is signaled early and drives the ritual (steeping husks, opening the locket, offering the pen). Her occupation shapes her perception ("preserve the weight of small moments") and her final choice to invite Elise back into the work. Present in setup, middle action, and closure. Her decision to "Start with what you remember" is the story's hinge. The archival work is not swappable; removing it breaks the covenant's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in paragraph four (middle) and again at the ending when Maren "opened the locket, set the little photo on the current page." Its meaning shifts from artifact of the broken covenant to a seed for regeneration. Present in two beats with evolving use. The photo anchors the past promise and charges the final act of writing together. Its scallop edge and faded palette tie it to the ink's color. Could score higher with a third distinct beat or more causal pressure on Maren's choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is the story's conceptual spine: broken eleven years ago, it is re-grown "not to restore the original... but to grow it again from what remained." It shapes Maren's entire eleven-year archival practice and is directly tested when Elise returns. The ending dramatizes regeneration on the page: "they began again, gently and thoroughly." Present in setup (original covenant described), middle (Elise's letter saying "I was wrong"), and closure (the act of writing together). Removing it collapses the story's stakes and thematic question.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is introduced early ("The process was gently thorough, like grief, like devotion") and characterizes Maren's archival method. It constrains her practice—walnut ink darkens over weeks, "patient and irreversible"—and reappears in the ending: "they began again, gently and thoroughly, to write down the world." The attribute shapes the story's pacing and the final image's tone. Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure. Could score higher if it forced a choice under pressure or imposed a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Steep" appears early and centrally: Maren "began to steep fresh husks, pressing them beneath rainwater" in the opening ritual. The action is specific to her archival method and is not easily swappable. It recurs in the ending image when Elise kneels "beside the basin and stared at the darkening water." The steeping's slow, irreversible process mirrors the story's accumulative pressure. Present in setup and closure; the middle beat is implied (husks releasing stain) but not dramatized as a distinct turn. Strong integration, shy of 8.5+ because it does not force a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is signaled in paragraph five: "how each small event gave rise to the next... cause touching cause like dominoes made of breath." The method shapes the covenant's original mission and Maren's archival lens. It is thematically central but does not constrain a choice on the page or alter tactics under pressure. Present in setup (exposition) and implied in closure (writing together to trace causes), but not dramatized as a distinct beat. Functional but closer to thematic claim than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is anchored in the opening paragraph and returns in the ending: "pale flowers glowing around them." Its liminal quality ("not quite land, not quite sea, not quite day, not quite dark") mirrors the covenant's regeneration. The clematis and sea lavender "bloomed each spring in defiance of salt and storm," supplying a concrete image of endurance. The setting is the physical site of the original covenant and its renewal, constraining the encounter to this charged location. Present in setup, implied middle, and closure. Removing it would flatten the story's symbolic and spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When context changes" is signaled early: "context changed, as context does. The harbor was bought... Old families were offered money to leave." The timeframe anchors the story in the moment of Elise's return, eleven years after the covenant broke. The past context (development company, displacement) shaped the original break; the present context (Elise's acknowledgment of wrongness) enables regeneration. Present in setup (historical shift) and closure (the act of beginning again). Could score higher if the time pressure were tighter on the page—currently the eleven-year gap is summarized rather than dramatized as a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is stated early and dramatized through Maren's eleven-year archival practice: "a fisherman's prayer... a child's laughter... the exact slant of rain." The motivation is tested when Elise returns, having once dismissed it as "a young woman's romanticism." Maren's final choice—"Start with what you remember"—reaffirms the motivation with visible cost (accepting Elise back despite the breach). Present in setup, middle (Elise's letter), and closure. The friction between Maren's devotion and Elise's abandonment charges the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named once at Elise's arrival: "not happiness exactly but something more layered, a haunted euphoria, the ghost of joy returning to a body that had learned to survive without it." The tone is coherent—elegiac, patient, charged with loss and renewal—and modulates across the story: opening ritual is calm, Elise's approach tightens, the ending breathes. The final image of flowers glowing at twilight carries the haunted beauty. Present in setup (twilight's liminal tone), peak (named), and closure (pale flowers, darkening ink). Could score higher if the tone shifted more sharply under pressure or was tested by a contrasting beat.</comment>
