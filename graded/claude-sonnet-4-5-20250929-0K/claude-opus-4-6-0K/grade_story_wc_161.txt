<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's interior life is rich and contradictory—the walls built through reinvention clash with her slow return to trust. Her micro-choices (adjusting the dehumidifier, reading dust motes) ground her vigilance in embodied action. The trust arc with Elias is earned through concrete weekly labor rather than declaration. Minor: the "woman climbing into her own ribs" metaphor is vivid but the body-as-space conceit doesn't recur to deepen contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) at closure—Marguerite accepts that she'll never recover her former self but finds sufficient resonance in shared preservation. The meteorite chip arrival tightens stakes by embodying lost songs in physical form, and Elias's weekly visits accumulate pressure through interpretation versus hoarding. Cost is visible: she releases the tightness she's carried since the pigeons scattered. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening (preservation becomes performance) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic functions as micro-setting: dust motes constrain her daily ritual (adjusting humidity), and the skylight serves as both clock and diagnostic tool. The meteorite chip on the fiddle bridge alters resonance, charging the final performance. Sensory hierarchy reflects her archivist priorities (ink variations, thumb-oil stains, pigeon-down fibers). Minor: spatial choreography during the fiddle scene (where exactly Elias stands, how the meteorite rests) could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the echo of lost songs without hoarding silence. The meteorite arrival deepens this by forcing Marguerite to choose interpretation over static archiving. The final fiddle performance enacts the tightening—sound that mourns its own passing—and the cost is her release of the knot she's carried. Agency is renunciation with visible payoff: she accepts impermanence. No secondary reversals needed at this length; one meaningful turn (preservation shifts to performance) suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as performance versus hoarding—emerges from the meteorite ritual and the final melody that blooms and withers simultaneously. The dust-mote mapping recurs with shifted meaning: first diagnostic, then emblematic of suspended memory. The closing image ("mote that refuses to fall") offers a non-literal answer to the question of preservation without moralizing. Subtext in Marguerite's walls (new names, closed loft) charges Elias's arrival. No prompt echo in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close. Perceptual signature is archivist-specific: ink variations, talon-scratched edges, thumb-oil stains. Diction modulates with emotional intensity—spare and technical early, more lyrical at the fiddle scene ("blooming and withering at once"). Elias's brief dialogue ("My grandfather said...") carries practical urgency distinct from Marguerite's interior texture. Minor: "phrase that opened like a flower and immediately began to shed its petals" risks slight overwriting in a peak beat, though it supports the blooming/withering tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines serve character, atmosphere, and motif. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives for routine, longer for reflection). No loops or scaffold detected. The meteorite description ("pitch pipe from another world") is specific and functional. Minor figurative density in the final paragraph (blooming/withering, flower/petals, mote/fall) approaches overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Propulsion is clean; no paraphrase cycles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination—pigeon-courier network, Mars meteorite as pitch pipe, dust-mote humidity reading—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "preservation as hoarding" into "preservation requires performance" offers a fresh angle on archival ethics. The meteorite's alien density altering fiddle resonance is a vivid, grounded fantastical touch. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous material detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's history as a courier pigeon trainer is established early (first third) and frames her preservation motive. It enables the paper-trail archive and her ritual vigilance. The trait constrains her trust (she closed the loft, released birds with no message), and this friction drives the slow opening to Elias. The final release of the chest-knot directly traces to pigeon-loss grief. Causal pressure across at least two beats (setup, closure linkage). Swappability: another analog-preservation role could substitute with minor edits, limiting ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Mars meteorite chip appears early (Elias brings it in the setup third), is handled twice on-page (Elias holds it to hum, rests it on the fiddle bridge), and its alien density is specified as altering resonance. It drives the middle turn (decoding phantom intervals) and charges the final performance. Cost connection: the sound it enables is "blooming and withering at once," embodying impermanence. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity: the meteorite's properties (weight, density) matter. Swappability: a tuning fork or heirloom stone could replace it with edits, capping just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paper trails shape the archive (handwritten notation, talon-scratched envelopes, receipts) and Marguerite teaches Elias to read them (ink variations, thumb-oil stains). The concept constrains her preservation method and enables the dust-mote ritual (protecting fragile pages). It's present in setup and middle development but less directly in the closure image, which focuses on the fiddle performance and the suspended mote. The trails remain backdrop rather than driving the final turn. Two-gate participation (setup, development) with lyric reprise; causal role in one major beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reinvention is established early ("new names, new cities, careful persona") and constrains her trust (walls built through years of reinvention). It enables her vigilance and isolation. The trait is label-heavy but does enable one on-page tradeoff: her slow opening to Elias costs her the safety of anonymity. Cost is present but not deeply dramatized—more told than shown in micro-choices. Two-gate participation (setup, middle constraint) but the closure focuses on trust rather than reinvention itself. Swappable with "guarded loner" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Balance" is signaled early (preservation against interpretation) and drives the middle collaborative work with Elias. The final image—"the balance she had been mapping all along"—directly names it as the resolution. It shapes at least two beats (weekly decoding sessions, final performance) and is causally tied to the closure reconfiguration. Cost: she releases rigid preservation for performed impermanence. Strong closure linkage. Swappability: "reconcile" or "integrate" could replace with edits, and the concept is somewhat abstract, limiting ceiling to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dust-mote mapping method is established in the first third ("reading the slow swirl the way a sailor reads current") and used on-page to gauge humidity and adjust the dehumidifier. The method recurs in the middle ("tracked the dust motes and adjusted the atmosphere around them both") and charges the final image ("slow ballet of dust... mote that refuses to fall"). Specificity: the mechanics (skylight, mote drift direction, dehumidifier adjustment) are concrete and irreplaceable. Three-gate participation with strong causal and closure linkage. The method is unique and drives her archivist identity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic is anchored early (smell of foxed pages, oak cases, skylight) and constrains choice: the environment's fragility demands her dust-mote vigilance. The setting supplies the worktable where the meteorite is revealed and the space where the fiddle performance occurs. Micro-setting (attic as preservation chamber) alters tactics daily. Three-gate participation with causal pressure and closure presence. Strong integration; removing the attic would break the dust-mote method and the archival stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "across learning to trust again" is signaled ("across the weeks that followed") and tracks Marguerite's shift from walled isolation to collaboration. Time pressure is modest—weekly visits accumulate rather than tighten a clock—but the duration matters: trust returns "the way a bulb pushes through frost." The arc spans setup to closure. Cost: the slow timeline itself (years of reinvention versus weeks of opening) charges the final release. Two-gate participation with thematic weight. Not a live ticking clock, so ceiling is mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve lost songs is established early (every scrap filed, echo of melodies no living throat remembers) and drives her daily dust-mote ritual. It's dramatized in her conflict with Elias ("preservation without performance was just hoarding silence") and shapes the final turn: she accepts impermanence as part of preservation. Cost: she releases the tightness from the pigeon loss. Three-gate participation with strong causal and closure linkage. Friction between preservation and performance is visible. Swappability: "honor lost art" could substitute, capping just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming/withering tone is established in the opening ("slow decay," "echo of lost songs") and modulates through the piece: technical and spare in the dust-mote sections, lyrical and elegiac in the meteorite and fiddle beats. The final melody is explicitly "blooming and withering at once—a phrase that opened like a flower and immediately began to shed its petals." The tone charges the final image ("mote that refuses to fall") with paradoxical suspension. Coherent across turns, integrated with theme, and indispensable to the closure effect. Three-gate participation with irreplaceability.</comment>
