<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is embodied through concrete actions (picking up damaged objects, smoothing barbs) and her interiority feels specific to a quiet observer. The scene with the boy demonstrates her values through micro-choices rather than declaration. Internal contradiction is present but mild—her realization about the poem feels slightly too articulate for the moment. The change (understanding dawn differently) is earned by the encounter, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of the feather between them reweights the opening "woven dawns" problem with visible cost (abandoning her original metaphor, sitting in shared grief rather than solitary observation). Orientation is clean within 120 words. The kite-snap functions as a tightening that shifts Maren from internal work to witness/guide. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the closure image charges prior particulars without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lagoon as setting pressures Maren's routine and supplies the shoreline path, wet stones, and reeds as tactile anchors. The feather—a micro-setting object—constrains her final choice (she uses it to teach the boy rather than complete her poem) and charges the closure image. Sensory detail (cobalt, bruised light, bronze tip) is selective and filtered through a poet's attention. The body in space is consistently tracked (bare feet on stones, kneeling, sitting).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering language for beauty in fracture. The kite-snap supplies one meaningful tightening—Maren must choose between her internal poem-work and responding to the boy's grief. Her agency is renunciation (closing the notebook, abandoning the "woven dawns" image) with on-page cost (she defers writing, her understanding shifts). The price is conceptual but legible: her prior metaphor is revealed as wrong. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through density increase in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in the incomplete) emerges from the feather, kite, and Maren's practice rather than statement, until the final paragraph where "Dawn was the moment you sat beside a stranger's grief..." edges toward articulation. The ending offers a resonant answer (the feather between them, "still pretty") that reweights prior material. However, "That's exactly it" and the dawn-realization risk soft moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (smoothing barbs, the boy coiling string) but the thematic echo in Maren's thought is borderline explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with tight focalization through Maren's perceptual signature (poet's lens, attention to damage and color). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("bruised light," "specific grief," "burnished hush"). The boy's single line of dialogue feels natural and distinct. Distance modulates purposefully from close observation to slightly elevated register in reflective beats. No head-hopping, and the prose rhythm reflects Maren's contemplative mind even under the kite-crisis pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere). Clarity is strong, though some figurative language clusters: "bruised light," "cursive across the water," "thin gold thread stitching earth to air," "punctuation in an unfinished sentence" within close proximity. The metaphor density in the middle section approaches ornamental without harming momentum. No loops or scaffold detected. The final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (poet seeks beauty in brokenness, applies lesson to grieving child) is familiar but executed with specific sensory detail (drake feather, cobalt lagoon, kite string as cursive). The "woven dawns" metaphor and its revision offer a fresh inflection on the teaching-moment frame. Emotional specificity (the boy's "specific grief," Maren's "warmly attentive" handling) avoids templates. The piece commits fully to its quiet register. Risk-taking is modest; the structure and turn are competent rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren appears in setup, middle (choosing to walk toward the boy, kneeling, tending the feather), and closure (sitting with him, realizing her poem was wrong). Her choice to close the notebook and engage the boy rather than continue her solitary work narrows options with opportunity cost. The observation-to-decision shift is visible. Two gates clear; payoff is conceptual reconfiguration rather than high-stakes causal turn, placing her in mid-6s with lyric-resonance lift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The feather is introduced early (morning find), used in the middle (pressing it against the page, then holding it up to the boy), and tended in the closure scene where it lies between them as the final image. Its broken state and iridescent colors constrain Maren's teaching method (she shows rather than explains) and charge the ending ("It's still pretty"). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (no generic object could replace its visual/tactile specificity) push this into high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "woven dawns" concept appears in Maren's notebook work (setup) and is explicitly revised in her realization near the end ("Dawn did not weave itself from remnants"). It shapes her internal stake (finding the right metaphor) but does not alter on-page tactics until the final thought. The concept is more thematic echo than causal engine. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is absent. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly above purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is shown early (picking up the feather, turning it slowly) and again in the closure scene (kneeling beside the boy, smoothing barbs). The trait enables her teaching method (patient demonstration rather than quick comfort) and constrains her to non-verbal engagement. The cost is opportunity (time away from her poem). Two gates clear, with visible tradeoff in the middle and closure beats, but the attribute could be swapped for "patient" or "gentle" without major edits, capping it mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tend" appears in setup (Maren's practice of picking up damaged things) and is performed on-page in the closure scene ("she began to tend the feather, smoothing the barbs"). The action drives the boy's parallel move (coiling the string) and anchors the thematic payoff. However, the major turn is Maren's choice to engage the boy, not the tending itself—the tending is method rather than pivot. Two beats, closure linkage, but mid-swappability (she could "repair" or "smooth" with similar effect) caps it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is signaled in Maren's description ("her fingers worked by harmonizing discord, not forcing alignment") during the closure scene. It shapes her tending method (finding where broken edges remember neighbors) and implicitly informs her poem-work. However, it arrives late (final third) and is told rather than dramatized in earlier beats. One beat, closure adjacent, but setup and middle development are absent. Late intro and ornamental phrasing cap it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon is present in setup (Maren at shoreline, reeds, wet stones), supplies the path she walks in the middle, and frames the closure ("cobalt hush around them"). The setting constrains her routine (dawn visits) and provides the feather in the reeds. Micro-setting (stones, water's edge) alters her tactics (walking the familiar path with sureness). Three beats, causal pressure, closure participation, and specificity (cobalt, post-rain) push this into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kite-snap is the inciting incident that changes Maren's immediate plan (from poem-work to engagement). The timeframe "as a kite string snaps" is present in setup (implied morning routine) and triggers the middle turn, but the closure scene lacks temporal pressure—time becomes expansive ("burnished hush between rain and dark"). Two gates clear, one turn, but the snap itself doesn't tighten the ending. Moderate causal role places it mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (discovering beauty in the incomplete) is dramatized in setup (her practice, the feather find, notebook work) and tested in the middle (choosing to help the boy rather than continue writing). The closure pays it off when she shows the feather's colors and realizes her metaphor was wrong. Friction is present (her original image fails; she defers completion). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, but the internal realization edges toward told rather than shown, keeping it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is established early (still lagoon, quiet poet, retreating clouds) and modulates with the kite-cry (sharp, brief interruption) before returning in the closure ("burnished hush between rain and dark"). Tone charges the final image (stillness around shared attention) and coheres through the turn without flattening. The tone is active—shaping perception and emotional register—rather than static backdrop. Three beats, closure charge, and coherence under pressure place it low 8s.</comment>
