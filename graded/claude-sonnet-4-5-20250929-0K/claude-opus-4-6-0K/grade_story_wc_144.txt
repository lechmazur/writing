<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's agency comes through clearly in her specialized method and the decision to calibrate the drone despite blindness. The tactile, embodied approach to repair work is character-specific and the cost of her blindness shapes her methodology rather than being merely declared. The brief encounter with Maren functions adequately though their interaction lacks friction. Minor weakness: Elara's competence is so assured that genuine struggle—beyond physical limitation—is absent; the repair proceeds smoothly without meaningful internal conflict or competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under a Situational lens with strong Accumulative/Textural elements: pressure comes from the ticking clock and the constraint of blindness, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the successful calibration) that validates Elara's alternative epistemology. The closure moment—"You feel it"—offers Charged Poise with felt cost (Elara's isolation, her method's invisibility to others). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drone's hum becomes "seamless," reweighting prior particulars. Cost is visible in Elara's continued solitude and the mist's patient return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Platform Seven and the fountain are not postcard details; they function as the calibration instrument that enables the repair. The mist operates throughout as sensory constraint and thematic echo. The depot's "iron bones" and "old luggage room" anchor Elara's isolated expertise spatially. The fountain's refracted light becomes the mechanism by which blind hands decode sensor feedback, directly constraining and enabling the climactic choice. Spatial choreography (workbench, platform, fountain, harbor) remains coherent across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repair the drone before the Celestine sails—is signaled immediately and tightens through the horn's call. The pressure is Situational (external clock plus internal constraint of blindness), and one meaningful escalation occurs when Elara moves from structural patching to the harder problem of calibration without sight. Agency is clear: she chooses an alternative diagnostic method. The cost is legible in real-time (the anchor lifting, Maren running) though the repair itself proceeds without significant friction or failure that would test commitment more deeply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the enacted question: can alternative ways of knowing substitute for conventional sight, and at what cost? The fountain's refracted light becomes both literal tool and figurative answer. The closing image—"every departure begins with something mended"—reweights prior material without stating a moral, gesturing toward broader resonance (repair as epistemology, isolation as price). Elara's method is shown in tactile particulars (motor frequency, adhesive strokes, click of the servo) rather than asserted. The mist's return charges the final beat with quiet inevitability, acknowledging the cost of her solitary expertise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara's sensory experience; her perceptual signature privileges tactile and auditory detail over visual. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate ("heartfelt artisan," "magnetic calm"). Dialogue is minimal but functional: Maren's question and Elara's answer carry subtext about trust and epistemology. The brief exchange with the world ("How do you know it's right?" / "You feel it") advances theme without exposition. One minor slip: "the world assumed were necessary" tilts slightly out of Elara's immediate interior into authorial distance, but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the prose modulates between lyric compression ("the mist closed behind her, patient and luminous") and functional clarity during the repair sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. No major loops or scaffold detected. Minor texture issue: "carrying a velvet-lined case" and similar constructions occasionally drift toward list-logic rather than pressure-driven syntax. The figurative language ("mist... fed by the fountain," "iron bones") is restrained and coherent. Opening and closing images bracket the piece cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—blind artisan repairs light-sensing navigation drone—offers a fresh synthesis of constraint and capability that avoids the inspirational-disabled-person template by grounding Elara's method in tactile expertise rather than triumph. The fountain as calibration tool is a specific, non-obvious choice. Risk is moderate: the piece commits to quiet competence without manufactured peril, which fits tone but limits surprise. The closure's resonance ("every departure begins with something mended") gestures toward durable insight without fully escaping platitude. Transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would dilute the depot's specificity and the sensory particulars of Elara's method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara as "heartfelt artisan" is established early (second paragraph) and drives two key beats: the diagnosis (tracing fractures, identifying calibration as the harder problem) and the repair (using the fountain to decode sensor feedback). Her blindness and tactile expertise constrain method and shape the ending's thematic charge. The trait is not merely label; it alters tactics on the page. Closure directly depends on her specialized artisan knowledge. Cost is visible in her solitary return to the shop.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone appears in the inciting beat (Maren's arrival), the diagnostic beat (Elara's tactile examination), the repair beat (patching, servo adjustment), the calibration beat (fountain test), and the closure beat (figure-eight flight, Maren's departure). Its specific mechanics—refraction-based navigation—drive the central problem and solution. Removing it would collapse the story's causal spine. The drone's "seamless hum" in the climax reweights prior particulars and charges the ending image of wings reading light on water.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The repair shop is anchored early (paragraph two: "old luggage room," shelves of broken things) and frames Elara's expertise, but its primary function is setting and premise rather than active constraint during the central conflict. The story could function with minor edits if the repair occurred elsewhere. It participates in closure (Elara's return to "the next broken thing"), offering thematic resonance but not causal necessity. The shop shapes identity more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Oversees while blind" is signaled early (paragraph two: welding arc stole sight) and constrains the hardest part of the repair—calibration—forcing Elara to substitute hearing and touch for visual diagnostics. The attribute drives the method choice (fountain as analog sensor) and charges the thematic question. Visible tradeoff: she cannot "simply look at a diagnostic screen." The blindness is not ornamental; it creates the story's central friction and validates the alternative epistemology at closure. Cost is clear in her isolation and the effort required.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Patch" appears twice: structural patching (resin, microfilament) and sensor housing patching (adhesive). The first is solved quickly; the second is paired with servo adjustment and calibration, making it part of the climactic repair sequence. The action is dramatized on the page with tactile specificity ("jeweler's pick," "steady, unhurried strokes") and enables the closure beat (seamless hum, figure-eight flight). Swapping "patch" for "seal" or "mend" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability, but the action drives two beats and links to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Examining light refraction through water features" is seeded in the setup (fountain on Platform Seven, drone's navigation method decoding "angle of bent light"), becomes the method for calibration (holding drone above cascading water, motor frequency as diagnostic), and charges the closure image (wings "reading the light on the water, translating refraction into a heading"). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally essential: Elara's alternative diagnostic depends entirely on refraction as a readable signal. It constrains her choice of location (the fountain) and validates her tactile epistemology. The final image directly invokes this method, reweighting it as metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot anchors tone ("magnetic calm") and provides the fountain, which is mechanically essential for calibration. The depot's iron rails, timber sleepers, and east-end luggage room ground Elara spatially. The mist returns in the closure beat ("closed behind her, patient and luminous"), offering thematic resonance. The setting supplies the critical resource (fountain) and shapes atmosphere, but the depot itself does not constrain choices beyond providing the calibration site. It participates in three gates (setup, middle use, closure reprise) and its specific features matter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"in less than an hour, the anchor would lift"—is established in the inciting beat and tightens pressure throughout. The horn sounds twice: low and resonant, then "the anchor chain was already clanking upward," forcing Maren to run. The clock is tracked and dramatized, creating urgency that compels Elara's method choice and validates the success when the Celestine's engines catch. The time constraint drives two beats (setup, closure) and is causally active rather than ornamental. One deduction: the elapsed repair time is not precisely tracked, softening the deadline's grip slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To decode feedback into direction" is stated as the drone's function (converting refraction into navigational data) and drives Elara's repair goal, but it is the drone's motivation, not Elara's personal desire. Elara's own motivation—to repair broken things—is asserted more than conflicted. The story demonstrates the decoding process (motor frequency as feedback, servo adjustment) with specificity, and the method shapes two beats. However, the desire is told in exposition rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs within Elara herself. It functions as premise more than active character drive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is introduced in the fountain scene ("mist wrapped them both in magnetic calm") and maintained through the repair sequence (Elara's "steady, unhurried strokes"). Tone modulates subtly: urgency enters with the horn and Maren's run, yet calm returns in the closing image ("patient and luminous"). The tone is consistent with Elara's expertise and the situational pressure, neither flattening conflict nor escalating into artificial drama. It charges the final image (mist closing, next broken thing waiting) and supports the theme of alternative epistemology. The tone is coherent and purposeful, elevating atmosphere without obscuring stakes.</comment>
