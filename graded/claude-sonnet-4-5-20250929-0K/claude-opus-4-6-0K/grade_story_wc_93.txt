<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is consistently grounded in the mentor's promise and her precognitive curse, with embodied emotion ("lived in her chest like a second heartbeat"). The final choice to place the stone, knowing the cost of transformation into stone herself, is earned and forecloses her path with visible sacrifice. Internal conflict operates clearly: duty versus self-preservation. Minor deduction for the vision of her own petrification feeling slightly convenient as late information, though it does charge the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change with visible cost: Maren completes the pattern knowing she will become stone, restoring friction. The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from prophecy through preparation to sacrifice. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, tidal bluff, post-Unmooring). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision reveals her petrification cost, narrowing her choice to sacrifice or abandonment of the promise. The inferred lens holds through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal bluff setting constrains Maren's work spatially and the aurora charges the final image with "borrowed dawn" spreading across her skin. The frictionless world is rendered through specific, purposeful detail (eels gliding across wet stone, buildings shedding contents). The painted rocks and star dust function as micro-setting elements that constrain her method. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting directly enables the climactic choice by providing the environment where the pattern can be completed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfilling the promise to restore friction—is signaled early and tightens when Maren sees the vision of her own petrification as the cost. This reversal narrows options from abstract duty to concrete self-sacrifice, forcing a choice with undeniable price. The escalation is driven by Maren's agency: she chooses to place the final stone despite knowing the cost. The pressure coheres under the Causal lens and the resolution requires her decisive action with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between prophecy, duty, and self-sacrifice without explicit moralizing. The recurring pattern motif (Fibonacci, eels' spirals, sacred geometry) accumulates meaning and charges the closure when Maren herself becomes the final element. The piece resists tidy resolution—she restores friction but pays with her existence, a genuine cost without false equivalence. The final image offers a resonant answer to the thematic question of what promises cost without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's attention to patterns, sequences, and sacred geometry colors all observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the climactic placement. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout ("friction dissolving like salt in warm water," "borrowed dawn"). The narrative certainty matches what Maren can know through her precognitive curse. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with strong propulsion through most beats. Rhythm varies naturally and syntax supports emotional intensity. Minor deductions for a few instances of elevated register that occasionally drift from the established voice ("elusive by necessity, not temperament" feels slightly formal). One paraphrase loop: "turned to stone" concept appears twice in close succession near the end without added pressure. Otherwise clean with zero muddy metaphors and clear sequence throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes precognition, frictionless physics, and sacred geometry in a fresh combination. The painted-rocks-as-restoration-method is specific and non-obvious, and the cost (protagonist becomes the final element) feels earned rather than convenient. The frictionless world is rendered through particular details rather than generic post-apocalyptic tropes. Minor limitation: the mentor's deathbed gift and implicit knowledge of the cost edges toward familiar fantasy-quest structure, though executed with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices create all key turns: she returns nightly to the bluff, develops the painted-rock method, and makes the final sacrifice. Her "elusive by necessity" trait shapes her rejection of supplicants and solitary work. Present in setup, middle development (testing the method), and payoff (placing the final stone). Irreplaceable—the story requires her precognitive knowledge and her commitment to Thessaly's promise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The star dust appears in setup (Thessaly's deathbed gift), is used actively in the middle (poured along the pattern's spine), and charges the closure (Maren places her hand against it before the final choice). Its unique property—bending light, impossibly dense—matters mechanically and cannot be swapped. It enables the restoration pattern and ties causally to the climax. Three distinct beats with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The promise to Thessaly shapes every choice: it drives Maren's nightly return, constrains her to refuse supplicants, and compels the final sacrifice despite the vision of petrification. It's introduced early, creates pressure in the middle (she could walk away), and directly shapes the closure ("I promised"). The entire narrative arc traces to this obligation. Removing it would eliminate the story's central engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The precognitive curse enables the plot (Maren foresaw the Unmooring), isolates her socially (called "mad, then desperate, then dangerous"), and reveals the cost of restoration in the vision. Present in setup and payoff. It shapes her understanding of patterns and provides the final-beat knowledge that charges her choice. Two beats with causal pressure, though the curse itself doesn't constrain her final action—she chooses despite, not because of, the vision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Harnessing energy is the method Maren uses ("spent months learning to harness its energy") and is shown on-page when the aurora bends downward and the painted rocks glow. Present in the climactic beat but mostly summarized in retrospect ("had discovered"). The specific mechanics matter but could be described as "channeling" or "activating" with minor edits. One strong beat at closure; moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mathematical sequences are introduced early (Maren grinds pigments, places stones "in mathematical sequences"), executed on-page in the climax (Fibonacci chains, prime intervals, golden-ratio arcs), and cannot be replaced—the method requires this specific precision to work. Three beats: preparation, placement, and effect. The mechanics shape the closure and tie to the theme of sacred patterns. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal bluff provides the workspace where Maren can arrange the rocks and access the eels' patterns. The aurora overhead is necessary for the energy bending. The setting enables the climactic action and charges the final image ("borrowed dawn spread its fragile gold across her skin"). Present in setup, middle observation, and payoff. The specific location matters: removing it would require a different spatial logic for the pattern work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The post-friction world is the story's engine: it creates the crisis Maren foresaw, validates her curse, generates the supplicants she must refuse, and provides the problem her sacrifice solves. Introduced in the opening ("after friction disappeared"), it shapes every tactical choice (eels drift differently, Maren can "barely grip" the rock), and defines the stakes at closure (restoring friction). Indispensable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Understanding sacred patterns drives Maren's nightly study, her mentor's teaching, and the method she discovers. It's woven through setup ("looking for sacred patterns"), middle development (months learning the sequences), and closure (the patterns reveal themselves, friction is "a rhythm the world followed"). The motivation creates friction with the cost (understanding requires her sacrifice) and is irreplaceable. Three beats with causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" appears as a recurring phrase that evolves in meaning: first describing the aurora's color ("bruised gold"), then the glowing rocks' light ("that same borrowed dawn"), and finally spreading across Maren's skin at the moment of sacrifice. The tone is elegiac and charged with impermanence, modulating with pressure. It reweights at closure, tying light/lending/sacrifice into a unified image. Strong lyric reprise that charges the final beat.</comment>
