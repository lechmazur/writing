<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete and embodied—fourteen unsent letters carried physically, pride warring with need—and the choice to place the earliest, angriest letter into the shard's mouth feels earned by prior setup. The interiority avoids therapy-speak; "the space where an apology waits unspoken" is specific to her stance. Internal contradiction is present: fury leading with "but I still—" captures simultaneous anger and love. Minor slip: Cael exists only through condensation messages and backstory, never tested as a live pressure in scene, which slightly limits relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change: Lira moves from paralysis (fourteen months of unsent letters) to action (placing one letter in the shard, turning the boat toward home). The cost is visible—she relinquishes pride, the "liminal breath between knowing you were wrong and saying it aloud." Drive lens reads Causal with lyric texture: finding the shard enables the condensation bridge, which forces the choice to send. One meaningful tightening occurs when the condensation asks "Tell me that's not true" and Lira must answer. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The piece coheres under a Hybrid lens (Causal at closure, Accumulative in the mangrove texture), held without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and selective—roots "like fingers of something that had forgotten how to let go," spirits' song as "Spanish moss made of sound"—and it guides Lira's search spatially (narrow channels, canopy gaps that admit moonlight). The shard wedged between roots creates a physical constraint that enables the plot turn. The swamp opens at the end, a micro-setting shift that charges the resolution. Sensory detail (humidity forming condensation, pole vibrating with song) reflects POV priorities. Minor: the cathedral/swamp juxtaposition is acknowledged but not explored for thematic friction, leaving a small gap in world logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: Lira must choose whether to break the silence with Cael. One meaningful tightening occurs when the condensation delivers Cael's unspoken plea ("Tell me that's not true"), narrowing Lira's options to answer or remain silent. The choice to place the letter is protagonist-driven and forecloses the prideful stance with visible cost (she "had been too proud to send"). Escalation reads under a Causal lens with lyric deepening. No antagonist is required; the pressure is internal and relational, cohering throughout. Cost is legible: she turns the boat toward Cael's door, committing to vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—what can be healed by the right light, how silence between loved ones is a wound both help open—emerges from the shard healing in moonlight and Lira's realization that "some broken things only needed to be held in the right light." The gargoyle as sacred conduit (rain from "sacred heights") reweights the apology as ritual rather than defeat. No moralizing; the ending image (moonlight "healing every shadow it touched") resonates without stating a lesson. The "fierce tenderness" motif recurs purposefully: fury as a mask for frightening love. The dash in "but I still—" is a non-literal answer to Cael's question, earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "the space where an apology waits unspoken, that liminal breath between knowing you were wrong and saying it aloud" feels character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled; POV modesty holds (Lira infers Cael's voice through the condensation, never claims certainty). Diction remains within the narrator's register; no filter-verb stacks or corporate drift. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. Brief compression under peak stress (shard healing, condensation forming) tightens syntax without losing internal texture. No dialogue; condensation messages function as quasi-dialogue, naturalistic in their brevity and emotional charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high: "She existed now in the space where an apology waits unspoken" does triple work (motive, theme, emotional state). Minor overwriting in early beats: "something that had forgotten how to let go" and "Spanish moss made of sound" cluster figurative language in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching, though both images serve setting. No loops or scaffold detected. The final line ("The moon followed her out, healing every shadow it touched") recharges the healing motif cleanly. Clarity and propulsion are strong throughout; no line-level artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—mangrove swamp medium, shard that heals in moonlight, messages in condensation—synthesizes Gothic, magical realism, and sibling estrangement into a specific whole. The shard as postal system (gargoyle's throat channeling words instead of rain) is a fresh inflection. Emotional specificity elevates the familiar apology arc: "choosing to be the one who broke first" and the dash in "but I still—" avoid generic templates. Minor: the cryptic-medium-sends-protagonist-on-quest frame is widely used, and Maren's role is functional rather than transformed. The ending (hand-delivering remaining letters) synthesizes magic and mundane action in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maren appears in backstory only, pressing the envelope into Lira's hands and delivering the cryptic instruction "Find the shard before the moon finds you." Her choice to send Lira shapes the inciting action but does not create a turn on the page. She is not present in the mangrove or at closure. Functional setup, no middle or ending development. Swappable with any mentor figure who gives cryptic guidance. Late setup (mentioned in paragraph two after the mangrove opening). Cap: missing middle development (3.4), missing closure participation (2.8) → 2.8. Raise slightly for inciting-action linkage to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shard appears early (wedged between roots), heals in moonlight (middle beat), and serves as the conduit for Lira's letter at closure (she slides the letter into its open mouth). Three distinct beats; causal pressure (healing enables the condensation bridge); closure linkage (the throat channels her words); irreplaceability (its cathedral origin and carved mouth are load-bearing). Visible cost: Lira must place the letter in the shard's mouth, a ritual act that externalizes vulnerability. Specificity high: gargoyle's rainspout from a cathedral in a swamp, stone that remembers its shape. Early signal (+0.8), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.6), specificity (+0.7) = strong 8.7 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unsent letters are the dominant stake from paragraph two onward: "fourteen unsent letters in a waterproof pouch strapped against her ribs" frames the conflict. They shape middle tactics (Lira must choose which letter to send) and closure (she places one in the shard, then commits to hand-delivering the rest). The concept constrains her options throughout: to mail is "to be the one who broke first." Cost is visible—she relinquishes the liminal space where pride protects her. Early signal (+0.8), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.7), cost connection (+0.6), irreplaceability (+0.8) = 9.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The healing attribute appears mid-story when Lira touches the shard and moonlight strikes it: "the stone heal—a crack along the jaw sealed itself." This moment triggers her epiphany ("some broken things only needed to be held in the right light") and justifies the condensation forming in the humid air. It enables one key turn (the bridge to Cael) and charges the final image (moon "healing every shadow"). Cost is conceptual: the realization that her pride has withheld the necessary light. Setup (~40% mark, late but not final third −0.3), one beat (+0.4), causal enablement (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.2), thematic charge (+0.5) = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Evoke" appears once: "watched the spirits' song evoke something from the ink—not just words but the feeling beneath them." This action enables the condensation shift from Cael's messages to Lira's transmission, a middle turn. It does not appear at closure (the final act is placement, not evocation) and is not set up early. Functional in one beat but somewhat swappable with "channel" or "draw forth." Setup missing (first mention in final third −0.7), one beat (+0.4), causal link (+0.8), absent from closure (−0.5) = mid-6s, 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Condensation forming words on the shard is signaled early ("condensation gathered on the shard's surface in the humid air. No—not just condensation. Words.") and its mechanics matter: moisture beads, messages appear and dissolve, Lira reads them as they form. This method enables the dialogue with Cael and shapes Lira's choice to respond. Present in two beats (Cael's messages, then Lira's transmission via moonlight through ink) and at closure (the shard's mouth becomes the postal channel). Early signal (+0.7), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.3), closure linkage (+1.4), specificity (+0.6) = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth pressures Lira's search: narrow channels guide her path, the canopy gap admits the moonlight needed to heal the shard, and the singing spirits provide auditory navigation. The swamp opens at the end, a spatial shift that mirrors resolution. The setting supplies the resource (moonlight) and obstacle (dense canopy) that shape the middle beat. Early signal (+0.8), two beats (search, moonlight moment +0.9), causal pressure (enables healing +1.0), closure participation (opens to let her leave +0.9), micro-setting (body, pole, boat constrain movement +0.5) = 7.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the space where an apology waits unspoken" is rendered as emotional stasis rather than a live clock. It characterizes Lira's fourteen-month paralysis and the liminal moment before sending, but does not create urgency or tighten decisions on the page. The phrase recurs thematically and charges Lira's realization, functioning as a conceptual frame. Lyric reprise (early paragraph two, returns at closure in the dash "but I still—") reweights the stake. Early signal (+0.6), lyric closure linkage (+1.2), no middle pressure (−0.4), no live ticking clock (−0.5) = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "find the moment before deciding" is dramatized: Lira seeks the raw instant "before pride or shame could intervene" and chooses the earliest, angriest letter that ends mid-dash. This desire shapes her middle choice (which letter?) and closure (the dash contains "everything"). Friction is visible: she fears being "the one who broke first" yet knows the silence is a shared wound. Early signal (implied in paragraph two, explicit in final third +0.5), one major beat (+0.4), causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), cost connection (+0.6) = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fierce tenderness is present throughout: "fury and ended with something she couldn't name," "fierce tenderness that almost buckled her knees," "who writes fury because love is too frightening to lead with." The tone modulates with pressure—early paragraphs lean eerie (mangroves "like fingers," spirits singing), middle beats intensify to realization, final image softens (moon healing shadows, sister's laugh). The tone charges the closure: placing the angriest letter is an act of fierce tenderness. Coherent across turns (+1.2), modulates under pressure (+1.0), charges final image (+1.4), specificity (not static +0.8) = 8.2.</comment>
