<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's compulsion to speak truths and his quest to break his inherited curse shape choices throughout, with embodied grief in the cistern scene ("his breath caught"). Internal contradiction appears when he shifts from urgency to "something almost like repose," but this feels earned rather than inconsistent. The final choice—to let the notebook speak rather than shout—closes the arc with visible cost (his father's unheard warnings now his own burden). Minor: Peter's characterization is retrospective summary rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: Marcus's descent is causally motivated (stolen dinghy, Monday demolition deadline) and the discovery narrows options to one clean choice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): he will not "cry wolf" but present proof, reweighting his inheritance with quiet agency. Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, Marcus, late afternoon) arrive promptly. One meaningful tightening when he finds the notebook and the cost—emerging into a world that never listened—charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The copperlight filtering through multiple surfaces (lantern room, crack in ceiling, onto his hands) becomes a pressure signature and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: spiral stairs, narrow corridor, confessional lattice, lower passage, cistern room. The cracked concrete and mineral stillness make setting an active constraint (foundation rot his father "could smell out"). Hovering dust motes serve as atmospheric witnesses that recur with purpose, and the jagged reef frames isolation without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find proof before Monday demolition reshapes the narrative. One strong tightening when Marcus retrieves the notebook, foreclosing the path of shouting warnings and narrowing options to silent evidence. The Monday deadline creates pressure but remains off-page; the story prioritizes discovery over confrontation. Agency is present in the descent and retrieval, and the cost—holding his father's unheard voice—lands with quiet weight. Escalation is modest but sufficient under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited curse and unheard truth emerges from concrete particulars: scuffs on the door frame, the notebook in plastic, the distinction between crying wolf and offering proof. The ending reweights the premise without stating a moral—Marcus will "simply open the notebook"—and the copper-stained hands and hovering dust charge the final image with earned resonance. The story resists the explain-everything temptation and trusts the reader to feel the shift from Peter's warnings to Marcus's silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Marcus's perceptual signature throughout: "chasing hush," "dust motes seemed to hover…like witnesses," "mineral stillness, the scent of bones long past their grieving." Copperlight as a filtering lens is consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the notebook discovery. Minor slips: "sustained impossibilities" and "thread the labyrinth with your own story" drift toward elevated register in a few beats, and the phrase "something almost like repose" feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in key beats (cistern discovery, scuff description). Clarity is strong with no loops or orientation debt. Mild overwriting in cumulative figurative language: "copperlight," "hovering," "threaded," "labyrinth" recur across most paragraphs without escalating function. The final third avoids artifacts and the closure image is clean. "Chasing hush" and "thread a labyrinth" border on abstract metaphor but remain legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The inversion of "boy who cried wolf"—son refuses to cry out and offers silent proof—is fresh and thematically earned. Lighthouse-as-prison and the confessional lattice filtering the corridor into "dozens of small, framed views" provide specific, non-obvious details. The premise (inherited compulsion, lighthouse cistern, demolition deadline) synthesizes familiar elements into a coherent, grounded vision. Risk-taking is modest; the story commits fully to its quiet, atmospheric mode without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is Peter Harlan's son; the inherited curse shapes his motivation and final choice. Present early, drives the descent and retrieval, and the closure hinges on his decision to let evidence speak rather than shout. Causal across multiple beats with cost at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lattice appears once: Marcus picks it up, sees the corridor fragmented through its grid, then sets it down. It does not return or shape a later choice. The fragmented view is atmospheric but not causal; easily swappable with another framing device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is introduced midway ("He was chasing hush now") and motivates the descent into silence where evidence waits. It shapes tactics (following silence deeper) and charges the final image (the notebook will speak in the hush his father never had). Present in two beats with thematic resonance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is a label applied to Marcus's inherited curse in the opening. It frames his compulsion but does not visibly constrain an on-page action or create a tactical trade-off. Told rather than dramatized; no cost tied directly to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hover" recurs: dust motes "hover, suspended as if time itself had thickened…like witnesses," and the final image places Marcus "hovering between grief and something almost like repose." The word charges both the discovery beat and the closure, reweighting stillness as both witness and emotional state. Not a physical action but a lyric motif with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The scuffs (gouges, scratches, crescent impressions) appear once in the corridor descent and tell a backstory of dragged prisoners. They do not return or shape Marcus's actions. The method is observed but not used; Marcus presses through the door without the scuffs altering his tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison is present early and continuously: jagged reef isolation, spiral stairs, confessional corridor, cistern room. The cracked concrete and foundation rot enable the discovery; the setting's decommissioned history frames the stakes. The lighthouse structure guides every move and the climb back toward the lantern room closes the spatial arc. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies on their own terms, before the demolition crew arrived Monday morning" is stated early and recurs in the ending: "Monday the crew would come. Monday the town would learn." The deadline tightens urgency and shapes Marcus's lone trip. The clock is slightly abstract (no minute-by-minute pressure) but present in two beats and contributes to closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is introduced midway as Marcus's goal: "Every step threaded the labyrinth with his own story, the way his father had tried to thread it with warnings." It motivates the descent and the final image ("threaded the last passage…with proof"). Present in two beats with closure resonance, though the metaphor is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Copperlight appears throughout: "copperlight of late afternoon," "copperlight seeping through a crack," "held the notebook to the copperlight," "copper-stained hands." It modulates with pressure (amber stillness at discovery, charged at closure) and "repose" frames the ending's emotional shift. Tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image with consistent sensory texture.</comment>
