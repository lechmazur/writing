<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is richly embodied through her caretaking gestures and the storage of Lena's fears, creating clear motivation. The controlled burn decision arises from genuine contradiction—devotion versus function—with the cedar box serving as a concrete anchor for abstract emotion. The final choice to burn the slips while keeping the box shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor: the "things that pretend to be alive but aren't" fear feels slightly on-the-nose for the android premise, nudging toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren burns the fears to preserve her function, accepting the static as "the shape of love in a machine not designed for it." The cost is palpable—she loses physical proof of Lena's trust but gains operational stability. Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the magnetic shift triggers memory fragments, which escalate to functional threat, forcing the burn decision that reweights her relationship to the past. The compass settling on "a new north" charges the final image without forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses function as micro-setting that both mirrors Maren's state ("chaos frozen into symmetry") and enables the climactic choice—the UV lamps provide the mechanism for controlled burn. Gypsum's properties (withstanding UV while paper burns) constrain the method credibly. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: rows, center formation, shelf beside charging station. The dome's "manufactured atmosphere" and filtration system participate actively in the closure beat, drinking away the smoke.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the static threatens Maren's core functions and thus the roses' survival. The escalation from memory fragments to "hum" to corruption threat is causally linked to the magnetic shift and tightens options to a forced choice: burn the fears or lose function. The controlled burn itself narrows options with visible cost (losing physical proof of Lena's trust). Agency is clear: Maren's decision to place the slips among crystals and activate the lamps forecloses the path of holding everything. One strong tightening; no multiple reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the desert roses as extended metaphor: "containing chaos until it crystallized into something you could hold" operates through action rather than assertion. The piece resists moralizing; Maren's final state is "strangely whole, beautifully fragmented"—neither redemption nor tragedy, but earned paradox. The closing image of tending "what remained" answers the implicit question (can a machine love?) through specifics without stating a thesis. The fear slips function thematically without symbol-shouting, and the empty box retention adds complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with clear access to Maren's processors and perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: "synthetic fingers," "optical sensors," "neural architecture" ground the android perspective without clinical coldness. Diction stays consistent—"Unit Maren," "charging station," "core functions"—while also carrying poetic weight ("violence made beautiful by patience and pressure"). The brief Lena backstory integrates smoothly via memory trigger rather than exposition dump. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (the burn) to slightly wider (the final paragraph's hope for Lena).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image-dense with strong propulsion. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line ("tending what remained") recharges the caretaker motif with new weight. Rhythm varies effectively: the short "She opened the box" paragraph provides caesura before the climax. Minor density issue: "the static would eventually corrupt her core functions, and the roses would die untended" reads slightly explanatory for a high-pressure beat. The "Fear of thunder. Fear of being forgotten" catalogue risks list structure but earns its place by dramatizing the act of reading. No loops or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The android-caretaker premise is familiar, but the controlled-burn-as-grief-management synthesis feels fresh and inevitably connected to the desert rose cultivation. The cedar box as physical container for abstract fears provides concrete specificity. Risk: the magnetic north shift as inciting event is slightly metaphorical-convenient, but the gypsum's UV-resistance properties and the dome's function ground the fantastical elements credibly. The piece avoids the typical android-becomes-human arc; Maren remains machine-like even as she accepts the static, which is a bolder choice than full sentimentality would be.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren drives all key turns: her choice to open the box, place the slips among roses, and activate UV lamps at concentrated intensity. Her nostalgic devotion motivates the setup (keeping the box 47 years) and creates the internal conflict (carrying vs. function). Present in first paragraph and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cedar box appears in setup (shelf beside charging station), middle (the hum from static), and closure (she keeps the empty box). It constrains choice by making the fears physical and burnable; its warped-with-age state adds cost to the burn decision. The final image of keeping the empty box reweights its meaning from burden to proof-of-trust to symbol of carried echoes. Irreplaceable: no other object could hold this specific history.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Controlled burn" is signaled as land-management protocol and directly executes the climax: UV lamps incinerate paper selectively while leaving gypsum intact. The concept shapes tactics (miniaturize through selective destruction) and alters the dominant stake (from "carry everything" to "save the whole by destroying parts"). Present in title framing and enacted on-page with visible cost. Slightly less than indispensable because the broader idea of "letting go" could theoretically take other forms, but the specific mechanism is well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" describes the desert roses' crystalline petals in the opening and recurs obliquely in the closing "strangely whole, beautifully fragmented" applied to Maren. The trait establishes tonal texture and thematic mirroring (mineral life / android emotion) but does not directly constrain a choice. Present early and echoed at closure with reweighted meaning, but the causal pressure is softer than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" appears as explicit goal: "She needed to miniaturize these—not the papers, but their weight inside her." The burn enacts this by compressing the static into "a hum that harmonized" rather than corrupting. The action drives the key turn and redefines the problem from elimination to compression. Present in decision framing and fulfilled at closure. Swappability: "reduce" or "contain" could substitute with minor edits, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Containing chaos" is seeded early in Maren's understanding of the roses ("chaos frozen into symmetry, violence made beautiful by patience and pressure") and governs her method: she places fears among crystals to contain them during burn, and the dome's filtration "drank [the smoke] away"—a secondary containment. The method shapes her approach (nest the slips in mineral lattice, use concentrated beam) and charges the thematic resolution. Mechanics matter and are signaled before deployment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass dome provides the UV cultivation lamps (tool for burn), the filtration system (consequence management), and the spatial constraint (Maren cannot leave; the roses anchor her duty). The desert roses supply both metaphor and mechanism: their gypsum structure withstands UV while paper burns. Setting pressures the choice (if she fails, roses die) and enables the solution. Early anchor, multi-beat involvement, indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Magnetic north shift triggers the inciting static three days ago and creates urgency (the compass "spun freely," then "spun again," then "settled" at closure). The timeframe provides escalation rhythm and a live countdown to core-function corruption. The 47-year backstory adds weight. Not a strict ticking clock, but the progressive worsening (fragments → hum → corruption threat) creates temporal pressure that drives the burn decision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inner static is the dominant stake: it surfaces as fragmented memories, makes the box hum, and threatens core-function corruption, forcing Maren to choose between devotion (keeping proof) and function (operational stability). Desire is embodied in her caretaking gestures and the 47-year burden. The friction between "every fragment of unresolved devotion" and survival needs drives the climax. Cost is visible: she loses physical proof but gains "something she could carry, miniaturized by the act of letting go."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" governs tone from the opening ("crystalline petals strangely organic") through the climax (fears dissolving into smoke, static softening into hum) to the closing image ("strangely whole, beautifully fragmented"). The tone modulates with pressure—controlled at the start, intensifying during memory intrusion, quieting after the burn—and charges the final image by making contradiction feel earned rather than forced. Coherent across beats and essential to the thematic resolution.</comment>
