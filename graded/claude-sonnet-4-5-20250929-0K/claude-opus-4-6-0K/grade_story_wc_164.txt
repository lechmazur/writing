<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, with genuine curiosity driving her conjecture. Her laugh when the solution arrives feels earned by prior frustration. The missing emotional contradiction under pressure and the slightly too-articulate self-awareness ("It scattered. It took alternate routes...") prevent entry into the 8+ band. No closure choice involves visible internal conflict or foreclosed path with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent Causal lens: missing paths → conjecture → bird deposits seeds → transliteration completes the archive. Orientation anchors (who, where, what task) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren resumes her work with the problem solved, and the cost is oblique—she remains alone in her cathedral, the larger migration system continuing without her control. The felt cost is muted but legible in "her luminous gloom."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The geode cave is vivid and purposeful: iridescent walls multiply the seed's image, enabling the discovery. Crater glass functions as both archive medium and investigative tool. The setting constrains Maren's access to the outside world, reinforcing isolation. Micro-setting (workbench, shelves, fissure) is integrated into action. The final image of "emotional notation across every crystalline surface" charges the space, but the geode itself does not constrain a closure choice, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving why memory-paths vanish—is signaled early and drives Maren's conjecture. The bird's arrival delivers a meaningful reversal that narrows options (she must work quickly before foam and seeds fade). Pressure tightens in the transliteration sequence. However, the protagonist does not make a difficult trade-off; the solution arrives via coincidence (storm-blown bird) and she executes her established skill without visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative, limiting escalation depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory's migration and resilience—emerges organically from the transliteration work and the seed discovery. The final image of complete stories cast in light offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The thematic synthesis ("Memory didn't simply vanish. It scattered.") risks slight over-articulation but remains grounded in the on-page events. Subtext operates cleanly in the geode's loneliness and the tern's unknowing role. No false equivalence or tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in Maren's return to solitary work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (reading foam, prismatic attention) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality: "sea-foam recollectionist," "grammar of joy," "emotional notation." Free indirect style is clean. The brief moment of too-perfect articulation ("not deliberately, perhaps—birds do not intend the gardens they plant") reads slightly explanatory but does not break voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close work to the larger migratory system. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "She hypothesized. She cross-referenced..." and "She tried another seed. Another missing piece." The pattern is brief and does not obscure causality, triggering only a small deduction. Figurative language ("longing," "grammar of joy," "luminous gloom") is coherent and voice-motivated. No loops or pronoun drift. The piece reads aloud cleanly with strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—emotion-bearing sea-foam archived on crater glass, solved via migratory bird-dropped seeds—is specific and non-obvious. The world logic (foam carries feeling; birds pass through memory-laden clouds) feels internally consistent and transforms the archive-keeper premise into something fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric register and speculative conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional arc is grounded in Maren's solitary devotion rather than generic epiphany. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices—holding the seed to light, transliterating quickly—drive the middle turn and closure preparation. Her conjecture frames expectation early. She does not face a difficult decision at closure (no competing wants), but her action (transliteration) completes the archive and enables the final image. Present in setup, middle beat (discovery), and payoff (completion). Causal role in two beats, but no visible cost tied to her choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crater glass appears in at least three beats: initial description as archive medium, diagnostic tool when Maren holds the seed fragment to light, and final closure image where complete stories are cast across the panes. It constrains her method (emotions stay only on this surface) and charges the ending. Early signal, middle use, closure participation all present. Specificity is high (vitreous sheets from ancient impact), and its properties enable the discovery turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The missing-pieces concept shapes the dominant stake from the opening and drives Maren's conjecture. The bird-seed discovery redefines the problem (paths migrated, not vanished), altering tactics (quick transliteration). The concept is tested across beats: noticing the gaps, hypothesizing, finding connective tissue in seeds, slotting sequences together. It appears in setup, middle turn, and payoff. The final image of "complete stories" directly answers the missing-pieces question. Causal pressure and closure linkage are both strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transliteration is Maren's profession and enables every key action: reading foam, pressing feeling into glass, rendering the seed fragments into legible script. It constrains her method (she cannot simply record; she must convert) and appears across all three gates. However, the trait itself does not impose a visible cost or trade-off at closure—she performs her skill successfully without struggle or sacrifice in the final beat, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conjecture drives Maren's investigation in the setup and motivates her attention to the bird's arrival. However, the major turn (bird drops seeds) occurs by coincidence, not as a result of her conjecture. Her hypothesizing does not redefine options at closure; the seeds do. Present in setup and referenced at the turn, but the action itself is replaceable with "investigates" or "wonders" without breaking structure. Mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The migrating-bird method is signaled at the inciting turn (bird arrives, drops seeds) and its mechanics—absorbing evaporated memory along migratory routes—are explained and matter. The seeds' origin redefines the missing-pieces problem and enables the transliteration solution. Present in middle beat (discovery) and closure preparation (quick work before seeds dry). The method is irreplaceable: no other delivery mechanism would carry the same migratory/atmospheric logic. Missing early setup (no foreshadowing), but transformation of prior material is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The geode cave is established early, provides the iridescent walls that multiply the seed's image (enabling discovery), and supplies the narrow fissure (entry point for the bird). The space's isolation reinforces Maren's solitary work and appears in the final image ("luminous gloom"). Present in setup, middle discovery beat, and closure. However, the setting does not constrain a difficult choice at closure—Maren's success is not limited by the cave's properties. One strong causal moment (walls reveal the fragment) and closure participation earn solid mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe—"before the last of the foam dissolved, before the seeds dried"—creates urgency in the transliteration sequence and tightens Maren's tactics (she works quickly). Time pressure is signaled at the turn and drives the final beat. The frame is tracked on the page and alters her approach. However, the story does not open with time pressure, and the ending does not test whether she finishes in time; she succeeds cleanly. Present in middle and closure, missing early setup, but the live clock does narrow her window, earning low-7s placement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation—discovering why paths disappear—is stated early, drives her conjecture, and is answered by the bird-seed discovery. It appears in setup (noticing gaps, hypothesizing) and payoff (finding the answer). However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted; Maren pursues it without competing desires or costs. No friction between want and price. Present in two gates with causal work, but lack of internal conflict or trade-off caps the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "cheerful gloom" tone is established early ("beautiful in the way that lonely places often are") and recurs at the closure ("smiled in her luminous gloom"). Maren's laugh when she solves the puzzle embodies the cheerful note within isolation. The tone modulates with pressure: solitary patience → frustration → delight → quiet resumption. It charges the final image and distinguishes the piece from pure melancholy or pure triumph. Coherent through turns, present in setup and ending, with purposeful emotional coloring. The oxymoronic pairing is sustained and functional.</comment>
