<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is established through consistent perceptual filters (shadow imagery, mirror-reading patience), and her core trait of "calmly intuitive" reading manifests in concrete action. The secondary character Haldr is functional but thin—his clenched fists and "rigid" posture are gestural stock, and his decision to take her hand arrives without visible internal struggle or cost on the page. Maren's final choice feels motivated, but the piece leans heavily on telling her empathic process rather than embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The "courageous anomaly" label is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Situational lens: Maren's stake is whether to sanction force, and the mirror-gazing sequence accumulates pressure by revealing the Southern Floe's fear rather than malice, which reframes her decision. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Haldr takes her hand, options crystallize, and the final image ("the world tilted one degree closer to mercy") reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the harder path of witness over violence). The cost is felt but not yet paid on the page, which satisfies RR under Situational logic. One minor slip: the phrase "the weighted breath before reply" in the final paragraph restates the opening frame without adding new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and stone building housing the mirrors are anchored early and revisited with spatial coherence. The mirrors and crystal fragment constrain Maren's method, and the orchard's frozen trees frame both the opening and the decision scene, creating purposeful enclosure. The "ice floes ground against each other with sounds like old bones" is vivid but borders on stock imagery for this setting type. Sensory selection is filtered through Maren's professional attention (the mirrors, the fragment, the lighthouse beam), though urgency does not narrow perception further during the peak choice. The setting charges the final image but does not directly alter Haldr's or Maren's tactics in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Maren will sanction force—is signaled in paragraph three and remains coherent throughout. The mirror sequence provides one meaningful tightening: Maren's glimpses reveal the Southern Floe's fear-driven hoarding, which narrows her options from binary (sanction/refuse) to tertiary (witness as alternative). The final choice forecloses the path of violence and crystallizes a harder alternative with conceptual cost ("I will do something more difficult"). Under the Situational lens, this counts as escalation through stance crystallization. However, Haldr's acceptance arrives without visible struggle or trade-off on his part, which mutes the felt cost of the reversal. The piece meets the one-tightening threshold but does not layer secondary pressures or credible losses that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mirror glimpses and Maren's role as a holder of shadow: empathy as a precondition for mercy, and the cost of choosing witness over force. The broken crystal fragment functions as both object and thematic anchor—its deliberate incompleteness mirrors Maren's method of assembling truth "piece by piece." The final image ("darkness that illuminated") reweights the premise non-literally without stating a moral. One slip: "courageous anomaly" and "someone willing to hold shadow might also be willing to hold their grief" veer toward thematic echo, articulating the story's thesis in near-prompt language. The piece resists tidy resolution and sustains ambiguity (Haldr's choice is deferred off-page), but the proximity to explicit theme statement in the second paragraph pulls slightly toward sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Maren throughout; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature is consistent: she notices shadow, texture, and emotional weight, and her interior voice favors declarative, patient syntax that matches "calmly intuitive." The dialogue is sparse (two brief exchanges) but goal-driven and carries subtext—Haldr's request is efficient, Maren's reply withholds easy answers. Filter verbs ("she could see") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The phrase "the courageous anomaly" in the final third shifts briefly into external labeling, and "the world tilted one degree closer to mercy" elevates diction slightly above Maren's established register, though the effect supports the closure image. No unmotivated tense or stance shifts; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during mirror work, slightly wider in framing paragraphs).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the mirror sequence; each glimpse does double work (world-building and reframing stakes). Two minor loops: "The question hung between them still" (paragraph three) is paraphrased by "This was the moment. The weighted breath before reply" (final section), and "shadow" recurs as modifier across six paragraphs without reweighting meaning each time. The phrase "a courageous anomaly in a region that feared the dark" borders on expository summary, and "the world tilted one degree closer to mercy" elevates diction slightly but remains legible. No grammar, tense, or pronoun errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly (orchard to stone building to orchard). One stock metaphor: "ice floes ground against each other with sounds like old bones shifting in their sockets" is vivid but not fresh. The piece avoids purple prose and maintains momentum; the loops are minor and do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—a shadow-wielding peacekeeper who uses salvaged mirrors to read empathy—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy and moral psychology. The broken crystal fragment as a reminder of deliberate incompleteness is a strong, specific choice. However, the core conflict (sanction force vs. choose witness) maps closely to familiar peacemaker templates, and the emotional arc (empathy reveals hidden pain, prompting mercy) follows a well-worn path. The piece transforms the template through the mirror mechanics and the "darkness that illuminated" paradox, but the final turn (offering to show Haldr what she has seen) is foreshadowed and arrives without surprise. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, earning mid-band placement. The specificity of the mirrors and fragment prevents higher scores from being capped by derivative structure, but the emotional calculus remains predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren ("shadow-laced peacekeeper") is present throughout, frames the opening, performs the mirror ritual, and makes the final choice to offer witness instead of sanctioning force. She is signaled early (paragraph two), shapes the middle beat (mirror sequence reframes her understanding), and delivers the closure decision. Her choice alters tactics (from binary sanction/refuse to tertiary witness path) and forecloses the violence option with conceptual cost. However, the shadow itself is largely ornamental—it trails, pools, and clings but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action beyond metaphorical weight. The "darkness that illuminated" image in the final beat charges the closure but is more thematic resonance than causal pressure. The character drives the story, but the shadow trait is under-utilized as a mechanical force. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal fragment appears in paragraph six ("She reached into her coat and withdrew the broken crystal ball fragment she always carried"), is used in paragraph seven ("She held the fragment up to the mirror. Light passed through crystal into glass…"), and is referenced thematically in paragraph six ("a reminder that seeing clearly sometimes meant accepting incompleteness"). Setup and development gates are met; it shapes one key beat (the mirror-blazing moment) by refracting light to layer visions. However, it does not return in the closure and does not constrain Maren's final choice to Haldr. The fragment could be replaced with another light-refracting object (prism, lens) without structural loss. Its thematic work (incompleteness as method) is present but not causally tied to the decision. Specificity is moderate; cost connection is absent. Two-beat involvement and middle causal pressure push it above functional, but lack of closure participation and swappability cap it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named in paragraph two ("a courageous anomaly in a region that feared the dark") and echoed in the final section ("The courageous anomaly"). Setup gate is met. However, the concept does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—Maren's courage is asserted via the shadow-holding metaphor, but no scene tests her courage through a choice with visible cost. The "anomaly" is descriptive label rather than dramatized friction. The concept functions as theme claim, not plot driver. It is present and thematically coherent but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is established in paragraph five ("She was calmly intuitive, reading the mirrors' visions not with frenzy but with the steady patience…"). Setup gate is met. The trait manifests in her patient mirror-reading (middle beat) and in her measured reply to Haldr (closure beat). However, the trait is more descriptive coloring than constraint—there is no on-page cost to her calm, no moment where intuition fails or where patience must be chosen over urgency. The trait enables her method but does not force a tradeoff. It is functional but replaceable (a rushed peacekeeper could read mirrors too, with different pacing). Development and payoff are present but weak; causal pressure and cost are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" appears explicitly in paragraph seven ("She was trying to reconstitute the full picture. Not the crystal ball itself… But the truth it once held could be reassembled, piece by piece…"). Setup is late (past the 40% mark), which triggers a cap at 4.6 under the late-arrival rule. However, the action is functional: the mirror sequence (middle beat) enacts reconstitution by layering glimpses, and the reassembled truth (Southern Floe's fear) reframes Maren's choice and drives the closure decision. The action is thematically specific and causally meaningful. The mirrors could function without the "reconstitute" frame, making it partially swappable, but the piece teaches the method and pays it off. Development and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is direct. Late signal and moderate swappability lower the score, but beat involvement and causal work push it into mid-6s despite the cap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vintage store mirrors" are introduced in paragraph four ("seventeen vintage store mirrors, salvaged years ago from a merchant vessel"), used in paragraphs five through seven (the glimpsing ritual), and briefly reprised in the closure framing ("via these glimpses in vintage store mirrors" is implicit in her method). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The mirrors enable Maren's key action (reconstituting truth), constrain her method (she must use them to see what others cannot), and the visions they provide drive the middle beat and reframe the closure choice. The mirrors are irreplaceable—remove them and Maren has no means to access the empathic glimpses that change her decision. Specificity is high ("seventeen," "tarnished bronze and carved oak," "mottled with age"); cost connection is indirect (the mirrors require ritual patience). Two distinct beats (introduction, blazing moment) and strong causal pressure justify high-7s. Closure linkage is implicit rather than direct, preventing 8+ placement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard is anchored in the opening line and revisited in the closure beat (Maren returns to Haldr "through the orchard"). The setting frames the story spatially and provides atmosphere (frozen trees, cliff's edge, ice floes below). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the orchard does not constrain Maren's choice or supply resources that alter outcome—the decision to offer witness could occur in any location. The setting is vivid and coherent but does not pressure tactics. The ice floes provide sensory texture and thematic resonance (shifting, unstable) but do not mechanically affect the plot. Development gate is weak; causal pressure is absent. The setting is purposeful and integrated but ultimately decorative relative to the closure. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → final beat) and strong atmospheric work push it into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "weighted breath before reply" is named in the opening paragraph ("in the space between question and answer") and reprised in the final section ("This was the moment. The weighted breath before reply"). Setup and payoff gates are met. The frame shapes the story's structure: the entire piece unfolds in the pause between Haldr's question and Maren's answer, which tightens urgency and justifies the reflective middle beats (mirror ritual as decision-making process). However, the timeframe does not mechanically constrain Maren's tactics—she could take longer or shorter without plot consequence. The frame is conceptual rather than causal. Development gate is weak; the "breath" is more metaphorical pacing than live clock. Lyric reprise and structural coherence push it into mid-6s, but lack of mechanical pressure and swappability (the pause could be "the hour before dawn" or similar) prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is articulated in paragraph five ("her task was to map that empathy onto action") and enacted in the mirror sequence (paragraphs five through seven) and the closure choice (offering witness). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The motivation drives Maren's method (she reads mirrors to understand all sides) and her final decision (she chooses the harder path of shared sight over easy refusal). The motivation is specific and causally meaningful. However, it is largely told rather than dramatized through friction—there is no on-page moment where empathy conflicts with another want or where mapping fails. The motivation is coherent and integral but not tested under pressure. Two-beat involvement (mirror ritual, closure choice) and causal pressure justify mid-6s; lack of visible conflict or cost connection caps it below 7.</comment>
