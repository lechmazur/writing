<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is rendered through craft-specific perception ("reading color the way others read faces") and embodied sensation ("a second rhythm beneath her own, quietly explosive"). The protagonist demonstrates genuine internal contradiction—thirty years of caution meeting Ren's urgency—that drives the palm-to-sternum moment at closure. Minor slip: the "morpho as clock/compass/text" triad feels slightly over-articulated for a dye master's thought process, edging toward authorial framing rather than character-specific cognition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Sable, tea house, post-surgery) within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through repeated observation of the morpho wing across nine mornings, culminating in the transparency moment that reweights the donor-heart question. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sable's dual rhythms merge and she shifts from observer to story-gatherer, with the cost felt in the thirty-year practice she's now willing to abandon. The "stories, as if they had been waiting, began to gather" delivers a clean RR with palpable cost—she's foreclosed her former watchful distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house, thermal updrafts, chain-groan, and cloud-soaked cedar build a micro-setting that recurs purposefully. The morpho wing functions as object-as-setting: Sable pins it to the cedar post, uses it as her "clock, compass, text," and its shifting hues under light constrain her daily observation ritual. The transparency moment at precise angle charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (wing to window, wing to post, palm to sternum) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "why some people magnetize stories while others...pass through the world like clear water through silk." The accumulative pressure tightens through nine mornings of wing observation, each angle "unlocking a different shade," building to the transparency beat where "blue dissolved entirely." Agency manifests as renunciation with cost: Sable abandons her thirty-year dye-master caution to write "what the light had made her feel," foreclosing the watchful stance. One meaningful deepening that narrows options and delivers visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the morpho's structural iridescence becomes the organizing principle for understanding how stories gather. "Not by force but by structure...angled correctly, open to the full spectrum" answers the magnetism question without stating a moral. The final image—Sable writing feeling rather than observation—offers a resonant non-literal answer. "The willingness to disappear inside the light" reweights the entire inquiry with earned complexity. Minor note: "quietly explosive" as descriptor for Ren's heart rhythm borders on authorial thematics, but the phrase does generate friction with Sable's caution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited throughout; psychic distance is controlled and consistent. Perceptual signature is sharp and craft-specific: "reading color," "mordant and fiber," "argument for blue that no dye could replicate." Diction stays within a dye master's lexicon with purposeful elevation ("iridescent caution," "structural...not pigmented") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. The prose modulates appropriately from technical observation to the softer final beat without register break. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("basalt platforms drifted on thermal updrafts, tethered loosely by iron chains that groaned"). The morpho description avoids purple prose while remaining vivid. Minor friction: "She began, by tracking sun trails through the valley each morning, to map how light moved" uses an awkward mid-sentence prepositional interrupt that slightly stalls momentum. The final paragraph's "merge into something she could not name but recognized" edges toward conceptual abstraction, though it remains anchored in the palm-to-sternum gesture. No loops or scaffold detected; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of donor-heart mysticism, dye-master craft knowledge, and structural iridescence as metaphor for story magnetism feels specific and non-obvious. The morpho wing as teaching device transforms a familiar "object as lesson" trope through Sable's professional lens. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending cohere well, though the central metaphor (light-structure-as-aliveness) is somewhat predictable once the wing appears. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging, and the closure follows inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's watchfulness drives all nine mornings of observation and her final choice to write feeling rather than color. Her dye-master habit of "observing reactions between mordant and fiber before committing a single drop" directly enables the methodical tracking that produces the transparency insight. The closure turn—opening the journal to write—is a decision that alters her thirty-year practice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing is introduced early (morning tea with Oku), handled in at least three beats (window rotation, pinned to cedar post as clock/compass, final transparency moment), and its evolving meaning charges the closure. The shift from cerulean brilliance to invisibility at precise angle is causally essential to Sable's realization that "the willingness to disappear inside the light" is the answer. Removing the wing would collapse the story's central mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is named once but operationalized throughout: the morpho's "brilliance was not invitation but warning," and Sable's thirty-year watchful practice embodies caution. The concept shapes her tactics (slow, methodical observation) and reappears transformed at closure when she recognizes both rhythms merging. The transparency beat literalizes the concept's stakes: visibility and invisibility as tactical choices, not fixed traits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is introduced as the donor heart's second rhythm and recurs at closure when both pulses merge. The attribute constrains Sable's experience (she feels it "most at dawn") and enables the final recognition. Cost is visible: she abandons her cautious stance. The attribute could be slightly more embodied in middle beats—it's named twice but not dramatized in micro-choices between those moments.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Illuminate" governs the entire middle section: Sable tracks sun trails, watches light "illuminate [the wing] in stages," and the precise angle where "the light struck it" produces the transparency insight. The action is signaled early and mechanics matter—different hours unlock different shades. The final turn ("what the light had made her feel") directly traces to this repeated action. Swapping for another verb (e.g., "observe") would weaken the light-structure metaphor and break thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By tracking sun trails through the valley each morning" is explicitly named and drives the method: Sable maps "how light moved across the tea house at different hours," pinning the wing to watch "the sun illuminate it in stages." The nine-morning structure depends on this tracking. Mechanics are clear—angle and hour determine hue—and the method produces the transparency moment that enables closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is introduced early with vivid detail (basalt platforms, thermal updrafts, chain-groan, cedar walls). It provides the elevated vantage for tracking sun trails and houses the morpho wing. Oku's refilling tea without asking supports the contemplative rhythm. The setting enables rather than pressures choices—it's a contemplation space, not a constraint. Micro-setting (the cedar post where the wing is pinned) does more causal work than the tea house itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The post-surgery timeframe is established in paragraph one and motivates the quest to understand Ren. The "nine mornings" structure creates a mini-clock that tracks accumulation. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency—Sable could observe for five or fifteen mornings with similar effect. The donor-heart backstory primes the dual-rhythm closure image but doesn't pressure tactics in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to learn "why some people magnetize stories while others...pass through the world like clear water" is stated early and drives every observation beat. Sable's sketching "fragments of Ren's life" alongside color shifts shows friction between inherited urgency and her own caution. The cost is dramatized at closure: writing feeling rather than observation means abandoning the dye-master identity that defined thirty years. The motivation is conflicted (caution vs. Ren's pull) and resolved through visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is established in the opening image ("mist altered every hue it touched") and sustained through cloud-soak, thermal updrafts, and the recurring "mist returned, softening the valley into silence." Tone modulates appropriately: contemplative patience in the observation beats, then a quiet intensification at the transparency moment without breaking into declarative triumph. The final image—stories gathering as mist returns—charges wonder with earned cost. Tone and theme are indivisible here.</comment>
