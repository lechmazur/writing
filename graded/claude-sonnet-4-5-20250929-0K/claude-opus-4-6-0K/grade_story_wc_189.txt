<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, grounded in her eleven years of observation. Her decision to show rather than argue is embodied through the molt-watching scene and the jade cicada handling. The secondary character Dao is given genuine interiority ("his expression was not bureaucratic. It was grieved") and applies immediate pressure. Minor slip: the "warmly observant" phrase feels slightly over-articulated for peak pressure, but the embodied choices (setting down the cicada, moving to the pool) earn the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by line three (grotto, Maren, tidal pools, eleven years). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered observations and the cicada motif, deepening rather than reversing in a causal chain. Closure is Charged Poise—"watch with me" crystallizes options and reconfigures the relationship with undeniable pressure; the felt cost is Maren's vulnerability in inviting collaboration after loss. The jade cicada's shift from private talisman to shared offering between them charges the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when Dao moves from bureaucratic messenger to grieved ally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto's physicality—ceiling worn away, starlight columns, tidal rhythm—constrains both the temporal frame and Maren's demonstration. The crab molt pool is a micro-setting that becomes the story's hinge: its location ("eastern wall where three shafts of starlight converged") and the molt's vulnerability charge the thematic lesson. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Maren notices anemone survival and hermit-crab trades, while Dao watches the blenny. The tide's physical pull in the final beat ("faint pull of water around her boots") grounds the metaphorical transition in bodily sensation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Maren's research continuation—is signaled in the first exchange and tested when she chooses demonstration over argument. The tightening occurs when Dao reveals he came "to help you find another way," converting obstacle to potential ally. Agency is clear: Maren's decision to show the molt rather than plead is a tactical choice with visible cost (vulnerability, time spent in persuasion rather than work). The crab's emergence provides external pressure that mirrors and validates her internal commitment. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length and executed through protagonist choice under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—transition as the essential texture of time—emerges wholly from the molt scene, the cicada's underground-to-emergence arc, and Maren's practiced attention to "the in-between." The final image ("watch with me") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: understanding begins in shared observation of fragile passages. No moralizing; the crab's trembling new skin and the cicada's wings "aimed at the stars" work as earned image rather than symbol. Subtext operates in Dao's grief, the jade placed "between them," and the grotto "breathing in." The piece resists tidy resolution—collaboration is proposed, not guaranteed—and the thematic question (how to sustain work that records fragility) is reweighted rather than solved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren with controlled access to Dao via external cues. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices molt-seams and equinox algae, not abstractions. Diction is character-specific ("everything important happens in the in-between," "time had texture—rough seasons and smooth ones"). Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext: "You came all this way" reads his posture; "Then watch with me" is invitation and test. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority (jade in pocket) to wider framing (grotto breathing). No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: long sensory passages in the grotto description, clipped exchanges during the funding reveal, then the slowed molt observation. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (cicada backstory primes the closure image while revealing character history). Minor loop: "the pause resumed, but it had changed shape" and the later "Dao was quiet for a long moment" feel like synonym variants of held silence. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final beat ("That's where it always starts") lands with clarity and momentum. Figurative language (time as grain, grotto as stone mouth) is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler frame is specific and the "texture of time" formulation feels fresh. The cicada's dual function—patience token and emergence symbol—avoids symbolic convenience by appearing early and being handled twice. Risk: the piece commits to a quiet, observational register and earns its ending through demonstration rather than confrontation. The molt as persuasion vehicle is a non-obvious synthesis. Minor proximity concern: the cicada-as-waiting motif echoes common craft-essay territory, though the execution through jade object and grandmother's voice personalizes it. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on this grotto, this cicada, this specific loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as tidal-pool chronicler frames every choice: she reads Dao's posture as she would read anemone survival, decides to "show him a transition in progress," and selects the molt pool with practiced knowledge. The trait enables her persuasive tactic (demonstration over argument) and her final invitation. Present by line one, drives the middle choice (moving to the eastern wall pool), and shapes closure ("watch with me" as extension of her chronicling practice). Causal pressure is clear; the story would collapse without this exact occupation and skill set.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jade cicada appears early (Maren touches it in pocket), is explained via grandmother's teaching (cicadas understand waiting, emerge into changed worlds), held up to starlight mid-scene, then "set...between them" at closure with "wings aimed at the stars"—a charged repositioning from private talisman to shared offering. Three beats, reweighted meaning at end. It enables her thematic explanation and participates in closure image. Strong integration, but the cicada does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it illustrates rather than pressures. Swappability test: another patience token (acorn, seed) could work with edits, though cicada's molt-echo is apt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transition periods dominate: opening assertion ("everything important happens in the in-between"), the conversation's "slack water between tides," the molt itself, and Maren's life work recording "the passage itself." The concept shapes stakes directly—her funding loss threatens her ability to chronicle transitions. It alters tactics: she chooses to demonstrate a transition rather than argue abstractly. The crab's emergence is transition made visible with cost (vulnerability, time). Closure hinges on inviting Dao into her practice of watching transitions. Setup early, drives middle choice, charges ending. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" appears once as narrative label when Maren reads Dao's grief. The trait enables her to perceive his posture shift and choose demonstration over confrontation. It's consistent with her chronicler practice (she notices what others miss) and implied throughout via her grotto knowledge and cicada handling. However, on-page cost is thin: the warmth does not visibly constrain or complicate a choice. Functional use in one key beat (reading Dao's grief), early signal via her knowledge base, but no tradeoff scene where warmth conflicts with another need.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Foresee appears explicitly: "Maren could foresee, through a kind of tangential approach...how this might unfold." Her foresight drives the choice not to argue but to demonstrate, predicting that showing the molt will speak more effectively. The action enables the middle turn (moving to the pool) and sets up closure (the invitation to watch together). Present in the pivotal beat, causally active, but the mechanics are stated rather than shown through micro-cues. Swappability moderate: "anticipated" or "intuited" would work with minor edits, though "foresee" ties to her pattern-reading skill.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tangential approach is signaled explicitly ("through a kind of tangential approach that had always served her better than direct confrontation") and immediately enacted: Maren avoids arguing for funding and instead shows the molt. The method shapes her tactic throughout the ending sequence and distinguishes her persuasive style from direct advocacy. It's a character-specific problem-solving mode tied to her chronicler practice. Present by two-thirds mark, drives closure choice, though the label feels slightly over-articulated. Mechanics matter and the method is irreplaceable—removing it would flatten her choice into generic demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ancient grotto supplies the molt pools, starlight columns that converge on the eastern wall pool, and the tidal rhythm that pressures the conversation's timeframe. Maren's encyclopedic knowledge of "which anemones had survived" depends on this exact setting. The grotto's ceiling gaps focus starlight on the molt, making it visible for demonstration. The rising tide in the final beat ("faint pull of water around her boots, the ancient grotto breathing in") adds urgency and cycles the transition theme. Setup immediate, enables middle demonstration, charges closure. Environment constrains choices and supplies the persuasive resource. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is "the pause in a difficult conversation"—explicitly marked ("The silence that followed was not empty. It was a transition") and tracked through beats: funding reveal, Maren's pocket-cicada touch, Dao's confession, the decision to show the molt, the crab's minutes-long emergence, Dao's offer, and the invitation. The pause tightens options (low tide window is finite, implied by "the tide was turning") and the molt's real-time unfolding creates urgency. Clock is felt rather than counted, but it alters moves: Maren uses the remaining slack-water time to persuade. Present across all beats, drives pacing, contributes to ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to discover (or preserve access to discovering) the texture of time is dramatized through her refusal to stop work, her choice to demonstrate a transition, and her final invitation to "watch with me." The motivation conflicts with practical loss (funding gone) and social risk (vulnerability in sharing her method). Grandmother's cicada teaching roots the desire in character history. Want is tested on the page via the decision not to argue but to show, and the cost is exposure—offering collaboration after solitary work. Setup early (eleven years, journals, cicada), drives middle choice, charges closure with friction between autonomy and need for help.</comment>
