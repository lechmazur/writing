<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, grounded in her arcane linguistics expertise filtering perception. Her choice to write the letter using covenant-language structure demonstrates internal contradiction (professional method applied to personal failure) acted simultaneously rather than summarized. The final micro-choice—placing the ink well back, then mailing the letter despite fear—earns the stance shift with visible cost (risking rejection after four years). Minor deduction: Elara remains an off-page construct; the relationship crucible operates through memory and inference rather than on-page pressure between two present characters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Causal: Maren's study of covenant languages motivates the promise-structure method, which narrows her tactical options from apology to interconnected architecture, and the decision to mail the letter forecloses silence with felt cost (the "bright, terrified hope"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes her stance shift from professional silence to personal translation, with the cost undeniable in "cautious exuberance" and the risk of the letter arriving "just in time or not at all." One meaningful tightening through the письмо composition suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive setting supplies vivid, selective detail (vaulted chamber, seventeenth-century Venetian ink well with "milky striations," scrolls and tablets) filtered through Maren's professional priorities. The borrowed ink well constrains her choice twice: she uses it ceremonially, then returns it "with the tenderness of someone returning a borrowed heartbeat," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (reading desk, shelf, door, corridor climb). Minor gap: the archive's "dead languages whispering" nears overt symbolism, and occupational detail (phonemic decay patterns, Hittite covenant languages) enhances texture without directly altering the present conflict's options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: restore trust before paths diverge permanently (Elara's departure tomorrow). One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren shifts from obeying silence to writing the promise-structure letter, narrowing her options from safety to risk. The final choice—mailing the letter knowing it "would arrive just in time or not at all"—forecloses the passive stance with visible cost (exposure to rejection after four years). Agency is decision with on-page cost; the protagonist drives the turn. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens through her translation work leading to the letter's architecture leading to the mailing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: translation as a method for human connection, trust rebuilt through architectural interdependence rather than apology. The ink well and covenant-language structure function as motifs that constrain choice (she needs something "beautiful and fragile" to "keep her honest"; the promise method shapes every line). The ending offers a non-literal answer—"the living, too, deserve translation"—that reweights the premise without moralizing. "Symphonies of truth" as polyphonic dissonance ("both of those things are true at the same time") integrates through Maren's internal conflict. Subtext operates in the letter's structure, the borrowed artifact, and the climb toward daylight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maren; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during letter composition, pulling back for final corridor ascent). Perceptual signature is distinct: professional linguist filtering emotion through language structures ("emotional geometries," "symphonies of truth," "thickening like sediment"). Diction remains character-consistent; elevated register ("arcane linguist," "phonemic decay patterns") suits her scholarly voice. Compression is purposeful ("carefully reckless, as she was in all things that mattered"). No dialogue present to assess. Minor note: "the bright, terrified hope of someone who has finally spoken" nears articulation of theme, but remains grounded in embodied state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme (e.g., the ink well description carries both setting and metaphor). Clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold detected. Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction nears overwriting ("vaulted chamber where dead tongues were preserved," "the courage to let contradictory notes sound together") without crossing into opacity, and one paraphrase near-loop in the final third ("cautious exuberance" restated as "bright, terrified hope"). Metaphor coherence holds; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: applying arcane linguistics (Hittite covenant-language structure) to personal reconciliation transforms the estranged-siblings premise through specific, verifiable occupational detail. The ink well as borrowed heartbeat and promises as "interconnected...threads in a larger weave" avoid cliché through concrete anchoring. Emotional truth (both rejection and non-rejection are true simultaneously) resists tidy resolution. Minor constraint: the archive-as-metaphor frame and final "the living, too, deserve translation" epiphany approach familiar territory; transformation arises more from execution specificity than premise novelty. No proximity echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (arcane linguist) appears throughout; her expertise shapes tactics (using covenant-language promise structure) and drives the key turn (writing and mailing the letter). Her professional lens filters all perception and constrains the method she chooses. Present in setup, middle (letter composition), and closure (mailing decision). Cost is legible: applying dead-language architecture to living reconciliation risks failure. Swappability test: a different occupation could replace the method, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Glass ink well appears twice with evolving use: borrowed for the letter-writing (first beat, ceremonial dipping), then returned to shelf "with the tenderness of someone returning a borrowed heartbeat" (second beat, charged action). Its fragility mirrors Maren's risk ("something that could break if she pressed too hard"). Contributes to closure tone but does not decisively shape the ending's stakes. Present in setup, middle use, and pre-closure return. Specificity (Venetian, seventeenth-century, milky striations) anchors it, but removing it would not break story logic—another meaningful object could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" (core concept) frames Maren's understanding of languages as "polyphonic, dissonant, resolved only through...letting contradictory notes sound together." This shapes her letter's structure: she refuses to "collapse one [truth] into the other," writing six interdependent promises. The concept enables her tactic and charges the thematic question. Present in setup exposition, applied in middle composition, echoed in closure reflection. Does not directly alter physical options or impose a felt cost, trending toward thematic illustration rather than stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" appears once as a character summary ("as she was in all things that mattered") when borrowing the ink well without permission. The trait is labeled but not tested under pressure; the borrowing itself carries no on-page consequence or trade-off. Not present in closure. Ornamental use; easily removable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is the stated goal ("unsnarl the knot between them") that organizes the middle section: Maren applies linguistic method to decode the silence, then writes the letter as her unsnarling tactic. The action drives the key turn (from silence to structured promises) and shapes closure (mailing the letter to unsnarl before divergence). Present in setup stake, middle execution, and closure attempt. Specificity: the method she chooses (promise architecture) embodies the unsnarling. Removing this action would require re-framing the entire conflict.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Via interconnected promises" is signaled early (Hittite covenant languages: "oaths...as interconnected promises, each one dependent on the others"), demonstrated in the middle (six promises structuring the letter), and shapes closure (the letter as a "careful architecture" she mails). The method constrains her tactics: she cannot write a simple apology; each promise must weave with the others. Mechanics matter: "A single broken strand would unravel the whole cloth." Cost is visible in the risk that Elara may not recognize the structure. Essential across beats; removal would collapse the letter's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Extinct Language Archive provides vivid setting (lowest level of the Athenaeum, vaulted chamber, scrolls and tablets) and professional context. The archive supplies the ink well Maren borrows and hums around her at closure. It does not pressure her choices directly; the letter could be written elsewhere. Micro-setting note: the borrowed artifact and reading desk anchor the writing beat, but the broader archive functions more as atmospheric container than tactical constraint. Present in setup, middle location, and closure backdrop. Postcard description with thematic echo ("dead languages") but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" (timeframe) is explicit: Elara leaves for Reykjavik tomorrow; Maren has been offered a permanent position. The deadline tightens Maren's decision to write now rather than maintain silence. Time alters tactics: she addresses the envelope "knowing it would arrive just in time or not at all," charging the final image. Present in setup, shapes middle urgency, and participates in closure consequence. The clock is live and narrows options. Minor constraint: the four-year backstory anchor is stronger than the tomorrow deadline in driving emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To restore trust after silence" is dramatized throughout: Maren's goal anchors the setup ("needed to unsnarl the knot"), drives middle choices (structuring promises as trust architecture), and charges closure (mailing the letter with "cautious exuberance" despite fear of Elara's response). Friction between want (reconciliation) and cost (exposure to rejection after obeying "Don't write back" for four years) is on the page. The motivation is tested, not merely declared. Present in setup, middle composition, and closure risk. Visible cost: foreclosing the safety of continued silence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" appears explicitly in the final paragraph ("one moment of cautious exuberance—the bright, terrified hope") and modulates through the piece: Maren's controlled risk-taking (borrowing the ink well, choosing the promise method), the letter's careful architecture, and the tentative hope at closure. Tone is coherent and charges the final image. However, the label is stated rather than solely embodied, and earlier beats read more as quiet determination than exuberance. Tone shifts purposefully under pressure (ceremonial composition, tender return of artifact, climb toward daylight) but "exuberance" as such is concentrated in the closure beat.</comment>
