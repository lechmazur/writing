<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naima's interior is concrete and specific throughout, driven by trauma-rooted contradictions (geode as heartbeat substitute, exhilaration described as "bleak"). Her hunt for stillness emerges organically from survivor guilt without diagnostic labels. The scholarship panel moment embodies her split effectively: "my unique perspective is that I know what a human body sounds like when it becomes part of a pressure wave" versus the sanitized response she gives. Minor slip: the wedding memory feels slightly performed rather than involuntarily triggered, and the final action (returning to work) lacks a visible micro-choice that shows cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers scientific observation, memory, and metaphor toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Naima consciously commits to "mapping reservoirs of quiet" as her life's work—a Charged Poise moment. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (floating observatory, Naima alone, geode). The closure reweights the opening's "bruise suspended in heaven" into "a sky that was, against all evidence, more still than violent." Cost is conceptual and felt: she accepts that her proof will never restore Rasha but can reframe destruction's place in the universe. One deduction: the 47-minute countdown structure promises urgency but the circuit-breaker mechanics don't constrain her work—she completes her logging with time to spare, so the deadline doesn't genuinely narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory's power-cycle rhythm (thermal limiters, cooldown light) structures the entire piece and the geode is handled twice with evolving meaning. Spatial choreography is clean; the console/emergency lighting/arrays are legibly positioned. The amethyst catching red light is purposeful and charges the final image. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the floating-above-clouds detail is vivid but never pressures a choice—Naima could conduct this work in a ground lab with identical stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prove that stillness exists and is mappable, redeeming her survival. The perturbation-theory sequence provides one meaningful deepening—third-order terms reveal the pattern—and her frantic logging before arrays reboot adds urgency. The piece enters the 7+ band because her choice to publish carries implicit cost (exposing her grief publicly, committing to this mission). Held under 8.0 because no live option is visibly foreclosed; her decision feels confirmatory rather than a turn that eliminates an alternate path she was weighing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—energy that chooses stillness over violence—emerges entirely through the geode's inward-growing crystals, the perturbation math, and Rasha's laugh "which no instrument could detect." The final image ("more still than violent, more held than broken") answers the opening's "bruise suspended in heaven" without stating a moral. No thematic echo or label-speak. The piece resists tidy resolution: Naima's proof won't prevent future weddings from burning, yet the math is real. Reaches high 8s because the conceptual repricing is undeniable and rooted in on-page particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "intangibly tangible," "bleak exhilaration," the missile's "pressure wave arriving three seconds after it had already unmade everything." Diction stays controlled even at peaks—no therapy-speak, no register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the data-capture sprint. One minor slip holds it under 8.5: "the awful thrill of understanding something the universe had not meant to reveal" slightly elevates into cosmic-narrator register, though recoverable as Naima's own grandiosity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, information density is high, no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but coherent: geode-as-heartbeat, crystals-as-proof, sky-opening sound. Two issues prevent 8+: "the engineering so precise it appeared effortless, though everything inside strained against collapse" stacks three metaphoric vehicles (engineering/effortlessness/collapse) in one sentence without clarifying the tenor. Second, "a phenomenon that registered on every instrument yet could not be isolated, collected, or held" is synonym churn—isolated/collected/held overlap without added nuance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: using astrophysics perturbation theory as a survivor's grief response is non-obvious and specific. The geode's inward-growth as counterpoint to explosion avoids symbolic convenience because it's introduced early and used throughout. Transformation test passes: the plot would collapse if you swapped "floating observatory + perturbation theory" for "ground hospital + trauma counseling." Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the refusal to dramatize the wedding directly both pay off. Held under 8.5 because the refugee-to-scholarship arc, while earned, follows a familiar template (survivor gains elite access, uses it to reframe trauma).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Naima is present throughout and her survivor status drives every beat. Her choices—logging coordinates faster, deciding to publish—alter tactics and commit her to a path. Appears in the opening hook and closure. Scores mid-7s because her decisions are confirmatory (she was always going to do this work) rather than a turn between competing live options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Geode appears in four beats: Dr. Kassar's gift with explanation, carried through camps, held to emergency light twice (once mid-story, once at closure). Its inward-crystal property directly explains her motivation and the final "reservoirs of quiet" metaphor. Removing it would break thematic coherence. Scores mid-8s because it's handled but not manipulated under pressure—she never uses it as a tool, only contemplates it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is signaled ("her unfiltered awakening: the recognition that stillness was not absence") and shapes her realization that potential pools exist. It charges the closure by framing her choice to publish as a revelation she cannot unsee. Scores mid-6s because the phrasing itself is abstract and slightly ornamental; the story would function identically if that exact phrase were cut, as the awakening content is already embedded in the math and geode.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced early ("something she could only describe as intangibly tangible") and constrains her method: she must use instruments yet cannot isolate samples. It reappears at closure ("the data was intangibly tangible, real enough to chart yet impossible to hold"). The paradox drives her reliance on perturbation theory expansions. Reaches 7+ because it's causally necessary to her approach and appears in closure, though the term itself feels slightly like prompt-fulfillment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hunt structures the entire 47-minute sequence and is named explicitly: "Forty-seven minutes to hunt." Her quarry—potential pools—defines the stakes and the perturbation-theory method. The hunt succeeds on-page (she logs coordinates) and her choice to publish is the hunt's culmination. Scores low-8s because the hunt itself is cerebral; no false leads or tactical shifts complicate it—she simply executes the method until the data appears.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named and its mechanics shown: "first-order terms showed nothing unusual. The second-order terms hinted at asymmetry. By the third order, patterns emerged." The method is not swappable—another technique wouldn't yield the same nested-structure proof. Caps at high-6s because it's introduced past the 25% mark and the reader doesn't see her choose this method over alternatives; it's presented as her established approach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observatory is anchored in the opening and its power-cycle rhythm governs the entire timeline. The thermal limiters and circuit breakers create the 47-minute window, and the arrays' reboot forces her sprint to save data. Environment is causally load-bearing. Reaches mid-7s because the floating-above-clouds detail, while atmospheric, doesn't alter her tactics—ground-based work would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The 47-minute cooldown window is established early and tracked: "She had eleven minutes left... Seven minutes." It tightens her data-logging and adds urgency to the save sequence. The arrays' surge back online provides the ending's sensory closure. Scores high-7s because the clock shapes her tempo but doesn't force a hard choice—she completes the work with margin, so the deadline doesn't genuinely foreclose an option.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized through Dr. Kassar's geode lesson ("See how the crystals grow inward? The energy doesn't escape. It pools") and internalized: "to find where unused potential pools... perhaps destruction was not inevitable." Friction appears in the scholarship interview where she must sanitize her true motive. The perturbation work and publication choice are direct enactments of this desire. High-8s because it's causally central and shapes every beat, though the wedding memory's emotional cost is told more than shown in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named explicitly and enacted: "the awful thrill of understanding something the universe had not meant to reveal." Tone modulates from the bruise-sky opening through data-sprint intensity to the quiet-resolve ending. The oxymoron charges the closure where mappable stillness coexists with irretrievable loss. Low-8s because the tone is consistent and purposeful, though a slightly broader tonal range during the memory beats (raw grief without the exhilaration overlay) would deepen the contrast.</comment>
