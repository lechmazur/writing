<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, driven by inherited practice and professional competence. Her motivation to "salvage something pure" is embodied through her handling of the snow globe and weaving of dream fragments. Internal conflict is present but mild—the grandmother's warning about weaving truth carefully never materializes as a genuine on-page struggle or cost that complicates her choices. The ending choice to expose the truth feels determined rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored early). The piece follows a single continuous scene at the shrine with embedded reflection/backstory that tilts present stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Maren commits to exposing the truth with visible cost (carrying forty-three names, the long walk out) and the final image reweights her mission with borrowed starlight. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—dream fragments accrue, the shrine amplifies, and the final cadence shift ("carrying borrowed starlight...forty-three whispered names") reweights the stake. However, the middle escalation is mild; the dreams arrive unbidden without a causal tightening driven by Maren's choices, and the cost at closure, while felt, remains somewhat abstract rather than a hard forfeiture of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with candle flames, blue-white ice refracting light, and the breathing glacier. Setting details are filtered through Maren's professional and inherited lens (tools, amplification metaphor). The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, charged at the altar and handled twice with reweighted meaning at the end. The shrine's exhalation and candle-flame behavior subtly guide the ritual without forcing symbolic convenience, and the final image of carrying borrowed starlight charges the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: expose the sabotage and contamination data through verified dream-patterns. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren's own unbidden dream arrives, adding a new thread and raising the emotional cost. Agency is present—she chooses to analyze, to listen, to expose carefully—but the escalation is largely contemplative; the dreams come to her rather than through a choice that narrows options. The resolution is earned by her stance crystallization (weaving truth carefully) with felt cost (carrying forty-three names, the long walk), though the price remains more conceptual than a hard trade-off that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: salvaging purity from wreckage, truth as a careful weave, and borrowed starlight as a metaphor for indirect illumination. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth held up to the light like glass—without stating a moral. The melted snow globe and candle flames recur purposefully, reweighting prior material. Minor slip: the grandmother's warning ("weaves truth carefully, or truth weaves you") reads as a thematic echo that borders on thesis statement, though it is mitigated by being attributed to a character rather than the narrator.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. Narrative certainty matches what Maren can know; her perceptual signature is distinctive (diver's pragmatism, inherited ritual logic). Diction is purposeful and consistent—"borrowed starlight," "apertures where one consciousness pressed against another"—with no register drift. Minor slip: "a cold and distant luminance that belonged to no sun she knew" edges toward elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds Maren's established interior register under pressure, though the effect supports atmosphere and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, specific, and propulsive. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, world, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally without template cadence. Minor scaffold detected: "She weaves truth carefully, her grandmother always warned" is a near-paraphrase of the opening exposition about her grandmother's teaching, and the two-sentence structure "Not treasure, not glory. Just the clean, undeniable shape..." reads as a slight rhetorical flourish that slows momentum at a reflective beat. No loops touch the closure image, and figurative language (borrowed starlight, glass animals as data) remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—wreck-diver ghost whisperer using dream cameos to expose sabotage—is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The melted snow globe as forensic evidence and the glacier shrine as amplifier are fresh, purposeful details. The core concept of "windows of connection" transforms familiar ghost-story tropes through the mechanics of dream analysis and inherited practice. Minor limitation: the emotional arc (determined investigator exposes truth) follows a familiar trajectory without bold structural risk or a non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate originality into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren appears throughout and her professional role (wreck-diver, ghost whisperer) frames the story. Her choices to set the snow globe on the altar, close her eyes, and commit to careful exposure create key turns. However, the most decisive moment—receiving the unbidden dream—arrives passively rather than through a choice that alters tactics, limiting the character's active causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The melted snow globe is handled in three beats: placed on the altar, touched during the dream sequence, and wrapped at the end with reweighted meaning (evidence, not ornament). Its physical properties (fused by impossible heat) are causally significant, and its transformation from wreckage to evidence charges the closure image. Setup is early, development shapes the ritual beat, and payoff is present in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Windows of connection shape the story's logic and method: cameo appearances in strangers' dreams are the investigative tool. The concept is explained early and demonstrated through Dag and the captain's dream fragments. However, it functions primarily as method/worldbuilding rather than constraining an on-page choice or creating visible cost; Maren does not struggle with the limits or risks of this connection, and the concept does not reweight options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated twice (grandmother's warning, Maren's final commitment) and frames her approach. It constrains her method—building a case "so precise that no one could dismiss it"—but the cost of this care is not dramatized on the page; we do not see Maren sacrifice speed, safety, or a simpler path. The trait remains more label than enacted tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expose" is the story's dominant goal, signaled early and resolved at closure when Maren commits to exposing the sabotage. However, the action itself is prospective—she will expose—rather than enacted within the story window. The major turns (analyzing journals, visiting the shrine, receiving the unbidden dream) lead toward exposure but do not dramatize the act itself, making it structural but not irreplaceable in scene.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams is the story's central method, signaled early (three months of analyzing dream journals) and demonstrated through specific examples (Dag as waiter, captain reading blank book). The mechanics matter: dream fragments are threads woven into a tapestry. The method is present at closure (the unbidden dream) and shapes Maren's investigative tactics throughout, though the shrine visit does not deepen or complicate the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is richly detailed (candle flames, blue-white ice, breathing exhalation) and provides the story's spatial anchor. It functions as amplifier for the water-dead and supplies the ritual frame (altar, votives, glacier's exhalation). However, the setting does not constrain Maren's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome; the dreams would likely come regardless of location, making the shrine atmospheric rather than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated explicitly and frames Maren's repeated dives and careful method. The desire is present at closure ("the clean, undeniable shape of what actually happened") and drives her commitment to precision. However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized through on-page friction; Maren does not face a choice where salvaging purity conflicts with another need, limiting the felt cost of this want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears in the opening paragraph (candles refracting through ice) and returns at closure ("carrying borrowed starlight in her chest"), creating a purposeful tonal frame. The tone—cold, distant luminance; indirect illumination—coheres with the theme of truth salvaged from wreckage and modulates with pressure (the glacier's exhalation, the candle flames steadying). The reprise charges the final image, making the tone structural rather than ornamental.</comment>
