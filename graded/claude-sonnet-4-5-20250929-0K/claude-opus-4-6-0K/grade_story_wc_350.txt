<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is established through distinct traits—choral librarian, empathetically decisive—and her motivation is clear. Internal contradiction appears in "empathetically decisive" (holding grief while acting), but this remains more label than embodied tension in key beats. The cuckoo weight gesture and activation sequence show micro-choices, yet the climax itself is observation rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final act—closing her eyes, listening—reads passive; no on-page choice alters her trajectory or sacrifices an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through interwoven choirs, the carillon test, and the borrowed-starlight atmosphere, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tower sings, the city answers). Closure lands on the page with felt cost—eleven years of silence broken—and the final image reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening (the test succeeds) is sufficient at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clock tower, grain elevators, and borrowed starlight filter create vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The dome's cracked resin and the workbench beside drive chains ground action. The cuckoo weight, placed twice, and the digital relay constrain Maren's choices and charge the final image when the weight vibrates with the carillon's pulse. Sensory detail (dust shaking, brass warming) reflects urgency and ties to closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making the tower sing to bridge the community—is signaled early and tightens once when Maren activates the carillon. That single pressure point narrows options (the test either works or fails) and the outcome lands on the page with felt community response. However, the protagonist does not face a trade-off or make a choice under duress at the climax; she presses a button and listens. Agency reads as execution rather than decision that forecloses a live alternative, holding the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—bridging division through layered song—emerges from the carillon's multilingual cascade and the grain elevators as resonators. The cuckoo weight seed ("small, steady forces") returns at the end, reweighting prior material. Yet the final paragraph risks stating the theme ("eleven years of silence finally, vigorously, tenderly break") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The piece invites reflection but edges toward assertion where implication would suffice, preventing entry to the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; no head-hopping. Diction is distinct—"empathetically decisive," "borrowed starlight," "bridges from silos"—and reflects Maren's choral-librarian lexicon. Perceptual signature (music as language beneath languages, silence as broken connection) shapes what she notices. Compression is purposeful, and rhythm modulates with the carillon's activation. No filter stacks or register drift in peak beats; voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and clarity holds. Minor scaffold appears: "It was not coldness; it was the understanding…" and "Her motivation was simple, though people kept complicating it" edge toward telling that could be dramatized. The phrase "vigorously, tenderly break" stacks modifiers at closure, risking overwriting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. These slips do not obscure causality but prevent entry to 7.5+; apply −0.3 for scaffold and −0.2 for figurative density at the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frame—rehabilitating a clock tower to bridge a fractured community via multilingual carillon—offers a fresh synthesis. Grain elevators as acoustic resonators and interspersing languages are specific, non-obvious choices. Yet the emotional arc (decisive woman succeeds in her plan) follows a familiar template without transformation through character contradiction or cost. The tower sings, the city answers; no hinge moment where Maren's values clash or the plan nearly fails. Freshness in premise, conventional in execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren appears throughout and her profession (choral librarian) frames the method. She climbs the tower, places the weight, connects the relay, and activates the sequence—three distinct beats. However, the activation is a single button press without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. The "harmonious" trait is implied in her method but not tested under conflicting pressures. Setup, development (gathering choirs, proposing talks), and closure participation present, but causal pressure at the ending is limited to observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cuckoo weight appears in three beats: carried as talisman, placed on the workbench, and felt vibrating at closure. Its meaning shifts from memento ("small, steady forces") to resonator at the end. Setup early, middle use as symbolic anchor, and closure reprise satisfy the three-gate model. Yet it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Maren does not trade it or use it mechanically. Charged lyric reprise reweights the stake, qualifying for mid-6s, but specificity remains thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grain elevator talks frame the entire project, appear in the council skepticism, and their rooftops become amphitheaters in Maren's plan. The elevators' acoustic role (concrete resonators amplifying the carillon) directly shapes the method and outcome. Setup, development (rehabilitation plan), and closure (elevators "caught the sound and held it") all present. The concept drives stakes and constrains tactics on the page. Causal pressure and closure linkage push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is defined mid-story ("could hold another person's grief… and still act") and illustrated when Maren activates the sequence without hesitation. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; no on-page moment where empathy and decisiveness pull in opposite directions. Label-only definition without friction or tradeoff. Present and functional but not causally essential; caps at mid-4s per the swappability and label-only frictions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rehabilitation drives the entire narrative: Maren's project, the council's skepticism, gathering choirs, restoring the carillon, and the first test. The action structures every beat and the ending turn (tower sings, silence breaks). Setup early, development through preparation, and closure directly shaped by the action's success. Causal pressure high; removing "rehabilitate" would collapse the plot. Specificity and cost connection (eleven years of silence, community answering) elevate this into the high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interspersing languages appears in method exposition (Dvorak, Somali, K-pop woven into cycles) and is dramatized at the ending when the carillon rings "a melody that began in Czech and shifted without seam into Somali, then Norwegian, then Vietnamese." Setup, development (choir gathering), and closure participation all present. The method shapes the sonic bridge and charges the final image. Causal linkage clear; specificity high. Closure participation and beat involvement justify 7+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower frames the opening, provides the climb and clockworks chamber, houses the carillon, and its dome filters starlight. Maren's actions (placing weight, connecting relay, activating bells) occur within and depend on the tower's mechanisms. Setup immediate, development (workbench, drive chains), and closure (bells shake dust from dome, tower sings). The setting supplies resources, constrains movement, and amplifies the ending's acoustic charge. Irreplaceability and closure linkage push this above 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" anchors the timeframe (nighttime first test) and recurs in the dome's cracked-resin light. The phrase charges atmosphere and signals urgency ("Tonight was the first test"). However, time does not tighten decisions on the page; no countdown or live clock alters tactics. Setup and closure mood present, but the timeframe does not constrain choice. Lyric resonance without causal pressure caps this in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"construct bridges from silos"—is stated explicitly and dramatized through Maren's project, choir gathering, and carillon activation. It drives every beat: climb, preparation, test, and the ending when sound crosses the river. Friction appears in the council's skepticism and the eleven-year silence, but Maren does not face an on-page choice where the motivation conflicts with another desire. Setup, development, and closure all shaped by this desire. Cost visible in effort and communal response; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone oscillates between vigorous (carillon shaking dust, bells alive) and tender (borrowed starlight, empathetic decisiveness, "tentatively… answer"). Both modes appear at closure ("vigorously, tenderly break"). The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image. However, "vigorous tender" as a unified tonality is less integrated than juxtaposed; the two qualities coexist rather than fuse into a single coherent register. Setup and closure both present, coherence strong but not seamless; mid-6s fit.</comment>
