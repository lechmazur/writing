<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and embodied—her grief becomes physical through the act of cataloguing tones, and the choice to "follow it leeward" is earned by prior accumulation. The motivation to turn obstacles into instruments drives micro-choices (striking each object, naming tones). Minor slip: the final choice feels more like convergence than contradiction; no visible on-page cost constrains the ending action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonances through repeated striking gestures that deepen in significance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final chord "fractured into infinite branches" and Sable chooses one heading. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. The closure unit reweights the opening isolation with undeniable pressure and a felt opportunity cost—she commits to one branch among infinite possibilities. Cost is conceptual and palpable in the image of choosing one arrow "only she could read."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard as micro-setting constrains every choice: each object she strikes is a survival resource repurposed as instrument. The mallet carved from pelican bone, the specific materials (fig trunk, mango bark, rusted bolt), and the tidal motion all supply texture and limit her toolkit. The final image—palm against mango trunk, feeling vibration—charges closure. Sensory detail (brine lapping, indigo light, fruit vibrating) is selective and filtered through her interpretive lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survival reimagined as creative agency, signaled early ("catalogued them, humming the notes back"). One meaningful deepening occurs when cloud spirals shift her from prediction to composition—"She was not predicting the future anymore. She was composing it." The tightening is textural rather than confrontational, fitting the Accumulative lens. The choice to follow one chord-branch forecloses other paths with felt cost (infinite possibilities narrowed). Agency is clear: she strikes, names, chooses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: loss transformed into composition, wreckage into instrument, without moralizing. The xylophone mallet seed ("refused to let loss be final") returns charged at closure when she tucks it into her belt after choosing a heading. "Restless euphony...never peaceful, but alive" resists tidy resolution. The final image—orchard humming, clouds rearranged into an arrow—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to survival without stating thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Sable reads sky and sound through a prophet's idiom ("Cumulus banking east meant squid runs"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("dubbed," "sketched resonance," "fractal generating"). Psychic distance remains stable; the elision of other survivors is efficient and purposeful. Minor slip: "particular electricity of things refusing to be still" edges toward abstract lyricism that slightly loosens the tight sensory register elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates well—short bursts during striking sequences, longer breath in reflection. Information density is high: nearly every image does double work (mango roots "threading down through gaps" conveys both setting and the woven survival logic). Two minor artifacts: "dubbed" recurs five times in a single paragraph without pattern-teaching, creating mild synonym pressure. "Sketched resonance made visible in vapor and light" is slightly abstract for a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffold otherwise; propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating orchard, fractal music composition, and cloud prophecy feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The xylophone mallet carved from pelican bone is a fresh, non-obvious detail that anchors the premise. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative rather than confrontational escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of "obstacles into instruments" is lived through specific action rather than asserted. Minor limitation: the prophet-interpreting-clouds frame is familiar; here it is elevated by sensory specificity and the musical overlay.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's choices create the story's key turns: she decides to catalogue tones, names each struck object (dubbing), interprets the spiral clouds as convergence, and at closure chooses one branch of the chord to follow leeward. Present in setup (introduced paragraph one), development (striking and dubbing mid-story), and payoff (final choice). Her agency drives the accumulative escalation and closure. Cost is conceptual (infinite branches narrowed to one) but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet appears in at least three beats: introduced as "single most peculiar possession" early, used to strike objects throughout the middle ("She lifted the mallet and struck"), and tucked into her belt at closure after the final chord. Its specificity (carved from pelican femur, remnant of lost instrument) charges the refusal-of-loss theme. It enables the striking action but could be replaced by another tool with minor edits; the emotional weight does more work than mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is named once ("spiral inward like a nautilus shell drawn by a trembling hand, sketched resonance made visible") and drives the interpretation that shifts her from prediction to composition. It shapes the middle beat (cloud pattern as convergence) and the closure logic (chord fractals into branches). Setup: implicit in early cloud-reading; development: explicit recognition triggers the shift; payoff: the final "arrow only she could read" echoes the concept. Swappable with "emergent pattern" or similar near-synonym, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is established early ("interpreting cloud movements for fishermen") and enables the key middle turn when she reads the nautilus spiral as convergence, shifting her method from prediction to composition. At closure, clouds "rearranged themselves into an arrow only she could read." Present in setup, development (triggers shift), and payoff. The trait constrains her lens but the visible cost is conceptual rather than physical; the action could proceed without this specific skill if another sign were substituted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dubbing (naming struck tones) is the repeated action that structures the middle escalation: "She dubbed it the Foundation...the Arch...the Hinge...the Tide Voice." Each naming transforms obstacle into instrument, enacting the motivation. Present across at least four beats and essential to the fractal-generating method. The closure chord is the product of accumulated dubbed tones. High causal pressure and specificity; swapping "dubbing" for generic "naming" would weaken thematic resonance but the mechanical plot could survive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fractal generating is signaled early ("She would find one tone, then split it into harmonics, then split those harmonics again") and its mechanics shape the middle beats: each struck object branches into harmonics, building the composition. At closure, the "chord so complex it fractured into infinite branches" is the fractal output, and her choice of one branch enacts the method's logic. Present in setup, development (drives the striking sequence), and payoff. Mechanics matter and the closure image depends on fractal logic; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood is the entire physical constraint: every object she strikes (driftwood beam, fig trunk, mango bark, rusted bolt, trailing root) is a survival resource repurposed as instrument. Setup: first paragraph. Development: materials supply the tones she dubs. Payoff: "pressed her palm against the nearest mango trunk, and felt the whole instrument of her survival vibrating." The setting is indispensable—removing the orchard would require complete plot redesign. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blue hour is named early and frames the ritual ("Every evening at the blue hour...she struck things"). It recurs mid-story ("the blue hour trembled around her") and the final line references "last indigo light." Present in setup and payoff; lyric resonance reweights the time as sacred/liminal. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency tied to the hour ending. The ritual could occur at dawn or night with similar effect. Moderate thematic charge but low tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is dramatized through every striking and dubbing choice. Setup: "She kept the mallet because she refused to let loss be final." Development: "Each obstacle she had mourned...she dubbed and incorporated. The raft was not debris. It was an instrument." Payoff: "felt the whole instrument of her survival vibrating." The motivation drives the dominant stake and the closure image. Visible cost: she must choose one branch among infinite, foreclosing other paths. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Restless euphony is named explicitly near closure ("restless euphony surrounded her, not peaceful, never peaceful, but alive") and coheres through the entire texture: "humming," "vibrating," "frequencies," "chord so complex it fractured." Tone modulates from isolation (opening) to charged accumulation (middle striking) to poise (final choice). The phrase "particular electricity of things refusing to be still" enacts the tone. Present implicitly in setup, charged throughout development, and named at payoff. The tone shapes the final image and is irreplaceable; "restless" + "euphony" captures the exact contradiction the ending delivers.</comment>
