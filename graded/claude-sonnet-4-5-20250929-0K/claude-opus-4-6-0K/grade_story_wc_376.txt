<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is clear and her affliction—wilting near dishonesty—functions as both trait and constraint, though it appears mostly as background color rather than forcing pivotal trade-offs. The final choice to inscribe imagined words carries visible cost (accepting incompleteness), but the arc feels more contemplative than conflicted; internal tension is present but muted. Embodied emotion is strongest when she listens to the jar and sits with the fragment; earlier beats lean toward summary. Minor: the warden's dishonesty triggers her affliction but doesn't alter her path, reducing the trait's causal weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Sable accepts incompleteness and the fragment itself becomes the whole truth, with visible emotional cost. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by ~60 words). The piece reads Causal with Accumulative undertones; map assembly → Vault discovery → mother's incomplete sentence → inscribing silence forms a clear because/therefore chain. One tightening occurs when the jar reveals only a fragment, forcing Sable to reframe her three-year search. Minor slip: the breakthrough (finding shredded map) arrives conveniently without prior setup of why that floorboard or studio mattered, softening inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, sublevels, and Vault 7's cathedral of jars constrain Sable's search and charge the closure image (inscribing the jar at home). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: humid corridors, faint jar luminescence, whispers pressed to glass. The toxic copper sky bookends the piece, reweighted in the final line as "something that almost resembled dawn," lifting mood without breaking world rules. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the warden checkpoint and Propagation District ferns function as lived-in waypoints. Small precision note: "enormous trees breathed life into Veridian's recycled air" blends metaphor and function smoothly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding her mother's lost words—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the jar contains only a fragment, forcing Sable to reconceive completeness as candor-in-attempt rather than finished speech. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she inscribes imagined words, accepting they "weren't true, exactly," and her hands stay warm, closing the loop on her affliction. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens. Minor: the three-year search is told rather than dramatized, and no live obstacle (time limit, rival, resource scarcity) raises immediate stakes; the map assembly weeks pass in summary, softening escalation texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—candor in small moments, honesty as willing attempt rather than completion—emerges organically from the jar fragment and Sable's final act of gilding silence. The mother's cut-off sentence and Sable's acceptance form a resonant, non-literal answer without thesis statement. Subtext operates in the warden's false assurance (triggering Sable's affliction) and the distinction between "true" and "dishonest" in the ending beat. The toxic sky's shift "toward something that almost resembled dawn" offers conceptual repricing without forced optimism. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion; the piece trusts image and action to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Sable's perceptual priorities (calligrapher's patience, sensitivity to dishonesty). Diction is controlled and distinct: "gilt on whatever leaf she held would tarnish and flake," "cartographic pigment," "zinc-etched postal plate." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening when she hears her mother's voice. Minor slips: "She reread the etching four times, tilting it under her lamp to be sure" tells rather than shows hesitation, and "understood something about candor in small moments" edges toward explication, though the following clause rescues it with concrete image. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong information density: "a labyrinth of humid corridors and botanical towers where humanity had retreated after the oasis dried and the toxic sky turned the color of burnt copper" packs world, tone, and history into one breath. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure supports momentum. Minor texture issues: "she found something that wasn't paper at all: a zinc-etched postal plate fragment" and "She noted this and continued" are slightly mechanical; "thin as smoke" is stock. One paraphrase loop: "The last words her mother ever tried to speak... had gone somewhere. Sable refused to believe they had simply ceased to exist" restates without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; syntax serves voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—gilded-leaf calligraphy, pneumatic archive of lost speech, physical symptom of dishonesty—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template "find the artifact" plotting. The transformation of her affliction from curse to compass and the ending's acceptance of incompleteness offer fresh emotional terrain. Trope (sealed city, lost parent's message) is elevated by the concrete mechanics: shredded map, zinc plate, jars of unfinished sentences. Risk: the piece commits to a quiet, lyric closure without retreat. Minor: the decompression event and three-year search rest on familiar scaffolding (sudden parent death, long quest), and the breakthrough's timing (renovating studio) lacks inevitability, softening originality at the hinge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable's choices—piecing the map, traveling to Sublevel, breaking the jar seal, inscribing the jar—create the narrative spine. Setup: introduced paragraph one. Development: map assembly and Vault journey are her decisions. Payoff: the final inscribing act is her agency with visible cost (accepting incompleteness). Causal pressure: her search narrows from abstract quest to concrete renunciation. Minor friction: the breakthrough (finding the map) arrives by coincidence rather than a choice she makes, and some beats (weeks of assembly) are summarized. Irreplaceability is high; the calligrapher's patience and affliction are unique to her role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears mid-story among map pieces, labeled "RETURN UNDELIVERED SPEECH TO VAULT 7, SUBLEVEL," and directs Sable to the Vault. Setup: absent in first third. Development: one beat—she reads it four times, driving her destination choice. Payoff: not present in the ending; the jar, not the plate, is inscribed. Two touches (discovery, rereading) but no evolving use or closure linkage. Swappability: a paper note could serve the same function. Causal work is real but narrow; the plate enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Candor in small moments shapes the ending's stakes and emotional logic: Sable reframes her mother's incomplete sentence as the whole truth—"that willingness, that reaching toward transparency even as the air was leaving the room, was the whole of it." Setup: the affliction (wilting near dishonesty) primes the concept early. Development: the warden's lie and Sable's reaction demonstrate it in action. Payoff: the final inscribing act ("They weren't true, exactly, but they weren't dishonest either") dramatizes the concept with visible cost (her hands stay warm, signaling acceptance). The concept changes her understanding and final choice rather than remaining thematic overlay.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wilts near dishonesty appears in two on-page beats: Sable feels nothing at the checkpoint (her answer is true), then goes cold when the warden lies. Setup: paragraph two. Development: checkpoint scene. Payoff: the ending's warmth ("Sable's hands stayed steady and warm") signals her acceptance of the honest incompleteness, closing the loop. The trait constrains her social navigation and validates her final choice. Friction: the affliction doesn't force a harder trade-off (e.g., revealing her destination or confronting the warden); it functions more as internal compass than external obstacle, reducing visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Rereading the zinc plate ("She reread the etching four times, tilting it under her lamp to be sure") occurs once in the middle, confirming the Vault address and driving her journey. Setup: the plate itself is found mid-story. Development: this beat. Payoff: absent from the ending. The action is functional but easily swappable (she could have read it once and decided, or consulted a map). No recurring motif or closure linkage; the act doesn't redefine options or carry visible cost. Single causal touch; replaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded map is signaled ("For weeks, Sable worked...matching torn edges with the patience her calligraphy had trained"), shown with concrete mechanics (magnifying lenses, tweezers, dampened silk), and produces the Vault location that drives the middle and ending. Setup: breakthrough paragraph. Development: assembly paragraph. Payoff: the map's product (Resonance Vault) leads to closure. The method demonstrates her calligrapher's patience and makes the discovery feel earned. Friction: the assembly weeks are summarized rather than dramatized in beats, and the map's discovery is coincidental (renovation, not purposeful search), softening inevitability. Swappability is moderate; another puzzle could serve, but the shredding implies deliberate suppression, adding thematic texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky supply world pressure (humanity's retreat, sealed survival) and constrain Sable's tactics (airlocks, checkpoints, sublevels). Setup: opening paragraph. Development: Propagation District and Vault 7 are navigated spaces that shape her search. Payoff: the final line reprices the toxic sky as "something that almost resembled dawn," reweighting the opening's despair with faint hope. Micro-setting (jars, studio, floorboards) also functions. The setting drives thematic resonance and charges the closure image. Minor: the oxygen temples and dignitaries' doors are mentioned but don't constrain on-page choices, remaining atmospheric detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the oasis dries" establishes a post-catastrophe present but doesn't function as a tightening clock. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: the three-year search and "weeks" of map assembly are told durations without on-page pressure. Payoff: the timeframe persists as backdrop (toxic sky shift at the end) but doesn't alter tactics or force a deadline. The passage of time contextualizes Sable's persistence, but no ticking urgency narrows her options. Swappability: the story would function similarly in a different post-collapse frame. Causal role is contextual rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Finding where lost conversations go drives every beat: the three-year search, map assembly, Vault journey, jar discovery, and final inscribing. Setup: paragraph three ("She had spent three years searching"). Development: the Vault discovery and her mother's fragment force Sable to reframe completion as candor-in-attempt. Payoff: the ending's inscription of imagined words dramatizes her revised understanding with visible cost (acceptance of incompleteness). The motivation is conflicted—desire for closure versus acceptance of fragment—and shapes the final choice. Irreplaceability is high; no other want would produce this arc.</comment>
