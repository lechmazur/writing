<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is well-embodied—"irony was a stone in her shoe," the dust "cemented into her lungs"—and her contradictory impulses (performing crisis vs. surviving one) ground her motivation. The walking-as-spelling feels mechanically described rather than enacted as a choice under pressure; we're told she "was cutting the cords" rather than shown a micro-decision where she forecloses a path. The final pause and whisper carry emotional weight, but the climactic gesture lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren commits to remembering rather than performing, and the building "decided to remember" reweights her seven-year practice with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors quickly (whispering gallery, interregnum, crisis actor) and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring images (dust, chessboard, walking-as-alphabet) that converge in the final whisper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chessboard "felt like a portrait of the country" pivots her purpose from personal to collective history, and the ending crystallizes that shift with the gallery "whispering back."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustics are purposefully detailed: "footsteps…carried with supernatural clarity" and the elliptical design enables the walking-alphabet conceit. The chessboard's missing pawns function as micro-setting, constraining Maren's reflection ("stranded without their front line") and charging the final image of "absent pawns like all those unrecorded kindnesses." The interregnum setting subtly pressures her work—"left unlocked, unguarded"—granting access she would not have under the old regime. Sensory selection is crisp: "dust cemented into her lungs," "luminous…absence," "stone bench."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Maren wants to "unbind herself" from crisis performance and become "historian of small gestures." The tightening occurs when she walks the names and the gallery "whispers back," reweighting her seven years of staged suffering with the cost of renunciation ("She would not pretend anymore"). However, the escalation is conceptual rather than decisional—no live antagonist or reversal forces a trade-off. The interregnum enables her work but does not complicate it; coincidence (unlocked gallery) grants rather than resists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the chessboard's missing pawns, the hand-holder's melody, the walking-alphabet ritual. "Nomadic penumbra" is deployed metaphorically ("borderland drifted with her") without overt thesis. The final image—gallery "whispering back"—offers a resonant answer to the question "how do we record unspectacular mercy?" without moralizing. One slip: "benevolently ruthless" in the fifth paragraph edges toward self-diagnostic abstraction, though it's quickly grounded in the next line's renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "irony was a stone in her shoe," "emptiness had a quality…luminous," "nomadic penumbra." Diction remains consistent under pressure; "benevolently ruthless" reads as narratorial gloss fitting Maren's educated self-awareness rather than a register breach. Psychic distance tightens in the final beat ("She whispered a name") without head-hopping. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Rhythm modulates purposefully: long sentences in reflection, shorter beats at the closure ("She kept walking. She kept spelling.").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: "dust cemented into her lungs and a fracture running through her left wrist like a river delta" does triple work (injury, image, character history). Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates into the ending. Minor loop: "She kept walking. She kept spelling. The gallery kept whispering back" uses triple-stem parallelism, though the pattern reads purposeful rather than artifactual. One filter-verb cluster in paragraph five ("she had discovered…she could trace…she had mapped") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No clarity or propulsion breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of crisis actor + real survivor + walking-as-alphabet + interregnum is specific and non-obvious. The chessboard's missing pawns as metaphor for unrecorded kindness feels earned rather than convenient. Risk: the walking-alphabet conceit could read gimmicky, but it's grounded early and paid off at closure. One friction: the "luminous absence" and "nomadic penumbra" phrases drift toward elevated abstraction without full dramatization of what those states cost Maren in the moment. Transformation test passes: plot and arc require these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's dual identity (crisis actor / real survivor) is present in setup, frames her motivation in the middle ("every performance a small betrayal"), and shapes the closure choice (renouncing performance for remembering). The contradiction drives at least two beats: the opening irony and the unbinding gesture in paragraph five. However, her choices remain reflective rather than decisional under pressure; no antagonist or complication tests her commitment on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in paragraph four, is handled physically ("ran her finger along the board's edge"), and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("chessboard watched…all those absent pawns like all those unrecorded kindnesses"). The missing pawns constrain Maren's reflection—"felt like a portrait of the country"—and charge the thematic close. Two distinct beats, early signal, closure reprise. Cap at 6.2: introduced just past the first third (~30% mark) and does not alter a tactical choice, only reflection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is named in paragraph seven and described metaphorically ("wandering edge between light and shadow"). It articulates Maren's state but does not constrain a choice or shift tactics; the concept is illustrative rather than causal. Present in the ending paragraph, so all three gates minimally met, but swappable with "liminality" or "in-between" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is named once in paragraph five, glossing Maren's stance ("gentle with herself but merciless toward the fiction"). The trait is told rather than enacted; we do not see a moment where gentleness and ruthlessness collide in a choice with visible cost. Label-only use, late introduction (second half), no dramatized tradeoff. Missing setup and development gates; cap at 4.6, nudged to 4.7 for coherence with the unbinding action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unbind" is signaled early (paragraph five: "unbind herself"), shapes the middle turn (renouncing staged collapse), and is enacted in the closure (walking the names, the gallery "whispering back" confirms her new role). The action drives the emotional arc and makes the final image legible. Two beats, early signal, closure participation. Not capped higher because the unbinding is performed reflectively rather than through a contested decision with live antagonist.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The walking-alphabet method is introduced in paragraph six ("she could trace letters…mapped the alphabet onto movements"), used in the middle beat ("walked the names"), and active in the closure ("She kept spelling"). The method enables the central ritual and is irreplaceable—remove it and the closure mechanism fails. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage. Cap at 6.4: the mechanics are told in summary ("months ago in an abandoned rotunda") rather than discovered or tested under pressure on this page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is anchored in paragraph two, its acoustics ("whisper…could be heard perfectly…forty meters away") enable the walking-alphabet method, and the gallery's response ("whispered their names…kept whispering back") charges the closure image. The setting constrains Maren's tactic (must walk the ellipse to spell) and the interregnum opens access. Three beats, all three gates, high specificity, closure participation. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The interregnum is named in paragraph two, provides access ("left unlocked, unguarded"), and frames the atmosphere ("between governments…held breath"). It enables Maren's work but does not tighten a decision or create a deadline; the timeframe is situational backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup, grants opportunity in the middle, and the ending's "interregnum outside continued" confirms its persistence. Two gates (setup, weak closure mention), but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's desire to "become their historian" is stated in paragraph five, dramatized in paragraph six (walking the names), and fulfilled in the closure ("building itself had decided to remember"). The motivation is coherent and shapes her renunciation of crisis acting. Early signal, drives the central action, closure participation. However, the desire is not conflicted on the page—no cost or counter-pressure tests her commitment in the moment. Strong setup and payoff, but mid-tier friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminous" appears twice: paragraph three ("luminous…absence") and implicitly in the final paragraph's "nomadic penumbra" imagery. The tone of quiet, reflective reverence remains stable and modulates subtly with the closure beat's gentle repetition ("She kept walking…kept spelling…kept whispering back"). Tone charges the final image and coheres with Maren's shift from performance to remembering. Present in setup, sustained through turns, payoff in ending. Strong coherence, though the tone does not shift under peak pressure since no live antagonist is present.</comment>
