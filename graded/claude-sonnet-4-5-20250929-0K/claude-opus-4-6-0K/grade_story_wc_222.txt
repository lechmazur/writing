<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and specific ("instinctively, without needing to name the mechanism"), and her choice at closure—placing the knight—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (she moves from defensive archive maintenance to forward exploration). Her contradictory impulses ("something between terror and delight") act simultaneously in scene. Minor: the apprentice-of-wonder framing leans slightly declarative, but embodied micro-choices (retrieving the knight, writing her scroll) ground her agency throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Decisive Change: Maren places the knight, the wall becomes transparent, and she steps through with visible cost (abandoning Cassius's defensive posture, embracing unknown risk). The causal lens holds: sundial coordinates → chess notation → scroll discovery → new scroll → passage opens. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening (the bishop scroll's either/or fork) narrows options and the final move reweights the stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, violet sky, and chess-archive chamber are vivid and purposeful; the obsidian wall thinning to transparency charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (observation deck → spiral staircase → archive chamber → workshop → back to archive). The pocket sundial lid and chess pieces function as micro-setting that constrains choices. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's urgency ("frost-crusted beard," "ice crackling beneath her feet").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (finish Cassius's work or "the spire forgets") and tightens at the bishop scroll's fork: seal or open. Maren's agency drives the turn—she writes her own scroll and places the knight—and the cost is legible on the page (she abandons forty years of Cassius's defensive maintenance to "play forward"). The either/or choice narrows options with visible consequence. One meaningful escalation is sufficient at this length and the pressure coheres under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the archive's "sacred game" vs. Maren's choice to "embrace the unknown," embodied in chess-piece swapping and the final step through the passage. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The spire remembered. And now it wondered.") that reweights prior material without moralizing. The white peony callback, the sundial-as-talisman, and the shift from "what was" to "what dares to be" all charge the closure without abstraction. No prompt-label echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren with a distinct perceptual signature ("the way a thief knows a locked door"). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful"). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during the scroll discovery, breathes during backstory). The two brief dialogue blocks (Cassius's past words) feel natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and rhythmic control holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive with high information density ("Every chamber held chess sets carved from mammoth ivory and arctic birch, and inside each hollow piece nested a tightly scrolled secret"). Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and reconfigure meaning. Minor: two brief paraphrase moments in the middle third ("The spire remembered everything—or it was supposed to. That was its purpose") restate without added pressure, triggering −0.2. No figurative muddle, no loops in peak beats, and clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chess-archive premise is fresh and specific: knowledge preserved in hand-carved hollow pieces, swapped across decades in a mid-game position. The transformation from defensive maintenance to forward risk feels earned in hindsight. The "wrong sky" opening and violet-light passage avoid stock fantasy tropes through concrete grounding (coordinates as chess notation, the white peony callback). Risk-taking in the unconventional archive mechanic and the quiet, image-driven closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's thief background appears early (pickpocketing anecdote) and the "chivalrous thief" framing shapes her final choice: she steals forward from Cassius's defensive game and leaves her own scroll in place. Her decision to write and place the knight is the key turn. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure action; causal pressure is moderate but the element enables the final move.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid is handed to Maren in the opening third, decoded mid-story (coordinates as chess notation), and pocketed again as a talisman before she steps through the passage. Used in three distinct beats with escalating function: gift → puzzle → keepsake. It enables the bishop discovery and charges the final image as a "reminder that even incomplete maps lead somewhere." Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" is named early and frames Maren's stance throughout; it shapes her reception of the "wrong sky" ("something between terror and delight") and justifies her forward leap at closure. Present in setup and thematically tied to the ending ("The spire remembered. And now it wondered."), but the middle beats rely more on the thief/archive mechanic. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; one key turn shaped by the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" is Cassius's label for the archive work, introduced early and directly echoed in Maren's final scroll: "cautious abandon—not reckless, never reckless, but willing to leap while still measuring the fall." The trait constrains her writing process (she measures the fall even as she leaps) and charges the closure tone. Present in setup and ending; one visible tradeoff (abandon tempered by caution). Lyric reprise with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Amend" is Cassius's instruction ("You'll need to amend it"), drives Maren's investigation of the sundial coordinates, and culminates in her writing a new scroll to replace the bishop's. The action is irreplaceable: the plot hinges on her correcting/expanding the archive rather than merely preserving it. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure execution; the amendment redefines options (seal vs. open) and enables the passage. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (chess pieces with scrolls inside), demonstrated through the bishop and the new knight, and the act of placing the knight on D5 triggers the passage opening. The mechanics matter: unscrewing, reading, carving, sealing, placing. Used across three beats with escalating stakes and the method is indispensable to the closure—story logic would fail without this exact mechanic. Strong specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire is anchored early (observation deck seven hundred feet above cloudline, frozen archive chamber, spiral staircase) and the setting constrains movement and resources (ice on every step, crystalline walls, obsidian that thins). The final beat depends on the spire's physical transformation (wall becoming transparent, passage corkscrewing upward). Present in all three gates; the environment shapes tactics and charges the closure image. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" frames the opening and recurs as violet light throughout, creating urgency (Cassius dying, constellations shifted, aurora pulsing). The timeframe tightens Maren's choice but does not impose a live ticking clock; the wrongness persists as atmospheric pressure rather than a countdown. Present in setup and closure image ("the wrong sky blazing violet above her"); one key decision shaped by the condition. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to embrace the unknown is dramatized early ("something between terror and delight"), tested in the bishop scroll's fork (seal vs. open), and crystallized in her written scroll: "I choose the door. I embrace the unknown with open arms." The motivation drives the final action and forecloses Cassius's defensive path with visible cost. Present in setup, middle conflict, and closure execution; friction between safety (seal) and risk (open) is on the page. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is introduced mid-story ("with cautious abandon—not reckless, never reckless, but willing to leap while still measuring the fall") and modulates across the narrative: Maren measures (decodes coordinates, retrieves the knight) while leaping (writes her own scroll, steps through). Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (she steps forward "into the wrongness" with both terror and delight). Present in middle and closure; tone shapes the final stance with visible cost.</comment>
