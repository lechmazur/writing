<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is sustained and specific—heartbreak as "architectural, load-bearing" is vivid, and her embodied grief (phrases spilling "like pollen") anchors her arc. The arc from delay to acceptance is legible, though the final choice feels more inevitability than active decision; her descent is acceptance rather than a turn that forecloses a visible alternative. Internal contradiction appears lightly (her refusal to let go vs. the ritual of release), but the peak beat lacks a micro-choice with visible cost. Theodan's voice on the cylinder motivates reflection without becoming a contrived epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, when by paragraph two). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grief accrues through discovered recordings, crystallized phrases, and the atlas ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—Maren accepts the ritual's ephemerality and descends, foreclosing pursuit of permanence). Cost is visible: she releases the words to dissolution and walks away. The single meaningful deepening—understanding Theodan's closed-mouth revision—reweights the Echovore image and charges the final descent. Closure lands cleanly under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The roofless observatory constrains the ritual (open dome required for light refraction) and charges the final image ("instruments of watching...what shines only briefly"). Sensory detail is purposeful: "dust-thickened air," "amber and violet bands," "filament of glass." The atlas page and scythe anchor micro-setting choices. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, meridian line, weighted corners). The setting's function as witness recurs with thematic weight at closure, elevating beyond postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to honor sacrifice by giving shape to what was taken, tested when Maren confronts Theodan's voice and understands his closed-mouth Echovore. The tightening is one deepening (naming steals the monster's power) that reweights her ritual and charges her descent. No explicit antagonist; pressure is internal and accumulative. Agency reads as renunciation—she folds the page and descends, foreclosing permanence with quiet cost. The cost is legible (ephemeral memorial, solitary witness) but the escalation is gentle, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (naming fears, honoring erasure, the persistence of meaning) emerges organically from the atlas, the crystallized phrases, and the Echovore's transformation. The final image—phrases as "coordinates fixed, its borders drawn in glass and goodbye," the observatory as instrument of brief witnessing—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the closed-mouth revision and the warm, un-crystallized utterance of Theodan's name deepens the theme. No thematic echo or sermon; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-close, with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (grief as architecture, "voices...clung to her like pollen"). Diction is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated ("commas," "instruments of watching"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("watched," "traced") are sparse and purposeful. The phrase "distant intimacy" colors the narration (tenderness to an empty room) without becoming precious. Slight register drift in "atmospheric dust and the observatory's remaining prisms" feels scientific-catalog, but the effect supports the setting's identity. Dialogue is absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths modulate well. Information density is high—most lines advance grief, setting, or the Echovore's reweighting. Minor scaffold: "She set her bag...and withdrew" is functional transit. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense ("heartbroken for so long that the condition had become architectural," "sea monsters...their jaws open around ships no bigger than commas") but coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. The final paragraph's layered closure image demonstrates high craft. One small clarity slip: "the beast that swallowed meaning and left only silence" then "the one Theodan had called the Echovore" implies two referents before clarifying as one.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Reaper-as-archivist frame, the crystallization of last words through refracted light, and the closed-mouth revision of the Echovore offer fresh synthesis. The emotional truth—grief as load-bearing, the ephemerality of memorial—feels earned and particular. The proximity of "heartbreak as architectural" to metaphor-workshop conventions lowers novelty slightly, and the Reaper-mourns-the-dead premise is familiar, but the atlas, phonograph cylinders, and light-prism mechanism transform it. Risk-taking (lyric closure, no antagonist, accumulative pressure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template echoes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's choices—listening to cylinders, spreading the atlas, whispering echoes, folding the page, descending—create the ritual beats and the final renunciation. Her understanding of the closed-mouth Echovore alters her stance. Present throughout; drives the arc and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atlas page is withdrawn, unrolled, weighted, pressed, traced, and folded across multiple beats. The Echovore's revision (mouth closed) reweights the dominant stake and informs Maren's final insight. It returns charged in the closure and is indispensable to the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice frames the ritual (phrases from last breaths crystallize, becoming visible memorial). It constrains Maren's choices (she must witness and release), appears in the inciting moment (finding the recordings), and charges the ending (words as coordinates, then dissolution). Shapes stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echoing forgotten phrases is Maren's involuntary response to grief pressure, appears on-page in the whispered ritual, and directly enables the crystallization. The attribute constrains her action (she cannot choose which phrases emerge) and carries visible cost (the weight of "residue"). Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystallization is the ritual's climax, dramatized in the dome, and produces the "chandelier of unfinished sentences." The action transforms grief into visible, temporary memorial and validates the theme. Removing it would collapse the closure's mechanism and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Scattered light (dusk refraction through prisms) is signaled early, enables the crystallization, and returns in the final image ("what shines only briefly"). The mechanics matter: amber/violet bands catch syllables. Shapes the ritual's possibility and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The roofless observatory permits the light mechanism, hosts the ritual, and the final paragraph's "instruments of watching" metaphor reconfigures the entire arc. The meridian line, spiral stairs, and broken dome constrain choreography and charge the ending. Indispensable to logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after finding") anchors the inciting event, and "every equinox" signals recurrence. The present ritual unfolds in real time (dusk to dark), tightening the window. However, no live clock pressures decisions; the frame contextualizes rather than constrains. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—to name nameless fears—is dramatized through Theodan's atlas work, internalized by Maren's ritual, and tested when she understands the closed-mouth revision. It drives the arc and shapes the thematic resolution. The friction (naming vs. letting go) emerges on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distant intimacy is embodied throughout: "tenderness delivered to an empty room," Theodan's name spoken warm and un-crystallized, the ephemeral memorial no one else will see. Tone modulates with pressure (grief → understanding → release) and charges the final image ("witnessing what shines only briefly"). Coherent, purposeful, indispensable to closure's emotional register.</comment>
