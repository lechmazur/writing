<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—"pressure settle into her chest," the diamond forming in her fist. Her choice to volunteer is motivated by the established theology of pressure-into-value and her history with the pyramid scheme betrayal. The "every Maren who'd failed, every Maren who'd flourished" collapse reads as genuine internal contradiction compressed into one moment. Minor slip: the "virtuously mischievous delight" descriptor for the alternate Maren is told rather than shown in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: geometric projections thicken, Fear materializes as shadowseam, dimensions fold inward. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the diamond forms as proof of sustained pressure, and Maren returns to work with the phone set down, a visible renunciation of the promise-chasing cycle. Cost is legible: she accepts geological compression and gains something unmarketable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and functional: substrate texture, blue glow shifting to geometric projections, Fear's shadowseam stitched to walls. The porthole bolt constrains choice—she threads it on mycelium fiber and wears it to see alternate Marens. The diamond placed among mushrooms charges the final image with scattered rainbows. Micro-setting (mushroom caps as glass-hard concepts) directly shapes her decision to volunteer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: survive the collapsing quantum promise without shattering. The piece tightens through three nights and escalating physicality (geometric smoke → shadowseam → collapse). Agency is genuine—Maren chooses to volunteer, accepting "pain with purpose" against learned distrust. Cost is visible: the geological pressure settles into her chest, she holds every permutation of grief. The diamond's unmarketability reinforces the cost: it cannot be monetized, only experienced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—pressure held with patience becomes transmissive rather than reflective—emerges from mushroom cultivation, bankruptcy recovery, the porthole's aperture view, and the diamond's light-scattering property. The final image (diamond among mushrooms casting rainbows) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists the pyramid's exponential-growth theology in favor of quiet accretion. Subtext operates in the contrast between Marcus's false promise and the other Maren's "pain with purpose."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Maren; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled—"beautiful, breathing dark," "copper and starlight"—and matches the contemplative, earth-bound register. The glitchy text messages use orthography (numb3r substitutions) purposefully to signal dimensional instability. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices substrate texture, mycelium strength, mushroom light before abstract concepts. Minor slip: "virtuously mischievous" is a narrator's phrase, not filtered through Maren's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well: short declarations ("The mushrooms didn't promise returns. They just grew.") against longer geological sentences. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—"geometric projections shattered into dust that tasted like copper and starlight" works; "concepts are becoming physical" is enacted on-page. Deduction: The phrase "every version of herself she could have been flickered like pages in a book left open in wind" is a stock literary image that slightly dulls momentum in a peak beat (−0.3). Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quantum-collapse premise is executed with specificity—porthole bolt as aperture, shadowseam as concept-made-physical, mycelium fiber as chain material. The transformation of pyramid-scheme theology into something unmarketable is a fresh moral calculus. Risk: the piece commits to geological pressure as metaphor and enacts it literally. Limitation: the "every dimension collapses into one volunteer" setup reads familiar from multiverse fiction; the mushroom-farm grounding and unmarketable-diamond payoff provide the needed transformation but don't fully escape the template's shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme survivor shapes Maren's distrust ("learned...to distrust anyone who needed volunteers") and her theology of pressure-into-value. The backstory with Marcus and Pinnacle Group primes her choice to volunteer. Her final act—placing the unmarketable diamond among mushrooms—contrasts with the pyramid's false promises. Present in setup and closure; drives the volunteer decision in the middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Submarine porthole bolt appears in the third-night beat, functions as aperture to see alternate Marens, is threaded onto mycelium fiber and worn during the collapse. Its aperture property (seeing through to other dimensions) is irreplaceable and shapes the volunteer choice. Closure participation: implied presence during collapse, but not explicitly mentioned in final image. Scores well for causal pressure and specificity but loses top band for late intro (night three of three) and no explicit return at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Quantum promise is named in the second message, explained as dimensional seaming, and enacted through the collapse ("every dimension's worth of pressure settle into her chest"). It shapes the central stake (volunteer or shatter) and the final diamond's formation. The concept narrows options and alters tactics (she must choose to hold the point of collapse). Present across all three gates but feels slightly abstract—more theme-driver than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Virtuously mischievous" is used once as a descriptor for the alternate Maren who "bends rules only in service of mercy." It does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized in choice. Label-only mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Volunteer action is the climactic choice: "I volunteer," she said aloud triggers the collapse, the geological pressure settling, the diamond forming. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it would break the story's logic. It drives the final third and directly produces the closure image (diamond in her fist). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; scores just below top band because the decision itself is brief and the on-page cost (pressure, diamond) follows quickly without extended tactical struggle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Glitchy text messages arrive in three waves (nights one, two, three), each escalating the stakes and delivering new information. The glitches (numb3r substitutions) signal dimensional instability and resolve into clarity when the final message lands. The method shapes the pacing (three nights = three beats) and provides the alternate Maren's explanation. Present in setup and development; final message ("Thank you. Every version of us felt that.") closes the communication arc. Functional but somewhat passive—Maren receives rather than uses the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushroom farm provides the opening anchor, supplies the substrate where the porthole bolt is found, and produces the geometric projections that enact "concepts becoming physical." The mushrooms' light shift (cool to warm) tracks escalation. The final image—diamond placed among mushrooms, scattering bioluminescence into rainbows—charges closure. Mycelium fiber becomes the chain for the porthole bolt. Setting is causally active across all three gates and shapes tactics (finding the bolt, threading mycelium).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "when concepts become physical" is enacted on-page: mushroom caps turn glass-hard, geometric patterns solidify, Fear materializes as shadowseam. The condition escalates across three nights and peaks during the collapse. It shapes the dominant stake (survive the conceptual-physical seaming) and provides the story's speculative premise. Present in setup (first night's geometric caps) and closure (diamond as solidified pressure). The "when" is more thematic condition than ticking clock, but the three-night structure provides pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate pressure into diamonds" is Maren's explicit theology: "the only theology she had left." It drives her choice to volunteer ("pain with purpose") and is literalized in the closure when the diamond forms in her fist. The piece dramatizes the conflict between this belief and her learned distrust of promises. The final cost—diamond is unmarketable, can't be "sold or traded"—tests and refines the motivation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the literalization is both earned and charged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone blends eerie wonder (bioluminescent blue, geometric smoke, dimensional aperture) with grounded earthiness (substrate, mycelium, damp earth). "Shadowseam" as descriptor for Fear's stitched edges is aptly strange. The tone modulates: calm cultivation → eerie escalation → geological compression → quiet return to work. The final image (rainbows across dark ceiling) sustains the wonder without deflating into sentimentality. Coherent through turns and charges the ending, though "shadowseam" itself appears only once and could recur more to anchor the tonal signature.</comment>
