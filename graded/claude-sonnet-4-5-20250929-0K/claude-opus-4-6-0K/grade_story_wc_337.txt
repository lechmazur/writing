<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is vivid and embodied—the "silt at the bottom of a still pond" metaphor grounds her silence as physical weight. Her motivation to exhume voices rather than simply repair masks shows clear escalation of stakes. Elin's entrance and offer to help shifts the dynamic with visible agency. The final hum is earned through the shared work, though the arc from isolation to connection could press harder against Maren's resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's first sound in years—"a low, unsteady hum"—reweights the accumulated silence with felt cost (years of voicelessness, the risk of sharing the burden). The sanctuary anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful deepening: Elin's joining disperses the weight, enabling the final exhalation. Cost is visible and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's starlight fractures into "pale rivers of color" that shift with cloud and emotion—environment charges mood and mirrors internal states. The net's hardened fibers and the tapestry needle's curve are tactile and functional. The sanctuary floor warming beneath them and the final "open field" image tie setting to closure. Micro-setting (the net, the needle, the stone floor) constrains Maren's method and the collaborative choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: releasing the accumulated silence before it kills Maren. The admission "Yes" is a micro-turn that opens the path to shared labor. Knot-by-knot unraveling escalates through repeated action with accumulating effect. The final knot releases the lullaby, and Maren's hum is the earned payoff—silence no longer a burial. Cost is legible: years of voicelessness, the vulnerability of confession, the work itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: silence as burden, shared labor as dispersal, clearing space for growth. "Grounding is letting them settle" encapsulates the shift from solitary absorption to communal processing. The net's voices, the "interlaced hush," and the final "open field" metaphor all serve the question of how grief is carried and shared. No overt moralizing; the lullaby becoming light offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; focalization remains clean. Perceptual signature: she reads silence as physical accumulation and objects as repositories of grief. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful ("Not collecting. Grounding."), and reveals character via economy. Elin's "which was its own kind of gift" captures the relationship dynamic without overexplaining. Register and diction remain consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. "The interlaced hush," "lucid unrest," and "centuries had hardened its fibers into something closer to wire" are dense and specific. Information density is high: every image advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. The final sentence—"an open field where something, eventually, might choose to grow"—carries purposeful compression and charges the closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—mask restorer absorbing silence from broken artifacts, then exhuming voices from a net—is fresh and commits fully to its metaphysical logic. "Interlaced hush" and "grounding" versus "collecting" are specific, non-obvious inflections. The turn to shared labor transforms the solitary mysticism into relational healing. Risk: treating silence as physical substance and voices as literal presences in knots. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as broken mask restorer drives setup (tools spread, "hundred broken faces"), the decision to exhume rather than repair, and the final choice to accept Elin's help. Her vocational identity constrains her method and charges the closure hum.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tapestry needle appears in setup ("the only instrument precise enough"), is used in at least three beats (first knot, second knot, Elin given "a second needle"), and its specificity (curved, made for dense weave) matters to the task. It enables shared labor and thus the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is named once and drives Maren's internal state (silence as lattice). It shapes her motivation and the stakes (the weight is killing her). The concept reappears obliquely in the dispersal ("silence did not accumulate as heavily") but isn't mechanically repeated. Lyric reprise with thematic cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulating silence is dramatized early (weight in chest, years of loss) and constrains Maren's choices: she must exhume to survive. The trait is tested when Elin offers help—sharing disperses the weight, proving the mechanism. Final hum shows the reversal of accumulation with visible cost (years lost).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exhumation (versus repair) is the inciting action, signaled in the second paragraph ("not come to fix...come to exhume"). It drives every knot-unraveling beat and the closure: releasing the drowned voices enables Maren's own voice. Swapping "exhume" for another verb would flatten the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unraveling knots in the centuries-old net is signaled early, shown in at least three distinct beats (first knot releases breath-shape, second knot releases man's voice about tide, final knot releases lullaby), and the mechanics (needle into knot, resistance then release) shape attempts and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary under starlight provides the frame for the entire action. Fractured light mirrors internal states, warmth beneath them signals progress, and the "lucid unrest" of the setting pressures Maren's choice to work at night. The columns and stone floor are tactile anchors that constrain the ritual space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across sharing a secret" is implicit: Maren's three-day discovery (archive mention), tonight's exhumation, and the shared confession ("This was the secret she had never shared"). The act of sharing the secret enables Elin's help, which disperses the silence. Time is present but not tightly dramatized as a ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Grounding restless spirits is the stated motivation, dramatized through action (unraveling each knot releases a voice). Internal friction: the spirits' unrest has become Maren's own accumulated silence, so the goal is both altruistic and self-preserving. Cost: years of voicelessness, the vulnerability of confession, the labor itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named explicitly and pervades the piece: "that strange wakefulness...when the world is too still and the mind too sharp." Tone modulates from solitary stillness to shared tension to final clearing. The final image—"open field where something, eventually, might choose to grow"—charges lucid unrest with hope, reweighting the earlier oppressive quiet.</comment>
