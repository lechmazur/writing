<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied—she weeps when the Stone sings, her throat aches from humming, tears freeze on her cheeks. The trait "logically emotional" is dramatized through her physics calculations and visceral grief working in tandem. The choice to match the Stone's broken frequency rather than force it back shows internal contradiction resolved under pressure. Minor slip: the predecessor's deathbed transfer feels like efficient setup rather than a choice Maren makes under present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Maren's raw throat, frozen tears, shaking body, and the physical ordeal of vibrational matching. The causal lens holds—she descends, diagnoses the frequency drop, matches it vocally, raises pitch incrementally, locks resonance, and the ice seals. The single meaningful tightening (Stone's decay threatens calving) drives the escalation cleanly. Orientation anchors (lighthouse engineer, Northern Fracture, crypt) arrive within the first two paragraphs. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key constrains choice: its tuning marks guide her diagnosis and its iron body becomes the tuning fork she strikes and holds to her throat. The Stone's pedestal, the narrow window's golden light, and the ice groaning around her all pressure the timeline and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency—she feels vibration in teeth, sternum, throat tissue. The drift-ice marina's instability (cracks, shifting platforms, calving threat) directly shapes the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent the marina from calving) is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through the Stone's frequency drop and Maren's shrinking time window. The escalation—matching broken frequency, enduring painful dissonance, raising pitch incrementally against resistance—is driven by her agency and method. The cost is on the page: throat ache, frozen sweat, seasick warble, tears. The final lock resolves through her sustained effort, and the cracks seal as direct consequence. One micro turn (Stone resists, then follows) supports the arc without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the specific ordeal: "some things endure not because they are strong but because someone chooses to match their breaking and sing them back." The concept of sonic absolution—release from dissonance, fractured things remembering wholeness—is earned through Maren's voiced matching and the climactic frequency lock, not stated abstractly. The key/pitch linguistic overlap deepens world logic. Minor slip: the final paragraph's thematic articulation ("she believed that some things endure...") borders on summary, though it follows the embodied climax and reweights prior particulars rather than replacing them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Maren's perceptual signature (engineer's precision, embodied sensation, marrow-deep response to sound). Diction modulates under pressure—"seasick warble," "sonic absolution," "flesh and frequency indistinguishable"—without register breaks. The phrase "logically emotional" and technical terms like "harmonic decay" and "vibrational matching" fit her idiom. Psychic distance tightens during the matching sequence. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short urgent beats ("The cracks sealed. The marina stilled.") contrast with longer sensory immersion. High information density—most lines advance situation, character, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "the Stone's voice" / "the Stone's vibration" / "the Stone's frequency" cycles synonyms across adjacent paragraphs. The metaphor "drift-ice marina groaned like a living body" and "tidal breath" cohere, but "wash of molten gold" is stock. No major scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language density stays controlled except in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of resonance physics, lighthouse-keeper tradition, and embodied matching offers a specific angle. The key-as-tuning-fork twist and the linguistic overlap (key/pitch in the old language) feel earned rather than imported. The choice to adapt rather than force repair avoids the expected fix-it arc. Minor friction: the drift-ice marina and sacred-artifact-maintains-ice premise echo familiar "fragile world, ritual sustains it" templates. Transformation is present but not radical; the ending's emotional truth and Maren's physicalized struggle elevate familiar elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's decision to adapt rather than force, her diagnosis of the frequency drop, and her sustained vocal matching drive all key beats. Her engineer identity shapes her method (calculate, diagnose, match incrementally). She appears early, acts in every beat, and her final choice (to become consonant, then shift together) directly produces closure. The coat is mentioned once as regulation uniform but does not constrain choice; the azure detail is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The key is signaled early (paragraph four), handled twice (she carries it down, strikes it against the pedestal), and its tuning marks guide her diagnosis. Its use as a tuning fork (struck, held near Stone, pressed to her throat) enables the matching method. It charges the final image indirectly (she holds it warm in her hand after success). It does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a second distinct choice, capping it below 8.5. Strong integration but one functional use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" is named explicitly and defined on the page: "release from dissonance—the moment when every fractured thing remembers its original wholeness and chooses to hold." It frames the climax (frequency lock as absolution) and reweights the stakes from repair to reconciliation. It shapes Maren's tactic (match, then raise) rather than mere thematic echo. Present setup, middle implication, and closure linkage. Specificity and causal pressure lift it above mid-band, but it remains more interpretive frame than object-like constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is dramatized: Maren calculates harmonic decay yet weeps at the Stone's voice; she understands physics and feels the sound in her marrow. This contradiction enables her method—she uses both technical diagnosis and embodied matching. It constrains her choice (she cannot force; she must become consonant first). Visible in setup, enacted in middle beats, and implicit in closure. Cost is present (throat pain, tears) but tied more to the action than the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Adapt" is the hinge: Maren rejects forcing the Stone back to original pitch and instead meets it where it is, then guides it home. This decision defines her method, differentiates her from prior keepers (implied), and drives the matching sequence. Setup establishes the need, middle enacts it across multiple beats (match broken frequency, raise incrementally), and closure validates it (cracks seal because she adapted). Removing "adapt" and substituting "repair" or "restore" would collapse the moral and tactical logic. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Vibrational matching" is named in paragraph six and taught through Maren's interiority: "You could not command a resonance. You had to become consonant with it first, then shift together." She enacts it across three beats (match Stone's frequency, hold painful dissonance, raise pitch incrementally). The method's mechanics—sympathy, synchronization—determine success. Setup, development (method shapes her choices under pressure), and closure all hinge on it. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; it is not swappable with generic "tuning" or "fixing."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina pressures stakes (calving threat) and timeline (shifting platforms, tidal groans). The crypt's narrow window tracks the fleeting sunset. The Stone's pedestal provides the surface she strikes. The setting's instability (cracks threading through foundation ice) is causally tied to the Stone's decay and resolution. Present in setup, pressures middle choices (she must succeed before ice splits), and implicit in closure (ice holds). Not merely postcard; it alters tactics and charges outcome. Strong but slightly below indispensable—story logic would survive transplant to a different fragile structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunset is tracked: "twenty minutes, maybe less" in paragraph one; "golden light through the crypt's narrow window was thinning" mid-crisis; "last golden light touched Maren's face" at closure; "the sun slipped away" final line. It tightens decisions (frequency window closes forever) and charges the final image. The clock alters her urgency and frames success as barely won. Present in setup, pressures middle, and pays off at closure. Solid integration; not swappable, though the mechanism (why sunset closes the window) remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire to protect the Stone and prevent calving is dramatized through every choice: she descends despite the threat, matches the Stone's painful frequency, endures physical cost. Friction between duty (generations of keepers maintained its tone) and present impossibility (Stone is dying) drives her adaptation. Setup, middle conflict (painful dissonance, aching throat), and closure all pivot on this motivation. Cost is visible. Strong integration; slightly below indispensable because the artifact's sacredness is asserted more than contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is sustained: the Stone's vibration moves through her flesh like warm water, bypassing thought, reaching marrow; she feels it in teeth, sternum, throat tissue; "flesh and frequency indistinguishable" at climax. Diction bridges body and transcendence throughout (embodied emotion, visceral response to boundless sensation). Tone modulates with pressure—precise in diagnosis, immersive during matching, quiet at closure. It charges the final image (body shaking with resonance, tears freezing) and coheres through all turns. No jarring tonal breaks.</comment>
