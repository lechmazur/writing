<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interior is specific and embodied—"bewildered still but no longer lost" lands with earned weight. The bathroom epiphany sequence avoids therapy-speak and delivers embodied realization through the concrete act of pressing the shell to her lips. Her final choice to hang the cameo and begin tending is motivated by her training as a curator, creating a satisfying link between profession and resolution. Minor deduction for the composite-face revelation arriving somewhat suddenly without prior dramatic groundwork in her resistances.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (orchard, book, cameo) that converge at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Maren shifts from possessing to tending with visible cost (hanging the cameo, accepting the burden of maintenance). Causality holds: coordinates → orchard → bathroom → question → knowledge → choice. The orientation anchor is slightly delayed (asteroid context arrives after the orchard description), but the disorientation reads purposeful and pays off when the impossible setting is dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard functions as more than backdrop: warm bark on an airless asteroid, the stone outhouse, and the grandmother-tree all constrain Maren's inquiry and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered—"fruit forming that looked like small green skulls" reflects her curatorial eye for strange particulars. The cameo hanging on a branch in impossible sunlight provides the micro-setting anchor that ties closure to place. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is understanding the inheritance; it's signaled early and tightens when three dealers refuse the cameo. The bathroom inquiry is a genuine turn—Maren's question unlocks knowledge that narrows her options to tend or possess, and she chooses with visible cost (releasing the cameo, accepting labor). The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length: confusion → inquiry → revelation → commitment. The forbidden-knowledge frame adds texture but remains slightly abstract; grounding it in the dealers' fear helps but doesn't fully dramatize the risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the cameo blank, the orchard-as-library, and the instruction "tend it" converge without thesis statement. The final image—portrait layering Maren's features over ancestral ones while she prunes—offers a resonant answer to what inheritance means without moralizing. "Love wearing its most complicated face" risks abstraction but is earned by the prior concrete struggle. The forbidden-knowledge concept integrates thematically as perspective rather than secret, and the curator profession deepens rather than decorates the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct—Maren notices through a curator's lens (legibility, display, composite layers). The voice modulates purposefully from bewilderment to trembling knowledge to calm tending. "Simply complicated" and "disquieting, luminous and terrible" risk elevated diction but stay within an educated narrator's register. The outhouse aside ("she did what she always did when the world became too much: she found a bathroom") injects character-specific rhythm. No head-hopping; narration respects what Maren can know at each moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is controlled with varied syntax and strong momentum. "The orchard had no business blossoming, and yet it did" sets voice and stakes efficiently. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor scaffold appears in "bright and disquieting, luminous and terrible" (near-synonym pair) and "touching everything, possessing nothing" feels slightly template-polished. The final paragraph's repetition of "she" openings (She walked / She pruned / She cleared / She let) creates purposeful rhythm but borders on template cadence; it reads intentional and voice-driven, so no heavy penalty applied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of nonlinear inheritance, curator protagonist, and astral orchard is specific and non-obvious. The bathroom-breakthrough frame could feel quirky but is grounded in Maren's consistent behavior and the outhouse's presence in the orchard. The pistachio-shell cameo and skull-shaped fruit tie back to the premise with earned particularity. The piece commits fully to its magical-realist premise and follows implications (breathing on an airless asteroid, time spirals) without hedging. Risk-taking in structure (nested temporal frames, inherited book with future pages) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's curatorial identity frames her approach and enables the final choice to tend rather than possess. Her bewilderment is present throughout, and her decision to inquire (going to the orchard, asking the question) drives the middle turn. The final act of hanging the cameo and beginning maintenance is a direct curator's choice. Present in setup, middle inquiry, and closure action—hits all three gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cameo appears early (velvet box, three dealers), drives the bathroom question ("What did you know?"), and returns transformed in the ending (hung on the branch, portrait layered with Maren's face). It's handled physically, rejected by experts, and becomes the vehicle for revelation. Removing it would collapse the inquiry mechanism and the closure image. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity; the blank-waiting-for-question insight is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance shapes the entire structure: the book dated 1796 to a future year, "each revelation unlocking the previous one," and the spiraling orchard visits. It determines Maren's confusion and the stakes (understanding vs. possessing). The phrase "simply complicated" echoes it. The concept is signaled early, constrains her approach (she must decode rather than inherit directly), and is dramatized in the time-layered orchard. Solid causal work across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" is used as a descriptor for the inheritance and echoed in the phrase itself. It flavors Maren's experience (bewildered but methodical) but doesn't visibly constrain a single on-page action with cost. It's more thematic accent than tactical pressure. Present in setup and thematic layering, but no middle choice hinges on this trait specifically. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Inquiry drives the structure: Maren goes to the orchard to inquire, her question to the cameo is the story's hinge, and the knowledge she receives leads directly to her choice to tend. The action is signaled early ("to inquire of whatever presence tended these impossible trees") and pays off in the bathroom beat. Removing inquiry would require fundamental rewrites; it's the method by which she engages the inheritance. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bathroom breakthrough is signaled as Maren's habit ("she did what she always did"), occurs on-page in the outhouse, and delivers the story's key revelation. The method is specific and character-rooted, and it enables the turn. However, it appears only once and could be replaced with another solitary-reflection setting (garden bench, locked study) without breaking causality. Present in middle and payoff gates, with moderate causal pressure but limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard is setup, middle action site, and closure image. Its impossible existence (trees breathing on an airless asteroid) creates the story's central pressure and mystery. The grandmother-tree, warm bark, stone outhouse, and fruit "like small green skulls" are all tactile and specific. Maren hangs the cameo on a branch and begins tending there. Removing the orchard setting would dismantle the inheritance metaphor and the closure act. Strong beat involvement, specificity, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is the book's instruction and frames Maren's temporal confusion ("three days ago, which was also somehow three centuries ago"). It flavors the nonlinear-inheritance concept but doesn't tighten her on-page decisions—she has no live clock and no deadline pressure. The timeframe is thematic more than tactical. Present in setup and as echo, but no middle choice is shaped by elapsed time or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Forbidden knowledge is signaled through the dealers' refusal and fear, drives Maren's trip to the orchard, and is redefined at the revelation ("not a secret but a perspective"). Her question "What did you know?" is motivated by this pursuit. The motivation creates early pressure and pays off in the middle turn. However, the "forbidden" frame remains slightly abstract—the dealers' reactions tell us it's forbidden, but no on-page cost (social, legal, physical) is paid for pursuing it. Solid setup and middle work; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Brightened disquiet is coherent throughout: "bewildered," "impossible," "disquieting and luminous," and the final "bright with a disquiet that was, she realized, simply love wearing its most complicated face." The tone modulates from confusion to trembling to calm tending, and the brightness intensifies as understanding arrives. The tone charges the final image and is indispensable to the story's emotional texture. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
