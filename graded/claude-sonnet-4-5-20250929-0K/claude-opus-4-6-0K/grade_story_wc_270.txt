<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maret's motivation is clear and her stance evolves through discovery to decisive action at the spring ceremony. Internal conflict is present—insurgent grandmother versus community elder—but her choices face little genuine doubt or competing impulse on the page. The granddaughter Pell and the high priest function as stage furniture rather than sources of pressure; Maret's agency is never seriously tested by relationship friction or personal cost. Embodied emotion is scarce; the protagonist moves through revelations without visceral hesitation or contradictory pulls.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery accumulates through the moss, lichen, and decoded script, then releases in the ceremony. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the amber dissolves, genetic material spirals outward, and children gain open futures. Orientation anchors are present early (reconstruction, hot springs, Maret's role). The cost is conceptual—tradition transformed, power structure challenged—but the emotional or social price to Maret personally remains abstract; no one resists her on the page and the high priest's "startled hands" vanish without consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs, sulfur lilies, and geothermal setting are vivid and specific; the ceremonial pool at closure uses the setting purposefully. The kite tail pinned across the kitchen wall and the lichen-warmed stone anchor discovery beats. However, spatial choreography at the ceremony is thin—crowd "murmured," Pell stood "ankle-deep," but no blocking, no physical resistance, no tactile struggle over the amber. The springs enable the resolution but do not constrain Maret's choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evolve tradition versus preserve hierarchy—is signaled early and drives the discovery arc. The decoded script provides one meaningful turn: original framework versus Conclave edits. Yet escalation is gentle; no genuine opposition appears, the priest offers no counter-invocation, and Maret's public challenge meets only a murmur. The dissolution of the amber is a conceptual climax but lacks felt cost or tactical sacrifice on the page; Maret wins unopposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: tradition as seed versus cage, shared inheritance versus imposed destiny. The final image—genetic threads dissolving into communal water, futures branching like root systems—reweights the premise without moralizing. The sulfur lilies' joy and Pell's gasp provide resonance. The line "reconstruction could finally begin for real" edges toward thesis statement but is saved by prior particularity. No heavy-handed summary; the root-language and plant telepathy serve theme without becoming allegorical stand-ins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited, and the voice carries a measured, earthy texture ("insurgency left that mattered," "sleepwalkers marched them straight into war"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maret notices plants, mineral processes, geothermal warmth. The priest and crowd remain voiceless; no dialogue tests subtext or advances plot, but the Global Dialogue Policy scores dialogue only when present. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she decided") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and imagery is concrete ("luminous threads," "veins of crystal"). The opening paragraph uses a template cadence: "healer, heretic, grandmother" list and "keeper of what grows" reads polished but slightly posed. Minor scaffold: "She did not want to destroy... She wanted to evolve" is explanatory where action could show. The moss "murmured," lichen "fed each meaning"—these are purposeful anthropomorphisms, not lazy filters. The final paragraph's "unpredictable, entangled, alive" nears stock catalog but is brief enough not to flatten closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-conflict reconstruction, telepathy with plants, and genetic destiny in amber is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother insurgent and plant-mediated knowledge avoid cliché through grounded detail. The kite-tail script as plot key is fresh. However, the unopposed ceremony and convenient decoding (lichen translate over two weeks off-page) reduce ingenuity; Maret's path to power feels more assured than hard-won. The transformation of tradition from leash to library is thematically strong but dramatized without genuine friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret drives every major beat: listens to plants, decodes the script, confronts the ceremony, unseals the amber herself. Her choices create the key turn and closure. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and high causal pressure. The insurgent-grandmother identity shapes her stance and the story's moral calculus with visible cost to hierarchy.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The embryo in amber is setup (Conclave tradition), developed (Maret's discovery of original purpose), and payoff (dissolved in the spring, releasing genetic threads). It appears in at least three beats and is irreplaceable; the closure image depends on its transformation from leash to shared inheritance. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Implanted destiny frames the conflict from paragraph three, shapes Maret's motivation to evolve tradition, and is reweighted at closure when the embryo dissolves into communal water instead of dictating one child's fate. The concept constrains Conclave power and enables Maret's insurgent stance with conceptual cost. Present across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plant telepathy enables Maret to decode the script (moss identifies root-language, lichen translate). It appears early and in two beats but is more enabler than constraint; no visible cost or tradeoff is shown for the gift. The attribute is specific and purposeful but does not narrow options or impose a price on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unsealing the amber is the climactic action; Maret takes it from the priest's hands and lowers it herself, using the original invocation. The action redefines the ceremony, transforms the embryo's role, and delivers the closure image. Major turn and payoff; irreplaceable. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kite tail with cryptic script is introduced early (Pell drags it home), decoded over two weeks via lichen, and its translation enables the ceremony reversal. It shapes two beats (discovery, decoding) and provides the method for the climax. Specificity is high—treated hide, angular glyphs, root-language—and it is irreplaceable. However, the decoding occurs mostly off-page (summary: "over the next two weeks"), weakening immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are present throughout: Maret kneels by them in the opening, they host the ceremony, and the amber dissolves in superheated water at closure. The springs enable the genetic release and symbolize transformation (cracking stone to reveal crystal). They pressure the ritual and supply the means for the ending. Strong setup, development, and payoff with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reconstruction timeframe is signaled early and contextualizes the conflict (post-ceasefire, tradition versus change). It shapes Maret's motivation and the story's stakes but does not impose a ticking clock or deadline. Present in setup and as backdrop but does not tighten tactics on the page. Functional but replaceable with another transitional period.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maret's desire to "evolve tradition with intent" is stated explicitly and dramatized through her decoding work and public challenge. It drives the discovery arc and the ceremony confrontation. The motivation is in friction with the Conclave's desire to preserve power, though that friction is more structural than embodied in on-page resistance. Setup, development, and payoff are clear; cost is conceptual.</comment>
