<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior voice is distinct and embodied throughout, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she came to die yet discovers "busy hands could quiet even a mind convinced of its own conclusion." The parasol tip's weight against her hip becomes a concrete anchor for her shifting stance. Minor deduction: the final paragraph's decision-making ("Or she would not") reads slightly telegraphed rather than fully earned by micro-choices in that moment, though the renunciation itself carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis—Maren's refusal to call the clinic forecloses the certain path with felt cost (the shimmer widens, time runs out). Orientation anchors by line 2 (Svalbard, clinic, tumor). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the fold in patience deepens through repeated trawling, the parasol discovery, and the final waterfront moment that reweights "endings" from a single sound to a constellation of textures. One meaningful tightening occurs when she stops counting mornings, narrowing her frame from clinic-certainty to drift-present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vivid and purposeful: "walls of sea ice that the current pushed in and rearranged each morning like furniture in a restless house" anchors both setting and theme. The cold becomes "a second skeleton," and the grapple's snag on the parasol tip is the pivot that charges her final stance. Spatial choreography remains clear across boat, waterfront, and piers. The parasol tip—a micro-object—functions as setting extension and constrains her final choice by embodying survival's limits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to proceed with the appointment) is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: she stops counting mornings. The escalation is textural—busy hands, the parasol's weight, shared coffee—accumulating pressure that makes the final refusal legible. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: the shimmer widens, the clinic calls, and she chooses the drift-present over certain closure. The cost is undeniable in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges strictly through particulars: the parasol tip as a census-entry life, endings as "the creak of a dock bearing weight it was never designed for." No moralizing; the final image offers a resonant answer—endings are plural, textural, and lived rather than scheduled. The fold in patience (concept) braids with windborne solace (tone) to reweight the premise without thesis. Maren's arc is inseparable from the thematic question, and the story resists tidy resolution while remaining coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: "the shimmer ate another degree of her peripheral vision," "the way a child holds a coin over a wishing well." Distance remains stable; interiority is compressed under crisis without filter-verb stacks. The two Norwegians remain silent—no dialogue—so voice distinction is not tested. Diction stays within Maren's lexicon (no corporate drift). The final "loosely" echoes the opening "gripped reality loosely," but the internal texture has shifted, charging the reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or paraphrase redundancy; information density is high (every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during the snag ("She hauled it up"), longer reflection during the parasol moment. Minor deduction: "someone whose name was now just a census entry, whose ending had come" carries a faint synonym echo ("whose… whose") that slightly loosens momentum, though it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is concentrated but coherent (wishing well, second skeleton, river rounding a bend).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourism frame is familiar, but the drift-ice marina and trawling work offer fresh angles. The parasol tip—antique lace wrapped around brass—is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that charges the ending. Risk-taking is present (accumulative structure, quiet refusal) but does not reach bold unconventionality. The transformation test: plot and arc would lose coherence with different setting or object, so originality is earned through particulars rather than premise alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive key turns: signing up for trawling (early), stopping the count (middle), and walking to the waterfront instead of answering the clinic (closure). All three gates present; causal pressure narrows options; closure linkage clear. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Parasol tip appears in beat 2 (the snag), beat 3 (weight against hip during shift), and beat 4 (held up to Arctic light at closure). It reweights meaning from ornament to survival limit. Specific irreplaceability (antique lace, brass spoke) and closure linkage earn high score. Cost tied to it: the choice to walk back "for one more pass" rather than call the clinic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fold appears in the opening line and deepens across the story ("The fold in her patience deepened over the following days"). It shapes stakes by creating room for volunteering and reweighting time. Present in closure logic (she shifts "loosely" rather than rigidly). Causal role in middle choice (stops counting). Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" appears in paragraph 1, constrains her perception (the shimmer), and enables the final stance ("she shifted with it, loosely"). Visible tradeoff: loose grip allows drift-present but forfeits clinic certainty. The trait shapes the closure image and is irreplaceable. Cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Trawling drives setup (she signs up to avoid sitting), middle (the parasol snag happens during trawling), and closure (she decides "one more pass" at the waterfront). Major turns trace to this action; swapping it would break the story's logic. Causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early (hostel corkboard), its mechanics matter (grapple lines, debris field), and it shapes all middle attempts. The work enables the parasol discovery and keeps her hands busy, altering her stance. Present in closure decision ("walked back to the boat"). All three gates; strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina pressures every choice: the cold enters her lungs, the ice shifts beneath the pier, the shattered fuel dock is where the parasol snags. Setting supplies the grapple (resource) and the groaning piers (final image anchor). Micro-setting (boat, waterfront) alters tactics. Closure image depends on this exact setting. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"On the fourth morning she woke up changed" signals the timeframe. The shift tightens her stance and occurs before the parasol discovery. Closure references the time pressure (clinic calls, she delays). Setup and payoff present; middle development implicit (days pass, she stops counting). Causal role modest but legible.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized in the opening (she "wanted to learn the sound of approaching endings") and reconfigured at closure ("Endings… had no single sound"). Friction between want (certainty) and cost (the shimmer, time) drives middle choices. The desire shapes the final refusal. Setup, development, payoff all clear; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tone coheres across turns: "windborne and sourceless, the way hymns carry through stone walls" in beat 2, modulates under pressure (the cold as "enormous"), and charges the final image ("wind across a floe"). The solace is present but not static—it deepens as she shifts from fear to acceptance. Tone integral to closure effect.</comment>
