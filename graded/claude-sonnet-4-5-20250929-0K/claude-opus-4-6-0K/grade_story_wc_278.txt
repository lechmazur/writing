<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority relies heavily on metaphor and atmospheric assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The backstory arrives as exposition rather than emergent pressure: "she had carried her own dissonance" is told, not shown through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The final act—placing amber, feeding letters—reads as ritual more than conflicted decision; no visible foreclosure of an alternate path. The piece gestures toward earned change but delivers it through symbolic machinery rather than dramatized internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure unit (sound cancellation, emotional resolution) occurs on the page but cost is asserted rather than legible: "felt the dissonance drain" tells us relief without showing what Maren sacrifices or forecloses. The time-fold is announced ("time folded in on itself") but not causally integrated—no prior constraint or price shapes her tactics. Orientation anchors arrive early (laboratory, Maren, evening descent), satisfying that test. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in design, but the final "meteor hush" moment reweights meaning primarily through metaphor rather than a concrete on-page alteration of options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The laboratory is vivid and purposeful: "ghost tape," "haunted firmware," and the Loom anchor atmosphere and generate the cry that drives discovery. The amber functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (stairs, basement, Loom, escritoire). The piece slightly over-relies on atmospheric assertion ("meteor hush," "folded dark") in place of immediate sensory grounding, but setting constrains Maren's final choice—she uses the Loom's resonance plate—earning the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing inherited guilt—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through discovery (cry, letters, grandmother's secret) but no on-page reversal narrows Maren's options or forces a trade-off; she executes a solution without visible cost or blocked alternative. The Loom's "counter-wave" resolves the cry conveniently, and Maren's choice to leave is declared rather than tested. One meaningful deepening (realizing the cry is her grandmother's child) occurs, placing the piece in mid-6s, but escalation lacks a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (witness as resolution, guilt preserved until acknowledged) emerges from concrete action—the Loom, letters, amber—without overt statement. The amber's shift from "tethered forever" to "at rest" reweights prior imagery with purpose. The final climb toward "morning unfolded and new" offers resonance without moralizing. Minor slip: "Some things are preserved so they can finally be witnessed" borders on thesis-statement, but it's attributed to the grandmother and earns its place by charging the closure. The piece resists tidy binaries and the thematic question remains anchored to particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "meteor hush," "constellation-covered hands," "fox-spotted" letters. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the atmospheric frame. Minor weaknesses: "the sound of a wound preserved in the architecture" and similar constructions border on abstraction that asserts meaning rather than dramatizing it. Filter verbs ("felt the dissonance drain," "recognized the penmanship") slightly dull immediacy at peak beats. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries personality and purpose throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Two frictions lower the score: (1) minor metaphor muddle—"time folded" then "clocks softened" then "hours nested" stacks abstractions without anchoring the effect in action; (2) near-paraphrase at closure: "silence of resolution. Meteor hush" repeats the same idea across adjacent lines. Information density is strong in early beats (tattooist backstory, Loom mechanics) but thins at the ending where assertion replaces scene pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Proofreading is clean. Prose is polished but not flawless under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—tattooist-turned-sound-keeper, haunted firmware, guilt-as-frequency—feels specific and non-obvious. The amber's dual function (inheritance token, resonance tool) transforms a familiar motif. Risk-taking in structure (time fold, lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning mild bonus consideration. The piece avoids template plotting and commits fully to its premise. Minor limitation: the counter-wave resolution, while thematically apt, leans toward symbolic convenience rather than a hard-won tactical choice. Still, the vision is singular and the ending reconfigures prior material with purpose.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as constellation tattooist frames her perceptual signature (mapping, precision) and is signaled early. The trait informs her shift to "mapping something else: the sounds that time had swallowed," providing thematic continuity. However, the tattooist background does not constrain or enable a key on-page choice; her decisions at closure (placing amber, feeding letters) could proceed identically if she were any other keeper. The element shapes voice and backstory but remains replaceable in the causal chain. Present in setup and thematically linked to closure, but no middle beat involvement and no specific cost tied to this identity. Two gates (setup, thematic closure echo) met; eligible to ~6.0. Lyric reprise is present but does not reweight a live stake with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber appears early (Maren wears it) and returns at closure where she places it on the Loom's resonance plate to enable the counter-wave. Two distinct beats: (1) mention as inheritance with thematic seed ("preserved so they can finally be witnessed"), (2) active use that enables resolution. The object's properties (suspended fly, grandmother's gift) are specific and charge the final image with meaning. Strong causal linkage to closure and thematic resonance. Minor limitation: the amber does not constrain a middle choice or impose visible cost—it functions as key rather than obstacle. Three gates met (setup, closure payoff; middle development absent). Causal pressure at closure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, early signal +0.5; missing middle beat −0.4, resolves without prior friction −0.9. Lands solidly in 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early, drives discovery (the Loom captures the cry and parses it), and generates the counter-wave tactic at closure. The concept is specific (self-rewriting code, dead engineer's intentions) and irreplaceable—without it, Maren has no mechanism to translate or cancel the cry. Three beats: (1) setup and world-rule explanation, (2) parsing the cry into "guilty," (3) enabling the counter-wave resolution. All three gates met. Causal pressure across beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, early signal +0.6. Minor friction: the firmware's mechanics at closure (translating letter pressure into sound frequency) are asserted rather than demonstrated, slightly reducing felt necessity. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cry-translation algorithm is seeded early ("designed to translate baby cries into their root needs") and enables the pivotal beat where the output "guilty" reframes Maren's quest. It appears again implicitly when the firmware translates letters into counter-frequency. Two beats: discovery and closure mechanics. The trait is specific to Maren's skillset and irreplaceable for this plot. Minor weaknesses: the algorithm is summary-only at closure (we're told it works, not shown constraint or cost), and the trait does not impose a tradeoff—it functions as pure enabler. Three gates met (setup, middle discovery, closure participation). Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.5, specificity +0.5; summary-only use −0.6. Lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The verb "tether" appears in two contexts: "tethered to the place" (the wound/cry) and "She would tether no more ghosts" (final renunciation). The action shapes thematic closure but does not drive a major turn—Maren's choice to stop tethering is declared, not tested against an on-page cost or alternative. The tethering metaphor connects the amber's suspended fly and the grandmother's guilt, providing thematic coherence, but removing "tether" and using "bind" or "anchor" would not alter plot logic. Two gates: setup (cry tethered to place) and closure (renunciation statement). No middle causal beat. Lyric reprise +0.4, closure presence +0.7, early signal +0.3; swappable synonym −0.6, ornamental at closure (stated, not enacted) −0.7. Caps at ~4.6 for missing middle development; actual integration slightly exceeds minimum, landing mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Handwritten letters are discovered in the antique escritoire after the time fold and provide the material Maren feeds into the spectrograph to generate the counter-wave. The method is specific: "read the pressure of the pen, the hesitations, the places where tears had warped the paper." Two beats: discovery (second half) and use at closure. The letters' physical properties matter causally—the spectrograph translates them into frequency. All three gates met (late setup ~midpoint, middle discovery, closure mechanics). Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6; late arrival (past first third) −0.4, summary mechanics at closure −0.5. Strong closure participation elevates past mid-band despite late introduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory pressures every major beat: it houses the Loom (discovery mechanism), the escritoire (letter source), and the resonance plate (resolution tool). The setting is textured (ghost tape, spectrographs, spiral stairs, basement of collapsed building) and causally essential—remove the laboratory and no plot event can occur. Three beats minimum: Maren's nightly descent, cry discovery, and counter-wave enactment. The environment supplies resources that enable the outcome. All three gates met. Causal pressure across beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, early signal +0.7, specificity +0.6. No meaningful frictions. Solidly high-7s for indispensable setting that shapes tactics and charges atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The time fold is announced at the story's turn ("time folded in on itself") and enables the appearance of the escritoire and letters. The timeframe reweights atmosphere ("meteor hush," "hours nested inside minutes") but does not tighten decision pressure or constrain Maren's tactics—she proceeds without a live clock or visible tradeoff shaped by temporal compression. Two gates: middle introduction (fold enables discovery) and thematic echo at closure ("toward a morning unfolded and new"). Setup is absent (time operates normally until the fold). Causal enabler +0.8, thematic reprise +0.5, specificity (fold metaphor) +0.4; missing setup −0.4, does not constrain choice −0.7, ornamental at closure −0.5. Caps at ~4.6 for missing setup; mild lyric payoff lifts to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to "hush the dissonance of old guilt" is seeded early ("static hum beneath every family gathering") and drives her career shift to the laboratory. The desire is tested at closure when she enacts the counter-wave and chooses to leave, foreclosing her role as keeper. Three beats: setup (dissonance mentioned), discovery (recognizing the cry as her grandmother's wound), and closure (hushing enacted, path forward chosen). Internal friction is mild—Maren proceeds without visible competing want—but the motivation is consistent and tied to cost (leaving the laboratory, gathering letters). All three gates met. Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, early signal +0.6; told-only interiority at key beats −0.5, mild friction between want and cost −0.4. Solidly low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrase "meteor hush" is introduced early as descriptor ("that vast, weightless silence that follows a streak of light") and returns at closure ("silence of resolution. Meteor hush"). Tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: atmospheric and lyric throughout, tightening at discovery, softening at resolution. The tone charges the final image by repeating the key phrase with reweighted meaning (from cosmic metaphor to earned emotional state). Two beats: setup and closure reprise. Missing middle modulation under stress. Lyric reprise that reweights +1.2, coherent modulation +0.8, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.0; static mid-story (no tonal shift at peak pressure) −0.6, slight over-reliance on assertion −0.5. Three gates met but middle is weak. Lands mid-to-high 6s.</comment>
