<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her hands-on work and quiet waiting establish a coherent internal world. The breach moment ("This is the breach…") risks over-articulation but remains rooted in physical action (uncapping the ink pot, photographing the cartoons). Her choice to keep the cartoons and pursue publication is earned by prior material, though the father comparison feels slightly imposed rather than dramatized. Minor: the self-portrait observation ("perpetually caught between two worlds") edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through Elara's deepening engagement with Dariush's story, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—she completes his sentence rather than solving her father's con-artist legacy). Cost is legible: she carries the cartoons and the obligation forward. Orientation anchors by line ~80 (prep room, Tuesday, Dariush arrives). One micro-deduction: the breach paragraph slightly over-explains the shift rather than trusting image alone, but closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prep room functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: fluorescent hum, chemical sharpness, steel counter all ground Elara's tactile work. The ink pot's glass and brass textures recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (counter, body, hands, plastic bag). Minor: "death carries a strange vitality" is told rather than shown in sensory particulars, though the vitality conceit pays off at the ending ("something stubbornly, deathly alive").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elara's search for fair-trade mathematics versus her father's con-artist legacy. The uncapping of the ink pot and discovery of cartoons deepens pressure by dissolving her clinical distance. One meaningful tightening: she must decide whether to keep the cartoons and act. Cost is visible (she carries the obligation out). Minor: the father's hypothetical ability to secure asylum is stated rather than dramatized as a present tension, slightly weakening the contrast.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the ink pot, the doorway self-portrait, the mathematics of completion versus balance. The final image ("she carries it out with her into the morning") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The breach dissolves rigid thinking via concrete action (photographing cartoons, planning publication). One slip: "the mathematics of a fair trade is not balance. It is completion" edges toward thesis statement, though it follows embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara's clinical precision ("steel counter," "fluorescent lights hum with animal insistence") modulates under emotional pressure without losing coherence. Diction remains character-specific (trade mathematics, "honest customers," embalming fluid). Minor: "The irony coats Elara's throat like embalming fluid" is strong, but the explanatory clause that follows ("the con artist could have saved…") over-articulates the irony rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, concise, rhythmically varied. Strong propulsion through most beats. Two friction points: "The honest child of a con artist learns one thing above all others…" opener reads slightly thesis-like; the breach paragraph contains minor synonym churn ("rigid thinking…membrane…perpetually caught") and over-explains the shift. No loops or scaffolding elsewhere. Information density is high, supporting escalation without drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The funeral-home frame combined with political asylum and the con-artist's honest child offers a fresh synthesis. The ink pot as vessel for final cartoons is purposeful. Risk: quiet accumulative design trusts image over drama. Minor deduction: the father-as-foil remains conceptual rather than embodied in a scene; the irony is stated rather than dramatized through a specific memory or choice that tests Elara's stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (con artist's honest child) is present throughout, framing the opening and driving the breach/closure choice to photograph and publish. Her attribute shapes the dominant stake (fair-trade mathematics vs. father's con) and her decision to act on Dariush's behalf. The father contrast is invoked repeatedly but remains slightly told rather than dramatized in a scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot is introduced early (plastic bag inventory), handled on-page (uncapping, discovering cartoons), and returned at closure (placed between Dariush's hands). It enables the key turn (finding the cartoons) and charges the final image. Its brass and glass textures recur with reweighted meaning. Highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Political asylum shapes Dariush's backstory and the regime/system stakes. It constrains his prior choices (fleeing, being detained) and provides thematic weight. On-page, it informs Elara's understanding but does not directly alter her present tactics—she would perform the same prep work regardless. Solid thematic participation, lighter causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is embodied in the breach moment: the cartoons dissolve Elara's clinical distance, forcing her to act. The attribute is signaled early (her rigid maintenance of professional distance) and paid off in the middle turn. Cost: she must now carry the obligation forward. The liquefying is slightly over-explained in prose but the action is clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Breach" is named and dramatized: Elara crosses from clinical distance to personal witness when she uncaps the ink pot and finds the cartoons. This turn redefines her options and drives the closure choice to publish. The breach is signaled ("Not a dramatic one…") and its consequences are carried forward. Slightly on-the-nose naming, but causal work is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is defined early ("watching, listening, cataloging") and applied in the prep room ("She waits now with Dariush…and lets his story assemble itself"). It shapes her method of discovery (patient observation leading to the ink pot reveal). Functional but not irreplaceable—passive observation could achieve similar effect. Mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is present throughout, providing sensory anchors (fluorescent lights, chemicals, steel counter) and micro-setting resources (the body, the ink pot on the counter). It constrains her work (clinical precision) and charges the final image ("switches off the fluorescent light"). The room's "deathly vitality" theme is woven through action. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Timeframe: None specified.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is stated early and dramatized through Elara's prep work, her breach choice, and the closure realization ("completion" vs. "balance"). The motivation drives her decision to photograph and publish. Friction: the final articulation ("the mathematics of a fair trade is not balance…") is told rather than fully embodied in a concrete choice. Strong thematic participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is seeded early ("death carries a strange vitality," fluorescent hum, chemicals "sharp and alive") and modulates through the breach without breaking. The tone charges the final image ("something stubbornly, deathly alive"). Coherent and purposeful across beats, supporting the accumulative design. Minor: one phrase is label-like, but the sensory work earns the tone.</comment>
