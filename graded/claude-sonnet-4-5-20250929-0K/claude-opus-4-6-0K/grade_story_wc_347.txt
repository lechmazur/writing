<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"offhandedly exact attention," the counting nut ritual, her deliberate avoidance of touch. The curse constraint creates genuine struggle: she cannot simply fix things but must engineer solutions through indirect means, which drives micro-choices (wrapped pry bar, kicked doors, sung notes). Internal contradiction appears in her hatred of the orchard paired with her commitment to the duty, though the piece could press harder on what she loses by staying. The final choice to guide the families is understated but earned by prior setup; the cost is her continued entrapment in this role, visible in the image of the nut sitting on the blueprint "like a period at the end of a sentence finally written."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens: Maren finds the blueprint → realizes a safer route exists → works to open it before frost → guides families through. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she has completed one duty cycle but remains bound to the role, the orchard, and the labyrinth. Cost is legible in the final image—the mechanical birds settling, the orchard creaking, the nut as a punctuation mark on her continued sentence. One meaningful tightening occurs when frost becomes imminent and three families are inbound. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (Maren, cliffside orchard/labyrinth, present moment tending). The blueprint discovery and its use form a clear because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, cursed orchard, and mechanical birds create a vivid, constraint-rich environment. The setting drives multiple choices: mechanical birds force careful movement and provide light when she sings; the curse prohibits direct touch, shaping all her tactics; frost on the old switchbacks makes the new passage essential. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Maren's priorities—stone exhaling cold, salt air as "a slap of grace," the passage's "graceless beauty." The counting nut, pry bar, and lanterns function as micro-setting elements that constrain action. The final image at the harbor charges the environmental particulars with meaning. Spatial choreography (terrace depths, stairs, harbor shelf) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: keep the labyrinth passage lit and safe for travelers, now urgent with frost coming and families expected. The blueprint discovery tightens the problem—a better route exists but must be cleared in four hours before frost makes the old path lethal. Maren's agency is visible in every beat: she assesses the blueprint, chooses the tools, clears the rubble, and guides the families. The curse constraint forces trade-offs (no direct touch) that shape tactics. One clear escalation: frost arrives, old path becomes "silver and lethal," families appear. The cost is her continued duty and the "graceless" nature of the solution—it works but offers no beauty or release. No convenient resolutions; the mechanical birds and curse remain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between duty, constraint, and graceless efficacy. The counting nut and blueprint function as motifs that reweight at closure: planning becomes action, the sentence is written but not ended. "Graceless beauty" operates throughout—the ugly passage that saves lives, Maren's indirect methods that work without elegance, the cursed orchard that anchors a necessary route. The final image ("like a period at the end of a sentence finally written") answers the thematic question: this duty is cyclical, each act of care a temporary close before the next. No moralizing or abstraction; insight arises from Maren's specific choices and the story's particulars. The piece resists tidy resolution—families are saved, but Maren remains bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization through Maren; perceptual signature is consistent (she measures, mutters exact distances, handles tools with precision). Diction matches her pragmatic stance: "offhandedly exact," "graceless beauty," no purple ornament. POV modesty holds—she infers the birds' logic but doesn't claim omniscience. The single line of dialogue ("This way. Watch the seventh step, it's narrow.") is perfectly in character: minimal, functional, focused on the immediate task. Psychic distance is stable; the prose reflects her practical mind under pressure. No filter-verb excess or head-hopping. Voice remains controlled through the emotional arc, compressing slightly under time pressure without losing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or scaffold loops detected. Information density is high—nearly every line advances situation, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and grounded: "trees jutting from limestone like broken fingers," "salt air hit her face like a slap of grace." No mixed metaphors or register drift. Action sequence is clear (find blueprint → assess → clear passage → guide families) with no simultaneity errors. Two minor friction points: "the small nut—not a fastener, but an actual hazelnut" briefly stalls to clarify, and "offhandedly exact attention" in the opening section slightly overexplains the trait. These are hairline; the closure beat is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of cursed orchard, mechanical bird sentinels, and touch-prohibition creates a fresh synthesis. The "leaving impressions without touching" constraint is specific and generative, forcing tactical ingenuity (singing to activate bird-lights, using wrapped tools). The counting nut ritual and blueprint discovery feel organic rather than checklist. Emotional specificity—Maren's hatred of the orchard paired with dutiful care—avoids generic caretaker tropes. The "graceless beauty" framing resists romanticizing either the setting or the protagonist's role. One small limitation: the mechanical birds, while vivid, lean toward familiar steampunk aesthetics without full transformation. The closing image (nut as period) is earned and non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren as reluctant caretaker is signaled in the opening line ("hated every single one of them") and drives every choice: she inherits the duty unwillingly but commits to it when lives are at stake. Her decisions create all major turns—blueprint assessment, passage clearing, family guidance. The attribute appears in three distinct beats (blueprint study, clearing work, final guidance) and charges the closure: she completes the task but remains bound. Visible cost: her continued entrapment in a role she never wanted, legible in the final image of the orchard creaking above and the nut marking an unfinished sentence. The reluctance-duty tension is embodied throughout, not merely labeled.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The counting nut appears in three beats: introduction with grandmother's lore, placement on the blueprint to mark the starting point, and final image where it sits "like a period at the end of a sentence finally written." It shapes one key choice (marking the plan's readiness) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure—what began as a planning token becomes a symbol of cyclical duty. Not fully indispensable (the blueprint could anchor the plan alone), but the ritual adds specificity and the final reprise charges the ending. Setup by first third, development in planning phase, strong payoff in closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blueprint drives the entire plot: its discovery creates the option, its details (seventeen meters, lower level, sealed doors) shape tactics, and following it enables the safe passage. Without this exact element, Maren would have no alternative route and the families would face the lethal frost-covered switchbacks. It appears in four beats: discovery, study, clearing execution (following its map), and implied presence in the final image (the nut on the blueprint). Earliest signal by paragraph four, clear causal pressure throughout, essential to closure. Visible cost: Maren must execute the plan under time pressure with her curse constraint, and the passage's success binds her more tightly to her duty.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is demonstrated in Maren's precise measurement ("Seventeen meters below the third terrace"), her blueprint assessment, and the counting nut ritual. It enables her planning and tactical choices but isn't stressed as a trade-off or constraint—she simply possesses this trait and uses it competently. Present in two beats (blueprint study, final guidance about the narrow seventh step), but no visible cost attached; it's pure competence rather than a double-edged attribute. Setup early, functional in middle, minor echo at closure. Contributes but doesn't create unavoidable friction or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The assembly action (clearing rubble, propping doors, hanging lanterns, singing to activate bird-lights) occupies the story's longest beat and creates the solution. Every major turn traces to this work: the passage becomes viable, the families can descend safely, Maren fulfills her duty. The curse constraint makes "assemble" more complex than simple construction—she cannot touch directly, forcing creative methods. Setup after blueprint discovery, dominates the middle section, pays off when families descend and "every one of them arrived safe." Removing this action collapses the plot; no substitute would preserve the story's logic and the constraint-driven ingenuity it showcases.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The no-touch method is introduced early ("the curse made direct contact dangerous," grandmother's technique) and shapes every action in the clearing sequence: leather-wrapped pry bar, kicked doors, hung lanterns by wire handles, sung notes to activate birds. It appears in at least three distinct beats and creates visible constraints—Maren cannot simply grab and move things. The method is specific and irreplaceable; swapping to normal construction would eliminate the story's central tactical challenge. Cost: the work is slower, more awkward, and requires constant vigilance. Strong setup, sustained through development, implicit in closure (the passage she "opened but never touched").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds creates multiple pressures: birds shriek if you move too quickly, they recognize Maren only by her grandmother's key, their glass eyes project light when she sings. The setting is the only passage between highland and harbor, making it essential. The curse-touched orchard sits at its heart. Birds supply light for the clearing work; the labyrinth's geometry (switchbacks, terraces, sealed lower level) drives the blueprint's value. Frost on the labyrinth stairs makes them lethal. Setup immediate, pressures throughout, closure depends on navigating this exact space. Removing the labyrinth or birds would require complete story redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Time pressure is signaled early ("The frost would come tonight") and tightened progressively: Maren feels it in the stone's cold exhalation, mechanical birds tuck wings, and she has four hours to clear the passage before three families arrive. The clock is tracked—"She worked for four hours"—and pays off when "The frost came, painting the old switchbacks silver and lethal" just as families appear. The timeframe shapes every tactical choice (speed of clearing, tool selection) and makes the accomplishment meaningful. Present in three beats (prediction, work montage, arrival), with visible consequence. Not swappable; a leisurely timeline would deflate all urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Guiding travelers is Maren's inherited duty, stated early and tested throughout. She hates the orchard but commits when "three families from Ashgrove were expected through before dawn, children among them." The motivation drives her choice to clear the passage and her final action of guiding them down. Some friction appears—she didn't ask for this role—but the story doesn't press the internal conflict hard; she acts pragmatically rather than wrestling with the choice. Present in setup (inherited duty), development (urgent families inbound), and closure (actual guidance). Cost is her continued entrapment. Motivation is clear and causal but could carry more visible ambivalence or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("trees jutting from limestone like broken fingers") and sustained: harsh beauty in the mechanical birds, the "graceless beauty of the passage," salt air as "a slap of grace." The tone modulates with pressure—colder and more compressed during clearing work, slightly warmer at the harbor moment—and charges the final image (cursed orchard creaking, nut on blueprint, "sentence finally written"). Coherent through all turns, never sentimental or overwrought. The phrase "graceless beauty" appears explicitly and implicitly anchors description throughout. Strong setup, consistent development, purposeful modulation under stress, clear presence in closure. Nearly indispensable; a different tone would require rewriting key images.</comment>
