<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation is clear and embodied through her consistent practice of listening rather than forcing. Her decision to display the locket rather than open the mailbox shows character-specific restraint earned by prior action. The woman's arrival and confession feel somewhat convenient, and her emotional arc compresses rapidly without enough contradictory impulses in the telling moment. Internal conflict remains largely retrospective rather than dramatized in real-time choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clean Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Marguerite's curatorial practice transforms an inherited burden into shared story, and the mailbox remains sealed with visible cost (the woman's tears, sixty years of carrying alone). The narrative gathers pressure through neighborhood fragments that converge when the construction intrudes. One weakness: the woman's arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than motivated by Marguerite's active listening, though the closure image reweights the locked box motif with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with "bruised orange light" and "amber stillness," and the jasmine trellis anchors spatial continuity. The green mailbox constrains Marguerite's choice (she listens rather than pries), and the construction noise creates temporal pressure that charges the final quiet. The thrift shop interior receives less texture, but the courtyard setting decisively shapes the story's contemplative rhythm and the woman's bench confession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether listening can heal versus forcing open the mystery—coheres throughout and tightens when the woman arrives with the locket. Marguerite's agency is renunciation (not opening the box), which forecloses the direct-action path with visible cost on the page. The escalation relies on accumulation of neighborhood fragments rather than a protagonist-driven turn, and the woman's confession arrives through situational coincidence rather than Marguerite's active pressure, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Marguerite's curatorial method and the mailbox's persistent whisper: some doors open only through listening, and the act of holding a story can release its weight. The locket in the window—"An unsent letter of forgiveness, sealed for sixty years"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights the locked mailbox as a choice rather than a problem, and the construction/sandstorm frame charges the courtyard's stillness with conceptual cost. Minor slip: "that is what curators do" edges toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that filters the courtyard through a jeweler's patience ("uncut stones"). Psychic distance is stable, and the woman's direct speech carries goal-driven subtext. One register slip: "the weight of carrying it alone" and "because that is what curators do" drift toward slightly elevated summary at closure beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the woman's lines advance plot without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Opening and closing images are strong, and information density is high with no paraphrase loops. Some figurative language borders on overwriting: "bruised orange light," "eye of a sandstorm," and "amber suspension" cluster in the frame without clear pattern payoff. The simile "like a locket turning on its chain" is elegant but slightly precious. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and spatial choreography stays clear. Minor template cadence in the neighborhood-gathering section ("Old Tomasz…Dina…") but functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The curator-as-listener premise offers a fresh angle on the mystery-box trope, and the mailbox's refusal to open inverts typical narrative satisfaction. The accumulation of neighborhood fragments and the locket-as-closure device feel specific and non-obvious. However, the wise-curator-who-knows-by-not-knowing arc follows a familiar spiritual-wisdom template, and the construction crew as "outside world intrusion" is a stock framing device. The ending's restraint is admirable but doesn't transform the premise beyond its initial implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's curatorial discernment drives her choice to listen rather than pry, and her final decision to display the locket (not open the mailbox) is the story's key turn. Her occupation shapes perception throughout. Setup early, middle listening beats, and closure action all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The locket appears in the woman's hand, is described with its photograph and address, and becomes the display object in the window with reweighted meaning. It bridges the mailbox mystery to closure and carries the forgiveness theme. Three beats: arrival, confession catalyst, window display.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox is the story's central image, appears in paragraph three, drives Marguerite's listening practice, and remains sealed at closure with visible cost (the shift from problem to choice). Its locked state constrains tactics throughout and charges the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is enacted via Marguerite's method of gathering neighborhood fragments rather than chasing the woman directly. It constrains her approach (she "let it lead her") and shapes the middle accumulation. The attribute is more method than visible tradeoff; cost is present but diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Hear" anchors Marguerite's practice from the mailbox's metallic whisper through neighborhood conversations to the woman's full story. The act of hearing (versus prying) defines her agency and the story's central question. Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and implicit in the closure choice. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (Tomasz, Dina, florist, teacher) and its mechanics matter: fragments accumulate to locate the woman. The method shapes Marguerite's middle tactics and demonstrates the "listening heals" premise. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the woman's arrival validates the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered and houses the mailbox, providing spatial continuity and the "amber stillness" tone. It supplies the bench for the woman's confession and contrasts with the construction noise. Constrains the story to one charged location and appears in the final image. Strong setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" arrives explicitly with the construction crew on Tuesday, creating temporal pressure and breaking the suspended stillness. It signals the closure beat but does not tighten earlier decisions. Appears late (final third) and functions more as atmospheric punctuation than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marguerite's conviction that "listening heals" is stated early and drives her refusal to pry. The story enacts the premise through her curatorial choices, and the woman's relief at being heard validates it. However, the motivation is more thesis than conflicted desire; there's no visible cost to Marguerite's patience, and no competing impulse dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is taught in the opening simile and sustained through "amber stillness," "impossibly still," and the mailbox's whisper. Tone modulates when construction roars but holds interior quiet during the confession. The final image returns to stillness with the persistent whisper. Coherent through turns and charges closure effectively.</comment>
