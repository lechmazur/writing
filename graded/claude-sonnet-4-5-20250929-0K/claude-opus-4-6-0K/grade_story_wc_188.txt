<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's interiority is concrete and embodied—the chant keeping "the weight at arm's length," the "gravity" tugging at her sternum. Her motivation to offer free fireworks emerges organically from her profession and financial ruin, and the mosaic message crystallizes her stance with visible cost (using salvaged materials, walking toward a village with no guarantee). Minor friction: her laugh after reading the message ("not bitterly, but with a serious kind of playfulness") edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, though it remains character-specific enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the chapel arrival (~200 words). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through the fortress atmosphere, the mosaic discovery, and the final decision to carry fire forward. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Luma resumes her chant and carries the flame out, crystallizing her stance with felt cost (depleted resources, no stars, uncertain reception). The mosaic message reweights her despair into defiant purpose. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fortress—crumbling, jasmine-threaded, phosphorescent lichen—constrains Luma's movement and charges the final image. The fire spinner's rag knot functions as micro-setting, enabling the mosaic reading and serving as the literal fire she carries out. The open dome and starless sky pressure her choice to create light in a blank canvas. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("sweetness that bordered on grief"). Environment shapes both the discovery beat and the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Luma seeks the mosaic note to counter hopelessness. The discovery tightens her options—she could leave or act—and she chooses to offer free fireworks with visible cost (salvaged powder, no payment, uncertain outcome). Escalation under Accumulative lens: the mosaic message deepens her resolve, and the final act forecloses passivity. One meaningful turn (discovery → decision) with legible price. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the fortress "forgot how to die," the chant as "small defiance," the mosaic message linking burning to sky-making. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Luma's act of carrying fire out embodies refusal without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the "serious playfulness" laugh and the lichen "breathing with her." The final image reweights hopelessness into structural wonder with conceptual cost (depleted resources, uncertain reception). No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV stable, third-limited on Luma throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "syllables that meant nothing in any living language," "ambient awareness," "deep, receptive attention." Diction stays character-consistent (fireworks designer's lexicon: "chrysanthemum bursts," "timing and altitude"). No head-hopping. Minor note: "a sentence she intended to finish" in the final line edges toward lyric elevation but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between reflective and immediate. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density high: "festivals had dried up after the war, and the villages that once pooled coins for her displays now pooled them for bread" compresses economic collapse and profession in one beat. Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Minor friction: "the weight was something she could not afford tonight" and later "Hopelessness had a gravity all its own" re-state the same pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "Serious kind of playfulness" is precise but risks over-articulation. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold at closure. Propulsion clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—wandering fireworks designer finds mosaic note in ruined fortress—transforms the "artist seeks inspiration" template through specific occupational detail (powder, fuses, altitude math) and the mosaic as a designer-to-designer message across generations. The chant and rag knot are particular to Luma. Risk: the accumulative, quiet ending could flatten in lesser hands, but here the fire-carrying image synthesizes profession, defiance, and setting without gimmickry. Slight derivative echo in the "refuse to stop burning" message, but the story earns it through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's profession frames expectation (setup), drives the mosaic reading (development: "ambient awareness" from mixing compounds), and her decision to offer free fireworks (payoff: closure action). Her choice forecloses passivity with visible cost (salvaged materials, no payment). Causal pressure across three beats; irreplaceable (fireworks designer's specific skill and trade). Cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rag knot appears in setup (testing ignition, gauging wind), enables the mosaic reading (middle beat: "struck her flint, and the chapel exhaled into amber"), and she carries it burning through the dome and out the gates (closure beats). Three distinct beats with evolving use; irreplaceable tool that charges the final image. Cost: she expends kerosene to read and carry light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mosaic note is the inciting discovery (setup and development). It narrows Luma's options—she could despair or act—and its message ("THE SKY IS WHAT YOU MAKE WHEN YOU REFUSE TO STOP BURNING") directly shapes her decision to offer free fireworks (payoff). Causal pressure; the note's content reweights her stance. Slightly swappable (any designer's message could work), lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chant bookends the story (setup: "kept the dark at arm's length"; payoff: "resumed her chant"). It constrains her (must murmur to avoid "the weight") and enables endurance. Cost: silence would invite collapse. Two beats (opening move, closure resumption) with charged reprise. Development beat less distinct—mentioned but not leveraged mid-story—lowering middle-gate strength.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Filter" appears explicitly in the mosaic reading: "tracing each character with her fingertip, separating meaning from ornament." This method enables the key discovery (development) and shapes the middle turn. Setup hinted ("ambient awareness"). Payoff indirect—her decision follows the filtering. Two beats; causal role in discovery. Swappable with "decode" or "parse," reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named once during the mosaic reading ("the same deep, receptive attention she used when mixing volatile compounds"). It enables the discovery (development) and is seeded in her professional skill (setup implicit). Payoff: the discovery drives her choice. Mechanics matter but are summarized rather than dramatized. One strong beat; lyric reprise weak. Causal but swappable with "intuition."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fortress is present throughout: setup (blooming, jasmine, crumbling ramparts), development (chapel with open dome, lichen light, mosaic floor), payoff (carries fire "out through its gates"). It supplies the mosaic resource, pressures her with "hush" and "no stars," and charges the final image ("crumbling and alive"). Three beats; irreplaceable setting that constrains discovery and elevates closure. High specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Night with no stars is signaled at setup (chapel open to sky, "Tonight, there were no stars"), pressures her choice (development: "if the sky gave her no stars to compete with, all the better"), and charges closure (starless air as canvas). Two beats with causal pressure. Cost: the darkness both enables (no competition) and threatens (hopelessness). Time is static rather than a live clock, lowering urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hopelessness ("gravity tugging at her sternum") is setup and the inciting force. The mosaic message confronts it (development: "stubborn, glittering refusal to go dark"). Her decision to offer free fireworks despite no payment (payoff) dramatizes the conflict between despair and defiance with visible cost. Three beats; friction between want (restore wonder) and resource scarcity. Irreplaceable motivation that shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" is named explicitly in her laugh after reading the note ("not bitterly, but with a serious kind of playfulness"). Tone modulates: reflective gravity (chant, hopelessness), lyric intensity (fortress blooming, jasmine grief), and playful defiance (the dare, "blank canvas had never frightened her"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image ("small defiance pressed into the starless air"). Modulation under pressure; high specificity.</comment>
