<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior state is vivid and embodied ("she had not slept since the war"), with a core contradiction between shyness and unstoppability that shapes her centuries-long commitment. However, her final decision to sleep feels more like passive acceptance than an active choice forged by contradictory impulses; the cost of six hundred years is told rather than dramatized in a present micro-choice that would charge the ending. The emotional progression toward rest is legible but lacks on-page friction at the closure beat, limiting higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece is best read under an Accumulative/Textural lens: images and motifs (shell, postcard, lullabies) deepen and the final silence reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora's choice to sleep after six centuries forecloses endless vigilance with visible emotional cost ("gratitude, formless, photosynthetic"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wind brings news of armistice, narrowing her options and enabling rest. Causality is legible under the accumulative lens, though the armistice arrives externally rather than through protagonist agency, keeping this out of higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is established early, vividly rendered ("spiraled upward from the ocean floor like a cathedral"), and charges the final image where "the nacre hold[s] her weight" as she sleeps—constraining and enabling the closure choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's long vigil (bioluminescent light, squid-dark ink, dried kelp). Spatial choreography is clear across the shell's chambers; the "reef-shadow joy" grounds the emotional tone in physical environment. The shell functions as micro-setting that shapes the final moment, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmuting pain into beauty to end the war—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through centuries of writing. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lullabies return with news of armistice, reweighting her work's impact and narrowing options to rest. However, the armistice arrives externally (strangers raised on her poems) rather than through protagonist agency at the closure beat; Liora receives the outcome rather than driving it, which caps this category despite clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—pain and beauty as a single photosynthetic process—emerges concretely through Liora's ink-on-kelp work and the recurring image of "photosynthesize pain into beauty," which shifts from metaphor to literal world-change. The final "reef-shadow joy" image offers a non-literal answer: happiness with "depth and darkness still moving underneath." No explicit moralizing; the orchard and fruit in the final paragraph extend the photosynthesis motif with earned resonance. One minor slip: "The blossoming forgives everything" appears both on the postcard and in narration at the armistice, risking thematic echo, though it reads more as reprise than sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("she flinched at her own shadow," "squid-dark ink"). Voice is purposefully lyric and metaphor-dense, consistent with the premise. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence during high-pressure beats ("black radiation of grief," "photosynthetic process," "drifts...like sedimentary memory"), risking overwriting without full pattern-teaching. The final paragraph's diction ("formless, photosynthetic, converting") reads slightly elevated but remains voice-motivated. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she would later learn") are sparse and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-rich with high information density; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and closure. However, metaphor density at peak beats ("black radiation of grief," "photosynthetic," "sedimentary memory," "fault line") clusters without always advancing causality, risking overwriting (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "She was shyly unstoppable. That was the paradox of her" restates the same idea across two sentences without added pressure (−0.2). Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Figurative coherence holds, though the sheer frequency in emotional beats approaches density penalty thresholds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—poet's work ending a war via centuries-long transmission through natural elements—is specific and non-obvious, with the "gargantuan shell" and "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" offering fresh inflection on art-as-world-change. The "photosynthesis" metaphor is purposeful and extended without gimmickry. However, the "poet saves the world through quiet persistence" template is recognizable; transformation comes through the shell setting and the armistice mechanism rather than a radical reframing of the premise itself. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and the centuries-long timeframe elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora (insomniac poet) is present throughout and her centuries-long writing shapes the armistice, but her key "choice" at closure—to sleep—reads more as passive acceptance than a decision that alters tactics or redefines options. The insomnia trait is established early and paid off at the end, creating a clear reprise, but the character does not make an active turn in the final beat; events permit rest rather than her agency creating it. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is weaker since she continues writing without on-page tactical shift. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but passivity at closure and limited causal pressure −0.8, swappability (another artist could fill the role with minor edits) −0.5. Lyric reprise keeps this in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Galaxy postcard appears in century three, is described with specificity ("material she could not identify"), and returns at closure ("She touched the galaxy postcard. The spiral...seemed to turn"). The postcard's message ("The blossoming forgives everything") reweights when the armistice is named "blossom armistice," creating thematic resonance. However, the postcard does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as liturgy and emotional anchor rather than causal instrument. Three gates (setup, development as ongoing compass, payoff in final touch), but ornamental use without action pressure −0.6. Closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, irreplaceability +0.4, but no causal pressure −0.7 limits this to upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" is the story's central event: it reweights Liora's centuries of work, shifts her dominant stake from endless writing to earned rest, and directly enables the closure choice. The concept is signaled obliquely in the postcard's "blossoming forgives everything" (century three) and named explicitly when the wind brings news, then paid off in the final paragraph ("The blossoming forgave everything"). It shapes on-page stakes by permitting Liora's first sleep in six centuries and charges the closure image. Three gates met, strong causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection (forecloses vigilance) +0.5. Slight late-second-third first explicit use −0.3, but transformation of prior material keeps this in 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is defined early ("she flinched at her own shadow, whispered her lines...yet she could not be halted") and the paradox is asserted to drive her six-century persistence. However, the trait is told rather than dramatically enacted in a specific on-page beat with visible cost; we do not see her flinch *and* persist within a single scene under pressure. The attribute shapes the overall arc (centuries of quiet work) but remains largely label-level. Setup gate met, development implied across centuries, payoff oblique (her quiet rest fits the shy mode). Early signal +0.6, specificity +0.4, but label-only execution without a concrete action turn −0.8, no visible tradeoff in a peak beat −0.5. Lands mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears twice: Liora "ensconced herself centuries ago" in the shell's deepest chamber, and at closure she "ensconced herself deeper into the curved wall" to sleep. The action bookends the piece and the final ensconsing enables rest (the closure choice), but the verb itself is largely interchangeable with "settled" or "nestled"—it does not carry unique mechanics that redefine options. Two gates (setup, payoff), closure linkage +1.2, reprise with reweighted meaning +0.6, but swappability −0.7 and no middle development beat where the action constrains or enables tactics −0.4 keep this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is the delivery mechanism for the armistice news and directly enables Liora's rest. The method is signaled when "an off-key wind...threaded through its dissonance were half-sung lullabies...fragments of melodies Liora had written" and the wind brings news of ceasefire. The lullabies appear again in the final paragraph ("The lullabies kept traveling"), charging the ending. However, the method arrives late (final third) and resolves the conflict it did not help create earlier. Two gates (development, payoff), closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure (enables rest) +1.2, but late introduction −0.7 and resolves-without-prior-setup −1.0 cap this around 7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is introduced in the opening line, described with specificity ("six hundred years," "chambers large enough to hold cities," "nacre walls"), and directly supports the closure action ("the nacre hold her weight"). The shell provides both spatial anchor and physical cradle for rest, shaping Liora's tactics (where she writes) and enabling the final beat. Three gates met, early signal +0.7, beat involvement (opening, midpoint description, closure physical support) +1.4, causal pressure (constrains location, enables closure posture) +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7. Strong integration across all beats places this near 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" and "six hundred years" frame the timeframe. The centuries are signaled early ("six hundred years," "she had not slept since the war") and the passage of time intensifies the stakes (endurance cost), but the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or force tactical choices within the single closure scene. The final paragraph's "six hundred years" reprise reweights the cost of rest. Two gates (setup, payoff via cost awareness), cost connection +0.5, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, but no tactical pressure (time does not narrow options on the page) −0.6 and no middle development beat −0.3 keep this in low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To photosynthesize pain into beauty" is Liora's stated motivation, introduced early ("she wrote to photosynthesize pain into beauty") and literalized at closure ("converting every dark century into this single moment of rest"). The motivation shapes her six-century action and is paid off thematically when the next generation understands "pain and beauty were not opposites...but a single photosynthetic process." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in on-page friction between want and cost at a peak beat; we see the result (poems, armistice) but not a moment where she chooses beauty over another competing desire under pressure. Three gates (setup, thematic development, payoff), early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.1, but summary-only use −0.7 and lack of on-page conflicted choice −0.5 keep this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears once in the closure paragraph ("the reef-shadow joy of her innermost chamber, where the dim light was not bright but was enough, where happiness arrived...as the dappled, cool, living shade of a reef at midday—joy with depth and darkness still moving underneath"). The tone is coherent throughout (quiet, lyric, elegiac) and modulates appropriately as pressure shifts from centuries-long vigil to earned rest. The "reef-shadow" image charges the final beat by embodying the theme (beauty with darkness integrated) in sensory terms. One gate explicitly (payoff), but tonal consistency across the piece implies setup and development. Closure linkage +1.6, specificity and thematic charge +1.1, coherence under pressure +0.8, but single explicit appearance and late first naming −0.6 place this in mid-7s.</comment>
