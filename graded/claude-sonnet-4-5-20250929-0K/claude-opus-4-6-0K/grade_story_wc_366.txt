<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivations are clear and rooted in her consistent trait of quiet observation and action: "cataloguing suffering not to exploit it but to understand where tenderness might be quietly inserted." Her decision to maintain the lamp embodies endurance with visible cost (two hours of work, ongoing crossings). Internal contradiction is present—she doesn't believe in ghosts yet responds to the tower's longing—but could be sharpened in a peak beat. The character arc ends in Earned Stasis with credible cost: she chooses isolation and maintenance, foreclosing other paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis (Maren commits to maintaining the lamp and the stone conversation) with visible cost: ongoing two-week crossings and chosen isolation. Orientation is anchored early (keeper dead, lamp dark, Maren ferries supplies). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: cairn discovery deepens the ghost's nature, lamp repair deepens Maren's commitment, and the final image of ongoing exchange reweights the premise. One meaningful deepening (understanding the ghost's protective wish) tightens Maren's stance. Cost is legible in "she never spoke of it to anyone onshore" and the indefinite commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lantern room is vivid and purposeful: "shadows pooled in ways that defied the geometry" and "pressure behind her sternum, a humming grief that was almost beautiful." Sensory detail—brine, old iron, cold—grounds the scene. The setting constrains choice: Maren must enter the haunted room, and the cairns placed throughout (gallery, stairs, sill, desk) guide her understanding. The lamp mechanism (reserve oil, wick, fuel lines) is handled tactilely and alters outcome. Strong micro-setting work; the lantern room itself charges the final image of shared maintenance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and responding to the tower's longing—is signaled early and tightens through cairn discovery, lamp repair decision, and commitment to ongoing dialogue. One meaningful turn: Maren reads the cairns, understands the ghost's protective wish, and chooses maintenance over abandonment. Agency is clear (her decision to repair and return) and forecloses other paths with visible cost (isolation, ongoing labor). Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: each cairn discovery layers understanding, culminating in her reply cairn. The ghost's wish "to bottle the feeling of safety" is tested on-page through Maren's action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—the longing to protect and be remembered, enacted through silent correspondence—emerges from particulars: the cairns, the lamp, Maren's reticence. The final image (three stones, "I am here") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the ghost's prayer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the cairn language and Maren's silence onshore. The piece invites reflection on "the space between words" and "luminescent ache" without philosophizing. No thematic echo; complexity is held without false balance. The sea glass warming "against her ribs" embodies connection without declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "cataloguing suffering...to understand where tenderness might be quietly inserted." Diction is consistent and purposeful ("humming grief," "luminescent ache," "held breath"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects Maren's mind—reticent yet observant—through sentence rhythm and selective detail. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (closer during lamp repair, wider during summary of ongoing visits). Voice remains coherent under pressure with no register drift. No dialogue present; thus dialogue bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in "the way...the way...the way" sequence (paragraph two), which reads as purposeful parallelism but borders on template cadence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("a thousand tiny suns," "sea glass the color of a held breath") is vivid but appears frequently; density is high without becoming muddy. Clarity and propulsion are strong. Final line ("The lamp never flickered out again") resolves with apt simplicity. Grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cairn-as-language conceit transforms the familiar haunted-lighthouse frame through specific, grounded detail: three stones = "I am here," two = "Send help," one = "Remember me." Maren's reticence and warmly observant nature feel particular rather than stock. The ghost's wish "to bottle the feeling of safety" is fresh and emotionally honest, avoiding malice-driven haunt clichés. Emotional arc (understanding, repair, commitment) feels inevitable in hindsight. Tone and setting cohere as singular vision. Risk-taking is present (anonymous chain, quiet ending) and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting small within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (reticent lighthouse supply skipper) is signaled early, drives the middle turn (lamp repair decision), and shapes closure (ongoing maintenance and stone replies). Her choices—reading cairns, repairing the lamp, building her own cairn—alter tactics and foreclose other paths. Cost is visible: isolation, labor, chosen silence. Present across setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in the first cairn discovery and is pocketed ("warm against her ribs"), but does not return or constrain a later choice. It is vivid ("the color of a held breath") and charged with meaning (part of the cairn language), but its single functional beat and lack of reprise or cost-linkage limit score. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain (cairns as stone messages) is signaled early, shapes middle beats (Maren reads and interprets them), and drives closure (she builds her own cairn, continuing the chain). The concept alters tactics: understanding the cairns changes Maren's response from fear to tenderness and commitment. Indispensable to story logic; removing it would collapse the premise. Present across all three gates with high causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is signaled early ("cataloguing suffering...to understand where tenderness might be quietly inserted") and enables on-page action: Maren reads the cairns' longing rather than fleeing, leading to her repair decision. The trait constrains her response (she acts quietly, without speaking to others onshore). Cost is implicit: her observation commits her to isolation. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is solid but the cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Protect" is the ghost's core action (wanting "to protect" ships) and becomes Maren's adopted action (maintaining the lamp, continuing the protective watch). It drives the middle turn (her decision to repair) and shapes closure (ongoing maintenance as shared protection). Removing "protect" would require fundamental rewrite of the ghost's motivation and Maren's response. Present across all gates; strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stone-stacking as messages is signaled early (first cairn, then the code explained), shapes middle beats (Maren reads sequences on stairs, sill, desk), and is indispensable to closure (she builds her own three-stone cairn). The mechanics matter: three/two/one meanings create the "anonymous chain" and enable dialogue without speech. Removing this method would break story logic. Present across all gates with high irreplaceability, causal pressure, and cost (the method defines the relationship and Maren's commitment).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room is signaled early, pressures Maren's choice (she must enter and interpret the space), supplies resources (cairns, lamp mechanism), and charges the final image (the lamp's radiance, the room's shift from grief to gratitude). The setting's "humming grief" and "shadows pooled in ways that defied geometry" are specific and irreplaceable. Micro-setting (gallery, stairs, desk as cairn locations) alters tactics. Present across all gates with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" is signaled in the opening line and frames the entire narrative: Maren's crossing, discovery, and repair all occur in this window. The lamp's darkness creates urgency (ships at risk) that drives her action. The ending shifts to ongoing time ("every two weeks after that"), marking the new pattern. Time tightens the decision (no keeper, strait dark) and alters tactics. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implicit rather than tracked beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety" is dramatized through the ghost's cairn messages and explicitly named mid-story ("the desperate wish to bottle the feeling of safety"). It drives Maren's response: understanding this wish, she repairs the lamp and commits to ongoing protection. Friction exists between the ghost's impossible wish (to preserve safety forever) and the on-page cost (endless maintenance). Present in middle and closure with strong causal pressure; setup is implicit in the haunting's nature.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone "luminescent ache" is established early ("humming grief that was almost beautiful, like light seen through water") and modulates with pressure: cold and watching during discovery, warming during repair ("radiance that seemed to exceed the flame"), settling into "the particular silence" of ongoing exchange. Coherent through turns and charges the final image (light holding, silent prayer). Diction throughout ("held breath," "luminescent ache," "sea glass...luminous") maintains tonal unity. Present across all gates with strong closure charge.</comment>
