<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is characterized through her methodology and singular professional philosophy ("convergence," foresight cultivation) rather than interior contradiction under pressure. Her emotional register remains consistent—methodical, detached—without embodied conflict or competing impulses that would test her stance. The ending suggests stance crystallization (turning Derry's death into refusable pattern) but no visible cost forecloses a path on the page; her professional identity is affirmed rather than altered. Strong perceptual signature (wind-obsessed focus) and credible expertise, but the final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through dramatized internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Mara's final reflection—"turning one man's singular, unrepeatable death into a pattern that could be recognized and refused"—reweights the opening stake (understanding convergence) with visible professional cost (tomorrow's recommendations will face resistance). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensor-by-sensor data gathering creates density that culminates in the wind-map convergence and the thematic mirror of Derry's shrine. One meaningful tightening occurs when the five vectors meet at a single point. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. Cost is conceptual and professional rather than viscerally felt, holding the piece just below the 8.5 threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as constraint and atmosphere throughout: the geometry funnels wind (driving the investigation), the junction shrine marks the convergence site, and the fog-as-door closing image charges the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional filter (salt, diesel, corrugated steel, wind speed data) without tourist-catalog breadth. Spatial choreography is clean across Row C, Row F junction, crane path overlay. The setting constrains her method (sensor placement every fifteen meters) and supplies the forty-percent amplification discovery that reweights the twist-lock failure narrative. Strong example of micro-setting (container walls, junction gaps) shaping tactics and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the convergence that killed Derry—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens: each sensor reading tightens the wind map until five vectors converge. The tightening is meaningful (forty-percent amplification discovery narrows blame from operator error to systemic wind-monitoring failure) and the cost is legible (tomorrow's expensive recommendations will face institutional resistance). However, Mara faces no on-page opposition or tactical friction; the investigation proceeds without setback, misreading, or forced trade-off. The escalation is informational deepening rather than pressure that tests her commitment or alters her stance. Strong coherence but lacks a visible price paid during the investigation that would enter the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—singular convergence as both forensic fact and existential condition, the ethical work of foresight—emerges through concrete investigation beats (sensor data, shrine, twist-lock history) rather than assertion. The flight engineer's patch (fraying edges, years worn, nailed with a roofing nail) functions as charged particular, and the final image (fog closing like a door) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question without moralizing. The line "Most investigators reconstructed the past. Mara's motivation was different" borders on authorial intrusion but is integrated as character philosophy. The piece resists tidy closure (some will call it expensive, some obvious) and earns its quiet ending through accumulated specificity. Minor slip: "the only honest work left" veers toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara's narration prioritizes technical precision ("twist-lock," "anemometer," "forty-seven sensor readings") filtered through investigative purpose, with lyric compression in the opening simile ("the way a diver waits for still water") and closing image. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The phrase "hazy precision, shapes that were certain in outline but dissolving at their edges" self-describes the prose texture and risks meta-commentary but pays off thematically. Minor diction slip: "what made her valuable and what made her lonely" tells rather than shows isolation. Free indirect access to Mara's methodology is clean. Rhythm modulates appropriately from patient documentation to the emotional weight of the shrine and convergence discovery. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance investigation, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during data analysis, longer syntactic builds during reflection). Opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "The facts were hard. The meaning was vapor" reads as manufactured aphorism rather than organic thought. Paraphrase slip in paragraph four: "That was the quality she worked in, always" restates the prior sentence's haze/precision claim without added pressure. "Rapidly adapting her model" (prompt element) appears once without dramatized mechanics. The phrase "visibility and what made her lonely" borders on telling-summary. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Overall propulsion is clean with one conceptual loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—wind-pattern investigation as accident forensics—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis of procedural and existential material. The container-labyrinth setting and sensor methodology feel particular rather than generic. Transformation of the investigator archetype (foresight rather than reconstruction) is purposeful. However, the emotional arc follows a predictable path: lone expert gathers data, discovers systemic failure, will present findings to resistant authority. The shrine functions as expected focal point; the closing fog-as-door image is evocative but not entirely fresh. Strong execution of familiar investigator-versus-institution material with wind-amplification specificity elevating it above template, but lacks the bold structural or perspectival risk that would reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (accident investigator) drives all on-page beats: she places sensors, interprets data, overlays crane paths, and formulates tomorrow's recommendations. Her professional identity shapes perception throughout. However, her choices do not create reversals or visible trade-offs; the investigation proceeds without friction, misreading, or forced renunciation. The final act (saving the file, collecting sensors) is methodical follow-through rather than a decision that narrows options. Setup strong, development functional, closure presence modest (she sits, reflects, walks out). Causal pressure is informational rather than agonistic. Score reflects solid middle development but lack of high-stakes choice that would reach 7.0+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The flight engineer's patch appears in one extended beat (junction shrine discovery) where Mara crouches, studies fraying edges, photographs it, and feels the wind gust. It charges the emotional center of the investigation and signals Derry's years-worn expertise. It returns implicitly in the final paragraph ("looking at the patch nailed to the wall") before she collects sensors. Setup mid-story (~40% mark), one strong beat with embodied action, lyric reprise at closure that reweights Derry's human cost. Two-gate structure (development + closure) with charged specificity. Does not constrain choice but accumulates thematic weight. Fraying edges and roofing nail add irreplaceable texture. Solid 5–6 range for purposeful recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Singular convergence is the story's spine: signaled in paragraph three ("convergence—the singular convergence of factors"), it shapes Mara's method (documenting vectors), drives the discovery (five vectors meeting at a single point), and articulates the thematic payoff ("turning one man's singular, unrepeatable death into a pattern"). It alters her tactics (sensor placement to map amplification zones) and reframes the official narrative (operator error → systemic wind-monitoring failure). Setup early, development across sensor-gathering beats, closure participation via the convergence-map screen moment and final reflection. The concept is structural rather than ornamental. Strong integration across all three gates with causal and thematic pressure. Approaches indispensability but does not quite reach 8.5 because the investigation could theoretically pivot to a different framing without full collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" appears once in paragraph six ("rapidly adapting her model with each new data point") as label-only narration without dramatized cost, visible tradeoff, or constraint. The text does not show her revising a prior hypothesis, discarding a sensor, or struggling with conflicting readings. The trait is asserted rather than embodied through on-page action. Late introduction (beyond 40% mark) and no closure participation. Functional presence without integration pressure. Cap at 4.6 (late + no development); deduct for label-only use and swappability (could be "refining," "updating," "iterating" with no loss). Ornamental tier.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Survey (sensor placement, wind-map construction) structures the entire investigation: Mara mounts sensors at Row C mouth, walks deeper placing them every fifteen meters, checks streaming data at the junction, walks the crane route sensor-by-sensor, and compiles forty-seven readings into the convergence map. The action enables all major discoveries (forty-percent amplification, five-vector convergence) and drives the ending's professional recommendations. Setup immediate (paragraph two "surveying the geometry"), development continuous across beats, closure direct (saved file, collected sensors). Essential and irreplaceable: no other action could substitute without rewriting the investigation logic. High causal pressure, beat involvement across all sections, strong closure linkage. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Documenting wind patterns between buildings (here, container walls) is Mara's signature method, signaled in paragraph two and executed throughout: she mounts sensors, tracks amplification, overlays crane paths, maps three critical zones. The method's mechanics matter on the page (sensor spacing, data streaming to tablet, forty-percent acceleration discovery). It shapes all investigation tactics and produces the convergence finding that charges the closure. Setup early, development continuous, closure direct (wind map shows five vectors converging). Specific and irreplaceable: the investigation depends on this exact methodology. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Nearly indispensable but could theoretically be replaced by alternate forensic approach with moderate rewrites; caps just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city supplies the investigation's entire spatial logic: corridors funnel wind, stacks form canyons that accelerate gusts by forty percent, the junction where Derry died becomes convergence site, and the geometry guides sensor placement and crane-path analysis. The setting constrains Mara's method (narrow gaps, six-high stacks) and provides the systemic failure's physical cause. Setup immediate (paragraph two), development continuous (Row C, Row F junction, crane route), closure charged (fog closes behind her like a door, the labyrinth as threshold). Indispensable: remove the container maze and the investigation collapses. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, spatial choreography, and thematic resonance (labyrinth as both literal and metaphoric structure).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the town goes silent" frames the opening (port silent at eleven-fourteen, last shift clocked out) and motivates Mara's work (only after quiet can she hear the wind). The night progression is tracked loosely (by one a.m. she has forty-seven readings) and the ending anchors tomorrow's presentation. Time enables her method (silence required for wind measurement) and adds atmospheric charge (cool night, fog, solitude). Setup strong in opening lines, development modest (time passes but does not tighten decisions), closure participation via "tomorrow" but no live clock pressure during investigation. Two gates met with purposeful atmospheric use but no tactical urgency. Mid-6 range for enabling condition without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to cultivate foresight in action, to see the next death before it arrives—is articulated in paragraph six and drives her professional identity throughout. It differentiates her from other investigators (who reconstruct the past) and shapes her closure stance (turning singular death into recognizable, refusable pattern). The desire faces conceptual friction (some will call it expensive, obvious after the fact) but not on-page dramatized conflict or competing want. Setup mid-story, thematic development across investigation beats, closure participation strong (final reflection ties foresight motive to the wind-monitoring recommendations). Motivation is asserted and thematically coherent but not tested through agonistic choice. Solid 7–8 range for thematic integration without visceral cost or internal contradiction that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hazy precision—"shapes that were certain in outline but dissolving at their edges"—is named explicitly in paragraph four and sustained throughout via fog, night air, corrugated-steel geometry, and the interplay of hard data (sensor readings, forty-seven points) with vaporous meaning. The tone modulates purposefully: patient documentation, emotional weight at the shrine, technical convergence discovery, quiet resolve at closure. Syntax and diction support the texture (lyric compression in similes, technical precision in investigation beats). The fog-closing-like-a-door image charges the ending with tonal coherence. Setup early, development consistent, closure strong. The explicit self-naming ("That was the quality she worked in, always") risks meta-commentary but integrates thematically. High execution with minor self-consciousness preventing 8.5+.</comment>
