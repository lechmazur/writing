<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is vivid and embodied through temporal dilation metaphors and the sketching ritual. Her choice to contact Cygnus Station emerges from the custom but feels slightly expository—she's been "too ashamed to answer" is told rather than shown through prior micro-choices. The protagonist's internal contradiction (pariah yet blessed) is established but not dramatized under pressure; she moves from confusion to direction without a visible cost forecloses a competing option. No second character tests her stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, observation deck, one year post-shutdown). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren transmits the sketch and message, crystallizing her readiness to resume research with visible social cost (resuming pariah work). The accumulative pattern—eleven months of silence, the anniversary ritual, the emergent compass rose—tightens into a single decisive stance that reweights her isolation. Cost is felt (resuming stigmatized work) but not deeply embodied in the final beat; the message "I am ready to look again" borders on thematic summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observation deck's residual temporal dilation field is vivid and constrains Maren's choice to linger (aging slower). The transparisteel walls, star positions, and dormant console are woven through action. The sketching custom anchors in the body (charcoal, arm's length) and charges the closure by revealing the compass rose. Stellar details (Vela, Archer's Spoke, Orphan) feel catalog-like rather than POV-filtered by urgency. The deck's function as micro-setting is strong, but occupational systems (Array calibration) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren's need for direction after professional ruin. Pressure accumulates through isolation, shame, and the anniversary ritual, then tightens when the sketch reveals the compass rose pointing to unmapped space. The turn—contacting Cygnus Station—narrows options (resuming pariah work) with social cost. Escalation is primarily textural (density of reflection, ritual, epiphany) rather than dramatic; no external obstacle tests her resolve or forces a trade-off on the page. The message feels more like a decision than a renunciation with visible friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—turning confusion into exploration via inherited ritual—emerges cleanly from the sketching custom and the compass rose's discovery. The final image (transmitting the sketch) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "blessed pariah," temporal dilation as metaphor, and the silence that "echoed." Minor slip: "It had turned confusion into exploration. It had given her a heading" states theme overtly in the penultimate paragraph, reducing resonance. The piece resists neat moral but leans into prompt language ("confusion into exploration") near closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and vivid, with distinct perceptual signature (temporal metaphors, star-naming, architectural attention). Diction matches Maren's technical background (calibration officer, dilation fields, Ethics Board). No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "cognitive rights," "relativistic phenomena," and "temporally stretched" cluster in early exposition without dramatization, slightly flattening voice under setup pressure. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the sketching ritual. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and propulsive. "The silence here was not empty. It echoed" and "time was not a river but an ocean" are vivid. Minor loops: "She had been blessed" / "blessed pariah" / "the blessing" recurs without reweighting; "sketch/sketched/sketchbook" appears nine times in compact space, some ornamental. "She closed the sketchbook and stood" followed by "Maren walked" is minor choreography clutter. Figurative density is controlled. No grammatical errors. Information density is high in the ritual and closure beats, slightly padded in backstory exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of time dilation, family star-sketching custom, and "blessed pariah" status feels specific and integrated. The compass rose as both inherited symbol and navigational discovery is fresh. The Ethics Board shutdown and cognitive rights framing are genre-familiar but executed with detail. Risk: Maren's isolation and ritual redemption echo template arcs (outcast finds new purpose through tradition); transformation comes from the tight weave of temporality, ritual, and occupational specificity rather than a bold structural or moral departure. The ending message avoids sentimentality but borders on articulated thesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's choice to contact Cygnus Station is the story's decisive turn. Her prior choices (lingering on the deck, opening the sketchbook, sketching) set up the climax but are iterative rather than conflicted. She is dramatized across all three gates (setup: pariah status and lingering; middle: sketching; closure: transmission). Causal pressure is moderate—her decision flows from the ritual but is not tested by competing options on the page. The "blessed pariah" framing is thematic rather than forcing tactical choices. Strong closure participation, modest middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The compass rose applique appears twice: as her grandmother's journal detail (setup) and as the emergent shape in Maren's sketch (closure). The return reweights meaning—inherited symbol becomes navigational heading. It is handled on the page ("traced its edges with her fingertip") and charges the final transmission. Missing: middle-beat involvement where the object constrains a choice. The reprise is purposeful and resonant but lacks a cost tied to the object itself; it serves as revelation rather than price. Lyric resonance is strong; causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"True north" is seeded early (grandmother's custom as finding "true north when the ground shifted"), reappears as a one-word paragraph at the discovery beat, and shapes the closure (compass rose points north, Maren finds heading). The concept alters Maren's tactic (contacting Cygnus) and charges the final image. It does not constrain a prior choice or introduce a cost on the page—it functions as thematic payoff rather than mechanical stake. Present in all three gates but primarily as motif. Stronger than ornament, weaker than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is named early (medics' diagnosis, "blessing"), enables Maren's lingering choice (aging slower), and returns at closure ("temporally stretched glass"). It does not constrain a tactical choice with visible tradeoff or introduce a cost beyond thematic resonance. The trait is labeled more than embodied—no on-page moment where temporal dilation forces a sacrifice or alters her ability. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is thematic echo. Functional but replaceable with "isolated" or "changed" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Glimpse" drives the story's climax: Maren glimpses the compass rose she "had not consciously drawn," redefining her confusion as direction. The action is irreplaceable—seeing the emergent pattern is the story's pivot. Present in closure (the glimpse) and shapes the ending (transmission follows the glimpse). Missing: middle-beat use where glimpsing something earlier constrains a choice. Setup is implicit (she sketches to see); the glimpse itself is concentrated in one decisive beat. Strong causal pressure at closure, light middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The family custom of anniversary star-sketching is seeded early (grandmother's invention, Maren's heritage), structures the middle (she opens the sketchbook and sketches), and delivers the closure (the sketch reveals the compass rose, which she transmits). The method's mechanics matter: charcoal, feeling not precision, mapping constellations "as they appeared to the heart." It constrains Maren's approach (no instruments, no precision) and enables the discovery. Visible cost: resuming pariah work via the sketch. Present across all three gates with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observation deck is integral: residual dilation field enables Maren's lingering choice (aging slower), the curved transparisteel walls frame the star view, and the dormant console supplies the transmission means at closure. The deck constrains access (shutdown, Ethics Board restrictions) and provides resources (comms relay). Spatial choreography is clear (glass, console, deck). The setting is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the temporal logic and closure mechanism. Present in all three gates with strong causal and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" frames the entire story: eleven months of silence, one-year anniversary, Maren's professional ruin. The timeframe tightens Maren's emotional state (year of drowning in confusion) and charges the anniversary ritual. It does not impose a live ticking clock or alter tactics beat-to-beat. Cost is durational (a year of isolation) but not immediate. The timeframe is causally necessary (shutdown enables pariah status and dilation residue) but does not escalate pressure within the story window. Setup, middle mood, and closure context are met; tactical pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's desire to turn confusion into exploration is dramatized through the sketching ritual and the compass rose discovery. The motivation is conflicted: shame (too ashamed to answer Cygnus) versus need for direction. Friction between wants (resume research) and costs (pariah status) is present but told more than tested—no on-page moment where she weighs competing goods. The motivation shapes the closure choice (transmission) with social cost. Present in setup (confusion stated), middle (ritual pursuit), and closure (exploration resumed). Stronger than label-only, weaker than high-pressure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is woven throughout: opening line ("silence here was not empty. It echoed"), middle beats ("silence began its long echo," "silence wrapped around her"), and closure ("silence echoed once more"). Tone modulates with pressure—from static isolation to charged anticipation ("the pause before a new sentence begins"). The tone is embodied in spatial description (curved walls, glass) and rhythm (reflective cadence shifts to action at transmission). Coherent across turns and charges the final image. Strong setup, development, and payoff; near-indispensable to the story's texture.</comment>
