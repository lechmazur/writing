<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and consistent—"sediment into still water," the terminal diagnosis as liberation rather than crisis—with embodied calm that drives her systematic choices. Her expertise and professional focus shape perception effectively ("shipments of fertilizer," precise botanical observation). The final renunciation is earned: she closes the diary knowing "every caretaker eventually becomes part of what they tend," a stance that forecloses alternatives with visible cost. Minor deduction: the late "brazen calm" label edges toward stock phrasing where the image work already carries it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren accepts integration into the system she tended, the copper oxidizing into bark mirrors her own absorption, and the diary left for the next caretaker forecloses personal continuation with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors early (doctor's office → ferry → island → orchard). The accumulative lens holds: systematic observation escalates to active intervention (copper wire), culminating in the final surrender that reweights all prior labor. One micro slip: "the world builds best when it builds together" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary, slightly dulling the earned image work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard as living architecture—stone pillars channeling water, roots sculpting ventilation shafts—constrains Maren's remodeling choices and charges the closure image where she sits "calm as limestone, patient as root." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional lens: mineral springs, lichen migration, capillary channels. The copper wire's oxidation into bark provides tactile grounding for the final integration. Spatial choreography remains clear across the four-month span. Strong execution; falls short of 9+ because the environment shapes but doesn't pivot a contested choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: making hidden collaboration visible in remaining months. One meaningful tightening occurs when the copper-traced oaks display their "internal logic like blueprints," validating her thesis and attracting expert attention. The terminal diagnosis provides a persistent constraint that shapes all tactics. Cost is legible: she relinquishes personal continuation to become part of the archive ("closes the diary and set it on the stone bench"). Strong accumulative pressure under the inferred lens. Enters high 7s but not 8+ because the escalation is methodical rather than contested—no reversal tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of interdependence emerges through stone-tree symbiosis, copper integration, and Maren's final absorption without overt statement. The diary as archive and the oxidizing wire provide concrete particulars. The final image—Maren among pillars and trees, "calm as limestone, patient as root"—offers a resonant answer to the collaboration question. However, "the world builds best when it builds together, and that seeing this clearly is worth whatever time remains" in the closing paragraph is explicit thematic summary that replaces scene pressure, triggering −0.6 under the penalty guidance and capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with perceptual signature rooted in Maren's systematic observation: "growth rates," "lichen migration patterns," "capillary channels." Diction remains consistent (professional, precise, understated) even under the terminal diagnosis. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from clinical objectivity early ("sediment into still water") to embodied integration late ("at home in the architecture of interdependence"). Rhythm and syntax support the accumulative design. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Clean execution throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance knowledge of the orchard's mechanics or Maren's intervention. Rhythm varies appropriately, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across months. Minor loop: "She had not cured anything. She had not defeated time. She had simply made visible..." uses template parallelism that slightly flattens the closure beat. "Brazen calm" and "sediment into still water" are effective but edge toward stock metaphor. No grammar errors or pronoun confusion. Strong craft overall, but the loops and near-stock phrases in peak moments keep it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—terminal caretaker reveals architectural symbiosis via copper-wire tracing—offers a fresh synthesis of memento mori and ecological interspecies design. Execution is specific and grounded: mineral capillaries, acid-sculpted ventilation, calibrated shadow angles avoid generic eco-mysticism. The copper oxidation metaphor is earned and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (acceptance → systematic documentation → peaceful integration) follows a familiar trajectory, and the final thematic statement retreats slightly from bold specificity. Solid originality within a recognizable template; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all major beats: deciding to remodel (first third), implementing copper wire technique (middle), closing the diary and leaving it for the next caretaker (closure). Her systematic observation shapes tactics throughout, and the final renunciation—sitting among the pillars rather than continuing—forecloses alternatives with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is direct. Cost is tied specifically to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The diary appears in the opening third ("opened the botanical diary she had kept"), anchors middle revelation ("flipped to the entries from her third year"), documents the copper intervention ("She documented everything"), and is deliberately closed and left on the stone bench in the final image. Four distinct beats; causal role in preservation and transmission; charged reprise at closure where it becomes the archive that outlives her. Strong integration; falls short of 9+ because the diary enables rather than constrains a contested choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Architectural secrets—water channels, acid sculpting, calibrated shadows—shape stakes (making collaboration visible) and tactics (copper wire, plaques, documentation) on every page. Present in the inciting third-year discovery, drive the remodeling action, and charge the final image where Maren embodies the interdependence she revealed. The concept defines options, attracts expert validation, and provides the thematic spine. Closure participation is direct: "at home in the architecture of interdependence." Indispensable; removing it collapses the story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" constrains action: Maren's measured documentation, precise wire placement, weather logging, and plain-language plaques all flow from this trait. It shapes her response to the diagnosis (no panic, immediate ferry return) and her methodical three-month transformation. The trait enables rather than conflicts, and cost is felt in the patient accumulation rather than a single dramatic trade-off. Present in setup (botanical diary habits), development (wire technique), and payoff (final calm). Solid integration; not indispensable because a similar temperament could serve.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The remodeling action—copper wire, plaques, visitor engagement—defines the middle span, materializes the architectural thesis, and provides the visible transformation that attracts experts. It is the vehicle for Maren's final months and directly shapes the ending where her intervention is complete and she becomes part of the system. Setup (decision "she would spend her remaining months"), development (three-month execution), payoff (orchard "becoming what Maren had always known it to be"). Causal pressure is strong; cost is the consumed months and her absorption. Essential but not unique; another preservation method could theoretically substitute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Copper wire signaled early ("began the next morning with copper wire"), its mechanics matter (trace minerals, green staining, growth-pattern visibility), it drives middle transformation ("green tracery would map the trees' vascular system"), and oxidizes into bark in the final entry, mirroring Maren's integration. Three beats; causal enabling; closure linkage via the oxidation metaphor. The method is specific and irreplaceable (another technique would lack the oxidation payoff). Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the architectural revelation could use another marker, but the copper's transformation charges the ending distinctly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard is the sole location, its living-stone architecture defines the dominant stake, supplies the water channels and shadow mechanics that Maren reveals, and provides the spatial stage for every beat. The pillars constrain her remodeling (she works within their logic) and charge the final image where she sits among them "calm as limestone." Setup, development, payoff all depend on this exact setting; removing it erases plot, theme, and closure. Indispensable; the story is the orchard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The six-month diagnosis frames the entire story, tightens Maren's decision to remodel immediately, and shapes the urgency behind documentation and transmission. Present in setup (inciting news), tracked in middle ("By the third month"), and implicit at closure where she accepts integration. However, the timeframe operates as backdrop rather than live ticking pressure—no scene dramatizes a deadline forcing a trade-off. Causal role is real but passive; swapping in a different terminal window would work with minor edits. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing contested middle development caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fostering interspecies respect motivates the remodeling ("wanted visitors to see... the greatest architecture was shared architecture"), drives plaque installation ("she wanted children to understand"), and is embodied in the orchard's collaboration Maren makes visible. The motivation shapes tactics (systematic revelation, plain language) and charges the final image where she models the respect by becoming part of it. Setup, development, payoff present; causal pressure strong. Falls short of 8.5+ because the desire faces no internal friction or contested alternative—Maren never doubts or sacrifices another want for this one.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is established in the opening ("she felt no panic... a brazen calm") and modulates through the narrative: measured politeness at diagnosis, steady handwriting during documentation, peaceful sitting at closure. The tone charges the final image where calm becomes embodied ("calm as limestone, patient as root"). However, the tone is static—no pressure tests or threatens it—and the label "brazen calm" itself is repeated rather than shown evolving. Setup and payoff present; middle modulation is implied but not dramatized under stress. Solid coherence; not indispensable because a similar serenity could serve.</comment>
