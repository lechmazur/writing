<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's proprioceptive enhancement is embodied consistently through concrete physical detail ("angle of her left wrist," "micro-rotation of each cervical vertebra"), and her micro-choices around the pewter strap demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she knows she shouldn't have kept it yet uses it to trigger therapeutic bracing. The therapy-speak ("remembering through trauma responses," "proprioceptive enhancement") appears but is filtered through her dismissive stance toward counselors, maintaining character voice. The final two-degree shoulder unlock represents earned alteration with visible cost (the terrible precise song she must endure), though the arc remains deliberately incremental rather than transformative, fitting the mathematics-of-mercy frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase and cadence shift—yesterday one degree, today two—reweighting the dominant stake (can the body unlearn its trauma response through repetition?). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Sera continues her experimental protocol with visible cost ("proprioception singing its terrible precise song") and measurable progress, forecloses the path of abandoning her self-designed therapy. Orientation anchors cleanly by line three (Sera, post-interrogation, rehabilitation clinic edge). The ultraviolet forest constraint subtly shapes her choice to stay: "the correct place... where alteration is visible." One meaningful deepening occurs when she releases the strap and her shoulders unlock—"two is more than one"—a tightening that narrows her experimental question toward potential asymptotic convergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest as contaminated beauty ("violet penance... doing visible time for invisible sins") directly mirrors Sera's proprioceptive alteration and constrains her therapeutic choice: she needs a place "where the consequence of what was done glows honestly in the bark." The pewter strap functions as micro-setting, handled twice with escalating bodily response, charging the final release. Sensory detail is filtered through her hyperaware proprioception ("Every joint, every tendon... reporting its exact position"). The forest's fluorescence appears in the final image, grounding her deeper walk into violet light as both literal and symbolic movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "She is trying to discover the mathematics of mercy... Is there a threshold... beyond which the nervous system accepts that the danger has ended?" One meaningful tightening occurs when touching the strap forces full-body bracing, then escalates to her breathing-and-counting protocol, then deepens to the measured two-degree shoulder unlock. Agency is renunciation/endurance under experimental protocol with visible cost: she must "let it sing" despite the "terrible precise song." The incremental progress (one degree yesterday, two today) narrows her experimental question with legible stakes under the Accumulative lens. Coincidence does not resolve; her choice to walk deeper into the forest remains volitional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ultraviolet forest as damaged-yet-beautiful mirror and the mathematics metaphor that structures Sera's experimental approach to healing: "How many times must a body brace before the bracing teaches it something other than fear?" The pewter strap recurs with reweighted meaning—first as "equation," later as trigger, finally as released object when shoulders unlock two degrees. The ending offers non-literal answer: she doesn't know if mercy "converges on a finite answer or stretches asymptotic," but "two is more than one"—resonant, grounded in data-point specificity, resisting tidy moral. The conceptual cost is legible: she must endure the "terrible precise song" indefinitely, and the forest's honest contamination validates her refusal to pretend unchanged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable single-third throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: the hyperaware proprioceptive lens colors every observation, from vertebra angles to the "two degrees" measurement. Diction stays character-specific—scientific precision ("asymptotic," "data points," "threshold") layered with embodied metaphor ("violet penance"). One brief register elevation ("transfigured," "cambium") reads voice-motivated given her analytical frame. The counselors' clinical language is embedded with clear attribution, maintaining distance. Rhythm modulates under pressure: short declaratives during the bracing sequence ("She breathes. She counts.") contrast with longer, more exploratory sentences when she theorizes. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful (interrogation details withheld but their cost made visceral through body memory).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. Information density is high: most sentences advance character state, setting resonance, or thematic calculus simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at peak stress ("She breathes. She counts. / Two degrees. She notes it like a scientist.") against longer accumulative sentences during reflection. Figurative language is controlled and consistent: the mathematics metaphor threads throughout without mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and premise cleanly; final image recharges "violet light" and "proprioception singing" motifs with forward momentum. One minor note: "shoulders seize... shoulders unlock" repeats the noun in close proximity, but the parallel structure serves the before/after measurement frame without becoming true redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of proprioceptive enhancement (SF body-horror element) with PTSD recovery through self-designed experimental protocol and the ultraviolet forest as contaminated mirror feels specific and non-obvious. The mathematics-of-mercy frame transforms standard trauma-recovery narrative through quantified increments and scientific methodology. The forest's fluorescence as visible consequence rather than metaphorical overlay offers fresh environmental specificity. Risk is present: the piece trusts reader comfort with technical vocabulary and asymptotic unknowability at closure. One proximity concern: "the body keeps the score" is a well-known trauma-therapy phrase, and while not directly echoed, the body-as-archive concept treads familiar ground in contemporary trauma fiction. The transformation succeeds through the proprioceptive specificity and the patient, non-triumphant incrementalism of "two is more than one."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera (enhanced interrogation survivor) makes the key choice to walk deeper into the forest for repeated exposure therapy and chooses to touch the strap despite knowing it will trigger bracing. Her survivor status shapes every perception through hyperaware proprioception and frames the central experimental question. Present in setup (paragraph one), drives middle beat (strap-triggered bracing sequence), and shapes ending (walking deeper with acceptance of the "terrible precise song"). The exact survivor element constrains her method: she can't escape the enhanced proprioception, so she must learn to "play it for her own purposes."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in three distinct beats: first as kept object she "should not have kept," second as trigger she deliberately touches to induce bracing, third as released object when her shoulders unlock two degrees. Its specific properties matter—cold, thin, curved, pitted surface—and it functions as both measurement tool (tracking her response) and therapeutic instrument. Early signal (paragraph three), middle causal use (triggers the bracing that tests her protocol), closure participation (release marks progress). The strap's reweighting from souvenir-equation to experimental stimulus to progress marker makes it indispensable to the incremental arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance as concept shapes Sera's choice of therapeutic location: she needs a place "where the consequence of what was done glows honestly" and doesn't "pretend to be unchanged." The forest's visible contamination validates her refusal of standard rehabilitation optimism. Present in setup (paragraphs two and four), motivates the middle beat (she chooses "the correct place"), and charges the final image ("violet light" as she walks deeper). However, the concept operates more as thematic resonance than direct constraint on tactics—she could theoretically conduct her experiment elsewhere. The penance frame reweights her self-designed protocol as parallel contamination rather than healing, which is conceptually essential but tactically adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement enables on-page action with continuous cost: it allows her to measure the two-degree shoulder unlock ("she can feel the precise angle because of course she can"), but also forces her to endure the "terrible precise song in every nerve." The trait appears in line one, constrains every movement description (vertebra micro-rotation, wrist angle without looking), enables her experimental methodology (data collection requires precision), and charges the final image (the singing she must not look away from). Irreplaceable: standard PTSD body memory wouldn't provide the quantified measurement that structures her mathematics-of-mercy hypothesis. The cost is visible throughout: she "hates every single one" of the measurements her body has become.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Brace" drives the central experimental sequence: her body learned to brace in the concrete room, the strap-touch triggers bracing ("every proprioceptively enhanced muscle... locking"), and the core question is "How many times must a body brace before the bracing teaches it something other than fear?" Present in setup via past-tense reference (paragraph three: "the posture the body learned"), enacted on-page in the middle beat (shoulders seize, ribs contract), and measured at closure (shoulders unlock by two degrees, showing partial release from involuntary bracing). The action is causally irreplaceable: her protocol depends on triggering and tracking this specific trauma response, not a generic startle or freeze.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is signaled in paragraph three ("a memory surfacing not through thought but through the body's own alarm") and its mechanics shape her entire experimental method: she uses the strap to trigger somatic memory, then counts through the response to measure its intensity and duration. The method appears in setup (named and contrasted with counselors' clinical phrase), drives the middle beat (strap-touch → body-seize → breathe-and-count protocol), and underlies the closure measurement (two degrees of release proves the method is accumulating data). However, the method could be described as exposure therapy or somatic tracking with minor edits; the specific "remembering through trauma responses" phrasing adds conceptual specificity but the mechanics would function similarly under adjacent terms.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest supplies the therapeutic environment Sera requires: a place where "alteration is visible" and damage "glows honestly in the bark," validating her refusal to pretend unchanged. Present in setup (paragraph two names it; paragraph four establishes its chemical-remediation backstory), pressures her middle choice (she identifies it as "the correct place... where the consequence of what was done glows honestly"), and provides the final image's charge ("violet light" she walks deeper into, proprioception singing). The forest's specific contaminated-fluorescence aesthetic is irreplaceable: generic nature wouldn't provide the visible-damage mirror that authorizes her self-designed protocol. The setting constrains by permission—it's the only space that matches her therapeutic need for honest non-healing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening moment and signals post-interrogation recovery phase, but the timeframe doesn't tighten subsequent decisions. The piece operates in elastic present-tense walk-time without urgency. "Yesterday it was one [degree]" provides comparative data but no pressure. The timeframe is setup-functional (orients us to immediate post-trauma phase) but doesn't create a live clock that alters tactics or escalates at closure. Swappable with "after discharge" or similar markers without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the mathematics of mercy" is dramatized through on-page experimental protocol: she walks the forest, touches the strap, measures her body's response, and tracks incremental progress ("two is more than one"). Stated explicitly in paragraph five but enacted across all three beats—her clinic-edge location choice, her deliberate strap-touch despite knowing it will hurt, her scientist-like notation of the two-degree unlock. The motivation structures her entire stance: she frames healing as data collection toward a "threshold" or "asymptotic" limit. Friction between desire (find the equation) and cost (endure the terrible song) drives closure. The specific "mathematics" frame is near-irreplaceable; generic "find healing" wouldn't provide the quantified, experimental methodology that defines her approach.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Displaced-rooted tone coheres through spatial and identity paradox: "her own shadow on the trail, displaced and strangely rooted at once, belonging neither to the woman she was before... nor to whatever she is becoming. She is between formulae." The tone modulates under pressure—measured and analytical during theorizing, physically immediate during the bracing sequence—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image: walking deeper while "displaced" (altered by enhancement) yet "rooted" (committed to her experimental protocol). The tone is present throughout rather than imposed at the end, and its dual quality (unmoored yet determined) structures her incremental progress posture. However, "displaced rooted" as exact phrasing appears only once; the tone operates more through enacted paradox than explicit thematic statement.</comment>
