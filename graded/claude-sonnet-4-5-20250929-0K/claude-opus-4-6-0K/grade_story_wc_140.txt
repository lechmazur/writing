<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's core motivation is clearly established—she seeks the texture of erased memories—and her method of collecting fragments shows consistent character logic. Her micro-choices (taking one certificate, layering it onto her wall) reveal hierarchy of values. Internal experience is embodied through her perceptual filter, though the piece leans heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No meaningful change occurs; she continues her established pattern, which reads as Earned Stasis but lacks visible foreclosure cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers fragments toward a conceptual repricing where visibility becomes the closest thing to a name. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Maren, port city Thessaly, container labyrinth, three years post-erasure). The filing-cabinet discovery and final addition to the wall constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the map's purpose crystallizes) with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "that visibility is the closest thing to a name any of them will ever have again"—a price of permanent erasure acknowledged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective detail (blue container, dented roof, corrugated walls) and constrains Maren's movement through tidal cycles. The found filing cabinets enable the climactic discovery. Sensory detail is filtered through her archaeologist's lens (scratched initials, faded stamps, the grain of erased histories). The poison label functions as micro-setting object that charges the final image by appearing on the wall beside the death certificate. Spatial choreography across the stacked maze remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—constructing a map of erased histories to make the dead visible—is signaled early and sustained. The filing-cabinet discovery provides one meaningful deepening: hundreds of clerical errors confirm the systemic nature of erasure and supply concrete evidence for her project. Agency is attention and curation (taking one certificate, layering it), which forecloses the path of passive grief. The cost is conceptual rather than decisional: she accepts permanent invisibility in exchange for this makeshift monument. No explicit antagonist or reversal, but accumulative pressure coheres under the Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—what remains when official record is gone—emerges organically through concrete particulars: the poison label's integrity, Daud's name in his own hand, the child's drawing. The filing cabinets reweight prior material by revealing erasure as systemic rather than singular accident. The final image offers a non-literal answer: visibility as substitute for name is both monument and acknowledgment of irretrievable loss. Subtext operates consistently in silence and gesture (Lark's humming, shared food, Maren's refusal to pursue reinstatement). No overt moralizing; complexity embraced without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's perceptual signature (she sees the port as "library of vanished lives," notices what archaeologists notice). Psychic distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches her knowledge limits. Diction remains consistent—elevated literary register appropriate to the voice—with purposeful compression in phrases like "the bureaucracy had already digested her identity and excreted nothing useful in return." No dialogue to judge. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, tightening in the filing-cabinet beat. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she perceives," "she feels") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance cleanly. Some filter-verb reliance in reflective passages ("she perceives," "she finds") and mild repetition of "she" stems in the middle third create minor drag. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("the bureaucracy had already digested her identity"), though density approaches but does not cross into overwriting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Propulsion remains steady despite heavy reflection load; the BRR exception applies because reflection is anchored to present stimuli (tides, containers, found objects) and micro-choices alter present options.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic erasure, container-port setting, and archaeological method feels specific and non-obvious. The poison label as "only honest thing" transforms a found object into thematic anchor through Maren's particular lens. Risk-taking in structure—sustained reflection interleaved with accumulative beats—heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template grief narratives by focusing on monument-making rather than reinstatement or revenge. Emotional truth anchored in concrete action (layering fragments, moving with tides) rather than abstraction. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (death certificate error survivor) is present throughout and her past erasure motivates all choices. She decides to collect fragments, to keep the poison label, to take one certificate, and to layer it onto the wall—key turns that drive the accumulative structure. Her observation work (listening, memorizing, filtering) enables the middle beats. The filing-cabinet discovery and final layering action both trace to her agency. Setup clear, middle development sustained, closure participation direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The poison label appears in two functionally distinct beats: discovery and contemplation (middle), then placement on the wall beside the death certificate (closure). Its unique property—honest self-declaration—contrasts with the erasure theme and charges the final image by juxtaposition. Early signal established, middle use thematically weighted, closure reprise reweights prior material. Irreplaceability high; no other found object would carry this particular integrity claim. Causally active in Maren's value hierarchy.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Erased histories (core concept) shapes every stake and tactic on the page: Maren's method, her motivation, the community of ghosts, the filing-cabinet discovery, and the map's purpose. The concept changes options by defining what "restoration" means—not reinstatement but visibility. Present in setup (clerical error), developed through the labyrinth community and found fragments, and crystallized at closure when the map makes the dead visible. Indispensable; removing this concept collapses the entire narrative logic and thematic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren "filters reality differently" (attribute) constrains her perception throughout: she sees the port as library, collects fragments others ignore, and presses them into composite histories. This trait enables the middle work (memorizing longshoreman stories, cataloging traces) and the filing-cabinet discovery. Visible tradeoff: her filter isolates her from commerce-oriented reality and forecloses normal reintegration. The trait shapes the final map's existence. Early signal clear, middle development sustained, closure participation direct through the act of layering.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Layer" (action) drives the structure: Maren layers stories, fragments, and finally the death certificate onto the wall. The verb organizes middle beats (collecting and arranging) and defines the climactic move (adding the certificate beside poison label and Daud's name). The map grows through repeated layering; the final image depends on this accumulative method. Not swappable—"collect" or "arrange" would lack the textural, archaeological connotation central to theme. Early signal, middle pressure, closure participation all present with causal force.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories (method) is signaled early (longshoremen's shift-change talk) and structures the middle work: Maren memorizes details, layers accounts, builds composite history. The filing-cabinet discovery extends the method to written records. Mechanics matter because the layering depends on these gathered pieces. However, the method is more described than dramatized in distinct beats; we're told she collects rather than shown multiple collection scenes. Functional across setup and middle, closure linkage present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth (setting) pressures every choice: tidal cycles force upward/downward movement, the maze structure creates discovery opportunities (filing cabinets in newly accessible container), and the blue container with dented roof houses Maren and the growing map. The setting supplies the resource (abandoned containers full of traces) that makes the project possible. Spatial constraints shape tactics throughout. Early anchor clear, middle development through tidal rhythm and maze navigation, closure participation direct (the map exists on the container wall). Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm (timeframe) governs movement and access: high tide forces residents upward, low tide opens new containers. The filing-cabinet discovery occurs "as the tide withdraws," and the final line notes "the tide is turning." The rhythm replaces calendar and structures Maren's exploration pattern. However, the tides don't create urgent deadlines or constrain peak choices with visible time pressure—they set pacing rather than impose costs. Setup clear (tides govern everything), middle use present (movement rhythm), closure participation gestural (tide turning as she listens).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to discover the texture of memories—is dramatized through on-page choices: collecting fragments, keeping the poison label, building the map. Friction exists between want (understanding texture) and cost (accepting permanent invisibility, "not revenge or reinstatement"). The filing-cabinet discovery concretizes texture as "the grain of erased histories pressing back." Early establishment clear, middle choices driven by this desire, closure crystallizes the motivation's fulfillment and price. Desire shapes the final image directly: the map makes texture tangible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Nameless identity" (tone) is coherent throughout: clinical opening (clerical error language), the community of erased people, impersonal systems, and the final acknowledgment that visibility substitutes for name. Tone modulates subtly—slightly warmer in community moments (Daud, Lark), slightly harder in bureaucracy passages—without breaking key. The poison label beat and filing-cabinet discovery both charge the nameless condition with layered meaning. Tone shapes the final image by making "the closest thing to a name" resonate as both achievement and loss.</comment>
