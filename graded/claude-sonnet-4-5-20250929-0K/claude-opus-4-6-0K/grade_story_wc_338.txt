<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and profession-specific: her eye reads "damage as language," and the discipline of "proximity without contact" is embodied in gesture. The Belgian's silent retreat and her own choice to "leave the chapel whispering" show contradictory impulses—curiosity versus restraint—acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the final renunciation feels slightly underdramatized; we see her decide not to sensationalize, but the cost of walking away from a career-making discovery is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Lena chooses gentle documentation over sensationalism, foreclosing the path of public recognition. The cost is legible in her modest publication plan and the phrase "leave the chapel whispering." Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered observation (map tear, henge discovery, vault comparison, Belgian's gesture) and resolves in a cadence shift that reweights her stake from discovery to preservation. One tightening (the realization that the Belgian's silence was chosen grief) narrows her options and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, the henge pillars, and the whispered acoustics all constrain Lena's choices: she sets up comparative footage because the decay is measurable, and the "trick of hydrology" that spared the western wall guides her conservation strategy. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional lens (mineral bloom, foxing, calcium deposits). The final image—rain older than the henge, her working beneath dissolving saints—charges closure by anchoring her renunciation in the physicality of erosion and time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to interpret or protect the chapel's silence. The discovery sequence (map → henge → vault → Belgian footage) tightens options; the realization that "some silences were chosen" is the key turn that forecloses sensationalism with visible cost (modest publication, crediting another, no fame). Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening comes from pattern recognition rather than confrontation. Minor slip: the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral; we don't see Lena wrestle with ambition or financial need, so the renunciation costs less emotionally than it might.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief made beautiful and hidden, the ethics of interpreting silence—emerges organically from the vault's design, the Belgian's retreat, and Lena's mirrored restraint. The final image ("finding in the tear between them not emptiness but a kind of tenderness") is a non-literal answer that reweights the map's division of known/unknown without moralizing. Subtext operates in the Belgian's hovering hand and Lena's decision to frame "what remained against the map of what was gone." No forced epiphanies; the insight is earned through comparative observation and the acoustics that "fold inward."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and profession-specific: "map framer by trade, which people misunderstood" and "surgery" for conservation work establish Lena's perceptual signature. POV distance is stable; her knowledge of cartographic damage informs every observation (grain, tear language, vellum). Diction remains controlled under pressure ("shielded openness," "methodically curious"). Minor deduction: a few phrases ("the familiar pull of things almost lost," "whispered chapel") edge toward stock lyricism, though they remain voice-consistent and don't muddle clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density: "the rain had been patient with it" and "prayers meant to stay close to the mouth" compress image and implication. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. The comparative structure (1971 footage vs. present) propels the middle efficiently. Minor deduction: "shielded openness" and "whispered chapel" are slightly overworked as recurring phrases, and "the familiar pull of things almost lost" is a touch generic for Lena's otherwise specific voice. No loops or major artifacts; clarity and momentum hold through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—map conservator studying a vault through silent archival footage, choosing preservation over publication—is specific and non-obvious. The "tear" motif (map division, silence as rupture and respect) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present in the quiet, renunciatory ending and the accumulative structure. Minor deduction: the Belgian archaeologist as Lena's mirror risks schematic neatness, and the chapel itself (grief sanctuary) is more shaped than discovered, edging toward symbolic convenience. Still, the occupational specificity and ethical calculus elevate beyond template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's perception (reading damage, recognizing the Belgian's restraint) drives the key turn: she decides to recommend modest conservation rather than sensationalize. Her profession enables the comparative method and her "methodically curious" trait constrains her to respect silence. Present in setup (map work), middle (vault analysis), and closure (conservation report draft). Causal pressure is moderate; her choice feels more like confirmation than struggle, so irreplaceability is mid-high rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The henge appears in two beats: discovery and as a temporal anchor ("rain older than the henge"). It frames the vault's entrance and recurs in the final image, but its stone circle with cross symbol is not revisited or reweighted at closure. The henge enables discovery but doesn't constrain later choices; swapping it for any ancient marker would require only minor edits. Functional but not causally indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispered chapel defines the stakes: its acoustics ("breathing seemed to fold inward") and scale ("murmuring, for prayers meant to stay close") dramatize Lena's choice to preserve rather than amplify. The concept shapes her tactics (comparative study, modest publication) and charges the final line ("leave the chapel whispering"). Present in setup (vault entry), middle (acoustic observation), and closure (her decision). Removing "whispered" would flatten the ethical calculus and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is embodied in her systematic comparison of footage, her discipline of "proximity without contact," and her choice to draft a conservation report rather than rush to publish. It enables her to recognize the Belgian's restraint and constrains her to avoid sensationalism—one clear trade-off (curiosity vs. restraint) that forecloses fame. Present in setup (map work), middle (analysis), and closure (report). The trait is more shown than merely labeled, but the cost is oblique rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reopen" structures the entire arc: she reopens the Belgian's abandoned question, the chamber (never formally closed), and the ethical dilemma of interpreting silence. The action drives her vault visit, comparative analysis, and final decision to publish modestly. Present in setup (colleague's map shipment), middle (footage comparison), and closure (conservation recommendation). The verb is irreplaceable—"investigate" or "study" would lose the ethical layer of engaging with the Belgian's silence. Cost is legible in her renunciation of a major discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (laptop, two video files), demonstrated in the middle (frame-by-frame matching, measuring what rain took), and shapes the closure decision (conservation report based on comparison). It enables her to see the Belgian's hovering hand and measure decay precisely, constraining her to recommend stabilization rather than excavation. The mechanics matter: without the footage comparison, she couldn't trace the Belgian's retreat or quantify loss. Irreplaceable; other methods (photos, sketches) would lack the temporal specificity and the Belgian's gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vault's rain damage (mineral bloom, calcium deposits, hydrology trick) directly shapes Lena's tactics: she recommends controlled drainage and western-wall stabilization. The dissolving frescoes are the measurable subject of her comparison and the physical manifestation of the theme (what rain takes vs. what remains). Present in setup (vault entry), middle (footage comparison), and closure (conservation plan, final image of working beneath dissolving saints). Environment is micro-setting that alters the conservation strategy and charges the ending with visible decay.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The map tear (known/unknown division with the circled-cross symbol) is the inciting image that sends Lena to the valley and reappears conceptually in the final image ("framing the map of what remained against the map of what was gone"). It's more lyric motif than ticking clock; time is generational (decades of rain, 1971 footage) rather than urgent. The timeframe seeds and returns with reweighted meaning, but it doesn't tighten moment-to-moment decisions. Strong early-to-final reprise, but no mid-scene development that constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to interpret silence with empathy"—is dramatized in Lena's recognition that "some silences were chosen" and her decision to honor the Belgian's retreat by publishing modestly. It's present in setup (her map-work discipline), middle (reading the Belgian's body language), and closure (leaving the chapel whispering). Friction appears in the tension between her professional curiosity and ethical restraint, with visible cost (foregone fame). The phrase itself arrives late (~60% mark), but the want/need conflict is enacted throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is embodied in Lena's "discipline of proximity without contact," her controlled footage analysis, and her decision to document without sensationalizing. The tone modulates from clinical observation (frame-by-frame comparison) to quiet resolve ("letting the place speak at its own volume") and charges the final image (working "with shielded openness" beneath dissolving saints). Coherent through turns, though the phrase itself is slightly overworked. The tone is integral to the ethical stance and the ending's resonance.</comment>
