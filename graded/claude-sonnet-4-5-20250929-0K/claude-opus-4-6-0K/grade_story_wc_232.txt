<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and her solitary expertise reads as lived-in. The promise motive coheres across the arc, and the final choice—touching but not crossing—feels earned by the seven-year research and her grief. Minor issue: "empirically intuitive" is told rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the climactic choice could have shown more internal friction on the page. No therapy-speak or label-only emotion; embodied detail is present throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by paragraph two (Elara, valley shop, post-husband death). The drive lens reads as Causal/Accumulative hybrid: research narrows location, seasonal rains trigger the hike, ants lead to the fissure, chip unlocks the doorway, and the final refusal reconfigures the promise with visible cost (she keeps it by not stepping through). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she touches the threshold, whispers fulfillment, and leaves with peace—foreclosing reunion with felt emotional cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the transparent stone reveals Marcus, and her choice narrows options permanently. The lens holds and cost is legible in "the first peace she had felt in years" after renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming cavern is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent fungi, ghost orchids, rising water at her ankles all ground the impossible space in sensory particulars. The ant column provides a concrete solve-path that reflects her skill (reading landscapes). The brass socket and archway function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—she must use the chip or leave. Spatial choreography is clean (boulder → fissure → cavern interior → archway) and the midsummer/creek-rise timeframe tightens access to this exact moment. Minor: the valley-town shop setting in the opening remains generic and could carry more lived-in detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: fulfill Marcus's promise by finding the Doorway of Decisions. Pressure tightens as the rains create conditions, then the ants provide the path, then the chip unlocks the choice to reclaim a life with Marcus. The protagonist's agency drives escalation (she researches, hikes, follows ants, crawls through, fits the chip), and the final renunciation forecloses reunion with visible emotional cost. One meaningful turn occurs when the transparent stone reveals the alternate life, forcing a trade-off between loneliness and earned wisdom. The resolution is earned by her alteration (from ghost haunting her life to someone who keeps promises without needing the reward).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the promise-keeping structure and the grief/solitude particulars: what we owe the dead versus what we owe ourselves, and whether wisdom earned through loss can be a form of completion. The final image—palm flat against the stone, whispering fulfillment, carrying peace—answers the question without stating a moral. The chip/doorway motif recurs with reweighted meaning (literal key becomes metaphorical proof of fidelity). Subtext operates in the gesture (touching not crossing) and in "less weathered but somehow less wise." No thematic echo or moralizing in the final beat; the choice implies rather than declares.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elara's perceptual signature (reading landscapes like faces, noticing ants hauling petals) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("calcifying," "sagging architecture of her days"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: compressed at the climax ("hands trembled," "whispered"), wider in the research summary. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose rhythms accelerate in the cavern discovery and slow for the final beat. Minor: the opening paragraph's "empirically intuitive—not psychic, not mystical" reads slightly expository, a hedge that could trust dramatization more.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in the discovery sequence. Information density is high: "carpenter ants moved along the rock face, carrying fragments of pale material—flower petals, she realized" does scenic, perceptual, and puzzle work in one line. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Grammar and tense are clean. Minor issues: "the one beam holding up the sagging architecture of her days" and "hollowed her out" are near-clichés that don't quite reach fresh metaphor, and "impossibly fragrant for bare stone" tells wonder rather than showing sensory surprise. The final line's rhythm supports closure well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of antique-map expertise, a type-foundry chip as literal key, and the ant-following solve feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would require full rewrite because the cartographic skill and marginalia research are load-bearing. The ending avoids the easy choice (reunion) in favor of a quieter, riskier resolution (earned peace through renunciation). Proximity check: the "doorway of decisions" and grieving-widow-finds-magic tropes are familiar, but the execution through historical map marginalia and seasonal cave blooming is fresh enough. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreating to irony or explaining away the magic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's loneliness is established early (paragraph two), her map-dealer expertise enables the research (paragraph four) and the ant-reading solve (paragraph eight), and her choice at the doorway is the closure beat. She appears in every paragraph and her decisions drive all major turns: research narrows location, hike on solstice, following ants, inserting chip, touching-not-crossing. The final choice would collapse without her occupational skill and grief motive. Cost is visible: she forgoes reunion to keep the promise's integrity. Causal pressure across three beats (research, discovery, renunciation) and closure linkage justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The matrix chip is introduced early (paragraph five), Marcus presses it into her palm with the promise, and she carries it in her vest pocket on the hike (paragraph seven). It clicks into the brass socket to unlock the doorway (paragraph ten), making the transparent stone reveal Marcus. The chip's reversed-D letter and "type foundry" specificity matter: it's a cartographic artifact that fits the marginalia research. Two distinct beats (gift/promise and unlock) plus closure participation. Cost linkage: using it opens the choice she must refuse. Removing it would require a different unlock mechanism and break the cartographic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The promise is introduced paragraph five, labeled "the one beam holding up the sagging architecture of her days" (paragraph six), and drives the seven-year research and solstice hike. At closure she whispers "I kept my promise" (paragraph twelve), reframing the act: keeping it means proving fidelity, not claiming the reward. The concept shapes stakes (why she searches) and the final renunciation (she fulfills the letter but refuses the gift). Visible cost: she walks away from reunion because the promise was "not for me. For you." Setup, middle pressure (research montage), and payoff all present. It alters tactics (she must find the doorway to honor Marcus) and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is defined paragraph one and demonstrated when she reads the landscape (paragraph eight: watching woods, processing with intuition, noticing ants). It enables the solve—no map marks the entrance, so her trained instinct finds it. The trait appears in two beats (definition and ant-discovery) and is causally necessary: without it she couldn't interpret the ants' path. Cost is implicit (thirty years of study to reach this skill). However, it's more told than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the middle development is thin—one decisive use rather than a constrained trade-off. Setup and payoff present; modest middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chip's glimmer when it "caught the fungal light and seemed to glimmer, as though the metal itself recognized where it had been made to go" (paragraph ten) is a single-beat flourish that charges the insertion moment but doesn't create a turn. The glimmer is atmospheric rather than causal—she was already fitting the chip regardless. It appears only at the socket, so no setup or middle development. Swappable: "gleamed" or "shone" would serve nearly as well. It enriches texture but doesn't drive a choice or redefine options. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Following ants home" is set up paragraph eight (she notices the carpenter ants hauling petals into a fissure) and is the method that reveals the entrance: "That was how she found it." The ants' behavior is concrete (carrying pale fragments underground, warm sweet air from the gap) and the method reflects her landscape-reading skill. It shapes one key turn (discovery of the cavern) and is signaled before use. The mechanics matter: she widens the fissure the ants disappeared into. However, it's a single-use solve without recurrence at closure. Setup and development present; payoff is the discovery itself, not the final image. Causal role in one major beat justifies mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blooming cavern is introduced paragraph nine (bioluminescent fungi, ghost orchids, mineral-rich water) and is the literal setting for the climax. It provides the archway and brass socket (constraining the chip-use), and the rising water at her ankles (paragraph twelve) adds urgency—the timeframe tightens as the creek floods. The impossible flowers and warm air make the magic legible and ground the otherworldly doorway in sensory particulars. The cavern appears in three beats (discovery, description, final choice) and its resources (socket, rising water) affect the ending. Midsummer and seasonal rains are named early (paragraph six) and enable access, so the setting is causally load-bearing. Removal would require a different unlock location and lose the sensory charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The creek rising is established paragraph six ("This June, the rains came heavy and steady, and the creek behind her house began to climb its banks") and paragraph seven ("the creek continued to rise outside"). The timeframe gates access: the doorway reveals itself "only when underground springs surged, when the creek rose with seasonal rain" (paragraph six). At closure, water is "rising at her ankles" (paragraph twelve), adding modest urgency. However, the live clock doesn't visibly tighten her decision—she stands "for a long time" without the water forcing her hand. The element shapes one key turn (access enabled) and is present at the ending, but the time pressure is more atmospheric than tactical. Setup and payoff present; middle pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the doorway is introduced paragraph five (Marcus's deathbed request), drives the seven-year research (paragraph six), and shapes the solstice hike and all discovery actions. At closure, fulfilling the promise becomes the stake she trades against reunion with Marcus: she whispers "I kept my promise" and leaves (paragraph twelve). The desire is dramatized through concrete choices (research, hike, crawl, insert chip) and conflicted at the end (wanting Marcus versus honoring the promise's spirit). Visible cost: she forgoes the alternate life. The motivation appears in setup (promise), middle (research montage and hike), and payoff (renunciation), and it forecloses a path. High integration across all three gates and strong causal pressure.</comment>
