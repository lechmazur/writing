<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied ("dove gray map case...worn to the softness of a moth's wing"), and her motivation—transmuting grief through visual arcs—is dramatized through concrete choices (arranging photographs, documenting vines). However, the piece leans heavily on reflective narration rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; her calm perceptiveness never faces genuine friction or mistake. The ending renunciation ("meant to be tended") feels asserted rather than earned through a visible cost that forecloses a path. While the texture is rich, the lack of on-page struggle or tradeoff caps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Maren, lavender field, factory ruins, spring). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: arcs of photographs accumulate meaning, vines climb, townspeople gather. Yet no decisive change or visible cost lands on the page—Maren arrives, lays out photos, and sits; the "puzzle was never meant to be solved" is a thematic claim, not a reconfiguration with felt price. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived because anchors are clear, but closure remains conceptual assertion rather than on-page shift under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered and character-filtered ("gentle beast that had lain down"), and sensory detail is purposeful (purple scent, rust, vines). The dove gray map case and flat stone function as micro-setting, constraining Maren's ritual. The recurring image of vines climbing appears in multiple beats and charges the final paragraph, though the constraint on choice is oblique. Strong descriptive control with clear spatial choreography; the setting feels indispensable to tone and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmuting grief into collective healing—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, no on-page tightening or deepening narrows Maren's options or forces a trade-off; she arranges photos, townspeople come, the field grows, and she sits. The vines' climb and the completion of the fourteenth arc suggest accumulation, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a pattern break or cadence shift with cost. The piece remains at one pressure level from start to finish, and Maren's agency is descriptive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: grief as soil, arcs as transformation, scars as stories. The final line ("meant to be tended") reweights the premise without overt moralizing, and the image of the butterfly blurred across the arc is resonant. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo ("every broken thing was also a beginning") and the ending insight feels summarized rather than discovered through friction. Strong thematic coherence, but lacks the friction and earned discovery that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: elevated, lyric diction ("beauty rarely asks permission," "cartographies of grief") suits Maren's archivist perspective. Psychic distance is stable, and perceptual signature is clear (she notices arcs, curves, grammar of transformation). However, some diction verges on over-written ("earnest whimsy," "strange, sweet algebra") and the register occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("dove gray...moth's wing"). No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and metaphor are legible, though density in peak beats risks obscuring immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences are generally clear, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff: "cartographies of grief," "visual grammar," "strange, sweet algebra" cluster without sharpening pressure. Several lines paraphrase adjacent content ("beauty rarely asks permission" / "scars are just stories the body tells"). Template cadence appears in reflective passages ("She liked to linger," "She did not leave"). The Overwriting check triggers a −0.4 deduction for density without payoff, and paraphrase loops add −0.2. Final third remains lyric-heavy, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—grief archivist creating photographic arcs in a reclaimed ruin—is fresh and specific. The dove gray map case, vines climbing, and lavender field cohere into a singular vision. However, the emotional arc (arrival → arrangement → contemplation) follows a reflective template without surprise or risk; the "tending not solving" insight is elegant but familiar in grief literature. The piece transforms its material through voice and detail, but the structure and resolution feel safe. Solid originality in texture, moderate in concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her occupation (subtle puzzle archivist) is named and thematically relevant. However, her choices on the page are minimal: she opens the case, lays out photos, and sits. The archival method (cataloging the unsolvable) informs her worldview but does not constrain a key turn. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development via decision is absent. Swappable with "grief counselor" or "memorial curator" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dove gray map case appears in beat one (carried everywhere, opened on a flat stone) and beat three (closed at the end). Its leather texture and contents (photographs) are specific and handled. The case frames Maren's ritual and its closing bookends the arc, but it does not constrain a choice or shift meaning between appearances. Setup, development (ritual use), and closure presence are met; causal pressure is light. Strong integration, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Collective healing is dramatized: townspeople visit, Tomasz brings a bench, Elena plants lavender, the field grows as a shared space. The concept shapes stakes (Maren's motivation) and outcomes (town transformation). However, it unfolds in summary rather than scene pressure; no on-page choice tests or deepens it. Setup and closure are strong, but middle development lacks friction. Present across beats, but more as theme than tactic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is asserted early ("perceptively calm even in the early days of her mourning") and echoed in her steady ritual, but never tested or constrained on the page. No moment dramatizes a cost of calmness (missed urgency, suppressed anger) or a benefit under pressure. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff. Mentioned in setup, absent from middle and closure as a live force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Linger" is named explicitly ("She liked to linger here") and enacted at closure ("She did not leave. She let herself linger"). The action defines Maren's stance and the story's rhythm: refusal to move on, tending rather than solving. It shapes the ending's Earned Stasis and is irreplaceable—"visit" or "work" would not carry the same weight. Setup, middle (explicit statement), and closure (enacted renunciation) are met. Essential to tone and closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arcs in black-and-white photographs are introduced early (Maren's method, arranged in curved sequences) and drive multiple beats: she documents vines, lays out fourteen images for fourteen lives, pins arcs to factory walls, and completes the final arc at closure. The method is specific (not "memorial" or "collage") and shapes townspeople's response. Setup, middle development (ongoing documentation), and closure (arc completed) are met. The mechanics matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lavender field behind factory ruins is introduced in the opening line, anchors every beat, and provides the stage for Maren's ritual and the townspeople's transformation. The field's dual nature (beauty/ruin) mirrors the theme and charges the closure image. Vines climbing the ruins and lavender growing through debris are tactile and recurring. Setup, middle use (Maren kneels, uses flat stone), and closure (final wide shot, sitting on bench) are met. The setting is indispensable and specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As vines climb" is invoked explicitly ("As vines climb, she had written"; "The vines climbed another imperceptible inch") and frames the timeframe as gradual accumulation across weeks. The climbing matters thematically and structurally (each tendril documented), but does not tighten a decision or create urgency. Setup (weeks of progress), middle (ongoing documentation), and closure (final inch) are met. Time shapes atmosphere but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to transmute pain into a masterpiece"—is stated explicitly and drives her ritual: arranging arcs, documenting vines, creating a living field. However, it is told rather than tested; no friction between her want and a competing cost or fear appears on the page. The motivation is present in setup, middle action, and closure realization, but lacks dramatized conflict. Functional and thematically cohesive, but not irreplaceable—"honor" or "memorialize" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Earnest whimsy is named explicitly ("sorrow and wonder could coexist in earnest whimsy") and permeates the voice: lyric elevation (dove gray, moth's wing, gentle beast) paired with grounded detail (bolt hole, sparrow nest). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (grief → contemplation → acceptance). However, the phrase "earnest whimsy" appears late and reads as authorial label rather than emergent effect. Tone charges the final image but is asserted rather than taught. Strong execution, moderate integration.</comment>
