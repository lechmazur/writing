<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—the yellow glass meridian, the tracing gesture, the sting of empathy—grounding her spiritual curiosity in concrete micro-choices (staying, recording, sweeping). Internal conflict between solitude and connection operates through her nightly ritual rather than explicit debate. The final choice to sweep and record is earned by accumulated causality, though the renunciation (never leaving) lacks a visible on-page cost that forecloses an alternative path; it reads more as acceptance than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (tracking station, Maren, post-collapse era) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece accumulates density through repeated tracing rituals, building toward a final image where Maren sweeps after the bolide—an Earned Stasis that reweights her solitude as radiant strength. One meaningful deepening: her empathic realization mid-story narrows her understanding and charges the ending. Cost is conceptual (choosing to remain soft) but legible in the closing image, meeting the RR standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass constrains the evening ritual and charges the final bolide moment with "colors no chart could hold." The tracking station's micro-setting (corroded bolts, volcanic dust, seismographs) pressures Maren's daily choices and roots her spiritual practice in physical maintenance. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional filter: she notices meteor azimuth and sensor condensation before personal comfort. The basalt ridge and ash plains anchor spatial coherence without postcard padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to remain attentive when attentiveness has "gone out of fashion." The meteor-empathy beat at mid-story tightens Maren's understanding, reframing her solitude from hiding to discipline. Her nightly cataloging becomes a visible escalation of devotion, and the final sweep after the bolide demonstrates agency—choosing softness as strength with the cost of continued isolation. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length; no coincidence resolves the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (strength in vulnerability, brilliance as fragility's consequence) emerges through the meteor-tracing particulars and the yellow glass ritual, never stated as thesis. The final image—sweeping dust so instruments can see what "tonight's human heart already knew"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Flourishing stillness" recurs purposefully, reweighted at closure when stillness expands "like a seed in volcanic soil." Subtext operates in Maren's devotion "that bordered on reverence" and the archivists' future discovery, charging the present with quiet consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren reads maintenance manuals as sutras and hears seismographs as chanting. Distance remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Diction control slips slightly in elevated passages ("primal elegance," "phenomenological astronomy") that drift above a janitor's plausible lexicon under pressure, though the voice-motivated lyricism supports the spiritual stance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the meteor-empathy beat. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Rhythm varies well until the final two paragraphs, where "she opened her eyes / she picked up her broom / she climbed the stairs" creates brief template cadence in a peak beat (−0.4). One paraphrase moment: "what it might mean to burn so brightly precisely because you were disintegrating" is immediately restated as "met the atmosphere honestly, surrendered its mass" without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language ("gray prayer shawl," "trembling gold meridian") enriches without muddle, and no filter-verb stacks appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic janitor, spiritual practice, and meteor empathy feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation test passes: replacing Maren with a generic observer or the yellow glass with another object would collapse the thematic engine. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative rather than causal turns) and tone (primal elegance sustained without irony) heightens stakes. The "overlooked era" frame and the future archivist touch add conceptual depth without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices (staying, tracing nightly, cataloging with devotion, sweeping after the bolide) create key turns in her understanding and drive the Earned Stasis closure. She is on the page throughout, present in all three gates, and her agency shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass appears in three beats: the evening ritual in paragraph three, the final bolide moment casting "green shadows through the yellow lantern glass," and implicitly framing her nightly stance. It constrains her ritual timing (sunset) and charges the closure image with color fusion. Irreplaceable: the specific hue matters to the thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named early (paragraph three) and returns in the penultimate paragraph where "the stillness flourished, expanding like a seed." It shapes Maren's stake (choosing to remain attentive in silence) and participates in closure, though it functions more as thematic echo than a tactical constraint. Present in setup and payoff; middle development implicit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Spiritual curiosity is established early (reading manuals as sutras, listening to seismographs) and drives her nightly tracing and catalog work. It constrains her choice to remain rather than transfer, with the cost of isolation. Visible in all three gates and causally active across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Empathizing with meteors is the pivotal middle turn: "She understood, then, why she had never left this place." It redefines her motivation from passive hiding to active discipline and charges the final sweep with purpose. Present in setup (tracing begins early), development (the green-white fire epiphany), and payoff (the bolide's "fragile spine"). Not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is signaled early, used in the empathy beat ("held her finger on the afterimage"), and shapes her nightly catalog work. The mechanics (finger against dark, azimuth and color notes) matter to her practice and the archivists' later discovery. Present in all three gates and drives her devotional escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tracking station supplies resources (parabolic dishes, meteor sensors, observation ledger) and pressures Maren's daily choices (corroded bolts, condensation, volcanic dust). The roof platform is the site of her ritual. It anchors the overlooked-era frame and the instruments that must be kept clean. Present in all three gates, though not the sole driver of closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"The hush of an overlooked era" frames the opening and charges Maren's choice to remain attentive when others have turned inward. It supplies the conceptual pressure (relevance versus obsolescence) but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat like a live clock. Present in setup and implicit at payoff; middle development is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find strength in vulnerability is dramatized through the meteor-empathy realization and tested in the choice to "remain soft in a hard silence." Friction between her solitude and the world's indifference creates cost. Present in all three gates and drives the Earned Stasis closure with visible consequence (continued isolation, devotional labor).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Primal elegance is sustained through elevated diction ("brass-framed pane," "trembling gold meridian," "phenomenological astronomy") that modulates with pressure: calm during sweeping, intense during the meteor epiphany, reverent at closure. Tone charges the final image ("the world had...shown her its entire fragile spine") without breaking into irony or sentimentality. Coherent across all turns.</comment>
