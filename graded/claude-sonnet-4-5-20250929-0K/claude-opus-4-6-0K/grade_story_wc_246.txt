<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific; her evolution from translator to author feels earned through on-page discoveries. The contradiction between isolation crushing and holding her operates simultaneously in scene. The final choice to edit the Vela signal feels motivated by her established values—"to thresh meaning from experience"—with visible cost in the pen's growing lightness. Minor: the backstory about the two ships is told rather than dramatized, reducing immediacy at a pivotal setup moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density increase (discovery of pen → wrong seeds → unbending → final signal) and the closure image crystallizes her stance with felt cost (the pen runs out, she presses down anyway). Closure qualifies as Charged Poise—the final moment reweights her work from translation to authorship with undeniable pressure, though the cost is future-facing rather than fully paid on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; the ellipsis between "two ships adjusted course" and "next morning...never changed course" is motivated and charges the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Locus as gravitational anomaly constrains Maren's work and enables the pen's mechanics; spacetime pooling is felt through signal distortion rather than catalog description. The pen itself functions as micro-setting, handled twice (discovery, final use) and charged at closure. Sensory detail is selective: "hummed against the paper," "absence...subtraction of meaning." The core chamber and console are present but not deeply rendered; at this length the focus on the pen and signals is appropriate and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: decoding vs. rewriting signals, then authorship itself. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren realizes the Locus distorts signals passing back, narrowing her options to either accept her errors or use the pen. The escalation—her shift from correcting errors to "unbending things" to facing the pen's depletion—is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: "the pen would run out eventually," and her final act forecloses passivity. No antagonist is required; coincidence (finding the pen) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Maren's work: translation vs. authorship, intention vs. noise, the ethics of revision. The pen's mechanics become a meditation on contingency without abstraction; "pulling a thread from a tapestry" is specific and operational. The final image—pressing the nib to a fresh page while "confidently uncertain"—reweights the opening without moralizing. Subtext operates in the phrase "seeds" (both agricultural and causal), the pen's "serpent's tongue" nib, and the isolation that "held her." No thematic echo or sermon; wisdom is earned through on-page discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; psychic distance is controlled and apt. Diction matches Maren's technical training: "harmonic ghosts," "contingent relationships," "causality." The prose modulates with her emotional arc—early confidence ("precise, filed without hesitation"), crisis ("what the Locus could do"), then quiet authority ("she pressed down"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she interprets signals as "whispers," "riddles," "flares of meaning." No head-hopping. The phrase "confidently uncertain" recurs purposefully without filter-verb stacks. Minor: "serpent's tongue" and "iridium-tipped" feel slightly elevated for the moment's pressure, but remain voice-plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or stakes. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with the arc. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "pooled like water," "pulling a thread" earn their space. The "strange comfort settled...like sediment" is functional, not decorative. Clarity is strong; pronoun references are clean. Minor: "She told no one" is scaffolding (who would she tell at a solo station?), and "metaphorically and literally" is light hedging that slows the beat slightly. Overall propulsion is excellent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravitational anomaly + signal interpretation + history-editing pen is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "edit history" trope through the Locus's mechanics and Maren's professional lens; the cost (contingent relationships, pen depletion) is integral. Risk: the piece commits fully to its metaphysical premise without retreat or safety-hedging. The emotional truth—isolation as crucible, authorship as conversation—anchors the speculative elements. Fresh inflection: "to edit...was to engage in conversation with that intent" reframes revision as dialogue rather than erasure. Transformation test: this exact combination of character, setting, and stakes is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as celestial signal interpreter is present by paragraph one (setup gate met). Her professional expertise enables the plot: she recognizes the Locus's distortion, interprets the dormant pulsar incorrectly, then discovers the pen's editing power (development gate met). The final beat—listening to the Vela remnant and pressing the nib to the page—directly ties her interpretive skill to the closure choice (payoff gate met). The character drives at least three distinct beats (initial error, unbending, final signal). Causal pressure is strong: her training creates the problem and the solution. Closure linkage is direct. Specificity: the role is irreplaceable; a generic editor or historian could not perform these actions. Minor limiter: the middle beats summarize her unbending work rather than dramatizing a second discrete choice under pressure, which slightly reduces beat involvement credit. Cost connection is present (reputation, isolation, pen depletion tied to her continued work). No late arrival, no ornamental use, minimal swappability. Strong integration across all three gates with tight causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pen is introduced in paragraph four, before the midpoint (setup gate met). It is handled in two distinct beats: discovery behind the bulkhead (draws a line through the pulsar classification) and the final use (presses nib to fresh page for the Vela signal) (development and payoff gates met). The pen's mechanics constrain Maren's choices: it hums, accepts marks "like absence," and is "growing lighter," creating urgency. Closure linkage is direct: the final image hinges on her pressing the nib down. Specificity is high: the "serpent's tongue" split nib and the fact that it has no ink but still marks are unique properties that matter. Cost connection is explicit: "the pen would run out eventually...growing faint." Two functionally different beats involving the pen are present (the pulsar edit and the Vela signal). Causal pressure: the pen enables her authorship and its depletion charges the ending. Minor limiter: the middle paragraph "She began to unbend things" summarizes repeated pen use rather than dramatizing a second discrete scene, which slightly reduces beat involvement credit. No late arrival, no ornamental description, high irreplaceability. Strong integration with meaningful cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept "editing history" is introduced in paragraph three when Maren draws a line through her report and "the two ships had never changed course" (setup gate met early). The concept shapes her tactics throughout: she "unbends" distorted signals, "straightens tangled signals with careful strokes," and in the final beat prepares to edit the Vela remnant (development and payoff gates met). The mechanics are explained through the "contingent relationships" method—events shift to compensate, creating different but whole patterns—which governs her approach. Causal pressure is strong: editing history is not a theme but the operational stakes; each edit teaches her something and carries cost (reputation, isolation, pen depletion). Closure linkage is direct: the final action is an edit-in-progress. Specificity: the concept is irreplaceable; mere signal interpretation would not create the same stakes or ending. Cost is tied to the concept throughout (crew never questioned her, review board never came, pen running out). Three or more beats involve the concept (initial edit, unbending phase, final signal). No late arrival, no summary-only use, no swappability. Exceptional integration: the concept is the engine of the plot and shapes every major choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The attribute "confidently uncertain" appears explicitly twice: first in paragraph five ("She was confidently uncertain about what she'd done") and again in the final paragraph ("She was confidently uncertain, as always"). It is also enacted in the opening line: "she finally accepted that the signals were not asking to be understood. They were asking to be rewritten"—a realization that embodies confident certainty about method paired with uncertainty about meaning. Setup gate met (paragraph five introduction is within the first half). Development gate met: the trait constrains her middle-phase work—she unbends signals "not recklessly" because each correction teaches her something, showing cautious confidence. Payoff gate met: the final paragraph reprises the phrase and ties it to her final action (pressing the nib while "Sure that the signal meant something. Unsure what it would mean once she was done"). The trait enables her to act despite ambiguity, which is essential to the closure. Causal pressure: her willingness to engage with uncertainty drives both her initial error and her redemptive editing. Cost connection: the attribute leads to her isolation and the pen's depletion (she keeps working despite uncertainty). Two distinct beats (initial acceptance, final signal). Specificity: the trait is character-particular and irreplaceable; blind confidence or pure doubt would break the logic. Minor limiter: the phrase is stated rather than fully embodied in a third discrete on-page choice that tests the attribute under new pressure; the middle "unbending" phase summarizes her stance without a dramatic beat. No late arrival, no ornamental mention, low swappability. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "unbend" is introduced in paragraph six: "She began to unbend things. Not just her errors but the Locus's own distortions, straightening tangled signals..." It is also present in the final paragraph as the implicit action she will perform on the Vela remnant ("she pressed the nib to the page and began"). Setup gate met (paragraph six is past midpoint but the action is seeded earlier through "drew a single line" in paragraph four). Development gate met: unbending defines her middle-phase work and reframes her role from translator to author. Payoff gate met: the final beat is an unbending-in-progress. The action shapes at least two beats (the unbending phase, the final signal). Causal pressure: unbending is the operational method for her redemption and her ongoing work. Closure linkage is direct. Cost connection: the act of unbending depletes the pen. Specificity: the action is tied to the Locus's distortion mechanics and the pen's properties; "correcting" or "fixing" would be generic. Minor limiter: the middle unbending phase is summarized ("she began to unbend things") rather than dramatized as a discrete scene, which reduces beat involvement credit slightly. Late introduction (paragraph six, past midpoint) lowers the score by −0.2 to −0.3. No swappability; the action is integral to the concept and mechanics. Strong integration with cost, but the late and summary treatment prevents top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method "through contingent relationships" is explained in paragraph five: "each event connected to others not by iron chains of causation but by softer dependencies, things that could have gone either way and now simply went the other way." Setup gate met (paragraph five, before the two-thirds mark). Development gate met: the method explains how Maren's edits work—"A ship that never diverted meant a crew that never questioned...which meant she stayed alone"—and it governs her cautious approach ("not recklessly"). Payoff gate is weaker: the method is not explicitly invoked in the final paragraph, though the Vela signal "folded seven ways" implies contingent distortion. The method enables her tactics (she can unbend without breaking) and constrains her (she cannot recklessly rewrite). Causal pressure: the method is the operational rule-set for her edits. Closure linkage is indirect; the final beat assumes the method but does not dramatize it. Specificity: "contingent relationships" is more precise than "editing" alone and ties to the Locus's mechanics. Cost connection: the method's limits (pen depletion, isolation) are present. One to two beats involve the method (the ships example, the unbending phase). Minor limiters: the method is explained rather than dramatized in a distinct on-page test, and the final beat does not explicitly reprise or reweight it. No late arrival, no ornamental use, moderate swappability (the concept could function with a different operational metaphor). Solid integration with cost, but the lack of direct closure participation and the expository treatment lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly (the Locus) is introduced in paragraph two and anchored immediately: "spacetime pooled like water...Transmissions that passed through it arrived changed." Setup gate met early. Development gate met: the Locus enables Maren's work (signal distortion creates her job), creates the problem (her errors), and enables the solution (the pen's resonance with contingency). Payoff gate met: the final signal is "folded seven ways by the anomaly," and Maren's workspace is "the Locus's core chamber." The setting pressures at least three beats (initial distortion, pen discovery, final signal). Causal pressure is strong: without the Locus, the plot does not function. Closure linkage is direct: the anomaly is active in the final image. Specificity: the Locus's properties (spacetime pooling, signal distortion, backward causality) are unique and irreplaceable. Cost connection: the Locus creates Maren's isolation and the pen's mechanics. No late arrival, no ornamental description, no swappability. Exceptional integration: the setting is the engine of the concept and shapes every major choice. Minor limiter: the Locus itself is not a physical constraint Maren navigates (no blocked corridors, no environmental hazard she must avoid); it functions primarily as a rule-set enabler rather than a tactical pressure. Still, the setting is indispensable and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after planting the wrong seeds" is signaled in paragraph three: "Her early interpretations...had traveled downstream...A pulsar she'd classified as dormant turned out to be cycling." This inciting error structures the entire plot. Setup gate met early. Development gate met: the "wrong seeds" create the stakes (her reputation, the two ships) and motivate her discovery of the pen's power. Payoff gate met: the final paragraph implies she is now planting correct seeds (or at least intentional ones) by editing the Vela signal. The timeframe tightens decisions: she is working in the aftermath of error, and the pen's depletion adds urgency ("Someday she would make her last edit"). Causal pressure: the wrong seeds are the inciting incident; without them, she never discovers the pen's power. Closure linkage is indirect: the final beat is a new edit, implicitly after the wrong-seeds phase. Specificity: the agricultural metaphor ("seeds") is purposeful and ties to causality. Cost connection: the wrong seeds cause isolation and drive her redemptive arc. One to two beats trace to the timeframe (the ships incident, the unbending phase). Minor limiters: the "after" is backstory rather than an on-page constraint that alters a live choice in the final beat; the timeframe frames the plot but does not actively pressure the closure. The phrase "planting the wrong seeds" is metaphorical and not reprised at the end to reweight meaning. No late arrival, functional presence, moderate specificity. Solid integration as inciting frame, but the indirect closure link and lack of live urgency in the final beat lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to thresh meaning from experience" is stated explicitly in paragraph six: "This was her motivation now...to thresh meaning from experience, to separate what mattered from what was noise." Setup gate met (paragraph six, within the middle third). Development gate met: the motivation governs her unbending work—"each correction taught her something"—and reframes her job from duty to authorship. Payoff gate met: the final paragraph enacts the motivation ("she listened...Sure that the signal meant something. Unsure what it would mean once she was done"). The motivation is dramatized in at least two beats (the unbending phase, the final signal). Causal pressure: the desire to separate meaning from noise drives her careful, non-reckless editing and her acceptance of isolation. Closure linkage is direct: the final action is an attempt to thresh meaning. Specificity: the agricultural metaphor ("thresh") is character-particular and ties to her technical role. Cost connection: the motivation prolongs her isolation and depletes the pen. Friction between want and cost is present: she wants to author meaning but must accept the pen's depletion and her solitude. Minor limiter: the motivation is stated in paragraph six rather than enacted in a distinct on-page choice earlier; the opening paragraph seeds the idea ("not asking to be understood...asking to be rewritten") but the phrase itself arrives late. No swappability; the motivation is irreplaceable and integral. Strong integration with visible cost and direct closure linkage, though the late explicit statement prevents top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone "strange comfort" is stated explicitly in paragraph six: "Strange comfort settled into her days like sediment in still water." Setup gate met (paragraph six, middle third). The tone is enacted throughout: isolation that "no longer crushed her. It held her," the pen as both burden and gift, the final paragraph's quiet confidence ("she pressed the nib to the page and began"). Development gate met: the tone governs Maren's emotional arc from crisis (paragraph three: "That was when Maren understood what the Locus could do to causality") to acceptance (paragraph six onward). Payoff gate met: the final paragraph maintains the strange-comfort tone—she is alone, the pen is dying, yet she proceeds with calm agency. The tone modulates with pressure: early anxiety shifts to strange comfort, which then deepens into quiet authority at the ending. Coherence is strong; no jarring tonal breaks. The tone charges the final image by making her solitary, uncertain action feel both eerie and earned. Specificity: "strange comfort" captures the oxymoronic quality of her state and is character-particular. Cost connection: the tone reflects her acceptance of isolation and the pen's depletion. Two to three beats embody the tone (the pen discovery, the unbending phase, the final signal). Minor limiter: the phrase "strange comfort" itself is stated rather than purely enacted, and the tone is more a coloring than a constraint that forces a specific choice. No late arrival, strong coherence, high specificity, but the tone is slightly passive compared to more active elements. Solid integration that elevates the ending without being indispensable to plot logic.</comment>
