<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual gift is embodied consistently—she hears walls murmuring, presses palms to concrete, listens through ground—and her motivation to collect stories before walls forget is clear and specific. Internal contradiction appears when she continues despite knowing no one will hear: "not because anyone would hear them again, but because the walls deserved a witness" shows endurance with visible cost (futility accepted). The choice to preserve Elspeth's burned diaries after understanding the attempt at erasure demonstrates agency under pressure. Minor slip: the emotional register remains controlled throughout; we don't see Maren degrade or falter under the weight of her solitary mission, which would deepen the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers density through wall-stories, Elspeth's tapestry research, and the displaced-axis prophecy, culminating in Maren's decision to preserve despite futility—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where refusal to stop forecloses the easier path of stillness with felt cost ("her strange, persistent purpose"). Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening: Maren, silo library, post-dream world. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes Elspeth burned the diaries herself to stop the knowledge, yet "the end had come anyway"—this reweights Maren's preservation project from salvage to witness. Cost is conceptual and emotional: she walks toward "the next crumbling building" knowing the labor is terminal, which charges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silo's "grain-silo acoustics like water in a well" and curved concrete walls function as more than backdrop—Maren presses her palm to hear accumulated voices, the crumbling fractures leak stories, and the open top filters pale light for her work. The tapestry fragment catches light on the display case and "seemed almost to breathe," a micro-setting detail that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear: spiral staircase, third tier reading desk, archive shelf, exterior wall. The detail "bronze quiet" recurs to anchor tone and the world's new stillness, though it edges toward ornamental when repeated without fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve wall-stories before they dissipate. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens: Maren retrieves diaries six miles away, probes their contents with tweezers, discovers Elspeth's obsessive research and self-silencing attempt, then chooses to archive them despite understanding the futility. The tightening occurs when she realizes "Elspeth had burned the diaries herself…believing that knowing the mechanism would hasten the end. But the end had come anyway"—this narrows options (silence failed) and deepens her commitment to witness. The final walk "toward the next crumbling building" forecloses rest with on-page cost (endless labor in a dreamless world). One micro-turn: the discovery that fire "grown tired" failed to finish the job, personifying coincidence without using it to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—witness and preservation in a terminal world—emerges through concrete particulars: the silo's acoustics, Elspeth's tapestry prophecy of displaced axis, the act of pressing palms to walls. The dragons-as-door motif and "the capacity to dream our world into continuing" avoid overt thesis while linking dream-loss to existential tilt. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "the walls deserved a witness, and the displaced axis of a dreamless world still turned, however crookedly, for anyone willing to listen." Subtext operates in the fireplace detail—Elspeth's failed erasure implies knowledge cannot stop fate—and in Maren's solitary persistence as both futile and necessary. Minor slip: "bronze quiet" borders on thematic label when repeated; one more concrete instantiation would sharpen it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with tight perceptual signature: Maren notices "the faint murmuring of walls," uses tweezers, tracks voices through seismic waves. Diction stays character-particular—"sensitively perceptive in a way that made stillness unbearable," "bronze quiet," "hollow bone thrust into the earth." Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during tactile work with the diaries, wider when summarizing Elspeth's travels, then intimate again at the wall-listening closure. Filter verbs ("she could hear," "she realized") appear but feel voice-motivated given her aural focus. One minor slip: "The dreamless walked for a time, then sat, then stopped" uses symmetric phrasing that reads slightly algorithmic, though it fits the tonal stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats: short urgent clauses during the diary discovery ("Someone had tried to destroy them. Someone else—the fire itself, perhaps, grown tired—had failed"), longer accumulative sentences for Elspeth's research summary. High information density: most lines advance knowledge (tapestry details, axial tilt, dream-loss mechanism) or deepen Maren's sensory gift. Two texture issues lower the score: "bronze quiet" recurs three times without evolving its meaning, edging toward template; and the phrase "the bronze quiet of the silo" in paragraph four echoes "bronze quiet that settled over everything now" from paragraph two, a paraphrase loop that slightly dulls momentum. No grammar breaks; spatial choreography (staircase, tier, archive, exterior) tracks cleanly. Figurative language is controlled and voice-apt ("hollow bone," "voices leaked out"), avoiding muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—last historian collecting wall-stories in a post-dream world—synthesizes apocalypse, sensory gift, and archival mission in a specific, non-obvious way. The tapestry's "displaced axis" prophecy linking medieval weavers to dream-loss is fresh and earns its hindsight inevitability through Elspeth's research trail. Risk-taking: the piece commits fully to quiet, reflective accumulation without forced confrontation, and the final walk toward "the next crumbling building" resists tidy closure. Transformation test: swapping names or settings would gut the silo acoustics and wall-listening mechanics. Minor cap: the "bronze quiet" phrase and the general "dreamless world" framing edge toward abstraction in a few spots, and Elspeth's backstory, while integrated, follows a familiar obsessive-scholar template. Still, the synthesis of listening-as-preservation and axis-as-prophecy feels specific enough to avoid derivative flags.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren ("odd historian") is present throughout and her choices drive beats: retrieving the box, probing diaries, placing the tapestry on display, walking east to the next building. Her oddness—hearing walls, moving when others stopped—constrains her to endless labor (causal pressure). She appears in setup, middle discovery, and closure walk. The final walk is a decision that forecloses rest, earning closure participation. Swappability: "historian" could be "archivist" or "curator" with minor edits, and "odd" remains somewhat label-only, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment is introduced mid-story inside the diary's back cover, handled on-page ("placed…on the display case beside the window"), and its dragons "caught the light and seemed almost to breathe" at closure, reweighting the prophecy motif. Two beats: discovery and display. It drives Elspeth's research (causal link) and charges the final image by showing the prophecy's physical remnant. Late first appearance (second third) and the fact that the story could function with "any medieval artifact showing displaced axis" cap the score; the specific dragon imagery is evocative but not mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Displaced axis" frames the conceptual stakes: Elspeth's tapestry shows a tilted globe, and her final entry links axial shift to dream-loss. Maren's closing line—"the displaced axis of a dreamless world still turned, however crookedly"—reprises it with cost (the world continues but broken). Present in setup (Elspeth's notes), middle (prophecy explanation), and closure (final image). However, the axis itself does not constrain Maren's tactics on the page; it functions more as thematic echo than action-shaping force. Swappability: "cosmic imbalance" or "world's tilt" would serve similar thematic work, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's "sensitively perceptive" trait enables her to hear walls and track Elspeth's voice "through the ground like a slow seismic wave," driving the retrieval and preservation beats. It constrains her to motion ("made stillness unbearable"), a visible cost. Present in setup, middle listening, and closure walk. The trait is somewhat label-adjacent—"sensitively perceptive" reads generic—and the mechanics (hearing through walls/ground) do more causal work than the adjective itself. Minor swappability: "hypersensitive" or "acoustically gifted" could replace it, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Probe" appears explicitly: "Maren…began to probe its contents, turning pages with tweezers." The action structures the middle beat (examining diaries, discovering Elspeth's notes, realizing the burned attempt) and leads to the archival decision. It's signaled, executed on-page, and drives knowledge gain that shapes the closure stance. Two beats: physical probing and the epistemic discovery it enables. Swappability test: "examine" or "investigate" would serve with minor edits, though "probe" carries a specificity (depth, care) that fits tweezers and fragile pages. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "half-burned diaries found in a fireplace" are present in setup ("cardboard box retrieved from a farmhouse six miles east"), their burned state matters (Elspeth's erasure attempt), and they supply the tapestry fragment and prophecy text. Two beats: retrieval and reading. The method (fireplace survival) is causally significant—fire's failure to finish the job allows discovery—but "half-burned documents" is a common trope and could be replaced with "water-damaged attic papers" or similar with moderate edits. The specificity (fireplace, failed burning) ties to theme but isn't mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "reclaimed silo library" provides the acoustic resonance Maren depends on ("curved walls…pooling…stories…like water in a well"), the spiral staircase and reading desk for tactile work, and the crumbling concrete that leaks voices. It appears in setup, structures the middle discovery beat, and the exterior wall listening precedes the closure walk. The silo's unique acoustics constrain her method (she came here for the resonance) and the open top supplies light for tweezers work. Removal would break her listening mechanics. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last human dream was dreamt" establishes the post-apocalyptic frame and motivates the world's stillness (people stopped moving). It appears in setup and colors the closure line ("dreamless world still turned"). However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; Maren's timeline is open-ended. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than mechanically active. No middle escalation tied to time passing, and it could be replaced with "after the last star fell" or similar cosmic-end frame without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard before the walls themselves forgot" is stated early, dramatized through retrieval and archival actions, and tested at closure when she chooses to continue despite futility ("not because anyone would hear them again, but because the walls deserved a witness"). Present in setup, drives middle beats (diary probing, placement), and shapes the final walk. Friction: she explicitly knows no one will hear, creating internal conflict. The phrasing "collect the stories walls have heard" is slightly generic—"preserve acoustic echoes" would be more specific—and the motivation itself, while dramatized, follows a familiar last-keeper arc, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears three times, anchoring the post-dream stillness: opening ("bronze quiet that settled over everything"), middle ("bronze quiet of the silo"), and closure implication ("sky was the color of old metal and the wind carried no sound"). Tone modulates subtly—controlled and observational during research, weighted with futility at the end—and charges the final image (the silent walk east). Coherent through all turns. Minor cap: the exact phrase "bronze quiet" recurs without evolving its texture, edging toward template; one fresh instantiation would lift it higher. Still, the metallic-stillness tone is indispensable to the piece's affect.</comment>
