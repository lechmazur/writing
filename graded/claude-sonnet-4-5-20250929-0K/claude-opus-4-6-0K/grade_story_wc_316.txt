<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selu's emotional numbness is embodied through concrete action—she feels nothing looking at her own pre-death brain, cannot cry—and the custody battle forces micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The clone relationship creates genuine pressure through complementary brokenness, and the final recognition ("Mira needs both") emerges from the sparring encounter with visible cost: Selu must share custody and acknowledge interdependence. Internal contradiction appears when Selu experiences "the raw ache of wanting" breaking through her numbness, earned by recognizing her clone's terror. Minor slip: the "ego death" backstory leans slightly diagnostic, though it's dramatized through present inability to feel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately (floating dojo, Master Selu, canyon below) and the drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: the custody petition creates the inciting pressure, the sparring forces recognition, and joint custody with shared future represents a Decisive Change that forecloses Selu's solo isolation with visible cost (interdependence, vulnerability). The brain-in-jar and the combat testimony scene link because/therefore, and the closure reweights Selu's internal terrain from "dead" to "first green shoot." History-rewriting operates as atmospheric constraint without breaking causality. One meaningful tightening occurs when Selu catches her clone's wrist and the recognition cracks her numbness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo above a shifting canyon creates atmospheric pressure and the sparring ring's two stone pillars provide spatial anchors for the climactic encounter. The canyon's geology rewrites (sandstone to basalt to bone) mirror the instability of identity and history, filtered through Selu's perspective. The brain-in-jar becomes a concrete object handled on the page ("held up to the light"), and the final ocean vista charges the closure image with salt and change. Minor gap: the rope ladder and records chamber appear without prior spatial setup, creating brief disorientation in the middle section.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—custody of Mira—is signaled in the opening third and escalates through Selu-2's evidence (the brain scan) to the combat testimony. The sparring encounter tightens pressure by forcing both clones to confront their incompleteness, and Selu's proposal ("Mira needs both") represents agency that forecloses solo custody with visible cost: shared vulnerability and ongoing interdependence. The recognition that each clone is "drowning" or "destroying" themselves narrows options from winner-take-all to joint survival. One strong reversal when Selu releases her clone's wrist and shifts from opposition to alliance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the complementary-opposites structure: stillness versus storm, numbness versus overwhelming feeling, neither sufficient alone. The brain-in-jar recurs as a monument to lost wholeness, and the final ocean image ("salt and change") offers a non-literal answer to whether Selu can recover emotion—she lets herself "want tomorrow" without false cure. The "first green shoot through scorched earth" avoids platitude by grounding recovery in the specific ache of wanting rather than joy. No thematic echo; the judge's ruling and the clones' shared stance dramatize interdependence without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and Selu's perceptual signature favors precise observation without affect ("the words sliced through pretense like a blade through silk"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Selu-2's "You can't even cry" and Selu's whispered "You're drowning in it" carry subtext and advance the conflict. Diction remains controlled with occasional elevated constructions ("vivify," "reliquary") that fit the contemplative register. Minor slip: "wheezing" for Dax and the attorney's single function feel slightly stock, though he doesn't dilute focalization. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "Three years ago, a meditation gone catastrophically deep had dissolved her sense of self so completely that the woman who emerged could not feel joy, grief, or anger" compresses backstory efficiently. The opening and closing images (canyon/ocean) create structural symmetry. Minor artifacts: "the raw ache of wanting, the first green shoot through scorched earth" stacks two metaphors in quick succession without clear causal link between them, and "ike smoke through a keyhole—present but untouchable" feels slightly decorative. Occasional filter verbs ("she saw terror") when immediacy would serve better.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clone custody battle combined with ego-death survivor and shifting-history setting creates a fresh synthesis that avoids template plot. The complementary-opposites resolution (joint custody as mutual incompleteness) offers a non-obvious answer to the custody conflict, and the floating dojo plus rewriting canyon ground the speculative premise in specific, purposeful detail. The brain-in-jar as legal evidence transforms a familiar custody trope. Risk-taking in the history-rewriting element heightens stakes without obscuring character clarity, though the Temporal Judiciary and Replication Mandate elements remain lightly sketched. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends specifically on clone dynamics and cannot be reproduced with simple substitution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Selu (ego death survivor) drives the key turn when she proposes joint custody, altering tactics from combat-to-win to recognition of mutual need. Present from the opening and shapes the closure choice with visible cost (shared vulnerability).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The brain in a jar appears in two beats: exhibited as evidence and held up to the light by Selu, then present "between them like a strange reliquary" at the ending. It represents the cognitive snapshot before ego death and charges the final image as a monument to lost wholeness, but its role remains more symbolic than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is the core premise that frames the inciting incident, drives the sparring conflict, and resolves through joint custody. Selu-2's petition creates the stakes, the combat testimony structures the middle escalation, and the judge's ruling delivers the closure with visible cost (interdependence).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" appears in Selu-2's accusation ("You can't even cry") which cuts to the core conflict, and Selu's whispered recognition ("You're drowning in it") returns the trait. The attribute enables honest confrontation that breaks both clones' composure, constraining evasion and forcing the joint-custody insight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Vivify" anchors Selu's initial goal ("to vivify the dead terrain inside her chest") and recurs at the turning point ("it vivified something in her") when honest speech cracks her numbness. The action's specificity—bringing emotional deadness back to life—drives the thematic question and the final "raw ache of wanting" moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Complementary opposites structure the sparring ("Where Selu-2 attacked with passionate fury, Selu answered with stillness"), the mutual recognition ("You feel everything… you feel nothing"), and the resolution ("The stillness and the storm"). The method is signaled early, shapes combat tactics, and articulates the closure logic that joint custody is required.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo provides the arena for the custody hearing and sparring, and the canyon's rewriting geology mirrors identity instability. The rope ladder, training platform edge, and central platform with stone pillars ground spatial choreography. The setting enables the combat testimony tradition but doesn't constrain tactics as directly as a ticking-clock or hostile terrain would.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>History rewriting itself appears in the opening (canyon geology shifting) and closing (ocean replacing canyon) and during the sparring ("as they circled each other the canyon below shifted again"). The timeframe creates atmospheric instability and thematic resonance but doesn't impose a deadline or tighten decisions—characters act without reference to when the next rewrite will occur.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is Selu's stated goal in the opening, dramatized through her inability to feel looking at the brain, and tested when she recognizes her clone's terror and experiences "a hairline fracture in the numbness." The motivation drives her training at the dojo and the final "first honest thing" that cracks her shell, with cost visible in her acceptance of shared custody and vulnerability.</comment>
