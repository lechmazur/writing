<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's cartographic perception is character-specific and shapes her actions (mapping sensory data, redirecting the converging frequency through cataloged sensation). Internal contradiction appears when she must balance discovery versus protection—her need to find her father versus the imperative to prevent catastrophic overlap. The embodied emotion is strong ("frequency pressing in," "shard pulsed warm") and micro-choices carry visible weight. The final renunciation (accepting the coordinates instead of forcing immediate reunion) reads as earned, though the cost could land more sharply on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative Hybrid, holding at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. The closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara receives coordinates but must chart the route herself—options reconfigure, cost is felt (he remains unreachable now), and the before/after is legible. Escalation moves from passive observation to active redirection under pressure, motivated by the shard's resonance and her mapped inventory. One minor causality slip: the "second frequency" appears suddenly without prior setup, though the piece recovers by making its threat immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay supplies concrete spatial grounding (corroded hull panel, stripped shuttles on cradles, workbench thirty meters away). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's cartographic priorities (textures as topography, temperatures as color). The shard functions as micro-setting, constraining choice: she must redirect through a "dead world she'd charted once"—a mapped destination becomes tactical resource. The parallel-bay overlay charges the final image by making proximity impossible. Scale and professional detail (sensory cartography) remain purposeful without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover her father and the truth he withheld. Pressure tightens when the second universe threatens catastrophic overlap, forcing immediate tactical choice. Elara's agency (redirecting via her catalog of mapped sensations) drives the turn and narrows options—she sacrifices direct answers for structural safety. The cost is legible: she gains coordinates but not reunion, must "chart the route home" alone. One beat deepens knowledge (his warning, his coordinates); the resolution is earned by protagonist action with visible constraint (her cyclical ability ebbs, leaving her alone again).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-weight and the cost of weaving between realities emerges through the shard, the unfinished sentence, and the coordinates that reshape "every map she'd ever drawn." The green glass returns with reweighted meaning: first a clue, then a window, finally a conduit for redirection and a carrier of his location. Subtext operates in the father's mouthed warning and pressed palm—communication through barrier. The ending offers a non-literal answer (she has the route but must walk it herself) without moralizing. Some thematic statements ("what she really was") trend toward prompt echo, though integrated into her reflection rather than declared outright.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and apt; Elara's perceptual signature (mapping sensation as topography, reading lip-shapes with "cartographer's instincts") is distinct and consistent. Diction remains within her professional-technical register ("residual frequencies," "transit scholars," "junction point"). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears on the page. Brief compression under peak stress (converging frequency, redirection sequence) maintains voice coherence. One slip: "what she really was" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than perception, though it anchors in her interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short during the convergence crisis, longer during reflection). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language ("weaving between worlds," "reality layered like fabric") is coherent and voice-motivated. One minor scaffold: "The truth he'd withheld—why he'd left, what the shard really was, what she really was—waited there" reads slightly expository, listing the stakes rather than dramatizing them. Spatial choreography (thirty meters, pressed palms at boundary) remains clear. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sensory-cartographer premise is fresh and the shard-as-navigation-tool synthesis feels specific. Combining parallel universes with tactile mapping and cyclical ability adds texture. The father's palm-press communication and the redirection-through-mapped-memory turn are non-obvious. Some familiar beats: the unfinished sentence, the dead parent in a parallel fold, the withheld truth. Transformation is present but incremental—emotional core (longing, separation, deferred reunion) would work in other SFF frames. The piece commits fully to its premise and the closure (coordinates without reunion) resists the tidy middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as sensory cartographer shapes two key beats: initial mapping of the bay and the redirection action where she "poured every mapped sensation she'd ever recorded" into the shard to redirect the converging frequency. Her specific skills enable the climactic choice. Present in setup (paragraph one), middle (redirection), and closure (charting the route home). High causal pressure and irreplaceability; the story's logic hinges on her cataloged sensory inventory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard appears in setup (found seventeen years ago, description and properties), middle (lifting it to eye, feeling it pulse warm, using it to redirect), and closure (cooling against her chest, implicit in "chart the route home"). It enables the window into the parallel bay, translates her father's warmth into coordinates, and becomes the conduit for redirection. Handled across three distinct beats with evolving function. High irreplaceability and closure linkage; visible cost (cyclical spontaneity, danger of convergence) tied to its resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is signaled early (paragraph four) and shapes stakes: her cyclical spontaneity creates unpredictability, the shard allows controlled glimpses, and the convergence of parallel folds is the central threat. The concept drives the redirection tactic (feeding the glass a different destination) and the father's location across a fold. Present in setup, middle crisis, and closure image. Causal pressure is strong; the mechanics matter to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is named in paragraph four and demonstrated when "she felt the cycle cresting" and later "the cycle ebbed." It constrains her access (some weeks the shard shows nothing, other times she shifts involuntarily) and times the encounter. The trait enables the window but also imposes cost (loss of control, ebb leaving her alone). Present in setup and closure, with middle demonstration. Modest causal role; the label does more work than on-page embodiment of trade-offs beyond timing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The redirection action is the story's pivot: Elara grips the shard and channels her mapped sensations to bend the converging frequency toward a dead world, preventing catastrophic overlap. This decision protects both universes, costs her immediate answers, and enables the father's coordinate transfer. Present in climax and shaping closure (she "stood alone" afterward, must now chart the route). High causal necessity and closure linkage; swapping it would break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is the method signaled early (paragraph four) and enacted when the shard splits the bay open into a live parallel fold. The mechanics matter: her father exists in a different fold, the second converging universe is drawn by resonance, and redirection works by targeting an empty fold. Present across setup, middle crisis, and closure (coordinates point to "a specific fold in the weave"). Solid causal role but slightly generic within SFF; gains from specificity of execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is named in the title and first sentence, provides spatial grounding (hull panel, stripped shuttles, workbench), and becomes the junction point where parallel folds converge. The overlay (working version with lights, welding arcs, her father at the bench) charges the encounter. Present in setup and throughout. It supplies the coordinates and context but does not constrain her tactical choice as sharply as the shard or her mapped inventory; the setting is more stage than actor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears once near the end as description of where she'd previously searched for her father—contrasted with the "solid coordinates" she now has. It frames past futility but does not tighten present decisions or impose a clock. Mentioned in closure reflection only; no setup or middle development. The phrase is evocative but ornamental to the on-page stakes; removing it would not alter the logic or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to discover "the weight of a withheld truth" about why her father left, what the shard is, and what she is—is signaled early (paragraph three) and drives her presence in the bay. The desire creates friction: she risks convergence to see him, must redirect rather than cross over, and accepts coordinates instead of reunion. Present in setup, tested in middle (the warning, the choice to redirect), and reweighted at closure (truth "waited there, heavy enough to reshape every map"). Cost is visible; want and sacrifice are dramatized.</comment>
