<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—"grief could suddenly seize her throat" grounds emotion in physical sensation. The long reflective passages on the crystal's patterns and the library's history are anchored in present sensory cues (dawn light, the crystal in hand). Her motivations are clear: she studies the refractions as a way to preserve meaning in a world that has abandoned written language. However, the piece leans heavily on observation rather than choice under pressure; her final act is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path with cost, which limits the top range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early: Maren, library alcove, dawn, eleven years post-dictionary. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the piece accretes meaning through repeated imagery (crystal, light, silence) and deepens via cadence shift in the final paragraphs where the "suspended hush" becomes "the presence of listening." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren accepts the patterns' growth without needing external validation, foreclosing the impulse to testify or explain. Cost is felt but oblique—she remains isolated, the building unused—limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid and purposeful: sonically reflective surfaces that "returned her words in overlapping waves" constrain her testimony and shape her silence. The crystal acts as micro-setting, refracting light across spines and hands, and its changing patterns drive her daily practice. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's scholarly lens (fractured sequences, spectrum patterns). The setting charges the final image—warmth, fractured light, resonance—without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear: Maren seeks to decode growth patterns hidden in the crystal's refractions, a quest for meaning in a post-literate world. Pressure deepens through accumulation—seventeen notebooks, three years, the suspended hush—but the piece lacks a decisive tightening or choice that narrows options. The ending reconfigures her stance (acceptance of the pattern without resolution) with felt cost (continued isolation, no external validation), but agency is passive observation rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between preservation and obsolescence, the value of patient attention when the world demands digitization. The crystal's "growth rings" and the library's "testimony" avoid overt statement. The final image—"The patterns were growing, and she was growing with them, and that was enough"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One micro-slip: "weathered innocence" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward label-speak, though it's integrated enough to avoid major penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated but not precious, with a scholar's particularity ("pressing her thumb against the final spine as though sealing a tomb"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during crystal observation, wider during historical reflection. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Free indirect style is clean; the prose reflects Maren's careful, almost liturgical attention. One minor slip: "sonically reflective in ways that unnerved visitors" tells rather than shows the effect, but the later dramatization (testimony scene) earns it back.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; the piece breathes between long, meditative passages and tighter beats. Figurative language is dense but mostly earned: "dawn parse itself through the crystal's facets" works; "like something wounded" for light feels slightly ornamental but doesn't obscure. One paraphrase loop: "She had been asked to testify once" is immediately followed by "She took it as the building's own testimony," which recycles the concept without adding pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("had been printed," "had been," "no longer needed") slightly dulls immediacy. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—decoding growth patterns in a chandelier crystal amid language riots—offers a fresh angle on post-literate dystopia. The library's sonic reflectivity and Maren's testimony failure are specific, earned details. The crystal as both scientific puzzle and meditative focus avoids stock tropes. However, the emotional arc (isolated scholar finds solace in observation) follows a familiar path, and the ending's acceptance, while resonant, doesn't surprise. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits fully to its quiet register but doesn't upend expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's reticence shapes her silence in the library and her stammering testimony, but the story tracks observation more than decision. Her final acceptance is a stance crystallization rather than a choice that alters tactics. Present across all beats, causally linked to the ending, but her agency is passive—she does not act, she witnesses and accepts.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal appears in at least five distinct beats: initial handling, light refraction study, pressed to eye, on table during note-taking, final light-throwing. It enables her study (fractured sequences), constrains her method (seasonal/humidity variables), and charges the closure image ("crystal threw its fractured light across Maren's hands, her notebook"). Irreplaceable: the chandelier's fall during riots and the crystal's evolving patterns are the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" is signaled early ("held breath before silence"), returns in the testimony flashback (stammering into overlapping echoes), and deepens in the final paragraph ("suspended hush seemed to deepen into something almost sacred"). It shapes Maren's tactics (perfecting silence to avoid triggering echoes) and charges the ending. However, it functions more as atmosphere than a constraint that narrows options, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library's sonic reflectivity is introduced early, dramatized in the testimony scene where "every reflective surface in the room" returns her words "in overlapping waves," causing her to stammer. It constrains Maren's movement ("learned to move through the space without triggering its echoes") and justifies her silence. Cost is visible: her testimony fails, the commission dismisses her. Present in the closure's "presence of listening."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Testify" appears twice: the cultural commission scene (flashback) and the final paragraph's "waiting to testify about what had been lost." The testimony failure defines Maren's reticence and the building's agency, but the action itself is recounted rather than dramatized. It reweights her final silence (she does not need to speak), but since it's summary-only in the present timeline, it remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" is signaled early ("refractions grew more complex"), guides her method ("seventeen notebooks with her observations, working through fractured sequences of data"), and appears in the climax ("world fractured into seven versions"). The method shapes her attempts (interrupted by cloud cover, trembling hands) and the final image (light "fractured" across her hands). Specific mechanics matter: she cannot resolve them into "clean equations."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The library at dawn provides the eastern light blade that enables her study, the alcove where she sits, and the "shadowed" quality that contrasts with brief "astonishing warmth" at closure. The setting pressures choices: she moves silently to avoid echoes, the rubble yields the crystal, the shelves witness her work. The dawn timing is causal—seasonal angle changes drive the pattern shifts. Indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The eleven-year timeframe anchors the opening and establishes the post-dictionary world, but it does not tighten present decisions. Maren's three-year study of the crystal operates on a loose calendar (seasonal shifts, monthly pattern growth) without urgency. The timeframe contextualizes but does not constrain tactics—she could continue indefinitely. Present but replaceable; missing middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire to decode the pattern is dramatized through seventeen notebooks, three years of observation, trembling hands under grief, and the choice to continue despite interruptions. The final acceptance ("that was enough") represents a shift from decoding to witnessing, foreclosing the need for resolution. Friction between the want (to crack the code) and the cost (isolation, no validation) is present and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is signaled obliquely in "the weathered innocence of someone who still believed that careful attention was its own justification." The tone coheres through the piece—gentle persistence amid loss, no bitterness—and modulates in the ending where innocence deepens into acceptance. However, the phrase itself appears only once, late, and borders on label-speak. The tonal charge in the final image (resonance, sacred listening) earns the score.</comment>
