<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently embodied through her hands and body ("gnarled as old grape stock"), and her pragmatic calculus around the auditors feels earned. The deception-turned-truth arc shows internal complexity, though the final moment leans slightly into diagnostic clarity ("love had become indistinguishable from skill") rather than letting contradiction live fully in the scene. Micro-choices—polishing marbles, whispering to hedges, placing the marble at the center—advance her stance credibly under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through ritual, history, and sensory detail toward a Charged Poise closure where Elara places the marble and waits with "patience...longer than the Bureau had existed." Orientation anchors (garden maze, morning after Bureau report, Elara's ritual) arrive promptly. The tightening occurs when she shifts from past deception to present reframing ("she would mend the deception itself"), and the final image—hedges blooming and withering simultaneously, the maze rustling—reconfigures prior material with felt cost (her forty-one years, the auditors' return tomorrow). One meaningful deepening lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden maze is established early and constrains her choices throughout: the grafted rootstock, the geometry that "somehow shifted between surveys," the center where she places the marble. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven—"cracked marbles that caught the light and threw rainbows," "mossy path," "hedges that bloomed in frost"—and the final image charges closure when "the maze rustled, and she was certain it was not the wind." The body (gnarled hands, curved back) and the marbles function as micro-setting that pressures tactics and anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the auditors' anomalous readings threaten the maze's survival. Pressure tightens when Elara realizes "confession would destroy the maze" and "continued deception would eventually fail," forcing her to choose a third path. The escalation is driven by her agency—she will "mend the deception itself" and submit new papers claiming natural hybridization. The cost is visible: forty-one years of work hang on tomorrow's audit, and she waits with "the patience of someone who had been mending lies into truths for longer than the Bureau had existed." One meaningful tightening with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: grafted rootstock becoming genuine hybrids, lies mended into truths, love indistinguishable from skill. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "gardens know their gardeners" without stating a moral—the maze rustles autonomously, Elara is "withered herself, blooming still," and the marbles at the center invite measurement of what cannot be quantified. The simultaneity of blooming and withering in the final paragraph reweights all prior material. No thematic echo mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices through a gardener's lens (rootstock, grafts, blight, provenance papers). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("withered was the word the town used, and she did not argue"). The compression in backstory ("the maze had nearly died twice") serves closure by establishing stakes without stalling. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate at the marble-polishing ritual, pulling back to survey forty-one years, then tightening again at the final rustling. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "She had learned long ago that appearing diminished made people underestimate her, and underestimation was a kind of freedom" conveys character, tactic, and worldview). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the day's action and breathing at the closure ("waited for morning with the patience..."). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines ("The deception had begun simply enough. Decades ago, when the maze was young...") where "decades ago" slightly paraphrases "had begun," but the slip is brief and does not touch closure. One paraphrase loop in mid-section: "She told them what she planned" followed by exposition that restates; apply −0.2 once. No figurative muddle, no template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—luck becomes measurable, forcing a gardener to reframe deception as discovered truth—offers a fresh angle on familiar "secret garden" material. The synthesis of bureaucratic audit culture and horticultural love feels specific and non-obvious. The marbles as commemorative ritual and the "mending lies into truths" frame transform stock elements through Elara's lived detail and pragmatic calculus. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece stays within realist bounds and does not obscure clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact maze, this exact deception, this exact Bureau.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decisions—counting marbles, polishing, whispering new truths to hedges, planning to submit new papers, placing the marble at the center—create every key turn. Setup early (kneeling in the maze), development (choosing the third path), payoff (waiting at closure with visible cost). Her withered pragmatism drives escalation and the final charged poise moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marbles are handled in multiple beats: counting and lining them, polishing the blue one, placing it at the center for auditors. They return with reweighted meaning—from commemorating victories to becoming evidence ("Let them measure that"). Setup early, development through ritual, payoff at closure. Strong integration, though the marbles do not directly constrain a tactical choice mid-scene; their closure charge is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mended deception shapes stakes and tactics throughout: the grafted rootstock, forged papers, the plan to reframe it as natural hybridization. Setup early (past deception), development (decision to "mend the deception itself"), payoff (final image where lies have become truths and the maze rustles autonomously). The concept drives every turn and charges the closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is dramatized on the page: Elara assesses three options (confession, continued deception, or reframing) and chooses the third path with visible tradeoffs. The trait enables her middle-section action—planning to claim natural hybridization—and constrains her final stance (waiting rather than fleeing or fighting). Setup in opening ("withered...freedom"), development in the three-path calculus, payoff in patient waiting. One visible cost: forty-one years hang on tomorrow.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Polishing is signaled early as ritual ("Every small victory...she commemorated by polishing one marble"), shapes the middle beat (polishing the blue sphere), and charges the ending (placing the polished marble at the center where auditors will find it). The action cannot be swapped without losing the commemorative-to-evidence arc. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the final placement redefines the marble's function from private ritual to public challenge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method (elaborate commemoration via polishing and shrine-keeping) is established early, shapes the ritual beat, and frames the ending gesture. "She had an entire shelf at home arrayed with candles and dried flowers surrounding the collection" provides specificity. The method constrains her response—she commemorates by "making broken things luminous" rather than celebrating conventionally—and the final placement is a scaled-up version of the ritual. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden maze is indispensable: its grafted rootstock creates the deception, its geometry "somehow shifted between surveys," and its center is where Elara places the marble for auditors. The maze pressures every choice—survival depends on it, the auditors' readings are anomalous within it, and the final rustling ("she was certain it was not the wind") charges closure. Setup immediate, development continuous, payoff unmistakable. Removing the maze collapses all logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the Bureau's first quarterly report, auditors returning tomorrow) tightens tactics throughout: Elara has one day to prepare, and the ending anchors in "waited for morning." The measurability of luck creates the entire conflict and forces her to reframe the deception. Setup early ("morning after the Bureau...published"), development (planning within the one-day window), payoff (waiting for tomorrow's audit with visible cost). The clock is live and alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to prove "gardens know their gardeners" is dramatized through her choices: whispering to hedgerows, planning to claim natural hybridization, placing the marble as challenge. The desire is conflicted—she risks forty-one years on this proof—and the cost is felt in the final wait. Setup mid-story ("That was what she wanted to prove"), development (the day's actions), payoff (the maze rustles autonomously, validating her claim). Friction between want and cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blooming-withering tone is established early ("withered was the word the town used"), modulates through the piece (past decay and revival, present danger and hope), and charges the final image: "hedges bloomed and withered simultaneously...she stood among them, withered herself, blooming still." The tone is coherent through pressure, reflects Elara's state, and reweights the closure with undeniable resonance. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the simultaneity at the end makes the tone indispensable to meaning.</comment>
