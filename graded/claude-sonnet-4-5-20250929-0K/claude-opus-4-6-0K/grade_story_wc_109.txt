<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's interiority is embodied through precise physical anchors ("fingers curled around," "teeth, in the marrow of her wrists") and her obsession with silence is shown through concrete action rather than assertion. Her final choice to descend into starless darkness forecloses return to her shore with legible cost. Minor slip: the "mildly obsessed" framing feels slightly hedged against full commitment, though the cartographer analogy immediately grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the completed map and descent into starless night crystallize her life's work with undeniable cost—she walks into darkness carrying knowledge that won't guide but will structure understanding. The accumulative lens is taught early (collecting silences, transcribing hush) and held through the star-by-star extinctions to the final glyph. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: from observer of individual silences to cartographer of cosmic structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort's "ramparts cracked by storms," "horizontal rain," and wind-moaning gatehouse constrain the oracle's movements and charge the final stillness when "the wind had stopped." The booklet's physical fragility (flaking gold, brittle pages) becomes tactile pressure. The body itself functions as micro-setting: she feels cosmic withdrawal "in her teeth, in the marrow of her wrists." Small deduction: the valley described only as "ink" misses an opportunity for POV-filtered specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the silence map before stars vanish—is signaled in the opening and tightens through each star's dimming. Her agency is decisional: she ascends, witnesses, paints the final glyph, then walks into the darkness her map describes. The cost is unmistakable: "a shore she might never see again" and entry into a world fundamentally altered. One visible tightening: the last star's flicker forces completion under ultimate time pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as coastline, darkness with structure, the paradox of summarizing the unsummarizable. The final image offers a non-literal answer—the map won't guide but will reveal architecture within boundlessness—without stating a moral. The booklet's transformation from collection to complete artifact embodies the thematic question: can the unknowable be held through compression? No thematic echo or prompt language in the ending beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: she notices edges, thresholds, the withdrawal of "a cosmic hum she had never consciously heard until it began to fade." Diction remains controlled ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "asymptote") without register drift; the elevated vocabulary suits an oracle-scholar without breaking character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to cosmic scope. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously ("She felt it in her teeth, in the marrow of her wrists"). Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating at the star's flicker. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: "the silence after a bell ceases ringing but before the ear releases its memory" restates the gap-silence concept already established, though the specific example adds texture. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography applied to silence and cosmic night feels specific and non-obvious. The paradox of "summarizing silence" through compression transforms the map-making premise. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Small deduction: the "stars going out" frame echoes familiar science-fiction/fantasy territory, though the silence-mapping method transforms it into something particular to this character and world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's choices drive all key turns: ascending the fort (setup), opening the booklet and beginning to paint (middle development), finishing the glyph and descending into starless night (closure). Her decision to complete the map despite knowing it won't guide but only structure understanding demonstrates agency with visible cost—she enters darkness as "oracle of a shore she might never see again." Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The booklet appears in beat one (carried against her ribs), beat two (opened on the stone ledge with pages described), beat three (flakes drifting as she paints), and beat four (pressed against ribs as she descends). Its physical fragility creates pressure; its transformation from incomplete to complete artifact is the story's central action. The final image depends on it: she carries the completed map "into the silence it described." Indispensable to both structure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" and its variants ("marbled hush") shape her lifelong obsession and define what she collects. It operates as both method (the stillness she transcribes) and goal (the map of night's structure). The concept constrains her tactics: she must listen and compress rather than observe and record. Present in setup, development (settling over the chamber "like resin closing around an insect"), and payoff ("vaster and more tender than she had imagined"). Strong thematic and methodological integration, though its causal pressure on moment-to-moment choices is slightly softer than the booklet's.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is stated early and immediately demonstrated through the cartographer comparison and decades of work. It enables her life's task and constrains her to this solitary pursuit. The hedge-word "mildly" slightly undercuts the visible cost, though the surrounding context (seven years away from shore, ascending in storm) shows genuine sacrifice. Present in setup and shapes the overall arc, but doesn't create a distinct middle beat with new cost; the obsession is consistent rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Retell" operates as her life's method and the story's central action. She retells silences through gold-leaf compression, and the narrative traces one final act of retelling under ultimate pressure. The action is specified early, demonstrated in the cataloged examples (tidal pool, breath/cry gap, bell memory), and executed in the climactic painting of the final glyph. The story's major turn—completing the map—is this action performed under the constraint of the last star. Swapping "retell" for a generic "record" would lose the compression paradox central to theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method of "summarizing silence" is signaled early as "paradoxical" and shown through concrete mechanics: "condensed notation of hush," each page "a glyph." It shapes her decades of work and constrains the final attempt—she must compress "every silence she had ever cataloged" into one asymptotic shape. The method matters throughout: listening rather than looking, painting what she hears, creating structure through compression. Present in setup, middle development (the mechanics of glyphs), and payoff (painting the final summary). Strong functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "storm-tossed ridge fort" provides the high-altitude vantage needed to witness the last star and shapes the atmosphere of isolation and endurance. Wind pressure constrains her movements (tearing at cloak, whipping hair) until the final stillness arrives. The fort's abandonment and ancient weathering reinforce the scale of time. Present in setup and anchors the middle/ending beats. Moderate causal pressure: she needs height and isolation, though any remote peak might serve; the fort's specific features (gatehouse, parapet) enable but don't uniquely determine her actions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "when only one star remains" creates the story's ultimate pressure and deadline. Setup signals astronomers' prediction; development tracks three stars vanishing in her lifetime; the climactic beat arrives as "the last star flickered" and she races to complete the glyph. Time tightens tactics: she must finish before total darkness. The timeframe is indispensable—remove it and the urgency, scale, and closure image (descent into starless world) all collapse. Visible cost tied to this exact timing: she'll never see her shore again because the world has fundamentally changed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Her motivation "to draw a map of an endless night" is established early and shapes every action: the decades of silence-collecting, the ridge ascent, the final glyph. Friction between want and cost is legible: the map won't guide anyone through darkness, only reveal its structure—she completes it knowing this limitation. The desire is dramatized through embodied choices (climbing in storm, painting as the star dies) rather than told. Present across all three gates with clear escalation: from collecting scattered silences to synthesizing them under ultimate constraint.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" as tone descriptor appears explicitly and guides the atmospheric texture throughout: the "ambered hush she carried within her," the silence that's "not the absence of sound" but deeper withdrawal, the final "vaster and more tender" stillness. Tone modulates purposefully from active (wind-torn ascent) to contemplative (opening booklet) to charged stillness (completion and descent). The tone charges the final image: walking into the silence the map describes. Coherent and purposeful, though the tone supports rather than drives the causal structure.</comment>
