<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and vivid during memory recoveries ("proof that he had been loved across centuries"), and the weeping response feels embodied rather than labeled. However, the protagonist remains reactive throughout—decisions are driven by Sera's appearances rather than Elias's agency. The final "choice" to accept reunion is unearned; no internal contradiction or resistance shapes his arc, and the transformation from passive witness to beloved feels declared rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: greenhouse, Elias, alchemical setting established by line three. The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural lens—each cameo appearance unlocks another memory layer, building toward the final manifestation. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: the bead shatters, Sera becomes solid, they hold hands, and "something finally, beautifully complete" is asserted rather than enacted. The Resonant Reconfiguration reads as wish-fulfillment without visible forfeiture or constraint; no path is foreclosed, no price paid that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is specific and vivid: "silver apples and mercury pears," "channels of distilled moonlight," "nightshade hybrids." The greenhouse functions as micro-setting, housing each cameo and serving as "cathedral of recollection." The final ripening of all fruit at once charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and sensory detail is filtered through Elias's reverent attention. The setting constrains movement and amplifies the uncanny tone, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering scattered lifetimes—is signaled early and sustained. Each cameo appearance functions as a tightening beat, deepening memory access. However, escalation is passive: Elias waits, Sera appears, memories unlock. No trade-off or cost complicates the process; each recovery is additive gain without loss. The final reunion resolves through external mechanism (bead shatters, veil falls) rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid—contradiction or renunciation that would narrow options is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of devotion transmuted across lifetimes emerges through concrete particulars: the tincture's cost, the scattered souls, the bead's resonance. "There was never a debt, only a promise" reframes obligation as devotion without moralizing. The final image—solid hand, ripened fruit, exhaling stars—offers non-literal resonance. However, the piece edges toward sentimentality ("beautifully complete"), and the thematic question of cost is undercut by the costless reunion; no ambiguity or counter-reading lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; psychic distance contracts appropriately during memory floods. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "lovingly venomous," "mournful elation," "ashen veil." Sera's single line of dialogue ("You drank my tincture...") carries goal-driven exposition with subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices alchemical detail, translucence, resonance. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor register drift: "displacement" and "transmuted" feel slightly elevated for an aged gardener's interior texture, but not enough to break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "breath of impossible fruits," "devotion transmuted into something heavier than guilt and lighter than joy." However, overwriting clusters in high-emotion beats: "mournful elation," "trembling awareness," "beautifully complete" stack abstract modifiers without grounding particulars. Paraphrase loop between "proof that he had been loved" and "someone willing to become a ghost to find him" restates the same content. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "He remembered being... He remembered choosing... He remembered telling..." triggers −0.4. No major causality break, but density suffers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—soul scattered across lifetimes, lover follows as ghost—is a familiar reincarnation-romance template. Execution is competent: the alchemical greenhouse provides specific grounding, and the bead as memory-key adds tactile particularity. However, the emotional arc follows predictable beats: mysterious ghost → backstory reveal → incremental memory unlock → reunion. No transformation of the trope through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost; the "debt" is revealed as misunderstanding, and the reunion arrives without sacrifice. Within-band functional but not fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ghost bride appears in four beats (pomegranate columns, nightshade wall, alembic/channels mention, final manifestation), framing expectation early and shaping each memory unlock. Her dialogue ("You drank my tincture...") drives exposition and her touch triggers resonance. However, her agency is delivery mechanism rather than decision-maker; she enables Elias's arc without choices of her own that create turns. Present at closure when she becomes solid, but causally passive. Two-gate (setup, payoff); middle development is thin—her appearances repeat the same function without new complication.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Carved stone bead appears in five beats: dropped by ghost, clutched in dream, pressed by Sera to unlock memories, grows warm on longest night, shatters at closure. Early signal (end of first cameo) frames expectation +0.6. Beat involvement across three distinct scenes +0.9. Causal pressure: enables each memory flood, constrains Elias's understanding until fully activated +1.2. Closure linkage: shattering triggers final transformation and fruit ripening +1.4. Specificity: "cool and impossibly heavy," "hum against his palm," "perfect circle indented" give tactile irreplaceability +0.6. All three gates met; total ~6.7, but swappability concern—could be a locket, ring, or other token with minor edits—caps practical ceiling and applies −0.4, landing ~7.6 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings structure the entire arc: each cameo triggers deeper memory access, bead vibration becomes "chord," "resonant awakening that cracked open something sealed inside his chest." Present by paragraph four, shapes five distinct beats (first touch, nightshade scene, accumulative unlocks, longest-night cascade, final shattering). The concept constrains Elias's understanding—he cannot access memories until awakened—and drives escalation through accumulation. Closure participation is strong: "final resonant awakening cascade" and "resonance of something finally, beautifully complete" bookend the arc. All three gates met, causal pressure across beats +1.4, closure shaping +1.2. However, "resonance" as metaphor risks abstraction; specificity wobbles between tactile (bead vibration) and thematic label (emotional resonance). Swappability: "restoration" or "remembrance" could substitute the conceptual frame with edits, capping at mid-7s. Lands ~6.4 after adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lovingly venomous appears once in Sera's speech description ("her voice lovingly venomous, sweet as honey laced with belladonna") and once in the penultimate paragraph ("that lovingly venomous grace"). Label-only; does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait colors tone but remains ornamental—Sera's dialogue is expository rather than demonstrating the paradox through choice. No setup work in first third (arrives mid-story), no middle development, minimal closure participation (mentioned but not enacted). Swappable with "bittersweet" or "tender-cruel." Two touches in one contiguous thematic cluster count as single functional beat. Ornamental use −0.8, late arrival −0.4, label-only −0.3. Caps at 3.8 per swappability rule; deductions pull to ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ghost(ing) saturates the story: "ghost bride" title, "ephemeral cameo," "ghosting through the far wall," "ghosting through the margins," "did not disappear this time" contrast at closure. Early signal (paragraph two) +0.7. Beat involvement: four cameo appearances across distinct scenes +1.4. Causal pressure: ghost state enables the debt-repayment mechanism and memory unlocking; Elias's passivity is justified by her incorporeality +1.0. Closure linkage: becoming solid inverts the ghost state and completes the arc +1.3. However, swappability concern: "spirit," "phantom," "apparition" could replace with minor edits; the specific mechanics of "ghosting" (translucence, brief duration) are described but not uniquely constraining—a dream-messenger or time-slip could perform the same function. Caps at 3.8 per swappability; strong execution across beats raises to mid-5s, lands ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral cameo appearances are signaled early ("flicker," "lasted only seconds," "ephemeral cameo, a tremor of light") and structure the entire middle: four timed appearances, each brief and vanishing. The method constrains Elias—he cannot hold or question Sera, only receive what she delivers in each window. Beat involvement: four distinct cameos +1.4. Causal pressure: brevity heightens urgency and mystery, shapes his passive stance +1.1. Closure participation: final appearance breaks the pattern (she "did not disappear this time"), using the method's reversal to signal completion +1.0. Specificity: "ephemeral" as duration-limit is somewhat generic (could be "fleeting visits" or "momentary visions"), but the incremental unlocking tied to each brief touch adds mechanical weight +0.5. All three gates met. Lands ~6.7 after swappability nudge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse is established in the opening sentence, anchoring who/where/when immediately +0.7. The setting supplies specific resources: "silver apples and mercury pears," "channels of distilled moonlight," "nightshade hybrids," "pomegranate columns," "alembic station," "irrigation channels." Each cameo appearance is staged in a distinct greenhouse zone, providing spatial choreography. Causal pressure: the greenhouse's alchemical properties parallel the memory-alchemy theme and supply the final payoff (all fruit ripens at once) +1.3. Closure linkage: "flooding the greenhouse with the scent of lifetimes" charges the final image, making the space a witness and participant +1.5. Irreplaceability: removing the alchemical greenhouse weakens the thematic coherence and strips the closure image of resonance +0.7. Beat involvement: appears in six distinct moments +1.4. All three gates met; strong across all signals. Lands ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Winter-cracked fields and "longest night of winter" frame temporal context early and return at closure ("endless night that suddenly felt like dawn," "stars that had watched this reunion unfold across four hundred years"). The hush and winter setting color tone but do not tighten on-page decisions—Elias's actions (walking rows, picking up bead, weeping) are not time-pressured. The four-hundred-year span is told rather than felt; the present scene's duration is vague. Setup present +0.5, closure reprise +0.4, but no middle development—time does not narrow options or alter tactics. Swappable with any seasonal/nocturnal frame. Functional yet replaceable; caps at ~4.9 per missing middle gate, deductions for lack of tactical constraint pull to ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repaying a debt across lifetimes is Sera's stated motive ("she would repay the stolen years") and appears in Elias's memory-dream and Sera's dialogue ("I owe you every scattered piece"). Early signal in dream sequence (paragraph six) +0.6. The debt drives Sera's cameo pattern and shapes Elias's understanding of the relationship. Middle development: each unlocked life is framed as installment on the debt. Closure participation: "The debt is paid" / "There was never a debt, only a promise" reweights the motivation, turning obligation into devotion +1.2. However, the friction between wants and costs is minimal—Sera's ghost state is endured off-page, and Elias receives only gains (memories, reunion). The motivation is told and dramatized in exposition but not tested through on-page choice that forces trade-off. All three gates met, but lack of visible cost in present action limits score. Lands ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mournful elation is introduced explicitly ("mournful elation of lives recovered") and sustained throughout: "He wept often, but they were not unhappy tears. Each recovered life was a gift and a wound simultaneously." The paradox is embodied in "lovingly venomous," "ashen veil turned...to gold," and the closing "endless night that suddenly felt like dawn." Tone modulates with pressure: early mystery (flicker, sorrow), middle accumulation (weeping, recognition), final transformation (warm hand, exhaling stars). The bittersweet duality charges the final image—completion is elegiac, not triumphant. Setup present by first third +0.6, beat involvement across emotional peaks +1.1, closure linkage strong (tone resolves the central paradox without flattening it) +1.4. Coherent modulation without static mood. Lands ~7.3.</comment>
