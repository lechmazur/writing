<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—her ruined throat vibrating where words used to live, her hands shaping vocabulary the hearing world only half understands. The emotional logic of her work (translating silence into music) drives her choices throughout, from striking the A440 to the final sentence-building sequence. Internal contradiction shows when she seeks to "leave a mark" despite being engineered out of the conservatory glass, and the ending choice (building the sentence) costs her the safety of continued silence. Minor: the backstory (Ondine capsizing) feels expository rather than lived-in through present sensory anchors, though it does explain the damaged larynx.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (winterglass conservatory, post-Severance world, Maren at work). The piece accumulates density through the tuning-fork vocabulary work, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to action) when Maren walks to the central node and strikes the full sequence—"I am here, I survived, and this is what it sounds like to begin again." Cost is felt: she broadcasts herself into a world that swallowed discord, risking exposure. The final beat ("the glass carried it anyway") reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. One friction: the middle third circles the notebook/spectrogram work without a meaningful tightening until the walk to the central node.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is not postcard decoration—it amplifies sound through engineered angles, constrains Maren's method (the central node is the convergence point), and charges the closure when the glass "carries" her imperfect smile. Sensory detail is purposeful: frozen glass repelling condensation, the A440 multiplying into a shimmering column, the sternum ache. The tuning forks are micro-setting objects that matter across beats. Body and tool constrain the final choice: she must kneel at the node and strike the forks in sequence, and the gesture (kneeling, one-by-one striking) charges the final image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to translate silence into music in a world that swallowed discord. The work is painstaking—sequences that "felt like questions but read as accusations"—and the middle section shows her rectifying errors by fractions of a hertz. The walk to the central node is a meaningful tightening: she moves from testing at the table to broadcasting at the convergence point, forecloses safety, and commits to being heard. Cost is legible: "Somewhere, a stranger stopped walking and pressed a hand to their chest." One friction: the middle accumulation (notebook, spectrograms, frequency mapping) risks repetitive looping without a sharper turn before the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "unshaken marvels" becomes the music inside breakable things, not the glass itself. The piece resists moralizing—grief pools in low registers, loneliness is middle C sustained—and the final image answers the thematic question through action rather than statement. The imperfect smile that the glass "carried anyway" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: discord may have been severed, but human imperfection survives in gesture and intention. Subtext operates in the vibration "where words used to live" and the stranger's unnamed warmth. No thematic echo; the Isen notebook line ("unshaken marvels") seeds early and reweights at closure without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Maren's sensory and professional idiom: "heat-mapping emotions," "spectrograms," "isolated frequencies with mathematical precision." Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (the sternum ache, the ruined throat vibrating). Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—acoustic researcher, emotional signatures, frequency profiles—and the prose rhythm modulates: longer analytical sentences in the middle, shorter declarative beats at closure. One friction: "Somewhere, a stranger stopped walking" briefly slips toward omniscient assertion rather than Maren's hope or inference, though the effect is minor and does not obscure her stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do double work (world-building and character motive, image and pressure). Sentence openings vary, rhythm accelerates cleanly into the final sequence. One paraphrase loop: "after the Severance stripped away discord, only the pure emotional tones remained accessible" echoes "chaotic sound simply stopped propagating... pure tones... still traveled" without adding pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph three ("had been," "had belonged," "had vanished") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. The final image ("the glass carried it anyway") is concise and charged. No template cadence, no scaffold bloat at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—noise dies but pure tones survive—is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that constrains the protagonist's method and stakes. The tuning-fork vocabulary and frequency-mapped emotions feel particular to Maren's training and voice. The transformation of "unshaken marvels" from assumed (the glass) to revealed (the music inside it) is earned in hindsight. Risk: the piece commits fully to a high-concept world rule and follows its implications without retreat, trusting the reader to grasp Severance mechanics through implication. The imperfect smile that the glass carries anyway is a fresh inflection on survival-after-silence material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (capsize survivor) is present throughout, on-page and in interiority. The capsizing is signaled early (paragraph two), her damaged larynx drives her need for a non-vocal language, and the survival framing charges the closure sentence: "I am here, I survived, and this is what it sounds like to begin again." The cold that "took her voice" constrains every beat—she cannot speak, so she must build a tuning-fork vocabulary. Her final choice (broadcasting the sentence) is a decision with visible cost: exposure in a muted city. Three gates met; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tuning fork case is opened early (paragraph four), forks are struck at the table (A440, F-A-C triad), and Maren carries "the full set" to the central node for the final sentence. Three beats: opening, testing, broadcasting. The case itself (mahogany, brass, violet velvet) is described but not causally active after the opening; the forks do the work. Swappability is low—the forks' precise frequencies matter—but the case as container could be generic. Closure linkage: the forks build the final sentence, so participation is strong. Cost connection: she risks being heard.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is quoted from Dr. Isen's notebook (paragraph six), initially misread as the glass, then revealed as "the music inside it" at paragraph seven. The concept shapes Maren's stake (finding what survives the Severance) and the final image reweights it: the imperfect smile that the glass carries anyway. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is implicit (her rectification work assumes this concept). Causal pressure is moderate—it frames her quest more than it narrows tactics. Closure linkage is strong, as the final line demonstrates the concept in action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is named in paragraph two ("her hands moved with a vocabulary") and demonstrated when she strikes the tuning forks instead of speaking. The trait constrains every beat—she cannot use voice, so she must use pure tones—and the ending's sentence-building is the trait in action. Cost: she must rely on a fragile, incomplete vocabulary. Setup early, beat involvement across the piece, closure participation strong. Swappability is low; her aphonia is structural. One friction: the trait is more constraint than enabling trade-off, so visible cost in a choice moment is less sharp than in, e.g., a decision to refuse speech.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rectify" is named explicitly in paragraph five ("trying to rectify those errors now") and demonstrated through her adjustment work (testing intervals by fractions of a hertz, sequences that felt like questions but read as accusations). The action drives the middle beats and sets up the final broadcast: she has refined the vocabulary enough to attempt the sentence. Closure linkage: the final sequence is the rectified product. Causal pressure: the mistakes and their correction matter to whether the sentence will be understood. Swappability is low—"refine" or "perfect" would lose the moral weight of error and repair. Cost: painstaking labor and risk of failure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Heat-mapping emotions" is named in paragraph five as Maren's pre-Severance technique and explained (every feeling had a frequency profile). The method shapes her post-Severance project: mapping emotions to surviving frequencies. Setup and development gates met; it matters to her approach. Closure participation is indirect—the final sentence uses the mapped vocabulary, but the method itself is not dramatized at the end. Causal pressure is moderate; the method enables her work but does not narrow a key choice. Swappability: "frequency mapping" or "emotional profiling" would serve nearly as well.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is introduced in the opening line, its acoustic properties (panes cut at precise angles, cascade like water through crystal) are explained, and it amplifies the A440 strike into a "shimmering column of sound." The central node (paragraph eight) is the spatial convergence point where every panel meets, and Maren must walk there to broadcast the sentence. The conservatory's ability to carry sound "through walls, through frost, through the muted city" is the mechanism of the ending. Three beats: opening anchor, table testing, central node broadcast. Causal pressure: the setting is the technology that makes her project possible. Irreplaceable: no other setting would supply this amplification. Cost: she must kneel at the exact node, exposing herself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" is signaled in paragraph one ("after the Great Silence fell") and explained in paragraph three (the Severance, when chaotic sound stopped propagating). The timeframe shapes every beat: Maren lives in a world where discord is swallowed, so she must use pure tones. The constraint tightens her method and charges the closure—her sentence is possible only because the Severance left harmonic pathways open. Setup and development gates met; closure participation strong (the stranger's response and the carried smile are legible only in this timeframe). Causal pressure: the Severance is the structural problem she solves. No live clock within the scene, so time does not narrow tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation ("to translate silence into music") is stated in paragraph five and dramatized across the piece: Maren opens the case, strikes forks, tests sequences, refines errors, and builds the final sentence. The desire is conflicted—she wants to "express now required more than hands" but risks exposure in a world that has gone quiet. The notebook work shows the painstaking labor; the final walk to the central node is the high-stakes commitment. Three gates met; causal pressure high (her want drives every beat); closure linkage strong (the sentence is the translation made audible). Cost: she broadcasts herself and forecloses safety.</comment>
