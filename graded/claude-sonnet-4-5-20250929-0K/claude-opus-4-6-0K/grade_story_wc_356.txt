<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete and embodied through her extraordinary nose, which both enables and burdens her pursuit of serenity within sensation. The grandmother's legacy creates character-particular history, and the final choice to breathe in both rot and orchids demonstrates earned internal shift through accumulated pressure. Interiority remains specific throughout ("a faint sulfurous whisper like a promise of future challenge"), though the closing epiphany approaches but does not quite cross into over-articulation. The renunciation of separation between beauty and decay feels earned by the three-month accumulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira's refusal to retreat from overwhelm, choosing to hold both rot and sweetness simultaneously, forecloses the path of avoidance with felt cost—she must endure the screaming nerves. The accumulative lens is taught early through journaling beats and held through the bloom; escalation reads as density increase (planting → growing → blooming) that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the flower blooms and forces the test, narrowing options to flee or endure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The treetop village constrains through verticality ("rope ladder at dawn," "platforms suspended so high that clouds sometimes drifted beneath them") and the corpse flower's stench functions as micro-setting that forces the climactic choice. Sensory detail is filtered through Lira's extraordinary nose throughout, from "forty varieties of mint" to the sulfurous seed signature. The clay pot and platform placement anchor the planting ritual spatially. The "wildflower hush" atmosphere charges the final moment when death-scent disrupts it, though some descriptors lean slightly decorative ("orchids grew from the living rails").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion, not withdrawal—is signaled early and tested once meaningfully when the corpse flower blooms. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal: planting → growth → bloom forces the single pressure point where Lira must choose flight or endurance. Agency appears in the final moment's refusal to separate beauty from decay, with the cost legible in "every nerve in her nose screamed." One distinct tightening is sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens, though a secondary complication during the three-month growth might have deepened pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the corpse flower teaches what lavender cannot, wisdom runs deeper than comfort, the undercurrent is refusal to separate beauty from decay. The brown paper with doodled flowers becomes a resonant vessel for the family custom of hidden wisdom. The final image offers non-literal answer—standing amid death and orchids in simultaneous serenity and motion—without stating a moral. The grandmother's wrapped gift reweights prior material at closure when Lira understands "what her grandmother had wrapped inside that paper covered in tiny laughing suns." Slight risk of thematic echo in "the undercurrent of wisdom was not the absence of overwhelm" but it remains dramatized through the bloom scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature filtered through Lira's herbalist expertise and extraordinary nose. Diction stays character-appropriate ("sulfurous whisper," "a wildflower hush") with purposeful compression in phrases like "the turning of the tide's thought." The brief dialogue with Maren feels natural and advances understanding without exposition dump. Minor pattern noted in "she was serene, and she was moving, and she understood" where the tricolon at closure tilts toward overt articulation, though the image work preceding it earns the moment. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("hummingbirds stitched the air with invisible thread") and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in the opening exposition establishing character, gift, and village. Some decorative layering appears in the brown-paper custom exposition, which recurs three times with near-identical phrasing across paragraphs ("doodled the day's observations on the interior surface," "journalizing...by doodling them," "a family custom"). The phrase "the turning of the tide's thought" reads as elevated register that slightly strains the POV's established lexicon. No major loops or scaffolding, but the custom's mechanics receive more explanation than the causal line demands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The corpse-flower-as-teacher premise offers a fresh angle on the herbalist-seeks-wisdom template, and the treetop village provides specific grounding. The brown-paper doodling custom is particular and memorable, though it functions more as texture than causal driver. The synthesis of extraordinary olfactory sense with the undercurrent-of-wisdom concept feels purposeful. Risk-taking remains moderate: the structure is traditional (arrival, planting, bloom, realization) and the emotional arc follows a familiar learning curve. The ending's simultaneity of rot and orchids transforms the premise without retreating to safety, though the path there is relatively straight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira appears throughout and her choice to plant the seed initiates the sequence, but the middle months are summarized. Her final decision to breathe in rather than retreat creates the closure turn with visible cost (screaming nerves). Two functional beats: planting and enduring the bloom. Early signal strong; middle development compressed; closure participation decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The seed is unwrapped and examined in the opening, planted at the turning hour, and its bloom creates the climactic pressure. Three distinct beats with escalating stakes. The seed's "faint sulfurous whisper" becomes the wave of stench that forces the test. Causal pressure is clear: no seed, no bloom, no test. Closure directly shaped by its opening. Specificity high—corpse flower properties matter (rot, delayed bloom, overwhelming scent).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept is named explicitly by Maren and Lira's quest centers on it, but it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint during the middle. The bloom scene dramatizes the concept—serenity within motion, not stillness—by forcing Lira to hold both sensations. Shapes the ending's realization but does not alter middle tactics. Present in setup and payoff; middle development implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's extraordinary nose enables her to detect the seed's dormant signature and creates the climactic cost when the bloom's stench attacks her heightened sensitivity. The trait is established early with concrete examples (forty mint varieties, rain three hours ahead, wound infection) and directly pressures the final choice—her gift makes the test harder. Two beats: detection and endurance. Cost visible in "every nerve in her nose screamed."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Journaling is mentioned three times across the middle section but does not create turns or constrain choices. Lira journals observations daily, but we never see a journal entry change her approach or reveal new understanding that alters tactics. Present and consistent with character, but largely swappable with "she studied the plant" without structural loss. Setup and middle presence solid; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The custom appears in the opening (grandmother's doodled flowers on the seed's wrapping), recurs in the middle (Lira continues the tradition on daily specimens), and returns in the final line (Lira understands what was wrapped inside). Three touches, but the custom does not constrain choices—it's a narrative detail that carries thematic resonance without tactical pressure. The final callback reweights the gift's meaning lyrically. Setup strong, middle texture, closure reprise meaningful but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Canopy Fell is established early with specific verticality (rope ladder, platforms, clouds beneath), and the treetop isolation supports the three-month growth period without lowland interruption. The platform location matters for planting ritual, and the orchid-filled environment creates contrast with the corpse flower's stench at closure. Two beats: arrival/planting and bloom. Setting enables the choice architecture (isolated enough for focus, sensory-rich enough for contrast) but does not actively constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The phrase appears once at the planting moment—"that liminal hour when the sky could not decide between day and night"—as atmospheric detail. It does not track across the story, create time pressure, or recur at closure. Functional as a ritual anchor for the planting beat but swappable with "dusk" or "twilight" with no structural loss. Setup only; no middle or closure work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to cultivate serenity within motion" is stated early and tested directly at closure when she must choose to breathe in or retreat from the overwhelming stench. The three-month wait dramatizes motion without stillness. The grandmother's teaching ("the corpse flower teaches what lavender cannot") adds friction—comfort versus challenge. Two beats with cost: accepting the seed and enduring the bloom. Motivation drives the sequence and is fulfilled with visible struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "wildflower hush" tone is established early and maintained through quiet, lyric description until the bloom disrupts it with death-stench, creating purposeful tonal break that charges the ending. Modulates once meaningfully under pressure. The closing line restores complexity—"the whole village smelled like death and orchids and rain"—integrating disruption into the hush. Coherent through turns; closure image synthesizes rather than resets. Static in middle section but purposeful at frame.</comment>
