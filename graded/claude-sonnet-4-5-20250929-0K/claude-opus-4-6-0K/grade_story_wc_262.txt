<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is embodied through psychometric sensation ("vibration, a low hum beneath her sternum") and her choices are motivated by the pull toward Estelle's stored love. The character progresses from eavesdropper to witness to participant, forecloses her search with a tangible act (adding her own letter), and the final descent registers emotional cost. Minor deduction: the trait "spatially imaginative" is asserted but not tested under pressure—it describes her mental mapping without constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Maren, projection booth, three nights) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through nested frames (booth, letters, film strip, Estelle's loneliness) until the projector screening crystallizes meaning. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—Maren's final letter and descent reweight "unused love" from loss to preservation with felt cost (she inherits the silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when she threads the film and watches every frame, narrowing her understanding and enabling the resonant final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: reels, canister, projector mechanics, and the carbon arc lamp heat are woven through Maren's actions and Estelle's remembered sensory world. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (film threading, silver halide chemistry). The booth's dual valence—"nest, womb, a place to incubate feelings"—charges the closure when Maren descends into the theater, the glowing screen a spatial residue of what she released. Specific, purpose-driven detail throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to find where unused love is stored") is signaled in paragraph four and drives all subsequent moves. One tightening: discovering the UNSENT canister and threading the film narrows options from search to witness to declaration. The final act—adding her letter and descending—costs Maren her observer status and binds her to Estelle's archive. Agency is decision and attention that forecloses detachment. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in "I found it. It is safe."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: love unexpressed "migrates...lodges in walls...hands of strangers who know how to listen." The final letter offers a non-literal answer without moralizing—safety is acknowledgment, not rescue. Estelle's goodbye letters reframe silence as declaration; Maren's psychometry becomes thematic method (listening to what objects remember). The glowing screen at the end—"a ghost of light that refused to fully disappear"—resonates as both literal residue and thematic afterimage. No thematic echo; no sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maren; perceptual signature is consistent ("eavesdropping on the dead," spatial imagination, vibration as reading). Diction remains within her idiom: technical (silver halide, leader strips) paired with lyric precision ("cathedral for images," "nest, a womb"). One micro slip: "forgotten lyrics searched for their tune" in the final beat edges toward authorial poetics rather than Maren's focalization, though it reads intentional as summative image. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: "She was a crystal gazer by trade, though she hated the carnival sound of it" anchors voice, profession, and stance in one line. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no paraphrase loops. Minor deduction: "a low hum beneath her sternum, hushed thunder rolling through a body of bone and breath"—the second clause restates sensation without advancing it, and "hushed thunder" leans toward prompt-label fulfillment. Figurative language is controlled elsewhere; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: psychometry + projection booth + goodbye letters to no one = love as archival medium. The specific angle—splicing longing into leader strips, photographing letters as film frames—feels inevitable in hindsight and irreplaceable. Transformation of the "lost love letter" trope through material specificity (silver halide crystals, sprocket holes) and Maren's witness role. Risk-taking in lyric compression and nested metaphor (geography of loneliness, house of rooms) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No stock arc; the final image reweights prior material with earned cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as crystal gazer/psychometrist frames the narrative and enables key beats: holding the letters, identifying the UNSENT canister, threading the film, and adding her own letter. Her decision to project the film and her final descent after watching "every frame" create two distinct turns. Present in setup, development, and closure. Moderate deduction: her choices follow the pull rather than conflicting options; no visible tradeoff between competing goods limits upper band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The film strip appears in three functional beats: Maren holds it to the bulb and reads frame by frame; she threads it into the projector (mechanical action that releases the archive); the projection fills the theater and leaves a glowing residue that she descends past. Early signal (top shelf canister), causal pressure (enables the revelation), and closure linkage (the screen's ghost light). Specific properties (leader strips, silver halide, sprocket holes) matter. Minor cap: the strip is more conduit than constraint—it does not narrow her options so much as fulfill them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Goodbye letters drive the inciting incident (thrift-shop find), the booth pilgrimage, and the dominant stake. The letters shape tactics: Maren searches for them, reads them psychometrically, discovers they are photographed as film, and responds by adding her own. The concept reweights at closure—they are "not farewells to a person" but "farewells to the silence." Present across setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable as the story's conceptual spine. Cost is legible: Maren inherits the silence and seals the archive with her witness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is asserted ("She could hold a building's blueprint...walk its halls without moving") and applied once when Maren maps the film strip's "geography" as rooms of loneliness. The trait does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it describes her method without friction. Present in middle development but ornamental; easily swappable with "empathetic" or "perceptive." No setup signal, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Incubate" is both metaphor and action: the booth as "nest, womb, a place to incubate feelings too fragile for open air" and Estelle's splicing practice that stored love in chemistry. Maren's threading and projection release what was incubated. Present in middle (conceptual frame) and shaping closure (the glowing screen as hatched residue). The verb is specific and thematically charged, but the on-page action (projecting) could be described without "incubate" with minor edits. Strong thematic integration; moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is established early ("held objects and listened to what they remembered"), demonstrated in the booth ("vibration...beneath her sternum," Estelle's hands and ache), and enables the discovery of the UNSENT canister. The method matters: without it, Maren cannot access Estelle's loneliness or know to thread the film. Present in setup, development, and payoff. Moderate deduction: the reading itself is quick; most narrative weight falls on the projection rather than the psychometric process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The projection booth pressures every beat: narrow staircase in darkness, twin projectors, reels on hooks, workbench tools, the bare bulb Maren uses to read film, the carbon arc lamp heat Estelle endured, and the small window through which light punches to the screen below. The booth's spatial logic (top shelf, threading mechanics, booth-to-theater sightline) enables and constrains Maren's actions. Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and closure (she descends from it). Specific, irreplaceable; the story's architecture depends on this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics search for tune" appears once in the climactic projection beat: "forgotten lyrics searched for their tune in the projector's rhythmic clatter, a melody of sprocket holes and shutter blades that had waited decades." The phrase is lyric and charged but does not constrain timing or alter tactics. No setup signal; present only at closure as atmospheric reprise. Timeframe itself (three nights, decades of waiting) is tracked but not pressurized—Maren's clock is loose. Lyric resonance without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is introduced early via Estelle's phrase, dramatized through Maren's three-night pilgrimage and booth search, tested when she finds the UNSENT canister, and answered in the projection and final letter. Maren's desire shapes every choice on the page. Friction is present: the search costs her three nights and binds her to the archive as witness-keeper. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost. Upper band reached; no conflicting want (e.g., fear of inheriting silence) for highest tier.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is introduced early ("vibration, a low hum beneath her sternum, hushed thunder rolling") and reprised in the projector beat ("silence that follows thunder"). Tone is coherent: reverent, subdued, and charged throughout. Modulates purposefully from searching quiet (first paragraphs) to release (projection clatter) to aftermath stillness (glowing screen). The final image—ghost light refusing to disappear—charges the tone with undeniable pressure. Strong thematic and atmospheric integration; one micro slip (phrase feels slightly prompt-fed in first use).</comment>
