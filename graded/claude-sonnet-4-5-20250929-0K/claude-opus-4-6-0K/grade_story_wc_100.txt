<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's weary undertaker identity is embodied through "thirty-one years" and "that companion of three decades," and his inadvertent stubborn trait drives the charter decision. The final beat—"rest was not something he gave. It was something he received"—is earned by the entire descent arc and lands with visible emotional cost (weariness settling "between his ribs"). Internal contradiction appears in the simultaneous impulse to discard the lens yet charter the dive, and the protagonist's micro-choices (sitting among tablets, closing eyes) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: "inadvertently stubborn" is told once rather than shown recurrently under pressure, costing ~0.3.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers subsonic hum, impossible architecture, and warm stillness into a pattern that culminates in the final closure—"true stillness, unchased at last"—which delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: weariness settles rather than vanishes). Cost is legible in the on-page image of weariness finding "its own permanent address" and the protagonist closing his eyes in receipt rather than giving. Orientation anchors (Elias, preparation room, Tuesday package) appear within the first ~50 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when placing the lens shifts the rotunda from distress to silence. The closure effect reweights all prior subsonic calls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: "columns and arched doorways occupying impossible spaces between the rock formations," "rooms existing inside volumes too small to contain them," and the warm, still water all constrain choices (diving depth, navigation, the act of placing the lens). The body under pressure is tracked (helmet palms, breathing, sitting on the floor) and the broken lens charges the final light-pattern image. Micro-setting (the pedestal, glowing tablets) drives the climactic turn. The environment's impossible geometry is not mere decoration—it shapes Elias's comprehension of "final rest" for a non-Euclidean city. Sensory hierarchy matches POV (undertaker notices "the particular weight of things that had traveled too far").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring rest to the drowned city's dead—is signaled early via Elias's undertaker profession and the subsonic hum. One meaningful tightening occurs when placing the lens aligns cracks with channels, forcing the atmospheric shift and ceasing the distress signal. Agency is present: Elias chooses to dive, to place the lens, to sit and receive rather than give. The escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens is a density increase (subsonic hum → impossible geometry → warm rotunda → aligned cracks → true stillness). Cost is visible in the final image: weariness no longer burdens but "held him gently to the ground," foreclosing his role as sole giver. Minor deduction (~0.4) because the dive itself encounters no secondary complication or live friction; pressure accumulates smoothly without a mid-descent reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—rest as receiving rather than giving—emerges organically from the undertaker's vocation, the subsonic call, and the final closure beat without meta-statement. The lens, broken but functional, operates as motif: first a distress signal, then a restored focus, finally "Just light, doing what light does when it finally has a place to land." That transformation reweights the entire arc. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what does the geography of final rest demand?" through the on-page shift from giving to receiving. Subtext operates in "chased stillness" and "actual quiet...unchased at last." No thematic echo or sermonic ending. Conceptual cost is legible: Elias's identity as sole giver is reconfigured with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance tightens at key beats (the subsonic hum "he felt in his molars," "peace that existed only because something vast and restless had chosen, temporarily, not to disturb it"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices weight, subsonic frequencies, and "the geography of final rest" through his undertaker lens. Diction stays in register ("embalming tools," "preparation room," "viewing room," "graveside"). The prose rhythm modulates purposefully—long, winding sentences for the descent and impossible architecture, shorter beats for the lens placement and final stillness. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats, no POV leakage. Minor deduction (~0.2) for one slightly elevated phrase ("atmospherically, as though the pressure of centuries had exhaled") that edges academic but remains voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (nearly every line advances character, setting, or pressure). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "rest" motif with cost. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence runs, no filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is controlled: "the ocean went on being the ocean" and "light, doing what light does" both serve closure. Minor deduction (~0.5) for two near-adjacent phrasings: "chased stillness" appears twice in close proximity ("Peace that existed only because..." and "True stillness, unchased at last"), and the weariness metaphor ("companion of three decades" / "no longer a burden but a weight") edges toward synonym churn without quite crossing the line. These do not obscure causality but slightly reduce propulsion in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker + underwater library + lighthouse lens + subsonic distress signal is specific and non-obvious; the premise does not closely match stock templates. The final turn—rest as something received rather than given—feels earned in hindsight and transforms the trope of "weary professional finds peace." Emotional truth (weariness settling rather than vanishing) avoids generic resolution. However, the piece does not take bold structural risks; it follows a classic descent-discovery-restoration arc with high craft but within familiar narrative geometry. The impossible architecture and bioluminescent script add textural freshness without fundamentally redefining the frame. Solid originality in execution, not paradigm-breaking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias appears in setup (package arrival, decision not to throw lens away), development (chartering dive, descending, navigating ruins), and closure (placing lens, sitting, closing eyes, receiving rest). His choices create key turns: chartering the boat despite intent to discard, placing the lens into the housing, and the final shift from giver to receiver. The weary undertaker trait constrains the dive (he understands "the geography of final rest") and enables the closure (his profession primes him to recognize the city's need). Visible cost: weariness finds "its own permanent address," foreclosing his prior role. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the character is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The broken Fresnel lens is handled in three beats: arrival in the package (subsonic hum, cracked concentric rings), empty housing at the pedestal (recognition of the match), and placement that aligns cracks with channels to cease the distress signal and refract bioluminescence. Its unique properties—subsonic frequency, broken yet functional—matter causally: the hum calls Elias, the cracks align with pedestal channels, and the final light patterns charge the closure image. The lens could not be swapped for a generic artifact without breaking the lighthouse/library/distress-signal logic. Strong early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Minor deduction (~0.4) because the lens itself does not constrain Elias's dive choices; it is primarily a goal object rather than a tool that alters tactics mid-descent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distress signals shape the entire arc: the subsonic hum (setup) drives Elias's decision to charter the dive, the library's state (middle) reveals the need for restoration, and the cessation of the signal (closure) delivers the shift to "true stillness, unchased at last." The concept changes options on the page: Elias understands the lens "had been sending distress signals...calling for someone to bring it home." The signals are not merely thematic but mechanical—subsonic frequency traveled "through stone and water and bone." Cost: Elias's weary role as giver is reconfigured when the signal stops. Strong causal pressure and closure participation. Minor deduction (~0.6) because the distress-signal mechanics (why subsonic, why through a lens, why now after presumed centuries) are asserted rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is named once in the setup ("the kind of person who, once a question lodged in his mind, could not dislodge it without an answer") and enables the charter decision: "He had meant to throw the lens away. Instead he found himself chartering a dive boat." This trait constrains his initial impulse (discard) and drives the key turn (descent). However, it does not recur or shape tactics during the dive itself; once underwater, Elias acts on professional understanding rather than stubbornness. The trait is functional in one beat but does not layer or create visible tradeoff at closure. Present by end of first third, enables one turn, but not indispensable—remove it and the charter could be motivated by professional duty alone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Revitalize" drives the climactic turn: placing the lens into its housing causes the library to "revitalize around him: stone dust cleared from the water, the warm current strengthened into a gentle circulation, and the tablets' glow steadied from flickering uncertainty into constant, readable light." This action redefines options (distress signal ceases, true stillness replaces chased stillness) and is irreplaceable—no other verb or act could achieve the same closure effect. The action is set up (empty housing signals need), dramatized (cracks align with channels, atmospheric shift), and charges the final image (light refracted, weariness settled). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. Minor deduction (~0.6) because the revitalization itself is mostly environmental description; Elias's agency is placing the lens, and the revitalization is the consequence rather than his sustained action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is signaled at the descent ("columns and arched doorways occupying impossible spaces between the rock formations...the city had threaded itself through the geology...rooms existing inside volumes too small to contain them") and matters thematically: the architecture "defied compression...defied logic." However, the impossible geometry does not constrain Elias's choices or alter his tactics—he navigates the ruins without friction, finds the library at the city's heart, and places the lens without the geometry complicating the act. The method enriches atmosphere and supports the theme of rest requiring non-Euclidean space, but it is not mechanically tested. Present in middle development, charged at closure (final image of light in impossible rotunda), but not indispensable to plot causality. Could be replaced with "ancient" or "alien" architecture without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city library pressures every choice: the dive depth ("four hundred feet, where no recreational diver should exist"), the warm stillness that signals intentional preservation, the pedestal with empty housing that reveals the lens's home, and the glowing tablets that flare when the lens is placed. The library supplies the key resource (the housing) and its transformation (revitalization) delivers the closure effect. Micro-setting elements (pedestal, rotunda, tablets) constrain Elias's final act and charge the ending image. Strong early signal (coordinates etched on lens), beat involvement (discovery, placement, sitting among tablets), and closure linkage. The library is irreplaceable—no other setting type could achieve the "geography of final rest" logic. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" establishes the story window (package Tuesday → charter → descent → placement → closure within hours or a single day). However, time does not tighten decisions: Elias faces no deadline, the dive proceeds without time pressure, and the placement is not constrained by air supply or tidal clock. The timeframe is present and coherent but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes. The phrase "after thirty-one years as the town's sole undertaker" matters more for character than for live clock. Functional setup, no middle constraint, no closure participation. Present but replaceable with "during the dive" or "one afternoon" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to give rest a permanent address" is dramatized early ("He had spent his life trying to give rest a permanent address, laying bodies into earth with the quiet conviction that stillness, once granted, should never be revoked") and drives the lens-placement choice. It faces friction at closure: the drowned city's dead "deserved no less," yet the final beat reconfigures the motivation—"rest was not something he gave. It was something he received." This shift forecloses Elias's prior identity as sole giver with visible cost (weariness settling). The desire is conflicted (professional duty versus personal weariness) and tested on the page. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt trade-off. Indispensable to the story's thematic and emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" is established at the rotunda ("Peace that existed only because something vast and restless had chosen, temporarily, not to disturb it. Chased stillness—that was what it felt like") and modulates through the dive (dark pressure, impossible geometry) to the closure beat ("True stillness, unchased at last, having finally stopped running"). The tone coherently charges the final image: from subsonic hum and atmospheric tension to the cessation of signal and "actual quiet." The tone is not a single static mood but a purposeful arc from pursued to achieved rest. Strong closure linkage and thematic resonance. Minor deduction (~0.5) because the tone phrase appears twice in close proximity without sufficient rhythmic variation, edging toward repetition rather than purposeful reprise.</comment>
