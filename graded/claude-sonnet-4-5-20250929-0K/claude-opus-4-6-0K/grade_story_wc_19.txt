<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior landscape is carefully drawn through embodied claustrophobia and her collection of silences, with micro-choices (breathing in measured sips, counting seconds) that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The porcelain doll functions as both anchor object and relational ghost, worn smooth by her thumb in a gesture that carries intimacy without sentimentality. The final choice to claim her own silence and descend is earned by the inversion experience, though the epiphany moment ("the silence of a woman no longer afraid") flirts with label-speak. Contradiction operates subtly: she seeks silences yet fears enclosure, and the resolution threads that needle cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren's claim of her own silence and her decision to descend carrying all flavors of quiet forecloses the path of perpetual collection with visible cost—she must now return to a world of bunkers that will never bury her again. The accumulative lens is taught early through the collection motif and held through the gravity inversion, which serves as the single meaningful deepening that reweights her relationship to open space. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One friction: the mother's vanishing backstory does necessary work priming the silence-collection motive but occupies roughly 15% of the text without altering a present micro-choice until the doll moment at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The trellis as micro-setting constrains choice through the gravity inversion and provides the gilded silence that becomes the story's experiential fulcrum. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: "gilded hush, luminous and heavy at once" reflects Maren's specific attention to silence textures, and the physical details (vines gripping lattice, coat billowing) anchor the inversion beat. The porcelain doll's shift in her pocket during inversion is a tactile particular that charges the moment. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and suspension, and the final descent image carries geographic consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's need to collect and understand silences as a way to process her mother's abandonment and her own terror—is signaled early and drives the climb. The gravity inversion provides one meaningful deepening: it forces her to experience openness without the ability to flee, and her choice to "let it sprout" rather than panic narrows options by accepting vulnerability. The cost is legible in the final image: she adds a new silence to her collection and commits to descending, foreclosing perpetual escape. Minor gap: the inversion is a situational pressure (coincidence complicates) rather than a choice-driven turn, which slightly softens agency at the peak beat under a predominantly accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the collection of silences as embodied particulars: bunker silence is "dense, metallic, pressing inward," field silence "thin and restless," the trellis silence "gilded...intangibly tangible." The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: Maren claims "the silence of a woman no longer afraid of open doors" and descends toward a world that "would never again bury her"—the juxtaposition reweights her father's bunkers and her mother's descent without resolving into binaries. The porcelain doll's worn face catching gold light is non-literal yet charged. One slip: "the silence of a woman no longer afraid" borders on thematic echo, though it's saved by immediate conversion to image (the descent) rather than dwelling in abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with tight perceptual signature: Maren's noticing is filtered through texture and containment (ceilings she could press palms against, silence with "a particular flavor"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the inversion ("coat billowing downward—or was it upward now?") and pulling back for the final reclamation. Diction stays within her lexicon—"intangibly tangible," "stretching each contracted moment like taffy"—without register drift. The prose reflects her mind under pressure through compressed clauses during the inversion and longer, reflective rhythms in the descent. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic accumulation without padding. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the inversion ("Then gravity inverted") and breathing in the reflective beats. One paraphrase moment: "She carried a tiny porcelain doll" followed immediately by descriptor feels slightly scaffolded, though it serves setup. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("vines that bore no fruit, only hospitality"; "sky offered itself like an open hand") reads purposeful for establishing the xenial trellis logic. No loops or template cadence in peak beats; the final paragraph propels cleanly through image rather than summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobia, silence collection, and gravity inversion offers a non-obvious angle on inherited trauma and spatial anxiety. The specific textures of silence (metallic, gilded, sprouting) and the daughter-of-bunker-builder frame avoid generic "fear of enclosed spaces" treatment. The gravity inversion as the crucible for confronting openness is both fresh and earned by prior setup. Proximity check passes: no close echoes of famous lines. One limiter: the "porcelain doll as mother's ghost" and "collecting experiences to understand a parent" are familiar narrative furniture, elevated here by execution and sensory specificity but not fully transformed into something structurally unrecognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (bunker builder's claustrophobic child) is present from the opening, drives the climb and collection motive, makes the key choice to "let it sprout" during inversion (mid-beat agency), and claims her own silence at closure. Three gates met with causal pressure and closure linkage. Her specific trait (claustrophobia as opposite of her father's gift for containment) narrows options and enables the stakes. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, rounded to 7.8 after dominant-limiter smoothing for the backstory occupying ~15% without mid-scene micro-choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The porcelain doll appears in three beats: carried in pocket with worn face (setup/backstory), shifts during inversion (physical presence under pressure), held to light at closure with whisper that generates the new silence. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle beat is physical presence rather than choice constraint. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (mother's absence, thumb-worn smile) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, rounded to 6.4 after recognizing the closure whisper as a charged reprise that reweights prior use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "gilded hush" is introduced early as the trellis silence, becomes the experiential center during inversion ("gilded hush deepened into something she had no name for"), and drives Maren's choice to stay and breathe rather than flee. It shapes stakes (collection of silences) and tactics (limiting exposure, counting seconds). Three gates met with high causal pressure and closure participation. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity (intangibly tangible, luminous and heavy, sprouting) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, rounded to 8.7 after minor swappability concern (could another sensory texture serve similarly? Marginally, but "gilded" ties to upper atmosphere light and xenial hospitality in ways that charge the exact closure image).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is defined on the page ("pressed without weight, touched without texture") and governs Maren's perceptual experience of the gilded silence, which in turn enables her choice to stay and let the sprouting silence fill her. Two gates (setup at trellis arrival, payoff in inversion experience); middle development is perceptual rather than a distinct tactical choice but the attribute constrains her breathing/counting method. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (enables the "let it sprout" choice by making openness non-threatening), closure linkage +0.9 (the new silence she claims is textured by this quality), specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, rounded to 7.2 for the attribute's irreplaceability in making the inversion psychologically navigable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sprout" operates as verb and image: the silence "sprouted...grew like a vine from the stillness itself, branching and leafing," and Maren's decisive micro-choice is "She let it sprout." This action redefines her relationship to openness (no longer building walls against it) and is irreplaceable—"let it grow" or "let it expand" would not carry the vine/trellis thematic linkage or the organic patience the moment requires. Three gates met. Early setup (vines/trellis in opening) +0.6, two beats (inversion, final claim) +0.9, causal pressure +1.3 (the choice to allow rather than resist is the pivot), closure linkage +1.4 (her new silence is one that sprouted), specificity/irreplaceability +0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By limiting exposure" is signaled early ("small sips, not gulps"), mechanically demonstrated in the counting-seconds tactic, governs her ability to stay on the trellis, and is implicit in her choice to descend rather than remain indefinitely. Three gates met with strong causal pressure. Early signal +0.7, three beats (arrival breathing, inversion endurance, descent decision) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4 (the method enables all her on-page agency), closure linkage +1.0 (descent is a limit she sets), specificity +0.6 (the sips/gulps phrasing and ten-second increments are concrete). Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is introduced in the opening paragraph, provides the gilded silence Maren seeks, and supplies the gravity-inversion constraint that forces the climactic choice. The latticed platforms, vines, and suspension in mist are not postcard description but functional: she clutches the railing, the vines grip during inversion, and the descent at closure is causally earned by her prior climb. Three gates met with strong closure linkage. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3 (the setting enables the inversion and the collection), closure linkage +1.5 (descent reconfigures her relationship to the trellis and to bunkers), specificity +0.7 ("xenial," "woven from living wood," no-fruit vines). Base 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7, rounded to 8.3 after noting the trellis's passivity during the key inversion beat (it survives rather than acts).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is announced early ("once each month above the clouds"), governs the peak beat's duration and Maren's inability to flee, and implicitly times her choice to "let it sprout" rather than panic. The hour is not tracked second-by-second but its presence as a known limit shapes her endurance. Two gates clearly met (setup, middle pressure); payoff is implicit in her survival and descent. Early signal +0.6, two beats (inversion, return to platform) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1 (the duration forces sustained exposure), cost connection +0.4 (she must endure the full hour). Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, lifted to 7.6 for the hour serving as the story's dominant temporal constraint and shaping the escalation window under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to collect silences is dramatized early (field, cathedral, bunker silences), drives the climb to the trellis, and creates the friction at closure when Maren adds her own silence and must choose whether to continue collecting or descend. Her desire conflicts with the cost of perpetual avoidance (never returning to the world of bunkers). Three gates met with high friction and closure charge. Early signal +0.8, three beats (backstory examples, trellis arrival, closure claim) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4 (the collection motive initiates the plot and the final choice pivots on it), closure linkage +1.7 (her new silence reconfigures the collection's purpose), cost connection +0.6 (she foregoes further collection to descend). Base 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, rounded to 8.4 after noting the backstory占 ~12% and the mother's silence is told rather than directly dramatized on this page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone as "stretching contracted" is embodied in syntax and pacing: Maren stretches each moment "like taffy pulled between careful hands," and the prose alternates between compressed clauses under pressure ("Then gravity inverted") and elongated, accumulative description ("a silence that sprouted, that grew like a vine...branching and leafing and reaching"). The tone modulates coherently—tightening during the inversion, expanding in the final descent—and charges the closure image of carrying gathered quiet downward. The pattern is taught early and held. Early signal +0.7, coherent modulation across turns +1.2, closure charge +1.3 (the final paragraph's rhythm enacts the stretched descent), specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, lifted to 7.7 for the tone's irreplaceability in making the accumulative lens legible and the final image resonant.</comment>
