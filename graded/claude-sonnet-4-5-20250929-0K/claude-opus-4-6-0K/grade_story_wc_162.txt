<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—her grain-reading inheritance and the way she traces the table provide character-particular gestures. The motivation to understand her father's distance is legible, and the final realization ("I was watching. The sky was clear. I could see you.") lands as earned by the accumulation of weather codes. Minor deduction: her emotional progression from discovery to understanding feels slightly accelerated; the featherly determination is named but not fully tested by a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (prism terrace, Maren, post-funeral) arrive early and remain stable. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the weather codes accrue until the final CAVOK entry reweights the father's silence as watchfulness. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the logbook transforms from clinical records into a language of care—with conceptual cost (the irretrievable missed chances). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the codes map her life milestones. Minor slip: the butterfly-effect argument at sixteen is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the causal link to the present distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid and purposeful, filtering light into spectra that mirror the fractured distance between father and daughter. The oak table's grain provides a micro-setting anchor that constrains her method of understanding and charges the final palm-press moment. Spatial choreography (terrace, table, logbook) remains clear. Does not quite reach 8+ because the terrace itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions more as atmospheric container than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the father's silence and the architecture of their distance) is signaled early and tightens through the logbook discoveries. The CAVOK entry provides a meaningful deepening that reweights prior material and narrows her grief into comprehension. Agency is attention and renunciation—she will trace rather than rage—with the cost visible in the irreversible loss of reconciliation. Enters high-7s but not 8+ because the escalation is accumulative rather than a narrowing choice that forecloses an on-page path; the cost is felt but not enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (the architecture of necessary distance, how separation can be both maze and sky) emerges organically from the logbook codes, grain-reading, and maze design without overt statement. The final image—"I was watching. The sky was clear. I could see you."—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why thresholds feel sacred, reweighting the father's absence as a form of vigilant presence. The butterfly effect and the fractured prism accumulate into a coherent whole. No sermonizing; the insight is earned through the specifics of weather notation and wood grain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; Maren's perceptual signature (grain-reading, the featherly determination metaphor) is character-specific. Diction remains controlled and purposeful throughout, with rhythm modulating appropriately ("The terrace drifted" as a refrain). Minor deduction: "featherly determined" and "fractured hush" feel slightly over-wrought in register for a grieving daughter's interiority at the peak moment, edging toward elevated diction that doesn't fully belong to her lexicon under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. The opening ("The terrace drifted") and closing cadence create purposeful framing. Figurative language (river/tributary, grain-reading, spectrum) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor artifact: "the necessary distances" and "featherly determined" both appear as explanatory inserts rather than emerging from scene pressure, creating slight register drift in two high-stakes beats. No loops or scaffold, but the elevated metaphor density in the final third approaches ornamental without quite crossing the line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn-maze design, pilot weather codes, and wood-grain reading as parallel languages of care is specific and non-obvious. The emotional truth (a parent's helpless observation from necessary distance) feels earned rather than template-driven. The prism terrace and CAVOK code provide fresh inflections. Minor deduction: the butterfly-effect framing and the sacred-threshold question trend toward familiar writing-prompt territory; the story transforms them through execution but does not fully escape the derivative premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren drives the narrative by opening the logbook, tracing the grain, and reaching the final realization. Her choices (to trace rather than rage, to press her palm to the table) alter her emotional stance at closure. Present in setup, development (grain-reading), and payoff (final palm-press and realization). Caps at mid-6s because her agency is primarily interpretive attention rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears early, is handled across multiple beats (opening it, reading entries for her birthdays, discovering CAVOK), and decisively shapes the closure by revealing the father's watchfulness. The weather codes accumulate pressure and reweight the father's silence. Specific mechanics (METAR abbreviations, CAVOK) matter and are irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage with felt cost (the irretrievable conversation).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" shapes the dominant stake and is present throughout (the lost-child framing, the divergence metaphor, the terrace itself as distance compressed). It constrains her tactics (tracing rather than raging) and charges the final image (the architecture of distance as the most carefully designed thing). Present in setup, development, and payoff. Does not reach 8+ because the concept is thematic accumulation rather than a mechanics-driven constraint that alters on-page options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" is named once and characterizes her resolve to trace rather than rage. It signals her stance but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Present in development as a trait declaration but does not shape beats or closure mechanics beyond mood. Label-only mention without tradeoff or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears in setup (grain-reading as inheritance) and payoff (she intuits his message at closure). The method of reading grain enables her final understanding and is irreplaceable—remove intuition and the closure loses its mechanism. Present in two distinct beats with causal pressure. Does not reach 8+ because the middle beats (reading the logbook) rely more on literal decoding than intuitive leaps.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Grain analysis is introduced early as her inheritance and returns at closure when she presses her palm to the oak table to intuit the father's message. The method is specific (reading age, season, density) and shapes the final beat. Present in setup and payoff with a charged reprise. Caps at mid-6s because it does not constrain middle choices; the logbook decoding does most of the narrative work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered and present throughout, providing atmospheric pressure and mirroring the fractured distance. It anchors the scene spatially and tonally. Does not reach 7+ because it does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as symbolic setting rather than active pressure. Strong lyric resonance but ornamental in causal terms.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames the backstory (the argument at sixteen) and the present (post-funeral). The timeframe is mentioned but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics on the page. The logbook's dated entries provide temporal structure, but the butterfly-effect label itself is ornamental. Present in setup as context but does not participate in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why thresholds feel sacred is stated early and drives her interpretive attention throughout. It shapes her decision to trace rather than rage and is fulfilled at closure when she understands the doorway as "distances compressed into a frame." Present in setup, development (threshold reflection), and payoff. Does not reach 7+ because the motivation is primarily intellectual curiosity without on-page friction or competing cost that tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is established early ("Light split and reformed. Silence came in pieces") and modulates with pressure, charging the final quiet realization. Tone is coherent across beats and supports the accumulative lens without becoming static. The prism-terrace setting reinforces the fractured quality throughout. Present in setup, development, and payoff with rhythmic control that elevates the closure image.</comment>
