<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's internal contradiction is well-embodied: the craving for certainty that "never stayed" drives his archival method while his past chasing applause haunts him through concrete sensory anchors (speaker cloth weave, frequencies in the chest). His final choice—writing the appraisal "for the record, so the silence would know"—is earned by the prior pattern of insulating with facts, then letting them fall away for "one uninsulated moment." Minor deduction: the epiphany ("it was never the sound itself...") edges toward articulation that feels slightly over-processed for a man just discovering it, though the specificity of "thread in the weave" salvages particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through the ending. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Marcus reweights his archival work from fact-insulation to making "the silence...know what it was holding," forecloses the need for public recognition, and the final image ("quarry walls waited like cupped hands") charges the shift with felt cost—he offers voice to the void rather than an audience. The tin-box discovery at ~60% provides the meaningful tightening; the photograph + scrap alignment narrows his stance from defensive precision to custodial purpose. Cost is conceptual and emotional, legible in the move from "needed it the way a burned man needs cool water" to actively writing for the record. Minor gap: the Harrisburg failure is told rather than shown, slightly weakening the before/after contrast, though the "collective exhale of dismissal" supplies enough embodied shame to anchor the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quarry as "echo valley of blasted rock" and the trailer as "aluminum box perched above" constrain Marcus's retreat and charge the closure: silence reflects nothing back until he offers it voice. The speaker cloth is handled twice (pressed between thumb/forefinger, aligned with photograph) and its weave operates as micro-setting, anchoring sensory memory ("vibrating against his chest") and enabling the final recognition. Minor slip: "gravel crunch" and Rita's entrance are clean choreography but add little pressure; the slab/pavilion origin of the tin box supplies thematic resonance (concert space → silence) without altering tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering purpose after loss. The tin-box arrival provides the single meaningful tightening: matching cloth to photograph narrows his stance from defensive fact-gathering to custodial witness. The final act—writing the appraisal "not for a buyer, but for the record"—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of seeking external validation with visible emotional cost (he no longer needs the applause he chased for decades). The price is felt in the shift from "confidently uncertain, always reaching for the solid thing that dissolved on contact" to deliberately offering voice to the silence. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length; no second reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the speaker cloth's shift from "negligible" to "bridge between a stage that once thundered and a silence" enacts the piece's inquiry into custodial invisibility versus recognition. The ending image—"quarry walls waited like cupped hands, ready to return whatever voice he finally offered them"—answers the central question (what replaces applause?) without stating a moral: Marcus becomes "the thread in the weave," essential infrastructure rather than celebrated performer. The Harrisburg failure and Claire's loss stack as "geological strata" without forced symmetry, and the final insight ("not to be remembered but to be the thread") grows organically from matching scrap to photograph rather than arriving as epiphany-by-fiat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance tightens at the closure moment ("let the facts fall away") with clear purpose. Perceptual signature is distinct: Marcus filters the world through weave, thread count, frequencies, a roadie's backstage geometry. The figurative language ("loss had stacked like geological strata," "confidently uncertain") is character-specific and voice-motivated. Rita's single line of dialogue is goal-driven and naturalistic. Minor deduction: "the version of himself that moved through the world without needing a reason" drifts slightly abstract for a man whose memories are otherwise anchored in physical sensation (amplifiers, cables, chest vibration), though it does not disrupt the overall texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple work (the scrap both object and memory-trigger, the binder both tool and "wall between himself and the ache"). Rhythm modulates well under pressure: the long meditative opening accelerates at the tin-box arrival, then slows for the alignment beat. Minor artifacts lower the score: "Loss had stacked like geological strata until he couldn't see over it, only through it" mixes metaphors (strata you see through versus a wall you see over). "Confidently uncertain" appears three times, twice as phrase and once as concept, edging toward mantra without full pattern-teaching. The phrase "the solid thing that dissolved on contact" in paragraph four is elegant but borders on abstraction for a man whose other sense-anchors are tactile and specific.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—ex-roadie → antiques appraiser finding purpose in archival witness—feels specific and earned, and the quarry's acoustic inversion (swallows sound / returns voice) offers a fresh angle on post-failure reinvention. The leap from public humiliation to solitary custodianship is motivated by concrete particulars (speaker cloth, photograph, the method of fact-insulation). Risk: the piece commits to quiet accumulation and conceptual closure without hedging. Deduction: the "thread in the weave" insight, while apt, echoes familiar craft-versus-celebrity themes without a sharp counter-reading, and the Harrisburg expo failure (confusing a Jensen cabinet with Korean repro) reads as setup convenience rather than inevitability rooted in Marcus's specific blind spot.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus (ex-roadie / appraiser) is introduced in the opening line, drives the tin-box examination (~60%), and makes the closure choice (writing for the record). His dual expertise (audio history, appraisal method) enables the scrap-to-photograph match and shapes his final recognition. Removing this exact background would break the thematic hinge (invisible infrastructure) and the tactile anchors (coiling cables, side-stage frequencies). Cost: he renounces the external validation roadie work once promised.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth appears in four beats: initial handling (paragraph 3), reference-binder appraisal (paragraph 4), photograph alignment (paragraph 7), final desk placement (paragraph 9). It enables the key turn (matching weave to photograph reweights the object from negligible to bridge) and charges the closure (Marcus writes to preserve what the cloth signifies). Irreplaceable: the weave's tactile memory and Saranac provenance are causally necessary. Cost: the scrap's transformation from market-negligible to custodial artifact mirrors Marcus's own shift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" frames the opening contrast (Marcus traded sound for silence), shapes the middle stakes (the photograph shows a stage "once thundered" now swallowed), and the ending explicitly answers what replaces applause (custodial witness: "so the silence would know"). The concept constrains Marcus's method (facts as insulation from the ache of recognition lost) and the final image reconfigures it (quarry walls as cupped hands ready to return voice). Swappability test: "after the spotlight" or "after the crowd" would require only minor edits, slightly lowering irreplaceability, though the acoustic specificity (applause as "rolling wave," its "inverse" as dismissal exhale) tilts toward the essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is named twice (paragraph 2, paragraph 4) and enacted throughout: Marcus writes with "steady" handwriting yet "certainty never stayed"; he stood "confidently uncertain, holding a posture that said he knew" while "every synapse screamed that he did not." The trait constrains his post-failure method (building fact-walls that dissolve on contact) and enables the closure move (letting facts fall away to discover the thread-role). Cost: the attribute keeps him reaching for solidity he cannot hold, a visible trade-off. Deduction: the label is articulated rather than purely shown, though the Harrisburg beat and the binder ritual embody the contradiction in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once at the tin-box opening: "Marcus pried the lid and had to wrest it free from decades of corrosion." The action is physical and specific (overcoming resistance), enables the discovery (set list, pick, photograph), and thus unlocks the alignment beat that drives the ending. Swappability: "pry loose," "force open," or "break free" would serve nearly as well with minimal edits, capping the score despite the verb's tactile specificity and thematic resonance (wrestling meaning from buried history).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is signaled in paragraph 4 ("Facts were his insulation now...each datum a small brick in a wall"), enacted in the binder appraisal (thread count, dye composition), and renounced at closure ("let the facts fall away for one uninsulated moment"). The method shapes Marcus's tactics (reference binder, steady handwriting) and its failure/transcendence drives the ending choice (writing for the record rather than the market). The mechanics are on the page and matter: without the prior fact-wall, the final uninsulated moment lacks cost. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is named in the opening line, supplies the isolation Marcus needs ("swallowed sound...he needed it the way a burned man needs cool water"), and the quarry walls return in the closure image as "cupped hands, ready to return whatever voice he finally offered." The setting's acoustic inversion (silence reflects nothing back) constrains Marcus's emotional strategy and charges the ending when he decides to offer voice. Rita's entrance and the space heater are minor choreography; the true constraint is the echo-valley muteness that forces the custodial turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Six weeks ago" anchors the Harrisburg failure, and "after twenty-three years" frames the roadie backstory. The timeframe shapes Marcus's present method (facts as recent refuge, loss still raw) and tightens the stakes (he is still building the wall, not yet settled). The ending does not impose a new deadline, so the temporal pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. The time markers are purposeful but not irreplaceable: "two months" or "a season" would yield similar weight with minor edits, capping the score in mid-6s despite clear presence across setup and middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is dramatized in paragraph 4 ("the purpose he had been trying to discover after loss") and resolved at closure ("He understood then...it was never the sound itself...but to be the thread in the weave"). The desire drives Marcus's binder method (each fact a brick), conflicts with his craving for certainty (which never stays), and the tin-box discovery provides the friction (object of negligible market value carries existential weight). The final choice—writing for the record—enacts the discovered purpose with visible cost (renouncing buyer/audience in favor of custodial witness). The motivation is both told and shown, with embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is established in the opening (quarry "swallowed sound," silence as opposite of everything he'd known), modulates through the memory beats (side-stage frequencies, the "rolling wave" of applause versus "collective exhale of dismissal"), and charges the closure image ("quarry walls waited like cupped hands, ready to return whatever voice he finally offered them"). Tone is coherent across pressure: meditative in the opening, tightens at the tin-box arrival, releases into resonant quiet at the end. The longing is directional (toward connection that silence might return) rather than static melancholy, and the final image reconfigures loneliness into potential communion.</comment>
