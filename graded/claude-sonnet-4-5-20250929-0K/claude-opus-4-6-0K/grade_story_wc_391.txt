<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and well-embodied: fury reshaped into patient sabotage, impatience sculpted into deliberate slowness. Her internal contradiction—speed vs. patience, complicity vs. rebellion—drives the arc and is enacted through micro-choices (forcing herself to sit with slowness, breathing through impatience). The final moment shows credible endurance and stance crystallization with visible cost (carrying maps that will "slowly, softly, purposefully unmake" the empire). Minor issue: the backstory block is substantial (~25% of the text) but anchored to present action and primes the closure effectively under the reflection-led allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren stands poised to deliver falsified maps, the revolution "moving at the speed of patience," with the conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeating ice/patience metaphors, moon-tracking detail, and map alterations that reweight the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when she "breathed the cold air until the feeling passed," crystallizing her commitment to slow revolution with felt cost (suppressing the desire to witness her betrayal's impact).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary is purposefully chosen for magnetic interference, the frozen lake reflects her transformation metaphor, and the magnetic viaduct is crossed twice with evolving meaning (once bearing tools and fury, finally bearing subversive maps). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional lens: "hexagonal basalt columns," "iron bones conducting faint hums," ice "molecule by molecule." The frozen lake constrains her departure timing and charges the final image ("the entire lake has changed state and no one can say exactly when it happened"). Environment directly enables her tactical choice (magnetic interference hides her from Bureau navigation).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: unmake the empire through cartographic sabotage without detection. The piece deepens pressure through accumulative texture rather than external reversals: Maren must "sculpt patience from impatience," suppress her urgency on the final night, and accept that she may never witness the revolution's success. Agency is decision and endurance: she chooses lunar navigation, forces herself into slowness, and "breathed the cold air until the feeling passed." The cost is legible—she forecloses the path of immediate satisfaction and fast action, walking toward the empire "carrying maps that would slowly, softly, purposefully unmake it."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: patience as revolutionary method, ice formation as metaphor for inevitability, the moon as authority independent of empire. The closure image—"molecule by molecule, until one morning the entire lake has changed state"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to resist an empire) without moralizing. The piece embraces complexity: Maren's complicity, her suppressed impatience, the ambiguity of whether her maps will succeed. Subtext operates in gesture and image: the viaduct's "faint hums," the moon's "indifferent path," the "secret pressed under glass." No thematic echo or label-speak mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maren's professional and emotional lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "vigilant horizon mapper," "geometry that always preceded soldiers," "the patient revolution she had been composing in her mind." Perceptual signature is distinct—technical precision ("theodolite," "coordinate framework") layered with lyric compression ("organ built for a god who preferred silence"). Free indirect style is clean, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure: longer contemplative sentences during moon-tracking, tighter cadence at closure ("She packed her instruments, crossed the magnetic viaduct one final time…").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with purposeful compression; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs. The ice/patience metaphor recurs without becoming mechanical: "sculpt patience from impatience the way the cold sculpted ice from water—not by adding anything, but by removing heat, removing urgency, removing the need to be first." No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issue: a few elevated phrases ("unyoke entire regions," "indifferent path") approach the edge of register drift but remain voice-motivated and coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolve through charged image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—cartographic sabotage as patient revolution—offers a fresh angle on resistance narratives. Maren's professional role (horizon mapper) is integral to both her complicity and her method of defiance; transformation test passes (changing names/places would break the story's logic). The lunar navigation detail and magnetic viaduct are specific and non-obvious. Emotional complexity (impatience sculpted into patience, suppressed desire for witness) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative/textural structure and quiet ending, which sustain pressure without external confrontation. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early as protagonist. Drives setup (choosing basalt sanctuary), middle development (moon-tracking, map falsification), and closure (walking toward the empire with subversive maps). The mapper role is irreplaceable—her professional skill enables the sabotage method and grounds her complicity. Two beats: the decision to defect after watching the village flee, and the final suppression of impatience. Causal pressure: her choices narrow options (commits to lunar navigation, accepts slow timeline). Closure linkage strong (final action is hers). Small deduction for backstory weight (~25%).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present in two beats: initial crossing ("still glistened with residual moisture, its iron bones conducting faint hums") and final crossing ("crossed the magnetic viaduct one final time"). The viaduct's magnetic properties enable her hiding place (basalt interferes with compasses). Reweighted at closure: first crossing bears tools and fury, final crossing bears subversive maps. Functional but not indispensable—could be replaced with another path/bridge with minor edits. The rain detail adds texture but doesn't constrain choice. Mid-band for purposeful reprise without deeper causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup within first third ("the patient revolution she had been composing in her mind"). Shapes middle tactics: choosing lunar navigation, forcing slowness, suppressing urgency. Payoff explicit in closure ("The revolution would move at the speed of patience"). The concept directly opposes Maren's natural impatience, creating internal friction that drives her micro-choices. Causal pressure: patience vs. speed determines method (moon-tracking over Bureau speed). Cost visible: she must "breathe the cold air until the feeling passed." Irreplaceable—the story's entire arc hinges on this opposition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Softly purposeful, she worked through the frozen weeks"). Constrains action: the trait requires her to suppress impatience and accept slow timelines, directly opposing her Bureau training. Enables tactics: deliberate map alterations "small enough to seem like accumulated error." Present at closure in the phrasing "slowly, softly, purposefully unmake it." Cost legible: she forecloes fast action and immediate witness. Two beats: the working weeks and the final breathing exercise. Could be more deeply embodied in mid-section choices; currently functions more as framing than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: "unyoke entire regions from the empire's reach, liberating territory by making it illegible." Development: the map alterations (mountain passes, shifted rivers, vanished villages) are the method of unyoking. Payoff: she walks toward the empire carrying maps that will "unmake it." The action is irreplaceable—her professional role and the story's premise depend on this exact verb. Causal pressure: the falsification narrows her options (must return in spring, present maps as routine update). Cost implicit: risk of detection, forfeiture of fast action. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Signaled in first third ("By tracking moon paths across the sky, she could establish positional coordinates independent of the Bureau's magnetic system"). Shapes middle tactics: "Night after night, she climbed the tallest basalt column and sighted the moon through her theodolite, recording its arc against the stars." The method's mechanics matter: lunar navigation is ancient, slow, and independent of empire control. Payoff: the final night she watches "the moon trace its ancient, indifferent path." Irreplaceable—no other method would provide the thematic resonance (moon as non-imperial authority) or the patience requirement. Cost visible: "hours of patience for minutes of usable data."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup early: "basalt sanctuary...hexagonal basalt columns rising from the lakeshore." Shapes choice: basalt interferes with compass readings, enabling her hiding. Development: she climbs the tallest column for moon-tracking. The frozen lake constrains departure timing ("when the ice released the lake...without leaving tracks in the frost"). Payoff: the lake metaphor charges closure ("molecule by molecule, until one morning the entire lake has changed state"). Causal pressure: magnetic interference and ice timing alter tactics. Irreplaceable setting—both basalt and frozen lake are load-bearing for method and metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled in title and opening: "after the lake had already frozen over." Constrains tactics: she must wait until spring "when the ice released the lake" to return without leaving tracks. Development: "the frozen weeks" mark her working period. Payoff: closure image ("until one morning the entire lake has changed state") ties the freeze to thematic transformation. The timeframe tightens decisions (forces patience, limits departure window). Cost legible: she cannot leave immediately, must endure isolation. Strong integration but slightly more swappable than other elements (another seasonal constraint could serve similar function).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup in first third: "She had always been fast, impatient, hungry to finish one map and begin the next. That speed had made her valuable...Now she forced herself to sit with the slowness, to sculpt patience from impatience." Development: dramatized in choices (forcing herself to work slowly, suppressing urgency). Conflict sustained: "She felt the old impatience stirring—the desire to see the revolution completed...She breathed the cold air until the feeling passed." Payoff: closure depends on this transformation ("The revolution would move at the speed of patience"). Cost visible: forfeiture of witness and speed. Irreplaceable—the story's internal arc hinges on this exact transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone established early: fury ("carrying nothing but her instruments and a fury she intended to reshape") held in check by restraint (basalt as "organ built for a god who preferred silence"). Modulates with pressure: contemplative during moon-tracking, tighter at closure. The "restrained wildness" is embodied in syntax (lyric compression held to clean propulsion) and diction (technical precision layered with metaphor). Payoff: final image balances wildness (unmake the empire) with restraint (slowly, softly, purposefully). The tone charges closure by sustaining both fury and patience without tipping into sentiment or polemic. Coherent throughout.</comment>
