<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular: her "senselessly perceptive" trait drives micro-choices (blade sheathing as ceremony, touching each plant to listen). Embodied contradiction appears when her pacifist conviction coexists with handling her father's hunting knife, though the story leans more toward endurance than genuine internal conflict escalating under pressure. The final stance—letting the world break while tending continuity—feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (isolation, father's absence). Minor deduction: backstory about the father arrives in summary rather than dramatized friction, and the cost of her refusal never tightens into a present dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's refusal to engage the external chaos is crystallized in the final image with felt cost (solitude, the world's ongoing breaking). Orientation anchors cleanly by line ~80 (dome, roses, tower smoke). One meaningful deepening occurs when the burlap scrap—ruin repurposed—becomes tactile proof of her thesis. The lens holds without contradiction; the final paragraph reweights "patience," "constancy," "forgiveness" via the recurring structure. Minor gap: no reversal or tightening narrows options; pressure accumulates through layered images rather than a causal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert rose farm, and recurring objects (knife, burlap scrap) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's professional and perceptual bias (taproot creaking, air pressure shifts from a sand hawk). The burlap scrap's tactile journey—caught on the vent, wrapped around the wound—demonstrates object-as-setting constraining present action. Spatial choreography inside the dome is coherent; the distant tower column provides external pressure without requiring elaborate world-building. The micro-setting (body, tool, plant) actively shapes her work and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintaining continuity (internal) against external chaos. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs when the burlap scrap—product of the tower's fall—is repurposed with visible cost (acknowledging ruin while refusing engagement). Maren's agency is renunciation with on-page cost: isolation, the father's absence, the world's unhealed breaking. Minor gap: no reversal or forced trade-off tightens options; the story deepens through accretion rather than escalation. The final image reweights her stance but does not foreclose a formerly live path, so escalation reads as modest for the Accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (continuity vs. chaos, pacifism as active labor) emerges through engraved words, the sheathing ritual, and the burlap repurposing without thesis statements. The final image—"she had her own long habit, and it was the opposite, and it was enough"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer via accumulation. Subtext operates in the knife's ceremonial return to its sheath and the forgiving grandmother plant "humming" with layered intentions. Minor deduction: "weave continuity through chaos" borders on prompt-echo phrasing in the penultimate paragraph, risking Thematic Echo (−0.3 guideline), though it remains embedded in scene pressure rather than standing as a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices air pressure shifts, taproot creaks, the burlap's "memory of weight and balance." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("senselessly perceptive," "engraved quiet") remains character-particular and voice-motivated. The prose compresses during peak moments (knife scoring, fabric wrapping) without losing internal texture. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("she could feel," "she could hear") appear early to establish the trait, then recede. Single minor slip: "the way she watched everything: completely, involuntarily, and with a perception so thorough it bordered on senseless" reads slightly over-articulated for the established rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the engraving motif. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph cuts create visual breath. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "She was senselessly perceptive. That was what her father had called it" is a brief tell-then-show that could integrate more tightly. The phrase "long habit of breaking" in the final paragraph borders on stock metaphor but remains anchored to the tower column image. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("she could feel," "she could hear") clusters but establishes the trait rather than dulling immediacy, so no 9+ disqualification applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifism as agricultural labor, words engraved into living wood to shape growth. The burlap scrap repurposed from catastrophe offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The closing contrast—Maren's "long habit" as the opposite of breaking—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is modest: the accumulative structure and quiet ending cohere without gimmickry. Minor gap: the bounty-hunter father and collapsed tower remain familiar post-apocalyptic scaffolding; transformation arises more from Maren's micro-choices than from the premise itself. No proximity echoes or template plots detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's pacifist stance drives the sheathing ritual (middle beat) and the final stance crystallization (closure). Early signal via refusal to be her father's instrument; payoff in the ending's renunciation. Two-beat involvement with causal pressure (sheathing ceremony, final image). Swappability moderate: the trait matters, but "daughter of X who refuses X's path" is a common frame. Cost is felt (isolation, father's absence) but not sharpened by an on-page dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The burlap scrap appears in two beats: caught on the vent (setup), wrapped around the rose wound (middle). Causal pressure: repurposing ruin demonstrates her continuity work. Closure linkage: the act of wrapping is the story's peak moment of synthesis. Specificity high: "already carrying the memory of weight and balance" makes it irreplaceable. Minor gap: no reprise in the final image to charge the ending directly, so closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Early signal: "engraved quiet" named in paragraph three. Shapes stakes: the farm is "a library of silences pressed into living wood." Middle development: each engraving alters plant behavior (patient ones open slowly, constant ones bloom in drought). Closure: the engraved words recur in the final paragraph, reweighting Maren's stance. Causal pressure: the method constrains her work and charges the final image. High irreplaceability: removing this concept collapses the thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Early signal: named and demonstrated in paragraph two (air pressure from a sand hawk, taproot creaking). Enables one beat: noticing the burlap scrap on the vent. Cost visible: her father tried to recruit the trait; she refused. Middle constraint: the trait filters all perception but does not narrow a live choice under pressure. Closure participation weak: mentioned in setup but not active in the final image. Swappability moderate: heightened perception is common; the "senselessly" modifier adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Early signal and middle beat: sheathing as ceremony, "the click of steel against stitching, the deliberate choice to put the edge away." Causal pressure: the act defines her pacifism as active labor. Closure linkage: the final paragraph echoes "her own long habit, and it was the opposite" of breaking. Two-beat involvement with cost (father's non-understanding, her isolation). High specificity: the gesture's meaning ("the cutting was done and the growing could begin") is irreplaceable. Minor gap: the action does not drive a turn, so it remains thematic rather than plot-causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Early signal: paragraph three ("inculcating plants with values, etching intentions into their living tissue"). Middle development: the method shapes plant behavior (patient ones last weeks, forgiving ones survive mistakes). Closure: the engraved words recur in the final paragraph, charging the ending. Causal pressure: the method is Maren's daily work and the story's organizing principle. High irreplaceability: removing this method collapses the plot and theme. Three-beat involvement with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Early signal: hexagonal panes, warm soil, vents. Micro-setting constrains action throughout: Maren kneels, walks rows, wraps the scrap against the wound. Middle beats: the dome holds warmth "like cupped hands"; the burlap scrap caught on the uppermost vent. Closure: "the dome held its warmth around her" in the final paragraph, charging the ending image. Three-beat involvement with high causal pressure and irreplaceability. The enclosure's glass boundary literalizes her separation from external chaos, making the setting indispensable to stakes and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Early signal: "The tower fell on a Tuesday, and by Wednesday… and by Thursday Maren Solke had already returned to her roses." Middle: smoke column "still rolled through the basin." Closure: "the world outside continued its long habit of breaking." The timeframe establishes urgency (she returns quickly) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics beat-to-beat. No live clock pressures choices. Swappability high: "after disaster X" is generic; the tower could be replaced with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Early signal: "to weave continuity through chaos" appears in the penultimate paragraph but is dramatized throughout via engraving and repurposing. Middle beats: wrapping the burlap scrap, walking the rows. Closure: "she had her own long habit, and it was the opposite, and it was enough." Friction visible: the father's absence, the world's breaking. Two-beat involvement with causal pressure. Minor gap: the phrasing "weave continuity through chaos" borders on prompt-echo, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Early signal: "smoke… glowed amber and white—a tranquil blaze." Tone modulates with action: calm during engraving, compressed during the knife scoring. Closure: "the sky blazed its quiet amber" in the final paragraph, charging the ending image. The oxymoron (tranquil blaze) is sustained and reweighted at closure. Two-beat involvement with high coherence. Specificity high: the tone shapes perception and supports the theme of pacifist endurance. Minor gap: tone remains largely static rather than escalating under pressure.</comment>
