<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—"pressed her palm against the mica" because "her hands remembered what her mind could not"—with internal contradiction that drives choices. The moment she begins to sing is earned by prior causality (the dawn-child's cooling, her repeated failures), and her final acceptance that "she would not remember this tomorrow" forecloses the path of stable memory with felt cost. Minor deduction: the dawn-child remains more symbolic device than character with agency, limiting relationship crucible depth. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently strong throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Maren, greenhouse, mirror world night). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the song spreads through "contagion" and "muscle and bone," building density until the final image reweights the entire realm. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the dawn-child's awakening and the woven dawn unspool with visible cost: Maren "would not remember this tomorrow," foreclosing stable memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when the melody "unlocked something" and spreads through the root network. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mica window constrains choice: it "split whatever glow touched them into layered, trembling bands" and later "caught [the notes] and split them," enabling the harmonic spread that saves the realm. The greenhouse's spatial choreography is coherent (silver-barked trees, phosphorescent mosses, root network), and the alchemical environment directly charges the closure image when "light poured through the greenhouse, painting the silver bark gold." Micro-setting (the mica window, the roots) acts as functional constraint. Sensory selection reflects urgency appropriately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm—is signaled early and tightens when Maren begins to sing, narrowing her options to this one act. The tightening is protagonist-driven: her song triggers the harmonic spread through the root network, forcing villages to respond. The final cost is visible: Maren will forget this tomorrow, yet "her throat would" remember, foreclosing stable memory but keeping the realm alive. Agency is clear renunciation with on-page cost. One meaningful turn (melody surfaces → spreads → dawn rekindles) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "songs that lived in muscle and bone rather than memory," "music knits communities together the way mycelium knits a forest." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Maren's acceptance that forgetting is part of tending—without stating a moral. The swaddling motif recurs with reweighted meaning: first wrapping the dying dawn-child, then the whole world "swaddling the whole wounded world." Subtext operates in the gesture of pressing palms and the paradox of forgotten songs that still spread. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Maren's fragmented memory: "memories arrived like scattered seeds, some sprouting in wrong seasons." Diction matches her voice—"simple, startling act of beginning again"—and remains consistent under pressure. The shift from scattered memory to embodied knowledge ("her throat would") is clean and purposeful. Minor deduction: some passages ("phosphorescent mosses pulsed in rhythms that once matched the heartbeats of entire villages") edge toward exposition that slightly exceeds Maren's immediate perceptual filter, though the effect remains mostly voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally ("Stay," she whispered, and the word unlocked something), and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor loop detected: "she had done this before and would do it again because realms do not stay rekindled. They require tending" paraphrases the prior sentence's content without added pressure (−0.2). One metaphor ("music knits communities together the way mycelium knits a forest") is vivid and coherent. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Propulsion is strong through the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-keeper, alchemical orchard, and woven-dawn mechanics feels specific and non-obvious; the premise avoids template plots. The turn—songs living in "muscle and bone rather than memory"—is earned in hindsight by Maren's scattered recollection established early. The transformation of the swaddling motif (child → world) adds fresh inflection. Minor deduction: the mirror-world frame and "endless night" setting remain somewhat ornamental, established but not deeply integrated into causal pressure. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren ("scattered memory keeper") is present throughout and her choice to sing creates the key turn that spreads the dawn. Her acceptance at the end—"she would not remember this tomorrow"—redefines options with visible cost. Early signal, two distinct beats (wrapping the dawn-child, singing the melody), and closure linkage all present. The scattered-memory trait constrains her repeatedly and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mica window appears in three beats: Maren presses her palm against it each morning, it splits light "into layered, trembling bands," and crucially it "caught [the notes] and split them" into harmonics that spread through the root network. It enables the climactic tactic (sound refraction) and charges the final image ("lifted the child toward the mica window"). Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" shapes the core stake: the realm was "sustained by woven dawns—great tapestries of first light braided together by communities singing in unison." The concept alters tactics on the page—Maren must coax the forgotten song to weave a new dawn. The mechanics appear in at least two beats (exposition, then the active weaving at closure). The final image ("watched the woven dawn unspool across the sky") dramatizes the concept with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The attribute "knits communities together" appears explicitly: "music knits communities together the way mycelium knits a forest: invisibly, persistently, beneath every surface." It constrains Maren's tactic—she cannot rekindle alone; the song must spread as "contagion" through villages. The trait enables the climactic spread ("woman humming over bread dough," "blacksmith's hammer") with visible pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "swaddle" is irreplaceable: Maren swaddles the dawn-child in alchemical dew, the act is tied to "coax[ing] fruit from blossom," and the final image extends it to "swaddling the whole wounded world." The action appears in three beats, drives the key turn (dawn-child stirring after swaddling), and charges the closure image with visible cost. Removing this exact action would break the story's logic and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" is signaled early ("the songs had been forgotten") and its mechanics matter: the melody surfaces "in her throat, as if her body had hidden it," then spreads as "contagion" through "muscle and bone rather than memory." The method shapes multiple attempts (Maren begins to sing, the song spreads, the dawn rekindles). Present in setup, middle development, and closure; causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" pressures choices: Maren must work within its "iron ribs," "silver-barked trees," and "phosphorescent mosses" to rekindle dawn. The setting supplies resources (dew from alchemical branches, the root network that spreads the song) that directly affect the outcome. Early signal, beats in middle and closure, and the final image ("light poured through the greenhouse") all integrate the setting causally.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" is signaled in the opening line and establishes the inverted reality ("every reflection runs backward and light remembers what darkness forgets"). However, the mirror-world timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—Maren's actions would proceed identically in a non-mirror setting. The attribute remains ornamental; it enriches tone but does not constrain choices. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to rekindle a dying realm" is dramatized in choices: Maren wraps the dawn-child, sings the forgotten song, and accepts that she will forget tomorrow to keep the realm alive. Friction between want (stable memory) and cost (forgetting) is visible on the page. The motivation shapes setup, middle beats, and closure. Causal pressure is strong, though the motivation is somewhat abstract until the swaddling scene concretizes it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone "bound release" is coherent and modulates with pressure: early stasis ("endless night," "scattered seeds"), rising tension ("the dawn-child stirred," "Maren sang harder"), and final release ("light poured through the greenhouse," "the whole wounded world"). The ending crystallizes the tone in "freedom into" rather than "freedom from," charging the final image with undeniable pressure. The tone shapes the narrative arc and closure effect without becoming static.</comment>
