<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between the meditative "controlled" breathing and the "thundering calm" operates in scene with visible cost: eleven years of carving without answers, then a shift toward incorporating others' voices via the ribbon. The grandmother specter functions as external pressure that forces micro-choices across weeks rather than being merely advisory. The final walk home to "set the table" and bring a poem is an earned renunciation—she's leaving the solitary stone carving for the communal dinner ritual—with visible cost: her identity as a gravestone carver is reweighted. Minor slip: the specter's appearances read somewhat convenient (arriving "each dusk" without friction), which slightly softens the pressure Elara faces alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ribbon poems accumulate meaning across weeks, the greenhouse dusk visits deepen rather than reverse, and closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the spiral's meaning crystallizes) paired with Charged Poise (Elara walks home to participate in the ritual with visible cost—she's abandoning the solitary stone project for the communal table). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. The cost is legible: she's spent eleven years seeking the shape of grief in stone and now shifts to the living conversation, leaving the finished slab behind. One slip: the weeks of migration compress into summary ("Across the weeks...Marguerite appeared each dusk") where a single dramatized encounter beyond the opener would tighten causality further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse's "iron bones laced with glass so old it ripples" and "broken roof panes" constrain Elara's nightly ritual and enable the butterflies to settle on her—micro-setting that shapes the meditative posture and the dusk timing. The Vermont slate slab, ferns, propagation tray, and soil anchor tactile work across beats. The final image of rolling the ribbon and walking home uses the greenhouse as departure point, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clear: cross-legged floor position, slate beside her, ribbon across lap, specter behind. Minor gap: the "copper smoke" dusk and the butterflies' thinning are vivid but remain largely atmospheric in the middle weeks rather than pressing a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightens once meaningfully: Elara shifts from cutting individual headstones to carving the communal spiral after the specter's guidance. The ribbon's reappearance and Marguerite's poem-by-poem mentorship deepen understanding, and the final spiral carving forecloses the prior eleven-year solitary method with visible cost (she walks away to join the living ritual). Agency is present: Elara chooses to retrace, to carve differently, and to bring a poem. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens. One limiter: the weeks of mentorship are summarized rather than shown in a second on-page reversal, so escalation reads as one major deepening rather than multiple tightenings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as ongoing conversation rather than closed monument—emerges organically from the spiral's "widening gyre" and the ribbon's poem-trading ritual, never stated as thesis. The final image (rolling the ribbon, setting the table, bringing a poem) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: collective grief is participation, not solitary carving. Subtext operates in Marguerite's directive "Retrace" and the ferns that "outlived their keeper." The story resists tidy closure by refusing to name the grief's content (whose deaths, which losses) and instead offers the conversational form. The "thundering calm" paradox charges the greenhouse scenes. No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes. The ending reweights prior material—eleven years of unanswered headstones—without asserting a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance: perception filters through Elara's professional lexicon ("Vermont slate," "chisel," "propagation tray") and her meditative focus. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "gradual and without apology," "fiercely meditative," "thundering calm." The specter's dialogue is minimal and directive, distinct from Elara's interior texture. No head-hopping; Marguerite's interiority is never accessed. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the closure image. One small slip: the phrase "the paradox of silence so full it roared" edges toward over-articulation where the established voice would trust the image alone, and "dissolved with the last butterfly" leans slightly ornamental rather than grounded in Elara's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally ("She was a gravestone carver by trade, but thoughtful in a way that slowed her chisel to a crawl" versus the terse "Retrace"). Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "Its rediscovery broke something open in her chest" advances emotion and primes the shift). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the dinner custom. Minor deductions: "the greenhouse filled with a thundering calm, the paradox of silence so full it roared" stacks two metaphors for the same effect within one beat (−0.3), and "each grief opening into the next, never closing, never repeating" includes a small redundancy between "never closing" and the spiral image already established (−0.2). Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and poem-trading at family dinners feels specific and non-obvious; the "shape of collective grief" as spiral rather than circle or closure is a fresh inflection. The ribbon as map and the carved slate as communal headstone transform the carver-as-solitary-artisan trope. Emotional specificity—"fiercely meditative," eleven years without answers—avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the weeks-long ellipsis and the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limiter: the specter-as-guide setup echoes familiar mentor-ghost patterns (e.g., inherited wisdom, family lineage), and while the poem-by-poem structure personalizes it, the framework itself is not transformed beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's occupation drives the story's central question (shape of grief), the choice to carve the spiral rather than names/dates, and the final renunciation of the stone for the living table. Her "thoughtful in a way that slowed her chisel" trait enables the weeks-long retracing. The carver role appears early, shapes two major beats (ribbon discovery → spiral carving), and the final walk home directly opposes her trade with visible cost. Highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ribbon is introduced early (previous migration), handled physically in the opening greenhouse scene (unrolled across lap, stitched lines read), and its poems drive the weeks of spectral mentorship. It reappears at closure ("rolled the ribbon tight, placed it beside the stone") with reweighted meaning: no longer lost archive but active map. The ribbon constrains Elara's method (she must retrace each poem's handwriting) and participates causally in two beats and the ending. Strongly integrated; just shy of indispensable because the stone spiral could theoretically exist without the ribbon's physical presence at the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship shapes the middle's primary action: Marguerite appears each dusk, explains poem origins, and directs Elara to retrace, which alters Elara's carving method and understanding. The concept is present early (first October setup, second October execution), enables the spiral's creation, and dissolves at closure. It constrains tactics (Elara works only at dusk during migration) and delivers the key insight ("The ribbon is a map"). Strong causal role across two beats and the ending. Cap reasoning: the mentorship is mostly told in summary ("Across the weeks...Marguerite appeared each dusk") rather than shown in multiple dramatized encounters, so beat involvement reads as setup + ending rather than three fully dramatized moments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is demonstrated on-page via "breathing so controlled that the monarchs...settled on her shoulders without fear" and enables the weeks-long retracing project. It constrains her approach (slow, contemplative rather than urgent) and the phrase appears early. However, the trait does not visibly foreclose an option or create a dramatized tradeoff; it describes her method without showing a cost of that method versus an alternative. Present in setup and implied in the ending's walk home, but the middle summary elides any on-page moment where fierce meditation pressures a specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Retrace" is Marguerite's directive, becomes Elara's method across the weeks, and drives the spiral's creation by reconstructing each handwriting. The action is signaled early (specter scene), structures the middle work, and its result (the spiral) defines the closure image and Elara's realization. Causal linkage is strong: without retracing, no spiral; without the spiral, no answer to the shape question. Present in setup, development, and payoff with clear necessity. Just below indispensable because the directive is brief and the weeks of retracing are summarized rather than shown in multiple pressure beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The family dinner custom is introduced early via the ribbon's backstory, reappears in Marguerite's explanations of each poem's origin ("everyone brought a favorite poem...copied it onto the communal ribbon"), and the final line directly invokes it ("walked home...to set the table for dinner. She had a poem to bring"). The custom shapes the ribbon's meaning and the story's thematic answer (grief as conversation). It does not mechanically solve a problem but reweights the closure by shifting Elara from solitary carver to communal participant. Solid integration across all three gates, though the middle's summary mode limits its on-page pressure role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk supplies the broken roof panes (butterflies enter), the floor for cross-legged work, the propagation tray (ribbon's hiding place), the ferns and soil (Marguerite's material authority), and the Vermont slate workspace. Dusk timing recurs as constraint ("each dusk") and the greenhouse's two-hundred-year age ties to Marguerite's presence. The setting enables the meditative posture, the butterfly settling, the weeks-long ritual, and the final departure. Micro-setting (slate, tray, floor) alters tactics. The ancient greenhouse frames the opening and closing images and pressures every encounter. Indispensable: no other setting would allow this exact sequence of choices and constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The butterfly migration frames the story's timespan, tightens Marguerite's availability ("Marguerite grew fainter" as "monarchs thinned"), and creates the urgency for Elara to complete the spiral before the last butterfly. The timeframe is present early ("Every autumn, when the butterflies threaded south") and at closure ("dissolved with the last butterfly"). However, the weeks themselves are summarized without on-page clock pressure during the middle work, so the migration functions more as atmospheric bracket than live constraint that alters specific tactical choices. Solid setup and payoff; underdeveloped middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to discover the shape of collective grief is stated early ("eleven years trying to discover"), drives Elara's nightly greenhouse visits, motivates her receptiveness to the specter's guidance, and finds its answer in the spiral and the walk home. The motivation is dramatized through her carving attempts, the ribbon's rediscovery, and the final renunciation of the solitary stone. Friction is present: eleven years without success, then the shift to communal form costs her the gravestone-carver identity. The motivation shapes setup, middle retracing, and the closure realization. Strong causal necessity; just shy of indispensable because the phrasing "shape of collective grief" is slightly abstract and could be rephrased without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is established early ("the greenhouse filled with a thundering calm, the paradox of silence so full it roared") and modulates across the piece: controlled breathing, fierce meditation, the specter's gradual materialization, and the quiet final walk. Tone charges the closure by holding the paradox—Elara's renunciation is neither triumphant nor defeated, but settled. The tone is coherent through all turns and supports the theme of ongoing conversation rather than dramatic rupture. Strong tonal control; slight deduction for the phrase "thundering calm" being articulated twice in close proximity (initial definition plus echo) where once would suffice, and the final paragraph's tone shifts slightly toward softer closure ("walked home through the dark") without maintaining the paradox's edge.</comment>
