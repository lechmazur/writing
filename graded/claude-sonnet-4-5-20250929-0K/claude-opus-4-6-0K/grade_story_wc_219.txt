<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera is well-embodied through micro-choices: checking her wrist monitor, scouting the route in a daze, the clinical framing of her "artificial pilgrimage." Her motivations (proving homecoming as mechanical while feeling its ache) create productive tension. Interior contradictions operate simultaneously in key moments—she proves the mechanism yet "understood that knowing the mechanism did not diminish the ache. It deepened it." The final pivot ("She believed it anyway") feels earned by the journey's accumulated particulars, though the shift is more stated than dramatized in a difficult action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, recurring amber imagery, and deepening reflection anchored to present stimuli. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sera's stance crystallizes in "She believed it anyway"—the luminous skeptic choosing belief despite (because of) proof. Cost is conceptual and felt: her academic identity is reconfigured, and the final image of the fly "going nowhere and everywhere at once" reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. One tightening is sufficient at this length; the single scene deepens rather than reversing multiple times.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, amber on the sill, and spring setting charge the final image: light moving through amber casts "a small golden eye on the floor," the fly's silhouette trembling as clouds shift. Sensory hierarchy reflects Sera's professional filter: cortisol spikes, neural pathways, oxytocin. The tower's ivy, limestone streaking, chalk dust smell anchor spatial choreography. The amber—handled twice, held to light, set on sill—constrains the closure moment by making preservation and presence tangible. Micro-setting (body/tool/object) meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: to isolate and measure homecoming's chemistry, testing whether manufactured feeling "still meant anything after the sky had opened." One meaningful tightening: Sera's artificial pilgrimage design confronts its own limits when "the sum exceeded the parts" despite matching hormones and pathways. Agency is renunciation with cost: she abandons her reductive stance ("She believed it anyway"), foreclosing the pure-skeptic path. The first-contact frame complicates but does not resolve; Sera's choice does. Cost is felt in the reconfigured identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (mechanism vs. meaning, preservation, proximity without presence) emerges through the amber's recurring image: the fly "mid-flight," "going nowhere and everywhere at once" becomes a non-literal answer to whether knowing chemistry diminishes homecoming. The closure avoids moralizing: "she understood that knowing the mechanism did not diminish the ache. It deepened it." Subtext operates in gesture: pressing forehead to glass, holding amber to light, the tower holding while rain falls. The final image reweights the premise—signal across void arriving warm mirrors homecoming's ache arriving despite its mechanism—without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization: "She was what the department called a luminous skeptic," "what she was doing, she understood clinically." Perceptual signature is character-specific: noticing cortisol spikes, wrist monitor, neural pathways, yet also "bronze quiet," "honey-dark," "green valley trembling with wind." Diction remains within Sera's academic-yet-poetic lexicon. Brief reflection ("Her peers found her reductive. Her students found her honest") anchors in present conflict. No dialogue present; interior voice modulates under pressure without filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("The rain fell. The tower held.") contrast with longer reflective sentences. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Ivy latticed the lower windows" gives setting, time passage, and abandonment). Minor figurative density in the closure paragraph: "small golden eye," "going nowhere and everywhere at once," "the smallest pilgrim" cluster without muddling. One paraphrase near-loop: "The chemistry was correct—every ion accounted for—and still the sum exceeded the parts" slightly echoes the prior "something exceeded the data," applying −0.2. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alien-contact frame charges a personal homecoming pilgrimage, making skepticism about nostalgia suddenly urgent. The amber—forty-million-year preservation meeting eleven-day-old signal—feels specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in structure: heavy reflection (near BRR ceiling) interleaved with present micro-choices sustains pressure. Transformation test passes: swapping names/setting would lose the academic-skeptic voice and the Gliese/amber pairing. One friction: the "luminous skeptic" frame and first-contact stakes feel somewhat prompt-assembled, reducing inevitability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera as "luminous skeptic" is established early, tested in her designed pilgrimage, and her final choice—"She believed it anyway"—reverses her reductive stance with conceptual cost. The character frames the journey, drives the middle reflection anchored to amber/tower, and the closure hinges on her renunciation. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is reflective rather than decisional. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but swappability (another scientist-skeptic could occupy the role) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fly amber appears in beat one (Linden's gift), beat two (set on sill, light through it casts "golden eye"), and beat three (held to light, final image "the smallest pilgrim"). It enables Sera's meditation on preservation and charges the closure: "going nowhere and everywhere at once" reweights homecoming's paradox. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity (forty-million-year Diptera mid-wing-beat) +0.7. Indispensable: removing it breaks the preservation motif and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" shapes stakes explicitly: Sera designs the return ("deliberate return, measured steps, controlled variables"), wears the same boots and satchel, scouts the route. It narrows her tactic—isolate chemistry—and the closure directly addresses whether manufactured feeling "still meant anything." Concept frames the dominant stake, tested in middle beats (cortisol spike "on schedule"), and the ending reweights it: mechanism deepens rather than diminishes. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, but some label-feel in "artificial pilgrimage" phrasing −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Academically rebellious in the quietest way" is established (papers dismantling nostalgia sentimentality) but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. It colors Sera's stance and her skeptic identity, yet the pilgrimage design and final belief-shift would function identically if she were labeled differently. Present in setup, informs voice, but swappable −0.7. No middle choice gated by this trait, missing development gate; closure references her skeptic frame but not the rebellious modifier specifically. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Converge" appears once: "footprints…converged with her current stride perfectly, as though past and present were lining up their spines." It signals the pilgrimage's effect and primes the closure theme (past meeting present), but the action itself does not drive a turn. Lyric reprise: early image returns as metaphor in final paragraph ("going nowhere and everywhere at once"). Two gates (setup, payoff thematic link), but middle development absent and swappability high (many verbs could describe footprint alignment). Resonance without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path" appear in one beat: Sera notices her own earlier scout-prints and follows them. The method briefly externalizes her dazed recursion but does not shape later tactics or the closure. Present after first third (late signal −0.4), ornamental use (description without pressure) −0.8, missing closure participation (tower/amber dominate ending) −0.6. Swappable: she could have remembered the route without prints. Functional setup for pilgrimage motif but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower anchors all three beats: destination framing the stakes, observation room where Linden showed Gliese, and the sill where amber is placed to cast light. Setting supplies the resource (window, sill) that enables the closure image and embodies preservation ("the tower held"). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5 (final paragraph: "The tower held"), micro-setting constraint (sill/light) +0.6. High irreplaceability: tower's history with Linden and its survival charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After making first contact" (eleven days ago signal arrived) frames urgency and thematic stakes: solitude unmade, humanity not alone. The timeframe motivates Sera's pilgrimage now and charges her homecoming question with cosmic scale. Present in setup +0.6, informs the why (one beat of pressure) +0.4, but does not tighten tactics in middle or appear in closure beats. Missing closure participation cap at 2.8 would apply, but the concept-driven charge (alien signal reweighting human homecoming) lifts it: conceptual cost +0.5, reaching low-6s for thematic setup work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To understand the chemistry of homecoming" is Sera's explicit motivation, dramatized through her wrist monitor check (cortisol spike), controlled pilgrimage variables, and the core conflict: proving mechanism vs. feeling ache. Desire frames two beats (pilgrimage design, tower meditation) and the closure directly answers it ("knowing the mechanism did not diminish the ache. It deepened it"). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3. Friction: the want versus cost tension is felt but the final belief-shift is more stated than enacted in a difficult choice with visible trade-off −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears explicitly mid-story ("Bronze quiet settled over everything: the hush of wet metal") and governs the entire piece's register: subdued, metallic stillness, low hum, finches muttering, rain dripping. Tone modulates under pressure (short declaratives at closure: "The rain fell. The tower held.") and charges the final image: stillness holding motion, preservation in amber. Setup +0.6, coherent modulation across all beats +1.2, closure charge (quiet intensifying meaning rather than breaking) +1.4. Specificity (bronze = aged, elemental, resonant) +0.6. Indispensable tonal anchor.</comment>
