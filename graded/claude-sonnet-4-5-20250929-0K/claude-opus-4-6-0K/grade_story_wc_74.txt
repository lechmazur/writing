<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is specific and embodied—insomnia as "a restless thing that lived behind her eyes," the methodical belief in kindness carried "like a second pulse beneath the skin." Her choices (picking up the brush, stepping back to evaluate, pressing her palm to glass) are micro-decisions that reflect her values under pressure. The final yielding to sleep is earned by four sleepless nights and the completion of the portrait, creating a quiet but credible shift. Minor slip: the old man's breathless non-thank becomes slightly over-explained in reflection rather than left as witnessed image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (rooftop greenhouse, waxing moon, Lena's insomnia) land cleanly in the first paragraph. Pressure accumulates through four nights of failed attempts, the methodical selection of tools, and the daydream excavation that surfaces the old man's face. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lena completes the portrait, recognizes the expression she sought, and accepts sleep—foreclosing the restless cycle with visible cost (four nights, the partial canvases). The final image reweights prior material: the lost word, the quiet kindness, the approach of sleep "like a stranger offering something gentle and unnamed." Cost is felt and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is vividly anchored with fogged glass, exhaust-stained concrete below, terra-cotta pots, ferns, bromeliads. Sensory selection is strong: saffron moonlight through haze, warm glass under her palm, the city's cough. The moon-tipped brush and its iridescence supply a tool that shapes the method (finest lines for the portrait). Minor limitation: the greenhouse functions primarily as atmospheric container rather than constraining a tactical choice—though the warm glass and moonlight do charge the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Lena wants to capture and prove that strangers carry kindness, visible in their faces when memory is roused. Pressure tightens via four sleepless nights, failed canvases, and the methodical selection of brush and daydream to surface one clear face. The portrait's completion narrows options (she can now sleep) and the cost is visible: four nights of insomnia, abandoned half-finished portraits. No explicit antagonist, but the elusiveness of the expression and her own exhaustion supply coherent resistance. One meaningful deepening when the old man's face surfaces with "absolute clarity" and she begins to paint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: lost languages as kindness going quiet, waiting in the body; the methodical hypothesis tested through painting; the saffron moonlight as stillness "not empty but full, the way a pause in music holds the note that came before it." The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: she does not need him to see the painting, only to know the kindness survives. The Sursilvan brush, the rain-soaked groceries, the unsaid word—all cohere into a meditation on what persists unseen. Minor ornamental touch: "alive as moonlight" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward overt theme statement but remains grounded in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "exhaust-stained concrete," "moon the color of old saffron," "daydream pulling her sideways out of time," "eyes held the same saffron quiet as the moonlight." Psychic distance is stable, close third; no head-hopping. Vocabulary and rhythm fit Lena's artist sensibility without register drift. The final line's syntax—"for the first time in days, felt the edge of sleep approach like a stranger offering something gentle and unnamed"—mirrors her receptive, weary stance. No dialogue to judge. Zero filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance character (insomnia history, method), setting (fogged glass, smog, moon), or theme (lost languages, kindness as second pulse). Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor slip: "she worked slowly, methodically" in paragraph six leans slightly toward summary when dramatizing the brushstrokes might tighten further. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("tug of daydream," "moonlight pooled on her hand," "involuntary visions...like ink in water"). Closure image is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomnia, painting, lost language, and lunar daydream method feels specific and non-obvious. The portrait-as-proof premise avoids generic "art heals" templates by anchoring in a methodical hypothesis about strangers' bodies remembering kindness. The moon-tipped calligrapher's brush and Sursilvan script add cultural specificity. Risk: the meditative, accumulative structure eschews conflict spectacle in favor of quiet intensity. Minor friction: the "particular softness in a stranger's face when they remembered a kindness" is articulated early, reducing discovery at closure; the ending fulfills rather than surprises.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's insomniac painter identity is present in setup (paragraph one), drives middle beats (four sleepless nights, choosing to paint instead of sleep, methodical work), and shapes closure (she completes the portrait and feels sleep approach). Her insomnia creates the opening for night painting; her painter's method (daydream excavation, brush choice) enables the portrait's success. Removal would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush appears in setup (grandmother's calligraphy, silver iridescence), is handled in the middle beat ("she picked up the brush," dipped it, used it for finest lines), and is set down at closure ("Lena set the brush down"). Its specific properties—silver iridescence, association with lost language—charge both method and thematic resonance. Causal pressure: the brush's fine tip enables the precise portrait work that surfaces the expression. High irreplaceability; any generic brush would lose the moon/language linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lost languages (Sursilvan) are signaled early via the brush and grandmother's letters, likened to "lost kindnesses" that "only went quiet, waiting in the body." The concept threads through Lena's belief system and the old man's unspoken word at closure. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice—it remains thematic rather than altering options or enabling a beat. Lyric reprise (early seed to final image of the "lost word" the man shapes in sleep) reweights the stake with undeniable thematic cost, qualifying for mid-6s under the lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is dramatized: Lena believes "methodically, the way a scientist believes in a hypothesis before the data arrives" and works "slowly, methodically, each stroke a small act of hope." The trait constrains her process (patient, systematic daydream excavation rather than frantic painting) and enables the portrait's completion. Visible in setup, middle (selecting brush, working slowly), and closure (stepping back to evaluate). Cost: four sleepless nights and abandoned canvases are the price of methodical persistence. Swappable with "patiently hopeful" without major edits, capping upper range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rouse" is seeded early ("roused" when buried warmth surfaces in strangers' faces), drives Lena's goal (to capture the moment kindness is roused), and charges the final image ("waiting to be roused" in the penultimate paragraph). The action shapes the portrait's content and Lena's method. However, it functions as both verb and thematic anchor rather than a discrete plot turn; easily paraphrasable to "awaken" or "stir" with minor edits. Present across beats and closure, but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—daydreams sparked by moonlight—is signaled in setup ("let the moon's glow spark involuntary visions"), employed in the middle beat ("she let the silver light pull her sideways...until a face surfaced"), and results in the portrait's completion at closure. The method matters: without moonlight-triggered excavation, Lena cannot access the face. Causal pressure: the waxing moon's glow enables the daydream that surfaces the old man. Specificity: tied to the moon-tipped brush and saffron light, not swappable with generic inspiration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is anchored in setup (eleven floors, glass panels, smog-choked city) and present throughout (terra-cotta pots, ferns, warm glass at closure). It supplies atmosphere and the moon-access needed for the method. Minor constraint: the greenhouse's warmth and moonlight enable the daydream work. Closure participation: Lena presses her palm against the warm glass in the final beat. However, the location is somewhat swappable—any moon-accessible artist space could serve with edits. The smog contrast charges the setting but does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The waxing moon is present in setup (first paragraph), tracked through the night ("still the moon climbed," "silver light had shifted to the far wall"), and implicit at closure. It supplies the light that sparks daydreams and marks elapsed time (four sleepless nights under waxing moons implied). However, the timeframe does not create deadline pressure or tighten decisions—Lena could work under any moon phase. The waxing detail adds poetic resonance (building toward fullness mirrors her building toward the portrait) but does not causally constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is articulated in setup ("she believed...that strangers carried kindness...she wanted to prove it"), drives all middle beats (selecting brush, daydream method, painting the old man), and is satisfied at closure ("she only needed to know that the kindness was still in him"). Friction: four nights of failure versus the hypothesis's demands. The motivation is specific, irreplaceable, and shapes every choice. Minor limitation: the belief is stated rather than fully dramatized in conflict (no one challenges her hypothesis on the page), capping slightly below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" is established in setup (moon "the color of old saffron, warm and muted and impossibly gentle"), recurs in the middle beat (old man's eyes "held the same saffron quiet as the moonlight, a stillness that was not empty but full"), and charges the penultimate paragraph ("quiet as saffron, alive as moonlight"). The tone is coherent through all beats, modulating only slightly as Lena nears completion (from restless to receptive). The final image—sleep approaching "gentle and unnamed"—sustains the saffron quiet without breaking it. High integration; the tone is both atmosphere and thematic anchor.</comment>
