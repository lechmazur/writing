<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's interior life is concrete and embodied through the pen nib talisman and her father's logbooks, with contradictory impulses visible in her decision to publish everything rather than suppress or simply expose. The choice to "reframe" by publishing both corruption and regret feels earned by the observatory discoveries and carries visible cost to family reputation. Minor slip: Crane remains functional but somewhat flat, existing primarily to deliver documents and witness her choice. The "devotedly observant" self-description and "solemn playfulness" feel slightly over-articulated for peak interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, Marguerite, post-call timeframe). The piece operates under a Causal lens: journalist's call → observatory climb → logbook discovery → Crane's arrival → decision to publish everything. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible cost (family reputation sacrificed, truth published, father's complexity exposed). The "proof by contradiction" framework structures her reasoning cleanly and the final image of clouds parting to reveal the printing plant grounds the decision in concrete consequence. One minor causality softness: the leap from "publish the documents" to "publish the diaries too" feels slightly compressed, though the logbook orbits prepare it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory functions as both physical space and thematic pressure: copper dome, spiral staircase, stone ledge, clouds below, observation slit all ground the scene. The pen nib's placement on the stone ledge and the view of the printing plant through shifting clouds charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (staircase, telescope console, ledge, dome). Minor limitation: the observatory's past use (father's visits, funded decades ago) is told rather than shown through present environmental cues, and occupational detail about the Gazette remains light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. family reputation) is signaled early and tightens through the logbook revelations and Crane's document spread. Marguerite's agency drives the turn: she chooses not to suppress (like her father) or simply expose (like a standard journalist) but to publish the full orbit including regret. The cost is explicit and on-page: "destroys your family's reputation... your mother's memory." The proof-by-contradiction reasoning narrows her options with visible logic. One meaningful tightening when Crane arrives transforms her solo discovery into an irreversible editorial decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the logbooks as "orbits of regret," the pen nib that fits no pen, the observatory funded for journalist humility that failed its purpose. The final image answers the thematic question through action rather than statement: publish the whole orbit, not just the crash. "Proof by contradiction" operates as both method and metaphor without over-explaining. The piece resists the tidy moral (father not simply good or bad) and the clouds-parting moment offers resonance without sermonizing. No thematic echo in the ending; the valley view does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marguerite with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct literary texture ("vestigial," "liturgical," "elliptical and recurring") that matches the educated newsprint heiress without jarring register shifts. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Crane's exposition and Marguerite's responses advance plot and reveal character stance. Minor slips: "devotedly observant" and "solemn playfulness" feel slightly author-voiced rather than character-voiced in peak beats, and the phrase "small, insistent question" at the pen-nib moment edges toward precious. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template patterns; information density is high (pen nib anchors identity, logbooks reveal suppression, proof-by-contradiction structures choice). Figurative language is controlled: "orbits of regret," "white sea," "dark gravitational center" cohere without mixing metaphors. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor density slip: "a woman choosing to let the truth complete its long, elliptical path home" in the final paragraph slightly over-explains what the prior image accomplished. Proofreading is clean; grammar and punctuation are conventional and effective.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of newsprint dynasty, observatory, orbits-of-regret metaphor, and proof-by-contradiction method feels purposeful rather than checklist. The choice to publish both corruption and regret (not suppress, not simply expose) offers a fresh angle on journalistic integrity dilemmas. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on these specific elements and wouldn't survive generic substitution. Risk-taking is moderate: the proof-by-contradiction frame and the logbook device are literary but not experimental. The premise (heir discovers parent's ethical compromises) is familiar, but the "publish the whole orbit" resolution and the mathematical-method framing elevate it above template execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite appears in the opening line, drives all major beats (climb, logbook reading, decision to publish), and her choice at closure alters tactics from suppression to full exposure. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Causal pressure is strong: her inheritance of the Gazette and the weight of her father's legacy constrain her options throughout. The decision is irreplaceable to this exact character (newsprint heiress with devotion to her father's details). Cost is visible: family reputation sacrificed. Minor limiter: Crane delivers the inciting documents, but Marguerite's prior suspicion and logbook discovery mean she's not purely reactive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pen nib appears in three beats: opening (breast pocket talisman), middle (held to light at the observatory), and ending (placed back in pocket "like a small, insistent question"). Setup and payoff are clear; middle use is present but largely contemplative. The nib's defining trait—never fitting any pen, ornamental and vestigial—reinforces theme (devotion to details that don't function) and charges the final return. However, the nib does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains symbolic rather than causal. Swappability test: another small heirloom could serve a similar function with minor edits. Lyric reprise is purposeful but does not reach irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" structures the entire piece: logbook entries as "elliptical and recurring," each pass bringing her father closer to "some dark gravitational center," and Marguerite's decision to "publish the whole orbit, not just the crash." Setup (logbooks beside telescope), development (October 1987 and March 1995 entries constrain her understanding), and payoff (final choice to show the orbit) all present. The concept changes her options: rather than suppress or simply expose, she reframes by publishing regret alongside corruption. Cost is tied to the concept: exposing the orbit means exposing her father's failures. Irreplaceable: removing this exact framing would collapse the thematic and causal structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is labeled explicitly ("I'm devotedly observant") and shown through her reading of logbooks and recognition of her father's patterns. Setup is present (opening: "devotedly observant of every detail her father had left behind"), development occurs (she reads the logbooks and infers the Whitfield connection before Crane explains), and payoff lands (her decision is informed by observed details). However, the trait enables rather than constrains her choice, and the label feels slightly on-the-nose in dialogue. Swappability test: "perceptive" or "detail-oriented" could replace it with minor edits. Cost connection is weak: the trait helps her but doesn't exact a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Intervene" drives the climax: Marguerite chooses to intervene not by suppressing (as her father did) or simply exposing, but by reframing through publication of both documents and diaries. Setup is implicit (her father's prior interventions via suppression), development occurs when she reads the logbooks and realizes "he chose," and payoff lands when she tells Crane "We run it all." The action is irreplaceable: the entire closure depends on this specific choice to intervene in a new way. Causal pressure is strong: her decision narrows options and forecloses the path of silence or partial truth. Cost is explicit and on-page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" appears explicitly in the final logbook entry reference and structures Marguerite's reasoning: "Assume Henry Bellwood was a good man. If he was good, he would not have buried truth. But he buried truth. Therefore, the assumption fails." Setup is late (final third), but the method is signaled through her father's love of it. Development is compressed into one paragraph of interior reasoning. Payoff: the method enables her reframing choice. However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized across beats, and the method could be replaced with another reasoning frame (e.g., "full disclosure" or "transparency") without breaking story logic. Late appearance and summary-only use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory functions in all three gates: setup (opening description, funded by father, location "where he used to go"), development (stone ledge where pen nib is placed, observation slit, clouds below), and payoff (dome and valley view in final paragraph). The setting constrains access (spiral staircase, above clouds) and supplies the logbooks that drive discovery. The "echoing" quality reinforces the regret theme, and the final moment when "clouds shifted" to reveal the printing plant charges the closure image. Specificity is high: copper dome, rosewood, stone. Minor limiter: the observatory is more symbolic container than active obstacle; it doesn't prevent or force a specific tactic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is established early: "the journalist called... at eleven that morning" and "Meet me where he used to go." Marguerite arrives, reads logbooks, and Crane joins her—all within one continuous scene window. Setup is clear, development is present (the reading and Crane's arrival structure the sequence), and payoff occurs (her decision will affect "tomorrow's edition"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with urgency; no countdown or deadline pressure is felt on the page. The "after the call" frame is functional but replaceable with "after discovering the documents" or another inciting trigger. Swappability and lack of pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" drives Marguerite's climb to the observatory and her reading of the logbooks. Setup: Crane's call promises "documents" about her father's real cause of death. Development: she discovers suppressed stories and the Whitfield connection through logbook entries. Payoff: her decision to publish hidden truths (both corruption and regret) completes the motivation. Friction is present: the truths implicate her mother's family and her father's legacy, creating cost. However, the motivation is somewhat generic (truth-seeking journalist/heiress) and could map onto similar premise stories. The specific constellation (family vs. publication integrity) elevates it but does not make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is demonstrated in Marguerite's self-description: "the art of smiling while your heart was being dissected." Setup is present (opening establishes the cathedral-like, abandoned-god observatory tone), development shows the blend (her wry "I'm devotedly observant" during a painful reveal), and payoff maintains it (clouds as "white sea," final image both grave and lyric). The tone modulates with pressure: more solemn during logbook reading, playful edge in dialogue with Crane. However, the tone is more consistent texture than dynamic pressure tool, and the explicit labeling ("solemn playfulness") in dialogue feels slightly self-aware. The final image is more solemn than playful, so modulation is present but not perfectly balanced at closure.</comment>
