<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable's interior is specific and embodied—monitoring noise through her copper receiver, calibrating by listening, reading the storm glass against passenger emotion. Her choices show consistent methodology: dimming light, adjusting speed, humming to match the terrace frequency. However, the passengers remain mostly symbolic receptacles; the woman, boy, and old man have no contradictory impulses or agency of their own. Sable's transformation from observer to participant in silence's lesson is clear but arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Sable, the terrace, morning routine). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the crossing as Sable layers adjustments (light, speed, hum) until the storm glass clears and passengers shift. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Sable herself receives the teaching she has been giving—but the cost remains oblique; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The return crossing alone provides symmetry and cadence shift but lacks the undeniable price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is specific, vivid, and non-generic: crystalline towers, refracted light as slow rainbows, cables threading spectral haze. The storm glass vial and copper receiver function as micro-setting tools that constrain Sable's method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she parses hum for discordance, watches dendrites dissolve. The violet curtain in the gondola charges the silence moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the crossing from platform to far tower.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear: Sable must shepherd emotionally turbulent passengers across the terrace toward comfort. The roiling storm glass signals the problem; her adjustments (dimming, slowing, humming) cohere as escalation under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vial begins to clear and passengers respond. However, Sable faces no reversal or trade-off; her method works without friction. The cost—if any—is that she learns from her own practice, but this lands as epiphany rather than forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as presence, transformation through passage, comfort catalyzed rather than imposed. The storm glass and prism light function as concrete anchors rather than abstract symbols. The final image—Sable alone on the return, vial clear, "silence finally teaching her what it had always known"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. Slight penalty: "silence teaching her" edges toward personification that declares theme rather than letting the scene embody it, and the woman's letter "rearranging" its words is a touch too convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Sable; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and controlled: "silver nerves carrying thought," "tooth-aching whine," "vaulting hush." Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices frequencies, noise levels, light angles. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("fluidly logical," "catalyzed, coaxed from the interaction") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-grounded. The passengers have no dialogue, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Psychic distance is stable; no filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, method, or passenger state. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "blade through silk," "color of early dusk," "hand offered in the dark." Two minor slips: "fluidly logical" is abstract scaffolding rather than embodied perception, and "Her method was fluidly logical, a chain of small adjustments" feels like exposition inserted for the reader. No loops or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—gondola operator as emotional alchemist using light and sound—is fresh and specific. The storm glass predicting emotional turbulence rather than weather is a neat inversion. Execution avoids most tropes; Sable is competent without being flawless. However, the core pattern (troubled passengers board, guide adjusts conditions, passengers exit transformed) follows a familiar service-provider-as-healer template. The woman's letter rearranging its words and the old man finding "the person he had been searching for in the light" edge toward symbolic convenience rather than earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sable is present throughout and her choices (calibrating equipment, dimming lamp, slowing speed, humming) create the key turn when passengers respond and the vial clears. Her decision to begin humming at the exact frequency is the pivot. She appears in the closure as recipient rather than agent, which limits top-band access, but her method drives all beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in three distinct beats: Sable lifts it at the platform and sees roiling fog (setup/complication), she watches it begin to clear mid-crossing (turn), and it is "perfectly clear" on the return (closure participation). Its state change tracks and enables the emotional arc. The vial's properties (dendrites predicting emotional turbulence) are specific and irreplaceable. It charges the final image by confirming the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"In transit" is not mere theme but structural armature: the story occurs entirely during a crossing, and transformation happens "not by arrival but by the passage itself" (on-page articulation). The gondola's movement through prism light enables Sable's method. The return crossing alone—still in transit—delivers the closure when Sable herself becomes the learner. Stakes depend on the crossing; static platform scenes would break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is stated once in exposition ("Her method was fluidly logical, a chain of small adjustments building toward a single effect") but never dramatized as a constraint or tradeoff. Sable's adjustments proceed smoothly without friction; the trait does not block or enable a choice under pressure. It functions as a label rather than a lived attribute with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears on-page: "Comfort had to be catalyzed, coaxed from the interaction between stillness and the willingness to receive it." Sable's humming—matching terrace frequency—is the catalyzing action that triggers passenger response and vial clearing. The verb shapes the middle turn. However, "teach" or "guide" could replace it with minor edits; the chemical/transformative connotation enriches but is not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is signaled early (paragraph 2: "Each morning she calibrated her equipment...by monitoring noise levels") and used throughout. Sable parses ambient hum for discordance, notes the train whistle's tear, monitors passengers' breathing and headphone leak, and matches her hum to the terrace frequency. The method enables her adjustments and tracks escalation. It appears in the closure reference to "vaulting hush." Mechanics are specific (copper receiver, frequency tuning) and shape her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is established in paragraph 1 and supplies the mechanism for transformation: refracted light enters the gondola, pulses with Sable's hum, and creates the violet curtain moment. Its "wandering pace" dictates her speed adjustment. The terrace's noise levels are the variable she monitors. It charges the final image ("terrace drifting in its vaulting hush"). The setting is not mere backdrop; light refraction and suspended drift enable the central method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is beautifully rendered ("the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo, when the world seems to inhale") and anchors the opening. However, it does not constrain decisions or recur under pressure. The crossing duration is unspecified; no clock tightens tactics. The phrase functions as lyric coloring rather than a structural element that alters choices. Late penalty applies (introduced paragraph 3, not in closure).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is stated on-page (paragraph 6) and dramatized through her sequence of adjustments. It drives every choice: dimming light, slowing speed, humming to marry terrace frequency. The roiling vial signals her task; the clearing vial confirms partial success. The closure reweights it—she becomes the learner—paying off the motivation with inversion and cost (her prior role as teacher is incomplete). Friction exists: "this could not be done by imposing quiet" shows her navigating the paradox.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" appears in paragraph 2 ("On quiet mornings the terrace drifted in a vaulting hush") and returns in the final sentence ("the terrace drifting in its vaulting hush"). The tone is consistent—elevated, reverent, spacious—and modulates with the noisy morning vs. achieved silence. It charges the closure by bookending with the sought state finally attained. However, it remains largely atmospheric; a shift to more urgent diction during peak passenger distress would have tested and deepened its necessity.</comment>
