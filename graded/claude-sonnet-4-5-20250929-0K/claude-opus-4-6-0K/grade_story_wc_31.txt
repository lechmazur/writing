<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's interiority is well-embodied ("hide behind truth the way other people hid behind lies") and his motivation—finding the color of sound—drives every choice from descending the ladder to pressing the key tag between pages. The synesthesia trait is shown through Margery's notebooks and the climactic moment when Eamon "could almost hear the color," delivering a concrete, earned realization. Minor: the emotional progression in the final beat ("wept in a color he could finally name") leans slightly toward epiphany declaration rather than pure embodiment, but the prior particulars earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Eamon, pier, solstice night) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lantern light accumulates meaning from wedding vows through Margery's synesthesia to the drowned library's spectral charts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) when Eamon presses the key tag into the book—circuit closed, vow kept, with the cost of grief made palpable. The causality is clean: low tide permits descent, lanterns provide the chromatic moment, the book's discovery completes the promised search. Cost is visible in "wept in a color he could finally name."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken Celestine's library constrains the search (accessible only at low tide), and the sky lanterns charge the closure by casting shifting amber/rose bands that enable Eamon's synesthetic breakthrough ("the light they cast seemed to hum"). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "brine stains and barnacle lace," "the deep amber of a sustained cello note." The micro-setting (porthole framing lantern glow) functions as the conceptual hinge, making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill the luminous vow to find the color of sound—is signaled early and tightens when Eamon descends into the ship, constrained by tide and his own methodical wandering. The pressure is accumulative rather than conflictual, but the tightening moment (lantern light through the porthole dissolving the boundary between sound and color) is causally prepared and agency-driven: he chose to descend, to search, to stop and perceive. Cost is legible in the grief that accompanies fulfillment ("wept").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—luminous vows and synesthetic truth—emerges from concrete images (lantern light, brass tag, hand-drawn spectral charts) without thesis statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the boundary Margery described dissolves on the page through accumulated light, closing the circuit between promise and proof. Subtext operates in "hide behind truth" and "permanent dusk," and the ending reweights all prior brightness without moralizing. No thematic echo or forced symbolism; particulars carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Eamon filters experience through light and quietude ("permanent dusk," "words themselves had been a kind of burning"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure—long, reflective sentences in memory, shorter when he enters the ship, rhythmic compression at the climax ("stopped breathing because he understood suddenly"). Free indirect style is clean, and the synesthetic vocabulary ("burnt orange," "silver-violet") reads as Margery's lexicon absorbed into his internal voice without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or closure. Sentence rhythm varies effectively (long opening, compressed climax, lyric final line). Minor artifact: "the way Margery always said it did" and "the way other people hid behind lies" repeat the stem "the way" within close proximity, and "luminous" recurs four times (vows, promises, luminous proof, circuit). No loops or paraphrase redundancy; clarity and propulsion are strong. The figurative language ("jaw unwilling to finish its sentence") is fresh but slightly dense in the opening without immediate payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, vow-keeping, and a drowned library is specific and purposeful, avoiding template grief-quest tropes. The lamplighter's occupation and "hide behind truth" trait deepen the premise beyond surface novelty. The turn—perceiving color as sound through lantern light—feels earned in hindsight. Minor: the synesthesia concept and sky-lantern timing converge with near-perfect convenience, edging toward thematic wish-fulfillment rather than harder friction. Still, the emotional specificity and committed vision lift the piece above derivative execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's occupation frames the opening and his late-shift preference ("permanent dusk") is tied to his grief and need for solitude. His choice to descend the ladder and his purposeful wandering through the library are key decisions that drive the search. The lamplighter role also enables the vow spoken "into the lamp flame," linking profession to closure. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skeleton key tag appears first as a memory anchor (Margery's nightstand, wedding hotel), then is physically handled when Eamon reaches into his coat, and finally pressed between the book's pages to "signify that the vow was kept." Three beats, with the final use charged by accumulated meaning and completing the closure circuit. The tag's tarnish and inscription carry specificity; its transformation from keepsake to closure marker is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" is introduced early (wedding "promises so tangled with brightness"), reappears in the pier vow ("speaking into the lamp flame the way he had spoken into the lantern glow"), and structures the ending ("luminous promise meeting luminous proof"). The concept shapes Eamon's goal and the metaphoric language throughout, charging the final image when light fulfills the vow. Not merely thematic echo; it constrains his search and defines success.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is stated outright in paragraph two ("he could hide behind truth the way other people hid behind lies") and functions as character insight, but it does not visibly constrain an on-page choice with cost. The trait informs his reticence (prefers silence, conceals grief), but no beat dramatizes a trade-off where truth-hiding alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present and thematically consistent, but not causally active in a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Signify" anchors the closure beat: Eamon presses the key tag between the book's pages "to signify that the vow was kept, that the circuit was closed." This act is the story's decisive gesture, transforming search into fulfillment and charging the final image. The verb is irreplaceable—its ceremonial weight matches the luminous-vow premise and completes the accumulative arc. Setup (vow made), development (search), payoff (signification on the page).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is introduced when Eamon moves through the library ("the way Margery used to browse, letting instinct guide his path while his eyes remained sharp") and directly enables the discovery: his hand finds the slim volume wedged between atlases. The method is Margery's, adopted by Eamon, and its mechanics—instinct plus attention—matter to the search. Present in development and payoff; causally relevant but not heavily constrained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the Celestine is essential: it houses the treatise Margery read as a girl, accessible only at low tide, and provides the porthole through which lantern light enters to trigger Eamon's synesthetic moment. The setting is introduced via backstory (Margery's memory), then entered on the page with sensory detail ("warped shelves and swollen spines"), and charges the closure by framing the chromatic breakthrough. Indispensable to plot and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sky lantern release is present from the opening ("Tonight the town was releasing sky lanterns"), visible during Eamon's descent ("Already the first paper shells were lifting"), and provides the chromatic catalyst at the climax ("the lanterns were now a river of light… painting the book spines gold, then rose, then the deep amber of a sustained cello note"). The timeframe tightens Eamon's window (low tide, solstice night) and directly enables the synesthetic moment. Setup, development, and payoff with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover the color of sound"—is introduced through Margery's lifelong search and Eamon's vow ("he promised he would find the color of sound"), drives his descent into the ship, and is fulfilled when he perceives lantern light as humming color. The desire is dramatized through physical action (climbing down, searching, stopping to perceive) and carries the cost of grief. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early ("a silence like the hush after a meteor splits the dark") and sustained through "the harbor held its breath" at closure. The tone—quiet, awestruck, accumulative—coheres across turns and modulates with pressure (reflective opening, purposeful descent, breathless climax). It charges the final image ("wept in a color he could finally name") without breaking into sentimentality. The metaphor recurs with reweighted meaning, fitting the luminous-vow premise.</comment>
