<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is concrete and drives her nightly ritual with visible micro-choices (using tweezers, separating threads). Her embodied emotion appears in moments like "fingers trembled" and the cool metal against her palm, avoiding therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—her "blithe" public persona versus solitary archive work—though the piece leans more toward consistency than simultaneous opposing impulses in a single beat. The final choice to take evidence to the archivist is earned by prior causality but lacks a felt cost on the page that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through the tapestry decoding and builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding Celia was silenced, decision to honor her testimony). Cost is conceptual—Marguerite will expose the parish council's crimes—but the final image of "carrying the uncharted echoes home" diffuses rather than sharpens the stakes. The closure reweights prior material but the decision to visit the archivist "tomorrow" defers the price, weakening on-page cost legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: open roof frames stars, cold metal wall, rusted nail holding the tapestry. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven (starlight pooling, velveteen gloom, dust on coat). The tapestry itself becomes setting-as-object, its frayed threads shaping Marguerite's nightly ritual. The cemetery and silo are distinct and specific to her occupation and motivation, and the final image of stepping "out into the night" uses spatial movement to charge the closure without postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: decode Celia's testimony and discover what happened. The tightening occurs when Marguerite reads "They will bury my testimony with me if I do not bury it first" and understands Celia was silenced. One meaningful pressure point exists, and the protagonist's agency (deciding to take evidence to the archivist) drives the resolution. However, the decision is announced for "tomorrow" rather than enacted on the page, and no live option is visibly foreclosed with immediate cost—she simply continues her plan without sacrifice or trade-off in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: precision as respect for the dead, making "something gentle grow in a place shaped by loss." The tapestry as hidden ledger and Celia's erasure explore testimony, silencing, and the architecture of harm without direct statement. The final image of humming the children's song "rising through the cobalt dark" offers a resonant answer—care persists despite loss—without moralizing. "Uncharted echoes" as a recurring phrase charges the concept but borders on thematic labeling; the piece mostly earns its wisdom through Marguerite's patient decoding and her choice to restore Celia's name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: Marguerite notices "velveteen gloom," thinks of messages as "uncharted echoes," and filters setting through her cemetery-gardener lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("blithe," "reliquary," "pastoral calm"). Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively between long descriptive passages and shorter declarative beats ("She set down the tweezers"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Register remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage weaken the voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong information density: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally (compare the opening's long periodic sentence to "She stood, brushed the dust from her coat, and stepped out"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Minor overwriting in the opening paragraph ("its final tick swallowed by the silence") and one decorative phrase ("ancient, indifferent witnesses") slightly elevate register but do not obscure causality. The piece avoids scaffold sentences and maintains high textural specificity throughout, with no prose artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardener decoding a textile map is specific and non-obvious, combining archival mystery with embodied ritual (chess clock, tweezers, color-coded threads). The premise transforms the "hidden document" trope through the tapestry's frayed-thread cipher and Marguerite's patient nightly method. Her motivation—"discover the shape of intentions" rather than revenge—offers a fresh moral calculus. The chess-clock ritual and velveteen gloom create distinct texture. However, the "silenced woman's hidden testimony" core follows a recognizable template, and the piece does not take structural risks that heighten stakes beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marguerite (blithe cemetery gardener) is present throughout and her occupation frames the story. Her "easy laughter among headstones" contrasts with solitary archive work (setup). She makes the key decision to take evidence to the archivist (closure participation). However, her "blithe" public persona is described rather than shown through a choice that costs her; the attribute shapes context but does not constrain a middle beat with visible trade-off. Two gates present, purposeful reprise, but middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in paragraph two (early setup), is opened and described ("tenderly organized inside"), and Marguerite places tweezers back inside at the closure beat. It holds Celia's relics and will accompany the tapestry to the archivist, directly shaping the ending. Three beats across the arc. The case functions as reliquary and evidence container with specific contents (five sovereigns, brass key, lock of hair, photograph) that tie to decoded names and sums. Strong causal role and closure linkage, though the middle beat is largely static description.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is named in paragraph four and used as a frame for Celia's woven messages. It appears again in the final line ("carrying the uncharted echoes home"), creating a purposeful early-to-final reprise that reweights the stake. However, the concept is more thematic label than on-page force; it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. The phrase enriches meaning but remains somewhat ornamental. Two gates (setup, closure), lyric resonance, but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes the sovereign case's interior in paragraph two. The trait signals Marguerite's care and respect, aligning with her motivation to honor the dead with precision. It appears once as a descriptor and is reflected in her patient method (using tweezers, magnifying glass). The attribute enables her approach but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost; it characterizes rather than complicates. Setup and thematic coherence present, but no middle friction or closure cost tied directly to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled early (paragraph four: "untangle thread from thread") and enacted on the page tonight in the northeastern corner beat. The action drives the key turn: untangling reveals "They will bury my testimony..." and Marguerite understands Celia was silenced. The method is specific, repeated across nights, and shapes the closure decision to take evidence forward. Three gates, causal pressure, closure linkage. The action is not easily swappable; the patient, tactile method defines Marguerite's ritual and the story's texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—decoding frayed threads using color-coded letters—is introduced in paragraph four and demonstrated in paragraph five with concrete mechanics (rust=R, indigo=I, gold=G). It drives the middle beat where Marguerite decodes the key sentence and shapes her nightly ritual throughout. The method is specific and not swappable; the tapestry's frayed border and color cipher are unique to this story. Three gates, strong causal role, but the method is more process than complication—it enables discovery without resisting her or imposing cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is anchored in the opening line and used throughout: open roof frames stars providing light, curved metal wall, rusted nail holds tapestry, velveteen gloom. Marguerite returns here nightly after the cemetery closes, making it her workspace for decoding. The silo shapes the mood and ritual but does not constrain a choice with cost; it is stage rather than obstacle. Three gates (setup, middle, closure beat where she steps out), strong atmospheric charge, but the setting enables more than it pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The chess clock running down at "eleven minutes past midnight" is a ritual marker Marguerite uses to transition from day obligations to night work. It appears in the opening and is mentioned once more as a boundary device. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Marguerite works at her own pace without a deadline pressing her. Setup and thematic function present, but the clock is atmospheric rather than a live constraint that alters tactics or escalates pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the shape of intentions" is articulated in paragraph six and demonstrated through Marguerite's patient decoding, her refusal of revenge, and her choice to restore Celia's name with precision. It drives her nightly ritual and the decision to take evidence to the archivist. The desire is specific, non-obvious (precision as respect vs. vengeance), and shapes the ending. Three gates, strong causal role. Minor friction: the motivation is briefly told ("Marguerite's motivation had never been revenge") rather than fully dramatized through a competing temptation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears twice: paragraph six ("velveteen gloom of the silo pressed close, soft and suffocating") and is evoked in the opening's "cobalt silo" and closing's "cobalt dark." The tone is consistent—intimate darkness, gentle pressure—and modulates subtly as Marguerite moves from discovery to resolve. It charges the final image where her humming rises "through the cobalt dark." Three gates, coherent across turns, tone as texture rather than static mood. The specific phrase is used sparingly but the tonal register holds throughout.</comment>
