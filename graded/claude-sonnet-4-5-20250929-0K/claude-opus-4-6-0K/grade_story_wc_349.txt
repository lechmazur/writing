<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific ("catastrophic" spiral attachment, measuring absence through groove-incision), but the customer's request is summarized rather than shown in scene, creating a mild passivity. The motivation—finding the place where stories begin through quantifying absence—is conceptually rich and genuinely constrains her parole-bound life. The final beat lands with embodied tension (stylus ready, "one void closer"), forecloses paths with cost, and earns the endurance stance. No therapy-speak or hedging; the spiral observation reads as character-particular field-work rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: depth of absence accumulates via the journal; the spiral notation crystallizes as a pattern-break that charges the final image. Orientation is prompt and vivid by line ~80. One meaningful deepening occurs when the catastrophic-spiral entry reweights Maren's own "removed pieces" and brings the map "closer." The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren waits to cut another absence, accepting the cost that her freedom feeds on what she cannot remember. Cost is visible in "freedom was borrowed light" and the glimmering parole premise. The lens holds without contradiction; the final sentence loops back to the opening lull and turns waiting into method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is established early and thoroughly (transparent walls, crystal trees, books-as-fruit, prismatic light calibrated per shelf). The bottled moonlight functions as micro-setting/tool: Maren adjusts them, fills grooves, and uses one to illuminate the spiral notation on the page. The swirling cloud sea beneath is mirrored in the spiral shape, creating a charged final comparison ("a void with motion"). Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail serves pressure (pale luminescence in grooves, obsidian warming). The parole-wrist-band integrates setting with stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early: find the origin-point of narrative by mapping the absences left by memory erasures. Maren's method (quantifying void-shapes in the journal) creates a tightly braided pair—helping others forget while accumulating data toward her own answer. One meaningful tightening: the spiral notation deepens the map, bringing her "one void closer," and the lull becomes a charged moment of readiness. Agency is attention and endurance with visible opportunity cost (she remains bound, waits rather than acts). The choice to log the catastrophic-spiral voice raises the conceptual cost: she is made of removed pieces, paroled into removing pieces from others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—the human need to narrate and the equally human need to forget—emerges concretely from the clean-slate transactions, the journal of negative space, and Maren's own wiped slate. The story resists moralizing; the ending offers no thesis, only the resonant spiral image that "looked like the swirling clouds beneath"—a void with motion. The parole premise avoids allegory by embedding the conceptual cost physically (glimmering wrist-band, borrowed light). The spiral as rare and load-bearing detail invites reflection on catastrophic attachment. No prompt-echo or thematic summary; the final "one void closer" is a reweighting, not a declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is single, stable third-limited; distance is consistent and apt. Perceptual signature is clean: Maren notices lacuna dimensions, obsidian warmth, light refractions—all filtered through her vendor/archivist lens. Diction is controlled and lyric without slipping into academic register ("drinking a person's past," "load-bearing memory"). No head-hopping or elision that withholds facts she knows. Sentence rhythm modulates well (long exposition → shorter final beats). One minor register bump: "mindfully scattered, the architect had insisted" reads as slightly externalized detail that Maren would not voice that way mid-thought, but it does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clarity and density are strong; the prose is vivid and specific ("a silence that hummed at a particular frequency"). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. One scaffold artifact: "That was what this place was. That was what she was—" uses parallel anaphora for effect, borderline acceptable but risks over-articulation. The line "she could walk free as long as she served" is clear telling that compresses efficiently. The ending propels without clutter. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (spiral, void with motion). Deduct lightly for the "That was" repetition touching a thematic beat without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis is non-obvious: mapping narrative origins by quantifying the negative space of erasures, filtered through a glimmering-parole vendor who herself was wiped. The glass orchard library floating on clouds is specific and fresh. The piece avoids tourist description and integrates world-logic (prismatic calibration, cloud-surface moonlight) purposefully. The spiral as "load-bearing memory" and "catastrophic attachment" is a precise, earned detail. The transformation test passes: change the names and setting, and the emotional arc loses its architecture. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (clean slate vendor) is present throughout and her role shapes the dominant stake: she helps one customer forget, logs the void, and prepares to "cut another absence." She makes the micro-choice to record the spiral notation and interpret its rarity. The ending beat ("stylus ready") reaffirms her agency. Setup present, middle development weak (the customer transaction is summarized), closure participation strong. Two gates met; development is thin but present. The spiral entry forecloses nothing tactically but charges the map, justifying mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears twice: adjusted on the counter (early setup) and held to the page to fill incised grooves with pale luminescence (middle beat). The second use is purposeful—illuminating the spiral notation—but the bottles do not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure. Setup and development gates met; closure gate missed. The object is functional but not indispensable; another light source would serve. Mid-band, capped by missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Glimmering parole frames the entire stakes architecture: Maren's freedom is conditional, etched into her wrist-band, and "literally shimmered." The concept shapes tactics (she must serve, must help others forget) and drives her search for the origin-point. It reappears at closure ("her parole glimmered precisely because it fed on what she could not remember"), linking her method to her constraint. Setup, development, and closure gates all met; causal pressure is strong. The concept is irreplaceable and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears once as a description of the prismatic light patterns, attributed to the architect's intention. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action; Maren does not use the scattering to guide movement or choice. Label-only mention without dramatization. Setup gate met weakly, development and closure gates missed. Ornamental use; easily swappable with "purposefully arranged."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Incise" is the method by which Maren records void-dimensions in her journal: cutting grooves with a metal stylus that she can "read in the dark." The action is signaled early, executed on-page in the middle beat (recording the spiral), and invoked at closure ("prepared to cut another absence into the page"). All three gates met. The incising is specific and irreplaceable; it ties to her tactile archival method and charges the final readiness. Two beats of involvement, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Maren's method—quantifying absence by measuring the "shape of the hole left behind"—is signaled early and executed on-page when she logs the spiral ("one voice, female…catastrophic…spiral"). The method enables her search for the origin-point and is invoked at closure ("one void closer to the source"). Setup, development, and closure gates all met. The mechanics are specific (seven-syllable lacuna, spiral frequency) and shape her attempts. The method is indispensable to the premise but does not constrain a choice with visible cost in this scene; it accumulates rather than narrows options. Solid integration, mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating on clouds is established thoroughly and early. It provides the chamber where Maren's shop operates, but the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The "prismatic scatterings" are observed twice but remain postcard description. The cloud-sea is mirrored thematically in the spiral notation but this is comparison, not constraint. Setup and closure gates met via the final image comparison; development gate weak. Lyric reprise lifts the score slightly but the setting remains largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe (lull on opening day, one hour after the first customer) is signaled early and frames the reflective mode. The lull recurs at closure ("The lull continued"), creating a bracket. However, the time constraint does not tighten tactics or force a decision; it simply permits Maren's reflection. Setup and closure gates met; development gate missed. The timeframe is consistent and legible but replaceable (any quiet moment would serve). Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to find the place where stories begin—is signaled early, dramatized through her journal-keeping and the spiral entry, and invoked at closure ("bring herself one void closer to the source"). All three gates met. The desire is specific and drives her method of quantifying absence. Friction exists: her search depends on accumulating others' losses, and her own slate was wiped. Cost is conceptual (she remains paroled, feeding on what she cannot remember). Two beats of involvement, closure linkage strong, cost visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone—integrated fragmentation—is coherent and present: "a woman made of removed pieces," "a fragmented cartography," "debris" searched for "the first shard." The lull creates a contemplative register that holds through the story. Modulation is gentle (exposition → spiral observation → charged final readiness). The tone charges the final image by pairing stillness with accumulation ("prepared to cut another absence"). Setup, development, and closure gates all met. The tone is apt and supports the accumulative lens, but it does not shift under pressure; it remains static. Mid-6s.</comment>
