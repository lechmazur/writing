<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lenne's motivation is embodied through tactile handling of the diary and goggles, and her "warmly inquisitive nature" drives concrete choices (lifting goggles to eyes, reading during ascent). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between grief-frozen and joy-excavating impulses, anchored by the mother's encryption method. The final choice—to step forward carrying joy "like a lantern"—feels earned by the diary's revelations, though the decision to continue upward rather than pursue the vanishing lacks on-page friction or visible cost beyond acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (elevator, spire, servant ascending) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through cipher-reveal mechanics and diary entries that reweight the premise of her mother's death. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lenne's calm expression "carrying her mother's joy" reconfigures the recorded suicide into a purposeful vanishing and trail. The cost is conceptual (accepting her mother left rather than died) and felt (the weight of continuing an incomplete search), legible in the "lantern in the permafrost dark" image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spire's ice-and-light physics constrain the diary's readability ("only here… at precise angles"), directly enabling the narrative's central discovery. Floor-by-floor ascent provides spatial rhythm and the goggles function as micro-setting tools that alter what Lenne can know. The final corridor of "pure ice and light" charges the ending image, though the ninth-floor study where she found the objects receives only brief retrospective mention without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understanding her mother's fate versus accepting the official record. The tightening occurs in the elevator as the goggles unlock cipher text, narrowing Lenne's emotional options from grief-frozen to joy-carrying. The final entry's revelation—"I am leaving this here for her"—deepens the stake by converting maternal suicide into a purposeful breadcrumb trail. Cost is felt in Lenne's decision to continue upward into an incomplete search rather than demand immediate answers, though no on-page antagonist or material trade-off tests her resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the diary's particulars: "joy does not cancel the pain… stubborn as roots in frozen ground." The goggles and scattered light function as earned metaphor, not ornament—only through precise refraction does hidden meaning appear. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: Lenne carries warmth through permafrost by reinterpreting her mother's departure as invitation rather than abandonment, avoiding the "explain-everything" trap while honoring complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is selective (steam condensing into ceiling ice, spectral light "like living things"). Diction stays character-apt ("warmly inquisitive nature" reads slightly elevated but coheres with the narrator's controlled tone). The closing phrase "enormous and specific warmth" modulates distance purposefully to charge the ending. No dialogue appears; interior access is consistent and the prose rhythm supports the ascent's measured pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high (goggles unlock cipher through spire's ice-refracted light), and propulsion stays clean through the ten-floor climb. Minor scaffold appears in "she understood" twice in the final third, and "the way" recurs as sentence stem ("the way her small fist closed," "the way clouds looked," "the way one might dig"). One paraphrase loop: the penultimate paragraph states "her mother had not thrown herself from the terrace" then immediately explains "She had hidden this and then vanished," restating the same revelation. These lower mid-band ceiling slightly but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary-readable-only-via-light-refraction premise offers a fresh synthesis of setting and object, and the emotional core—joy excavated beneath anguish rather than canceling it—resists binary grief templates. The spire's ice physics and the goggles' prismatic function interlock with narrative necessity. Risk is present in the quiet, non-confrontational closure and the mother's ambiguous fate, though the servant-ascends-to-discover-truth frame follows familiar mystery-inheritance contours without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lenne's servant role signals early (lower kitchens, reassignment) and her decision to read the diary during ascent drives the central revelation. The final choice to step forward "carrying her mother's joy" narrows her path with cost (accepting incompleteness, continuing the search). Her ascending through the spire's hierarchy over eleven years provides structural backbone and causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Goggles appear in the opening bundle, are handled and examined mid-climb ("turned over in her hands"), then lifted to eyes to unlock the cipher—three distinct beats. Their prismatic lenses are mechanically necessary (diary unreadable without them) and irreplaceable. They fold into Lenne's apron in the final paragraph, a charged physical gesture that ties them to her ongoing search and mother's legacy.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The encrypted diary shapes every beat: its discovery behind the wall seeds the story, its cipher drives Lenne's action in the elevator, and its final entry ("leaving this here for her") delivers the closure revelation. The encryption method (readable only via spire light and goggles) integrates setting, object, and stake. Removing it collapses plot logic and thematic core entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is labeled once early ("would not let a locked thing stay locked") and drives her choice to lift the goggles and read mid-climb despite risk. The trait enables the cipher discovery but lacks visible on-page cost or a moment where curiosity conflicts with caution. It functions as stable motivation rather than a contested attribute under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unfold" structures the entire narrative: cipher unfolds through goggles, entries unfold her mother's mindset, and the final revelation unfolds the recorded suicide into purposeful trail. The word itself appears once ("unfolded only in the place") but the action recurs mechanically (opening diary, lifting goggles, passages "reorganizing") and conceptually (emotional revelation). The climax depends on unfolding hidden text; swapping the verb would require rewriting core mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Scattered light mechanics are signaled early (sun angling across ice, spectra sliding through the elevator) and directly enable the cipher solution: "Through the lenses, the scattered light… refracted again, and the cipher… shifted." The method is irreplaceable—without precise ice-refraction physics, the diary stays locked. It constrains both how and where discovery occurs, shaping the elevator timeframe and spire setting as necessary conditions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire provides more than backdrop: its ice physics make the diary readable, floor-by-floor ascent structures escalation, and the upper terrace carries thematic weight (site of supposed suicide, now reinterpreted). The frozen environment mirrors emotional states (grief "frozen solid") then shifts meaning. The tenth-floor corridor of "pure ice and light" charges the ending. Removing the spire setting collapses cipher mechanics and symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb provides visible structure: each floor marker ("fourth floor," "sixth," "eighth," "ninth," "tenth") tightens temporal and spatial rhythm. The ascent creates urgency (limited reading time) and the final stop at ten delivers closure. The timeframe is tracked and dramatized rather than vague, shaping Lenne's decision to read immediately. A live clock that constrains tactics, though the cost of running out of time never materializes as threat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to seek out the joy beneath anguish"—is dramatized through Lenne's reading of her mother's entries cataloging small joys amid grief. The final entry's line "joy… lives underneath, stubborn as roots" articulates the stake explicitly, and Lenne's closing act (carrying joy "like a lantern") enacts it. The desire is coherent and shapes her acceptance of her mother's departure, though the text's directness ("I want Lenne to know this") nearly crosses into thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone balances warmth (mother's love, Lenne's tender handling) with cool distance (clinical spire details, "calm, even detached" expression). The narrator's register stays measured through emotional peaks ("enormous and specific warmth" modulates without breaking). Diction like "excavating beneath" and "permafrost dark" sustains the controlled temperature. The tone charges the final image—Lenne's outward calm holding inward fire—and coheres across all beats without flattening under pressure.</comment>
