<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is characterized through micro-choices (examining the sextant, sketching beyond assignment scope) and her "functionally creative" trait manifests in concrete action—she cannot look at a broken system without reconfiguring it. Internal contradiction is present: she knows proposals die in committee yet builds one anyway, driven by the sextant's reminder that foolish assumptions were built before. The cost is oblique but legible: she carries "angles between what was fixed and what was possible," a stance that forecloses comfortable passivity. Minor slip: the trait feels slightly label-adjacent ("her professors noted it") rather than fully dramatized through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Maren saves the file, names it "Gate 11," and walks out carrying "angles between what was fixed and what was possible"—a crystallization of stance with conceptual cost (she has committed to an unsanctioned vision that will likely fail institutionally). The piece accumulates density through layered images (carnival → survey → sextant → sketch → departure) and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from official survey to personal redesign. Cost is felt but slightly abstract; a sharper on-page price (e.g., missing a deadline, burning a bridge) would elevate further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the terminal's "maze of intentions" supplies both the problem and the solution architecture. Micro-setting details (geothermal vents, compromised roof, sub-level trenches) constrain and enable Maren's redesign choices on the page. The sextant discovery behind a collapsed panel is spatially coherent and charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (confetti in grout, cold bulbs, "atmospheric pressure" silence) and filtered through civil-engineer POV. The hexagonal hub, eastern wing, and Gate 11 recur with reweighted function, transforming from failed transit nodes to potential greenhouse cells and market floor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Maren find a viable resurrection path for the terminal? The stake is signaled early and tightens when she finishes the official survey but chooses to stay and sketch an unauthorized proposal. Agency is clear: her decision to "puzzle out new equations for hope" as engineering forecloses the safer path of filing the official report and leaving. The cost is conceptual and opportunity-based (institutional risk, time spent on likely-futile work) rather than a dramatic confrontation, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs; a second reversal or visible external obstacle would strengthen escalation further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: "to resurrect a place, you did not pour new concrete over old ghosts. You traced the flows already present—water, heat, light, memory—and you gave them somewhere meaningful to go." The sextant (a tool for finding position by fixed points) returns as brass weight "carrying angles between what was fixed and what was possible," reweighting the entire sketch without stating a moral. The "maze of intentions" motif recurs with shifted meaning: from flaw to asset. Subtext operates in the carnival's departure, the "enormous quiet of its own potential," and the label "Gate 11" (a personal claim against institutional erasure). Minor abstraction in "hope as engineering" phrase, but it is earned by prior scene work and remains rooted in hydraulic, thermal, electrical flows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, tightly bound to Maren's civil-engineer perception: "load-bearing walls," "geothermal vents," "junction boxes," "microclimates." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("she felt the silence like atmospheric pressure") to technical observation. Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads architecture as "a maze of intentions," sees "every revision betrayed a different theory." Diction matches expertise without register drift. No dialogue, so voice is carried entirely through narration. Minor density loss in one reflective passage ("She was not naive. She knew proposals died…") that slightly flattens momentum, but the reflection anchors in present action (holding the sextant, sketching) and tilts her stance toward commitment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and rhythmically varied. Information density is high: "the building had absorbed them all into its bones like a reef absorbs shipwrecks" does double work (setting detail + thematic charge). Figurative language is purposeful (sextant as "tool for finding position," flows as "blood through a body on life support") without overwriting. Minor template cadence in the middle section: "Rainwater still entered… geothermal vents… still pushed… Electrical conduits… still terminated" stacks parallel "still" constructions across three sentences, creating a brief drumbeat. The loop is functional (emphasizing dormant infrastructure) but slightly mechanical. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. No clarity breaks or major artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination of abandoned-spaceport-as-adaptive-reuse-site and civil-engineer-as-hopeful-sketcher offers a fresh synthesis. The sextant (celestial navigation tool in a grounded, earthbound ruin) is a non-obvious choice that charges the ending image. "Hope as engineering—quantities balanced, forces resolved, resources routed" transforms sentiment into technical practice. The piece resists the easy decay-porn ending and the too-tidy community-garden resolution by keeping Maren's proposal unsanctioned and likely doomed, yet built anyway. Minor proximity concern: the tone and imagery (failed transit hub, carnival memory, intern's vision) echo certain contemporary ruin-literature conventions without fully transforming them. The emotional truth and hydraulic specificity elevate it above template, but the conceptual territory is not entirely uncharted.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's curiosity drives the sextant discovery and her choice to sketch the unauthorized proposal. Her intern status matters: she has survey access but no institutional power, raising the conceptual cost of her final commitment. Her decisions (staying after the survey, naming the file "Gate 11") create the story's key turn from assessment to advocacy. Present across all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure participation) with causal pressure and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in two distinct beats: discovery behind the collapsed panel (mid-story) and final image ("brass weight against her ribs, carrying angles between what was fixed and what was possible"). Its function evolves from lost keepsake to thematic anchor. The object's specificity (index arm, star coordinates, precision manufacture, tool for measuring angles between celestial bodies and horizons) is irreplaceable and charges the closure image. Strong setup, middle discovery, and closure reprise with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is introduced early ("The terminal was a maze of intentions") and explicitly shapes Maren's redesign: "The maze of intentions that previous planners had carved into the building became, in her drawings, an asset rather than a flaw." The concept alters her tactics (she uses irregular corridors as microclimates, dead-end bays as greenhouse cells). Present in setup, middle transformation, and implicit in the ending (Gate 11 as one node in the maze now given purpose). Causal work is legible but slightly abstract; the concept tilts more toward theme than hard constraint on physical action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is defined on the page: "she could not look at a broken system without imagining how its existing pieces might be reconfigured into something that worked." The trait enables the core action (sketching the redesign) and incurs cost (professors note it "sometimes with concern"; she cannot leave after the official survey ends). Present in setup (professor comment), drives the middle action (sketching), and underlies the ending choice (saving the file, committing to the vision). The trait constrains her options (she is compelled rather than freely choosing) with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the story's spine: Maren understands "to resurrect a place, you did not pour new concrete over old ghosts. You traced the flows already present…and you gave them somewhere meaningful to go." The action is signaled early (her assignment is "adaptive reuse"), drives her middle choice (sketching the redesign), and defines the closure moment (saving "Gate 11" as an act of resurrection against institutional erasure). The verb is thematically and causally essential; swapping it would break the story's logic. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled early (rainwater, geothermal heat, electrical conduits "went to waste") and becomes the method: "rainwater captured and filtered for a hydroponic corridor…geothermal heat channeled to warm a community workshop…solar panels…feeding charging stations and grow lights." The mechanics matter on the page: her sketch routes existing infrastructure to new purposes. The method shapes her entire middle action and is implicit in the ending (the file contains this specific redesign approach). Present across all three gates with high specificity and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is indispensable. Its physical infrastructure (geothermal vents, compromised roof, sub-level trenches, hexagonal hub, eastern wing, Gate 11) supplies the exact resources and constraints for Maren's redesign. The setting's history (original designers' vision, budget cuts, failed retail spaces, carnival occupancy) embeds the "maze of intentions" that Maren transforms. Spatial choreography is precise and coherent. The setting pressures every choice and charges the final image (walking to her car through dusk, the spaceport "waiting to be read correctly"). Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's logic, stakes, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves" anchors the opening ("The carnival left on a Thursday, and by Friday morning…") and creates the silence that allows Maren's encounter with the terminal's potential. The timeframe provides immediate context and a mood shift (noise/color → quiet/potential) but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Time is tracked loosely (morning survey, afternoon finish, dusk departure) without pressing constraints. Present in setup and ending, but functions more as atmospheric framing than as a live clock altering tactics. Lyric resonance (carnival memory bookends the piece) but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized through concrete action: Maren sits on the concourse floor and sketches the redesign, defining hope as "engineering—quantities balanced, forces resolved, resources routed." The motivation is conflicted (she knows "proposals died in committee, that funding evaporated, that interns did not reshape municipalities") yet she builds it anyway, incurring conceptual and opportunity cost. The desire drives the middle action and the ending commitment (saving the file, naming it Gate 11). Friction between hope and futility is on the page with visible cost. Strong setup, middle enactment, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stoic wonder is coherent and consistent: the prose maintains measured distance ("she felt the silence like atmospheric pressure") while registering marvels (sextant precision, hexagonal hub geometry, "enormous quiet of its own potential"). Tone modulates with pressure: technical during survey, reflective during sextant discovery, purposeful during sketching, quietly resolved at departure. The ending crystallizes the tone—"carrying angles between what was fixed and what was possible"—balancing resignation (likely institutional failure) with wonder (the vision itself). Rhythm and diction sustain the tone without flattening into monotone or tipping into sentiment. The tone charges the final image and is indispensable to the piece's emotional architecture.</comment>
