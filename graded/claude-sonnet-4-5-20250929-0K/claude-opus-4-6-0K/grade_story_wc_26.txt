<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is concrete and specific ("the dusk noticer," her "luminous regret"), and her final choice to alter the archive emerges from consistent values—preservation versus purity—with visible cost ("the scholar in her grieved"). The decision to "re-bind the shadows" is motivated and constrains later action. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen: her grief over impurity is stated more than dramatized in micro-choices during the metamorphosis sequence. Embodied emotion is strong in selective moments ("held breath before diving") but occasionally drifts toward elegant summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the final image reweights "hope" from abstract theme to visible graft, and the cost (impurity, alteration of the record) is legible on the page. Orientation anchors (Maren, library, above clouds, post-Lumen Protocol) land cleanly within the first 15% and the piece teaches its lyric, mosaic structure early. Escalation operates through pattern-break: early dreams versus recent dreams, then Maren's decision to splice footage, charged by the single new bud and the river stone materialized. One meaningful deepening (understanding hope's architecture) tightens into one decisive act (pressing the stone, re-gathering the shadow) with visible cost. The closure unit—Oren's shadow re-bound, branch budding—lands on the page and reweights prior material; the conceptual cost (archive no longer pure) is undeniable in "she would accept impurity."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming library is vivid and layered—shelves as branches, petal-pages, mist overhead—and the setting recurs in the final beat when "the branch above her desk put out a single new bud," charging the closure image. The river stone materializes from the archive, establishing the setting's physics and enabling Maren's tool use at the end. Spatial choreography is clear (desk above clouds, reading glass, branch overhead) and sensory detail is selective (pollen, old paper, apricot light). The setting constrains Maren's method (she must work within the archive's structure) and supplies the resource (the stone) that enables her act, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Minor: some description leans toward catalog ("foxglove, larkspur, evening primrose") without immediate pressure integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the archive's vitality and hope's shape—is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: Maren discovers the shadow-loss pattern, understands it as hope unraveling, and decides to metamorphose the archive by splicing early footage into recent pages. The decision forecloses the path of archival purity with visible cost ("the scholar in her grieved"). Agency is decision-based, and the cost is legible. The piece avoids multiple reversals but delivers one meaningful pressure point that narrows options (accept impurity or let the archive wither) and a quiet but charged resolution (shadow re-gathers, branch buds). Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through density increase and pattern-break, meeting the high-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—hope as architecture, shadow as its shape—emerges organically from concrete images (river stone, unbound shadow, blooming shelves) without thesis statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: Maren's graft restores the faithful shadow and buds new growth, reweighting "impurity" as necessary sacrifice rather than corruption. Subtext operates in Maren's epithet ("dusk noticer") and the deliberate pacing of her final act. The motif (river stone, shadow, branch) recurs with escalating meaning and constrains the closure choice. Minor slip: "the shape hope takes when it anchors a person to their own future" verges on abstraction, though it remains anchored in the shadow image and Maren's perception. The final image—working "softly, deliberately, binding shadow to sleeper to hope"—resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Maren's perceptual signature: "the luminous regret of someone who sees the loss clearly enough to describe its beauty." Diction is elevated yet consistent, voice-motivated by Maren's archivist-gardener stance. No head-hopping. The prose modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the decision beat, lyric cadence in the final paragraph. Psychic distance is controlled; filter verbs ("She understood," "She decided") are deliberate and fit the reflective register. Minor: one stock phrase ("held breath before diving") and slight register drift in "metamorphose the archive" (a verb choice that reads more authorial than Maren's established idiom). No dialogue present. Perceptual bias is consistent (noticing light, dusk, thresholds).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance world, character, or stake. Sentence openings vary and figurative language is mostly coherent ("shelves growing like branches," "shadow…like smoke"). Two artifacts lower the score: mild overwriting in the opening (stacked metaphors: "bloomed," "growing like branches," "bursting," "pressed petals" within two sentences) and a paraphrase-loop near midpoint ("shadow was wrong. It had separated. It drifted…no longer answering") where three adjacent clauses restate the same observation without added pressure. Template cadence in one passage: "She pulled dream after dream, dreamer after dreamer, pressing…scrubbing…" reads slightly mechanical. Propulsion is strong in the decision and closure beats; clarity is maintained. No loops touch the closure unit. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), mild density excess (−0.3), and template stem (−0.4) yields net deduction of ~−0.9 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—dreams encoded as petal-pages, shadows as hope's architecture—is fresh and the blooming-library setting is vivid. The turning point (splicing early footage into recent pages to restore shadows) feels earned by prior setup and offers a non-obvious synthesis of archival ethics and metaphor. Emotional specificity (Maren as dusk-noticer, her "bright pang" of grief) avoids generic templates. Risk is present in the lyric register and the quiet, tool-mediated climax. Minor: the core image of "shadows unbound = hope lost" leans toward allegorical transparency, and the Lumen Protocol world-building, while intriguing, remains lightly sketched. Transformation test passes—plot and arc depend on the specific library, dream-sharing technology, and petal mechanics. No close echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's sharp observation drives the inciting discovery (shadow-loss pattern) and her dusk-noticing frames the ending image ("the dusk she always noticed was settling"). Her choices—to pull dream after dream, to decide on metamorphosis, to press the stone—create the key turn. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure participation). Causal pressure is clear: without her noticing, the problem remains invisible; her decision to act alters the archive's trajectory. Cost is visible (accepting impurity). Slight limiter: the trait "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" is more establishing flavor than a constraint that visibly trades off against another option during the climax.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>River stone appears in Oren's early dream (setup), materializes on Maren's desk as a turning point ("the archive did that sometimes"), and is pressed against the newest petal-page to restore the shadow (closure). Three distinct beats; irreplaceability is high—the stone's origin in Oren's faithful dream and its physical manifestation enable the splicing method. Causal pressure: Maren uses the stone as a tool to re-bind the shadow, and its presence charges the final image. Cost connection: the stone embodies the archive's early fidelity and the price of grafting. Closure linkage is strong. Only minor gap: the mechanics of why the stone enables the splice are implied rather than established.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Shadow unbound is present in setup (Oren's shadow "separated…drifted…untethered"), drives the dominant stake (understanding hope's architecture), and is reversed in the closure (shadow "re-gathered…finding the soles of his dreaming feet"). The concept shapes tactics: Maren's method is to restore the faithful shadow by splicing early footage. Cost is clear (accept impurity to restore binding). All three gates met; causal pressure high. Slight limiter: the concept is more thematic container than a mechanical constraint that Maren must work around—its reversal is declarative ("his shadow slowly re-gathered") rather than tested through obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Softly, deliberately" recurs as a rhythmic anchor in three moments: turning the stone, beginning the work, and the final line's cadence ("working softly, deliberately"). It constrains pacing—Maren does not rush—and the trait enables her methodical approach under pressure (grief over impurity, urgency of withering branches). Present in setup (turning the stone) and closure (final line). Tradeoff is implicit: deliberateness costs speed, and the archive continues to wither as she works one dream at a time. Moderate causal pressure; the trait is more voice signature than a choice-altering constraint at peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is signaled as Maren's decision ("She decided she would metamorphose the archive"), defines the major turn (from passive archivist to active grafter), and structures the ending action (pressing, splicing, binding). The action is irreplaceable—swapping to "repair" or "restore" would lose the cocoon metaphor and the acceptance of transformation-with-impurity that charges the thematic cost. Present in all three gates; causal pressure is high (the decision forecloses archival purity and enables the shadow-rebinding). Closure linkage is strong: the final image enacts the metamorphosis beat by beat. Cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is established early ("every petal-page…unspooled as silent video" and "comparing a dream donated in the protocol's first year to one donated last month") and drives the discovery of shadow-loss. The method recurs in the middle ("She pulled dream after dream…pressing the petals under glass, scrubbing silently through decades of footage") and is reversed at closure ("she could press the early footage back into the recent pages, splice the faithful shadows"). All three gates met. Causal pressure: the method shapes Maren's diagnostic process and her solution. Specificity is high—silent video matters (lack of sound emphasizes the visual shadow) and the comparison across decades is irreplaceable. Minor: the mechanics of reversing the reading-glass process are asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Blooming library above clouds is present throughout: shelves as branches, petal-pages, mist, the branch above Maren's desk that buds at closure. The setting supplies the resource (materialized river stone), pressures choice (withering branches signal urgency), and charges the final image (new bud, light "the color of ripe apricots," threshold dusk). All three gates met. The setting's physics (objects pressed free, dreams as petals) enable Maren's method. Causal pressure is moderate—the library frames stakes but does not block or complicate her action at the climax. Closure linkage is strong (branch buds, library blooms on). Slight limiter: the cloud-altitude and blooming metaphor are more atmospheric than mechanically constraining.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Eleven years since dreams became shareable" anchors the timeframe in setup and the "decades of footage" comparison establishes temporal span. The historical dimension (early dreams vs. recent) drives the discovery and solution. Present in setup and middle development; closure participation is oblique (the final evening's work begins the long project but does not resolve it on a tracked clock). Causal pressure is moderate: the timeframe enables the diagnostic method but does not tighten decisions in the ending beat. No live countdown or tactical urgency tied to hours or days. The element shapes context more than moment-to-moment choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is Maren's stated motivation and is dramatized through her choices: pulling dream after dream, understanding hope's architecture, grieving the cost of impurity, then acting to re-bind shadows. Present in all three gates (understanding the loss, decision to metamorphose, enacting the splice). Friction is clear: her desire to preserve the archive's nourishment conflicts with her scholarly commitment to purity, and she chooses preservation with visible cost ("the scholar in her grieved"). Causal pressure is high; the motivation drives the major turn and shapes the final image (binding shadow to hope). Closure linkage is strong. Only minor gap: the grief over impurity is asserted more than tested through a complicating obstacle during the splice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Luminous regret is coherent from the opening ("she loved the place…the way one loves something already beginning to disappear") through the decision beat ("a bright pang she held the way one holds breath before diving") to the ending ("the kind of dimming that precedes the stars"). The tone modulates under pressure—grief sharpens during the discovery, softens into resolve at closure—and charges the final image (working while the library blooms on "the world's thin, beautiful, darkening edge"). No tonal breaks. The regret is earned by prior causality (understanding the loss) and sustained without flatness. Rhythmic control is strong. Slight limiter: one phrase ("luminous regret of someone who sees the loss clearly enough to describe its beauty") edges toward self-conscious elegance, though it remains voice-consistent.</comment>
