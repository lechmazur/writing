<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret's motivation is clear and embodied through her archive work, with internal coherence visible in how exile shaped her practice of mapping absences. The final choice to begin work is earned by her seven-year preparation and functions as both action and renunciation of dwelling on loss. Osen's arc from doubt to loosening tension is clean but secondary. One minor slip: the "reactively visionary" trait is told rather than fully dramatized in a peak choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to renewed agency): Maret's opening of her notebooks and writing the first new entry forecloses passivity with visible cost—the seven-year gap and the ruined collection frame what she accepts and begins. The causal lens holds: exile → indexed memory → valve discovery → work resumption. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the valve connects to the missing manifests, narrowing her focus and crystallizing her method. Cost is legible in the damage she inherits and the years lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor's salt-corroded surfaces and water-stained archive constrain Maret's work materially and charge the final image of wet stone as "blank page." The trumpet valve's patina and the overlapping tide marks function as micro-setting that shapes her investigative choices. Sensory detail is purposeful: mildew, brine, pale light through salt-hazed windows anchor mood and priority. The harbor after rain recurs at closure, reweighting her stance from exile to fresh start.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the archive's coherence—is signaled early and tightens when the valve reveals that missing manifests matter now, not abstractly. The tightening is one beat: discovery → recognition → method articulation, sufficient for this length. Agency is clear in Maret's decision to "start with what's missing" and her immediate action opening drawers. Osen's loosening functions as secondary pressure release. Cost is the seven-year gap and the scale of ruin she must navigate; visible and felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of navigating absences emerges through the valve, the indexed exile notebooks, and the "every gap is a shape" axiom without becoming thesis statement. The final image—blank page after rain, notebooks spread beside the valve—offers a resonant answer to how meaning is compiled from fragments. Subtext operates in Osen's silence and Maret's immediate work rather than reassurance. The exile-to-return arc integrates with the thematic question of what absence teaches. No overt moralizing; the ending reconfigures prior material through juxtaposition of ruin and beginning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with close psychic distance that modulates appropriately: introspection during ferry arrival, tighter focus during valve examination. Diction is controlled and character-specific: "architectures of connection," "staggered intervals," "the ghost of brine." The brief dialogue ("We start with what's missing") feels natural and goal-driven. Narrative certainty matches what Maret can know; her inferences about the convoy are clearly marked as conjecture built on evidence. One very brief register lift in "reactively visionary" feels slightly explanatory but does not disrupt voice consistency elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across beats without template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character (exile practice), setting (tide marks, patina), or theme (gaps as shapes). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful: "bruised with cloud," "hollowed her first year," "climbed the walls in overlapping tide marks." The scaffold sentence "She had learned, over those seven years, to navigate absences" edges toward summary but immediately grounds in concrete practice (indices, cross-references). Propulsion is clean through the valve discovery beat to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archivist-as-protagonist and "mapping absence" angle feel fresh within the exile-return template. The trumpet valve as micro-discovery that rewrites two centuries of mystery offers specific ingenuity. Emotional truth in Maret's unsentimental return—she begins work rather than dwelling—avoids stock reunion beats. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on archival particulars, not generic "finding purpose." One modest hedge: the exile/return structure itself is familiar, elevated here by occupational specificity and the valve's concrete function but not radically reimagined.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret (ocean-spray archivist) drives all key turns: her decision to return, her recognition of the valve's significance, her choice to start work immediately. Present in setup (ferry arrival), development (valve examination, cross-reference against mental indices), and closure (opening notebooks, writing first entry). Her archival expertise and exile-honed practice constrain and enable tactics throughout. Cost is visible in the seven-year gap and the ruin she inherits. Specific irreplaceability: only an archivist with her memory and indexed exile records could make these connections.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in two distinct beats: Osen's presentation on the table and Maret's examination/recognition. It enables a causal turn by connecting to the missing Tessand manifests, narrowing her investigative focus. Present in closure beat when placed beside the exile notebooks as the story's final image juxtaposition. The valve's patina and maker's mark are handled concretely, not merely described. Swappability test: a generic artifact would lack the two-century historical link and the specific maker's mark that ties to the missing crates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" shapes stakes and tactics on every page: exile taught Maret to map what's missing; the archive's gaps become her method ("every gap is a shape"); the valve's presence implies the convoy's absence returned. The concept structures her approach in development (checking reference numbers against memorized indices) and crystallizes at closure ("We start with what's missing"). Cost is the seven years spent indexing memory and the ongoing work of reconstructing from fragments. Not merely thematic echo—it alters her investigative options throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is named explicitly in exposition ("It was this practice that made her reactively visionary") and demonstrated when the valve triggers immediate mental restructuring of connections. It enables one on-page action: her recognition that the valve + missing manifests = convoy wreckage in harbor waters. Present in setup (explained) and development (valve beat), with a weaker closure link—her opening of notebooks implies the trait but doesn't dramatize a new reactive leap at the ending. The trait feels partly label-reliant despite one clear demonstration. Swappability: a near-synonym like "intuitively synthetic" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hearten" drives the emotional resolution: Osen's chest-loosening and his long fear that "it was not enough" are answered not by reassurance but by Maret's immediate commencement of work. The action shapes closure by providing the relational turn that complements Maret's task-focused arc. Present in setup (Osen's fear established via his letters and silence at the door), tested in development (his watching her), and resolved at closure (his exhalation, the loosening). Cost is implicit in his years of stolen hours. Swappability test: "reassure" or "encourage" would not capture the specific mode—she heartens by beginning, not by speaking comfort.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is signaled early (Osen's letters "every few months, irregular, cautious") and its mechanics matter: the gaps in communication mirror the gaps in the archive, and Maret's exile practice of indexing from incomplete information depends on this method. It shapes tactics in development—she cross-references Osen's fragmentary reports against her memory. Present at closure in the juxtaposition of "staggered intervals of attention" (Osen's patchwork preservation) against Maret's resumption of continuous work. The method is both means (how she stayed connected) and thematic reinforcement (intervals as another form of navigated absence).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain supplies the dominant visual motif (wet stone, salt spray, bruised sky) and constrains Maret's archival work materially—salt corrodes paper, warps bindings, yet also preserves shipwreck artifacts. The setting pressures her method: she built her career around "what the water gave back and what it kept." Present in setup (ferry arrival, quay grooves), tested in development (water stains, mildew, the diver's harbor-floor recovery of the valve), and charged at closure when the post-rain harbor "looked like a blank page." The final image reweights the setting from adversary to renewed opportunity. Removal would collapse the archival logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" frames all action and tightens decisions: Maret returns because the council rescinded the ban; her seven-year preparation makes immediate action possible; Osen's relief depends on her return timing. The timeframe is present in setup (exile duration, council's forgetting), constrains development (she uses exile-built indices), and charges closure (the "first new entry in seven years"). Cost is the lost years. One limitation: the timeframe functions more as framing condition than live countdown—no ticking urgency within the harbor scene itself, though the before/after of exile does structural work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is Maret's explicit motivation, dramatized through concrete choices: she indexed memories during exile, cross-references valve against partial manifests, and opens her notebooks to write. The motivation is tested when she encounters worse damage than expected—she could despair but instead articulates method ("every gap is a shape"). Friction between want (restoration) and cost (scale of ruin, years lost) is visible on the page. Present in setup (her sharpened purpose), drives development (valve recognition), and crystallizes at closure (beginning the work, spreading notebooks). The desire shapes every beat and the final action is its direct expression.</comment>
