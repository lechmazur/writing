<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's skillset (identifying footsteps) and her choice to follow the mysterious woman are clearly motivated and consistent. Internal contradiction surfaces when she pockets the "useless" key yet continues deeper—this choice shows her weighing trust against logic. The woman's motives remain abstract ("rebuilding deep corridors"), and Maren's final whispered answer is elided, which weakens the visible cost of her decision. Embodied emotion is present but compressed; the final beat would benefit from a micro-hesitation or physical tell that shows the weight of her commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Situational with a Charged Poise closure: Maren crystallizes her stance by pocketing the key and whispering acceptance, the geomagnetic storm and labyrinth framing pressure throughout. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first 120 words. Causality holds—maps lead deeper, woman appears, offer made, answer given—with one meaningful tightening as Maren moves from puzzled to committed. Cost is felt (she accepts an opaque partnership on trust alone) but not made undeniably visible in a final image or forfeiture; the whisper "carried perfectly" signals acceptance without showing what she surrenders or gains, keeping the resolution at Charged Poise rather than full Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly specific (asphalt to grating transitions, rust-thick walls, aurora light filtering between stacks) and constrains Maren's navigation when electronics fail. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional attention: pitch of metal groans, texture underfoot, vibration in bones. The geomagnetic storm directly eliminates navigation systems, forcing reliance on auditory memory. The deep junction and oldest containers charge the final image, grounding the mysterious woman's proposition in spatial particulars. One gate satisfied: setting alters tactics and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will accept the woman's opaque offer based on trust and listening skill—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens as each map layer leads deeper into unmaintained sections during the storm blackout. Agency is present: Maren chooses to follow, to keep the key, to whisper acceptance. The cost is implied (she commits to an unknown project with a stranger) but not shown as a trade-off that forecloses a named alternative on the page; no mention of what she leaves behind or risks losing. Under the Situational lens this is solid, but the final beat would score higher with a visible price paid or option visibly closed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust, navigation by listening, the paradox that whispers carry farther than shouts in certain architectures—emerges from the labyrinth's acoustics and Maren's skillset without overt statement until the woman's line, which borders on articulating the thesis but stays dramatized in context. The zodiac coin (Libra scales) and the key with no lock function as motifs that reweight meaning: balance and trust over literal function. The final image (whisper traveling perfectly) answers the thematic question non-literally. Minor penalty: the woman's line "whispers travel farther than shouts—in this labyrinth and everywhere else" edges toward moralizing by extending the principle beyond the scene, though it remains tied to her recruitment pitch rather than authorial summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices footsteps, metal pitch, texture shifts, all filtered through eleven years of maintenance expertise. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext (the woman's deflection "The key was the test"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the deep approach and remains controlled. One minor slip: "long enough to know every person by their footsteps alone" in the opening employs a faint expository register that could be tightened to "She knew every person…" for immediacy, but the effect is slight and the voice coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (each paragraph advances setting, character skill, or plot). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One minor cluster: "carried perfectly" appears twice in close proximity (penultimate paragraph dialogue and final line), creating a small echo that slightly dulls the closure image's singularity. Figurative language (aurora as "sickly green curtains," containers "hummed like tuning forks") is vivid and consistent with Maren's technical attention. Grammar and pronoun references are clean; no scaffolding or synonym churn. The micro-repetition of "carried perfectly" warrants a −0.2 deduction in Q7 for paraphrase adjacency touching the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of labyrinth-as-neighborhood, footstep identification, and the acoustic principle (whispers vs. shouts) feels specific and non-obvious. The folded origami maps that change route with each layer offer a fresh visual conceit tied to navigation and trust. Geomagnetic storm as both practical obstacle and metaphor for orientation loss is familiar but well-executed here. One friction: the mysterious-mentor-with-cryptic-test frame (maps, coin, key with no lock) leans on a recognizable template; the story transforms it through the acoustic particularity and Maren's technical lens, but the underlying structure remains derivable. Risk-taking in the elided final answer is bold and appropriate; slight penalty for template proximity in the recruitment-test arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's maintenance skillset (listening, structural knowledge) is established early, enables her to navigate during the blackout (middle beat), and directly motivates the woman's recruitment offer at closure. Her decision to follow the maps and pocket the key are on-page choices that narrow options. All three gates present; causal pressure across beats; closure hinges on her unique capability. Cost is implied (committing to an opaque partnership) rather than shown as a visible forfeiture, preventing the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zodiac coin (Libra scales) appears twice: left with the second map, then turned in Maren's pocket during the woman's pitch. The second touch connects to the thematic idea of balance and judgment. Setup and closure-adjacent gates present, but the coin does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it functions as thematic ornament rather than causal lever. No visible cost tied to the coin itself. Mid-band for purposeful reprise without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Folded maps are the inciting object (discovered after first encounter), drive the middle movement (Maren unfolds layers to navigate deeper), and are mentioned in the penultimate paragraph as still holding uncovered routes, charging her forward commitment. Each unfolding alters her route; without them she cannot reach the deep junction during the blackout. All three gates; high causal pressure; irreplaceable mechanics. Cost: accepting the maps means accepting opacity and trust over certainty. Strong integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's ability to identify people by footsteps is established in the opening, enables her to recognize the woman's "impossibly light" gait (inciting mystery), and is the reason the woman recruits her ("someone who navigates by listening"). Setup and closure gates present; middle development is implicit (the skill allows her to trust her navigation during the storm) rather than shown in a discrete choice-beat. The trait drives causality but one beat remains summary-adjacent. Solid integration with one gate weaker than others.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The challenge (maps, coin, key left as a test) appears after the first encounter, structures Maren's middle journey, and is confirmed at closure when the woman explains "whether you'd come this far on trust alone." Setup ~day-two, middle navigation, closure explanation. The challenge could be replaced with another recruitment mechanism (a direct invitation, a hidden message) without breaking story logic; the test's specific form matters less than Maren's response. Functional across beats but not fully indispensable; the folded maps do more causal work than the abstract notion of "challenge."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The key appears with the second map, Maren notes it "fit no lock," pockets it during the woman's pitch, and the woman declares "The key was the test." Setup and closure explanation present. Middle development weak: the key does not constrain a navigation choice or enable a tactic—it exists to be carried as a symbol of trust. The woman's meta-explanation ("No lock needed. The key was the test") borders on thematic label rather than mechanical payoff. Functional but largely ornamental; removing it would weaken thematic echo but not break plot causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established in the opening, supplies navigation challenges (metal groans, grating texture, six-high stacks) that Maren uses to orient when electronics fail, and frames the acoustic principle (whispers carry cleanly through the corridors) that grounds the closure image. All three gates; setting alters tactics throughout and charges the final beat. The geomagnetic storm forces reliance on the labyrinth's physical particulars, making the environment indispensable. High causal integration; setting is the story's skeleton.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm knocks out electronics and navigation systems (inciting obstacle), forces Maren to rely on tactile and auditory memory during her journey (middle pressure), and flares in the penultimate paragraph as the container walls hum, charging the moment she pockets the key. All three gates; the storm tightens decisions by removing technological aids. Cost: without the storm she could navigate normally, reducing the woman's test's difficulty. Strong integration; the storm is a persistent constraint that escalates pressure and validates Maren's skill at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire to understand the mystery (who left the maps, why) drives her middle journey. The woman's line "whispers travel farther than shouts" articulates the thematic motivation at closure, and Maren's whispered answer enacts it. Setup is implicit (her curiosity), middle is goal-pursuit, closure ties to the concept. Friction: the motivation is more thematic claim than embodied want with visible cost—Maren does not wrestle between shouting for help and whispering, nor does she sacrifice an alternate loud approach. The principle is demonstrated acoustically but not dramatized as a personal conflict or calculated choice under opposing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone blends deliberate pacing (Maren's methodical unfolding of maps, precise recall of labyrinth features) with spontaneous mystery (the woman's light footsteps, aurora flares, the sudden offer). Calculated: her eleven-year skillset and map-following. Spontaneous: the woman's appearance, the key's metaphorical reveal, the elided whispered answer. Tone modulates with pressure—calm expertise in early paragraphs, tightening urgency as she navigates deeper, crystallized acceptance at the end. The final image ("It carried perfectly") maintains coherence and charges the closure without tipping into sentimentality or forced revelation. Solid tonal control across turns.</comment>
