<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is character-particular—her trade shapes perception ("pressure—how to hold it, redirect it") and the conflicted loyalty to Henrik is embodied through micro-choices. The father's confession and her final decision to "carry both truths" feel earned by prior causality. Backstory is substantial (~25%) but anchored to the present letter-decoding and shifts her stance at closure. Minor slip: "slyly heartfelt" reads as label-only rather than dramatized contradiction in a key beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: letter discovery → chain match → decoded confession → Maren's decision to continue the floodgate work with reweighted understanding. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she cannot absolve but understands and commits to carry forward, foreclosing simple forgiveness with visible cost. One meaningful tightening when the chain unlocks the cipher narrows options and deepens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater's breathing vents and mist function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("warm breath...followed her out"). Sensory detail is filtered through her machinist's priorities (basalt cracks, resin adhesive). The surveyor's chain and envelope constrain the decoding choice. Spatial choreography is clean across tiers and descent. Does not quite reach 8.0: the caldera setting pressures mood but does not alter a tactical choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to forgive her father—is signaled early and tightens when the decoded letter reveals falsified surveys and eleven deaths. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she "could not absolve him" yet commits to the floodgates, foreclosing easy closure. One meaningful deepening (chain unlocks cipher, narrows interpretive options) and the final choice alters her relationship to the work. Just shy of 8.5: the emotional price is clear but the trade-off between conflicting goods could be more viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—how to hold harm and healing simultaneously—emerges through floodgate imagery, encrypted compassion in the father's system, and Maren's final refusal of absolution. "Dappled resolve" is earned through concrete particulars (chain, resin, eleven deaths) rather than stated. The final image ("warm breath...followed her out") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the volcano's dormant pressure mirrors unresolved grief. No thematic echo in the final paragraph, though "encrypted compassion" flirts with prompt-label territory earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is machinist-specific ("pressure," "calibrating gates to the millimeter"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during decoding, withdrawn for the backstory block. No head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture in diction ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") and rhythm tightens under pressure. Slight register drift: "harmonize conflicting values" and "encrypted compassion" edge toward abstract diction during peak reflection, though they remain character-plausible for an engineer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences often do two jobs (e.g., thermal vents establish setting and metaphor simultaneously). Rhythm varies with scene needs. Minor scaffold: "She reached into her pack and withdrew the object she'd also found" is scaffolding that could compress to direct action. "Slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve" are elevated coinages that work in voice but border on overwriting. No loops or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the decoding sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—daughter decodes father's apology via surveyor's chain cipher—offers a fresh synthesis of inherited guilt, industrial systems, and cryptographic discovery. The floodgates-as-penance motif is specific and non-obvious. "Encrypted compassion" as concept risks prompt-echo but is made concrete through on-page pressure calibration. The ending avoids the tidy moral; Maren's refusal to absolve while continuing the work is emotionally authentic. Transformation is evident: plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's machinist trade is present throughout (pressure metaphors, floodgate maintenance framing) and her decision at closure—to continue the floodgate work with reweighted understanding—traces to her professional lens. She is signaled early, drives the decoding beat, and her final choice alters tactics (she will carry both truths). Does not quite reach 7.0: the profession shapes perception more than it constrains a mid-scene tactical choice under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in setup (withdrawn from pack), enables the cipher-breaking beat (numbered links translate symbols), and is "draped across her knees" in the closure image, reweighted as a symbol of both harm and tool. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (without it, no decoding); closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable: only this object with numbered links unlocks the father's letter. Visible cost tied to it: the decoded truth forecloses simple forgiveness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is named early, shapes the decoding stakes (father's hidden motive), and reappears at closure when Maren realizes the floodgates carry "his encrypted compassion inside it, a language of remorse." It changes her understanding and alters her relationship to the work. Present in setup, middle (decoding), and ending. Does not quite reach 7.5: the phrase borders on thematic label rather than a concrete mechanic that narrows her options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is applied as a descriptor ("she had grown slyly heartfelt about it, hiding deep tenderness behind equations") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables a key choice. It colors her professional stance but does not force a visible tradeoff. Present in setup; absent from middle pressure or closure action. Swappable with "guarded compassion" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tremble ("Maren's hands began to tremble") occurs at the pivot: recognition that the chain matches the adhesive imprint. It signals the emotional turn before the decoding and is the hinge between mystery and revelation. Tremble is embodied, character-particular (a machinist's steady hands losing control), and irreplaceable—removal would flatten the beat. Present in middle pressure; shapes the closure sequence by marking the moment stakes become personal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Analyzing the adhesive is signaled early ("faint smear of adhesive," "tiny indentations"), provides the mechanic for the cipher solution (chain links match imprint), and the method is specific and irreplaceable. It drives the middle decoding beat and enables closure: without the adhesive discovery, no translation. Mechanics matter on the page. Does not quite reach 8.5: the method is demonstrated in one extended beat rather than iteratively tested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater is present from the opening, provides sensory texture (thermal vents, mist, fractured steps), and the "warm breath" follows her out in the final image, reweighting the dormant-volcano metaphor. Setup and closure linkage clear. Does not reach 7.0: the setting charges atmosphere and the ending but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource mid-scene. Postcard risk mitigated by the breathing motif.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The amphitheater's breathing recurs ("Every few minutes," "breathed again," "exhaled once more") and marks the passage of internal time during decoding and reflection. It establishes rhythm and ties to the dormant-volcano metaphor. Present in setup and closure image. Does not reach 6.5: the timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock that tightens decisions; Maren's choices are not time-pressured.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To harmonize conflicting values" is her stated life-work (balancing floodgate pressures, loyalty vs. grief) and drives the closure choice: she cannot absolve but will hold "both truths" and keep the gates running. Desire is dramatized in her trade, tested by the decoded confession, and resolved through renunciation with cost. Present across all three gates. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Just shy of 8.5: the friction between wants is more reflected than enacted in a high-stakes scene choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is named late (final third) but the tone it describes—mottled shadow and warmth, conflicted but committed—is established earlier through her profession, the letter's mixed revelation, and the amphitheater's alternating mist and light. Tone modulates from investigative curiosity to grief to commitment, and the phrase charges the final image. Coherent through turns. Does not quite reach 8.0: the explicit label arrives late and borders on summary rather than enacted tonal shift.</comment>
