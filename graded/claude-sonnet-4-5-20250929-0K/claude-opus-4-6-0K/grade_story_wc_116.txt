<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in purposeful witnessing without judgment. Her relationship to the swan, vine, and obsidian refuge reveals contradictory impulses—attachment versus release—acted out through micro-choices like the new crease and her stillness when the tendril approaches. The final exhalation carries embodied cost, foreclosing speech and old interpretation modes. Minor deduction: the protagonist's agency is largely observational; while Earned Stasis is valid, the piece leans heavily on endurance without a sharper on-page trade-off that forces competing goods into collision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates density through the vine's arrival, the swan's recursive unfolding, and the obsidian refuge's delayed reflection, culminating in the keeper's breath settling into the library's memory—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence and witness crystallize with conceptual cost (abandoning judgment, letting words rot). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the vine's approach to the swan tightens without resolving, and the keeper's exhalation charges the final image. Minor slip: the cost is felt but oblique; pointing to "breath carried weight" as proof requires inference rather than a harder on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and the swan as micro-setting all constrain choice: the keeper visits the refuge to replenish silence, the vine's encroachment forces witness, and the swan's geometry structures her record-keeping. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (pale vines feeding on lamplight she no longer provides, distant percussion of water). The vine's tactile interaction with the swan charges the final beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the catacombs and downstream chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to witness change without judgment, tested when the new vine threatens the swan. One meaningful tightening: the tendril's approach forces the keeper to hold still without flinching or hoping, a micro-choice that narrows her stance and reaffirms renunciation. The cost is her ongoing withdrawal from interpretation and speech, legible in the final exhalation. Minor gap: the escalation is a single moment of restraint rather than a sequence that narrows options through multiple reversals; coincidence (the tendril withdrawing) assists rather than the keeper's direct action resolving pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: decomposing books, regenerative silence, the swan's shifting text, and the keeper's grip on reality "loosely, the way one holds a bird one intends to release." The final image—breath settling into the library's long memory—offers a non-literal answer to whether witnessing alone suffices, reweighting destruction as "change wearing unfamiliar clothes" without stating a moral. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending. The obsidian refuge and recurring crumbling/germination motifs charge closure without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and controlled; third-limited with deep interiority. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the keeper notices roots, silence rhythms, and vine breath through a witness lens. Diction remains within her contemplative register ("gripped reality loosely," "a whisper of air leaving a body that had learned to need very little"). Free indirect style is clean. Slight deduction: one filter stack in paragraph four ("she could hear," "she watched") slightly dulls immediacy during a reflective beat, though voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer action, atmosphere, and thematic weight without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the vine's approach and breathing in the obsidian refuge passage. Figurative language is controlled and coherent ("letting it fall from her like dead skin," "the river's patient hand"). Minor loop: "she did not mourn them" / "she did not question this" uses similar stems across paragraphs, a small scaffold artifact. One metaphor borders on mixed: "burrowed into the swan's geometry the way others might burrow into earth" conflates paper-folding with excavation without full coherence. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of chronicle keeper, origami swan as notation device, and regenerative silence offers a fresh angle on witnessing and entropy. The obsidian refuge's lagged reflections and vine-as-germination avoid stock decay imagery. Emotional specificity (holding reality "loosely, the way one holds a bird one intends to release") anchors universals in particulars. Slight deduction: the core premise—solitary keeper in decaying archive—echoes familiar post-apocalyptic meditation templates; transformation through the swan's cryptic folds and the accumulative texture lifts it, but the risk-taking is moderate rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is present throughout and her choices—unfolding the swan, pressing a new crease, holding still when the tendril approaches—shape two beats (middle annotation, final stillness). Setup is immediate; development occurs when she marks the vine's arrival; payoff is her exhalation settling into memory. The trait is more observational endurance than decisive action that alters tactics with sharp cost, limiting causal pressure. Still, the keeper's witness stance constrains her response and charges the ending image, reaching functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears once in a retrospective passage ("years ago—or centuries") describing visits to replenish silence. Setup is present but summary-only; no middle development beat on the page; no closure participation. The refuge's lagged reflections add thematic texture but remain ornamental without constraining a present choice or charging the final image. Swappable with another meditative retreat without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Regenerative silence frames the keeper's purpose early ("to record it all in the only medium that mattered—the silence between observations") and reappears when she burrows "into the stillness" and her breath "settling into the library's long memory" at closure. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is implicit in her refusal to interpret. The concept shapes her stance and charges the ending, though it operates more as thematic frame than a mechanic that alters tactics under pressure. Two gates plus lyric reprise with cost push it past mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is signaled early ("She gripped reality loosely, the way one holds a bird one intends to release") and enables her acceptance when the swan's text shifts meaning. Setup is vivid; one beat of enabling (not contesting the swan's mutability); no sharp payoff moment where the trait's cost is tested. The attribute reads as philosophical posture rather than a constraint that narrows options with visible trade-off, limiting causal depth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears three times: burrowing into the swan's geometry, the keeper letting stillness "fold around her like paper, like earth, like the river's patient hand," and the implicit burrowing of attention throughout. Setup in paragraph four; development when she presses a new crease; payoff when she "burrowed into the stillness" at closure. The action defines her method of witness and charges the final image. Could be paraphrased as "immerse" or "fold into" with minor edits, but the geometry/earth parallel tightens specificity enough to cross into essentiality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Origami swan is introduced early, unfolded to reveal coordinates and a name, refolded to shift text, pressed with a new crease to mark the vine, and approached by the tendril at closure. Setup, development (middle annotation beat), and payoff (tendril's touch) are all present. The swan's cryptic folds serve as the keeper's recording medium, shaping her witness method and charging the final moment when the vine decides "not yet time." The mechanics matter on the page; removing the swan would break the story's notation logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overgrown library is present from the opening, supplies the vine that forces the keeper's witness, and hosts the final exhalation that settles into "the library's long memory." Setup is immediate; development occurs when the vine wraps spines and pulls volumes into germination; payoff anchors closure. The catacombs' roots, cracking ceilings, and decomposing books constrain the keeper's existence and provide the materials for regeneration. Environment is indispensable to stakes and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" anchors the keeper's timelessness early and recurs obliquely ("Years ago—or centuries," "so many times"). Setup is clear; no middle development where duration tightens a choice; closure mentions "a season turned" but does not track time as a live pressure. The timeframe establishes mythic scope but remains atmospheric rather than a mechanic that alters tactics or raises cost. Functional but replaceable with "timeless vigil" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to witness change without judgment" is dramatized early, tested when the vine approaches the swan (she holds still "without flinching, without hoping, without grief"), and reaffirmed at closure when her breath joins the library's memory. Setup, development, and payoff are present. The desire drives her restraint and charges the final image. Friction between the temptation to interpret (old habit) and the cost of renunciation (throat forgetting words) adds weight. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Crumbling peace is established immediately ("Books decomposed into soft mulch," "crumbling was not the same as collapsing") and modulates through the vine's slow encroachment, the obsidian refuge's stillness, and the keeper's exhalation—"almost nothing" yet carrying weight. Tone is coherent, rising slightly when the tendril approaches, then settling into the final image of seasonal turning. The peace-amid-decay tonality charges closure without static repetition. Diction and rhythm support the tone across beats.</comment>
