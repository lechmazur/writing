<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is consistently embodied through her actions with the ink and the drone, and the eleven-year quest provides clear internal pressure. The "serene anger" and "burning coal" are somewhat label-heavy but the closing transformation ("It became light") feels earned by the experimental process. Minor weakness: the brother's fall is recounted rather than dramatized in real-time choice, limiting the felt contradiction between past helplessness and present agency. The final stance—accepting witnessing as the answer—forecloses the quest with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly: Sable's realization that time dilation is "the mind's insistence on completeness" reweights her eleven-year pursuit, and the coal transforming to light provides Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens (three ink vials, pattern deepening) holds through the ending. Orientation is clean—who, where, when anchored early. One meaningful deepening occurs across the three vials; the third pours directly into the closure image. Cost is legible: she does not recover her brother, but she lets go of the burning coal by understanding its nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment provides purposeful atmosphere and the "spiraling currents" mirror the ink patterns, lending thematic coherence. Sensory detail is selective (golden light, wind chord, sand grains) and filtered through Sable's scientific focus. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice, however; the experiment could occur elsewhere with minimal change. The body and objects (vials, drone) are handled on the page, which partially satisfies the micro-setting test, but the canyon itself remains largely decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why time slows—is signaled early and tightened across the three ink pourings, each deepening her perception. The eclipse return provides a purposeful external trigger, and the third vial creates a final intensification where the answer crystallizes. Agency is present: Sable's conscious choice to pour the final vial and her active interpretation of the patterns drive the resolution. Cost clarity is solid—she releases the quest's fury but does not reverse the loss. One minor gap: no visible tradeoff between competing goods complicates the peak choice; her experiment succeeds without tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ink experiments and the brother's fall: attention as the only available response to irretrievable loss. The final image—"It became light"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The recurring coal metaphor shifts meaning at closure (from burning fury to illumination). Subtext operates in the visual patterns and Sable's wordless grief. Minor slip: "the mind saying: this matters. Do not look away" edges toward direct thematic statement, though it remains tied to the on-page pattern work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and distinctive—clinical precision layered with mythic diction ("heated glass," "cathedral of detail"). POV stays close and stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (scientific observation tinged with grief) is character-specific. Filter verbs ("she had seen," "she had watched") appear in the brother's-fall passage, appropriate for recollection but slightly dulling immediacy. The prose modulates well under pressure: short clauses during the third vial, expanded syntax in reflection. Needle's data feeds and the ink's chemistry ground the voice in her expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do double duty (world-building plus emotional charge). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: "burning coal," "heated glass," and "cathedral of detail" are coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting: "a fury so old it had calcified into something smooth, something she carried with the composure of a woman holding a burning coal because she refused to let it go until it yielded its secret" stacks clauses without adding pressure. The final line ("The wind carved on") provides clean propulsion and closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—tracking subjective time dilation through disappearing ink patterns—is fresh and non-obvious. The albino tracker detail and wind-carved encampment add specific texture without ornament. The grief-to-scientific-quest synthesis feels organic, and the eclipse timing is purposeful rather than convenient. The resolution (time slows because the mind insists on witnessing) is specific enough to avoid platitude. Risk-taking in the experimental method and the quiet, image-driven ending elevate the piece. Minor derivative echo: the "frame-by-frame" imagery of traumatic slowdown is familiar, though the ink-pattern investigation transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable is present throughout and her choices (waiting for the eclipse, pouring three vials, interpreting the patterns) drive all key turns. Her albinism is mentioned ("colorless eyes") but does not constrain or enable tactics; the tracker role is functional but could be swapped for "researcher" with minimal change. She appears in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates, and her agency is clear. Moderate irreplaceability: the character's history and experiment are specific, but the albino-tracker combination does not press the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Needle appears in two beats (ascending early, descending mid-scene) and provides atmospheric data and cross-reference for Sable's perception. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its sensor readings confirm the ink's constant rate but do not change Sable's approach. Setup and middle gates are met; closure participation is absent—Needle is not mentioned in the final paragraph. Functional but replaceable: a stationary sensor array could serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is central to the entire experiment and shapes all three key beats. Each vial pouring advances the plot and deepens Sable's understanding; the third vial directly yields the closure realization. The ink's ephemeral nature mirrors the theme and enables her perception test. Setup (first vial), middle (second vial), and closure (third vial forming a falling figure) are all present. Causal pressure is strong: without the ink's patterned evaporation, the story's logic collapses. High irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is stated explicitly ("She was consciously wild in her methods") and motivates her choice to abandon the university and live rough. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; the wildness is described rather than demonstrated in a moment of tactical tradeoff. Setup gate met, but middle and closure participation are absent. The trait could be removed and her experimental choices would remain unchanged. Label-only use with minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Disappearance operates at multiple levels: the brother's fall (a disappearance that triggers the quest), the ink's evaporation (the method), and the final acceptance of transience ("watched it dissolve the way all moments dissolve"). The action shapes the premise, drives each beat (ink fading faster than Sable can hold it), and anchors the closure image. All three gates present. High causal pressure: removing disappearance breaks the story's logic and theme. Visible cost: she must release her grip on the past.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (first vial, mapping fractal progressions), used across three distinct beats with escalating complexity, and delivers the closure realization. The spilled-ink patterns are not merely ornamental—they trigger the time-dilation effect and provide the answer. Setup, middle, and closure gates all met. The mechanics matter: without the ephemeral patterns' visual complexity, the perceptual slowdown would not occur. High irreplaceability and strong causal pressure. The specificity of "spilled ink" rather than any disappearing substance elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is introduced early and provides atmosphere ("silence," "spiraling currents" that mirror the ink). It does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the experiment could occur in any isolated location. Setup gate met, middle and closure participation weak. The setting's thematic echo (wind carving stone, ink patterns fading) is purposeful but does not reach causal necessity. Swappable with "remote research station" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled immediately ("After the eclipse ended") and motivates the experiment's timing: the eclipse return creates a "neurological jolt" that primes Sable's crisis perception. Setup and middle gates met—the eclipse aftermath is the catalyst. Closure participation is indirect; the eclipse is not mentioned in the final paragraph. The timeframe shapes one key choice (when to pour the first vial) and adds specificity, but does not tighten ongoing decisions. Moderate causal pressure; a different crisis trigger could substitute with some rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is established early ("tracking something invisible for eleven years"), dramatized through the brother's fall backstory, and drives every on-page action (waiting for the eclipse, pouring vials, interpreting patterns). The final realization directly answers the motivating question. Setup, middle, and closure gates all met. Friction between desire and cost is present: she cannot save her brother, only understand the slowdown. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable. Minor deduction: the eleven-year span is told rather than shown in present tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Serene anger is explicitly named ("the source of her serene anger") and embodied in the burning-coal image. The tone modulates purposefully: clinical precision in the experimental beats, lyric expansion during the brother's fall, quiet release at closure ("It became light"). The tone charges the final image by shifting from controlled fury to illumination. Setup, middle, and closure participation present. Moderate cost connection: the tone's transformation is the emotional payoff. Minor deduction for the explicit label rather than pure dramatization, and the tone could be inferred without the direct statement.</comment>
