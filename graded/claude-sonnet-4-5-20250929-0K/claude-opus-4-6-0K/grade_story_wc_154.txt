<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior is richly layered—"the vertigo that came whenever someone trusted her to unknot meaning from wreckage"—with embodied anxiety felt in the atrium and concrete micro-choices (pressing thumb over words, deciding to stay). The relationship with Suki is shown through specific acts (reading cast notes, translating dialect) and emotional stakes are deeply rooted in Lena's professional history. Minor slip: the "shrewdly innocent" trait is told rather than enacted on the page, and the interiority occasionally tilts toward articulated self-knowledge ("grafting new meaning onto old wounds") that feels slightly over-polished for the stress moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lena chooses to stay, foreclosing flight with visible emotional cost ("pressed her thumb over the words and held still"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through interleaved reflection and present stimuli (cast notes, coral fragment, child under anesthesia) and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena decrypts "Tell Lena: stay" and commits to presence. Cost is felt in the sustained posture and the promise she must now carry alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium anchors early with sensory specificity ("glass ceiling wept condensation") and recurs to charge the ending ("The mist thickened. The twilight deepened"). The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting, its ridged grooves pressuring Lena's reflection and reappearing in the closure beat ("placed the coral fragment on top of the cast"). Spatial choreography is stable. Slightly more tactical constraint from the environment during the decision beat would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lena's commitment to translate silence into presence—is signaled early and tightens when she reads "Tell Lena: stay." The escalation follows Accumulative logic: each decrypted line deepens her recognition of shared anxiety until the final choice crystallizes. The cost is felt (she forecloses leaving, binds herself to Suki's recovery) but remains primarily emotional without a tangible forfeiture or external consequence visible on the page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—language as anchor against erasure, shared anxiety between caretaker and child—emerges through concrete particulars (cast notes, coral grooves, "the ache found its lotus-hearted shape") without thesis statements. The ending offers a resonant answer: staying is the only translation that matters, enacted through image rather than declaration. The final paragraph risks minor thematic echo ("the only craft she had ever truly mastered") but stops short of moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the cast inscriptions and Lena's bodily stillness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Lena notices grooves, ridges, weight—translator's habit of decoding surfaces. Diction stays interior and lyric ("lotus-hearted shape," "shrewdly innocent") without head-hopping. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (cast, coral, mist) and modulates pressure. Minor register slip: "the thing behind the thing, the plea inside the threat" reads slightly expository in a high-interiority beat. Rhythmic control is excellent; sentence variety supports emotional modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("mist pooled like something alive," "ocean memory on human record"). One mixed metaphor: "lotus-hearted shape" for ache—lotus connotes serenity, not ache—muddies the closure image slightly. Minor paraphrase loop: "the same thing Lena had done... the same thing she was doing now" across two clauses. Information density is strong; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Propulsion is steady with purposeful breathing at the ending. No fatal artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of translator-as-emotional-anchor with Pacific setting and child-refugee stakes is specific and non-obvious. The brain coral as analog for memory and translation is fresh. Risk: the piece leans into lyric introspection over external pressure, trusting quiet accumulation—this succeeds but leaves little room for surprise. The cast-note decryption device is functional but could be sharper. Transformation of caretaker trope through dialect translation and shared anxiety elevates above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout; her professional history frames the stakes and her decision to stay is the closure act. She appears in setup, drives the middle decryption beat, and enacts the ending choice. Swappability is low—translator identity matters. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice feels inevitable from her character rather than a high-cost fork.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brain coral appears in setup (paragraph two), is handled in the reflection beat ("held the brain coral fragment against the cast"), and returns in the closure image ("placed the coral fragment on top of the cast"). The object's grooves parallel the cast's ridges and charge the final juxtaposition. Use is somewhat static—descriptive rather than tactically enabling—but the reprise reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties are named explicitly ("They shared this anxiety... the fear that language would fail") and motivate Lena's staying. The concept shapes stakes but is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. It appears in setup (translator's vertigo), middle (recognition), and ending (promise to translate silence), meeting all three gates, but causal pressure is soft.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is introduced in paragraph five as a label ("the attending physician described as shrewdly innocent") but never enacted on the page. No scene shows Lena disarming Suki or others through this trait. It remains ornamental—a character note without dramatized cost or enabling function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears in setup ("unknot meaning from wreckage") and middle ("Lena unknotted the last line"). The action is specific to her translator role and enables the discovery of "Tell Lena: stay," which triggers the closure choice. It is not easily swappable and participates in two beats, but the work itself is summary rather than tactically constrained.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged cast notes is signaled early (nurse hands her the cast) and drives the middle beat where Lena reads three languages line-by-line. The method is specific and irreplaceable. It does not participate in the closure image—Lena places the coral on the cast but does not decrypt further—so closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atrium at twilight anchors setup and recurs in the ending ("The mist thickened. The twilight deepened"). The setting provides atmosphere and a spatial anchor but does not constrain choice or supply tactical resources. The glass ceiling's condensation is evocative but passive. Micro-setting (the stone bench, the coral) does more work than the atrium itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is introduced early ("after the anesthetic kicked in") and locates Lena in the liminal window while Suki is under. It creates a bracketed urgency—Lena must decide before Suki wakes—but the clock is not tracked on the page and does not visibly tighten tactics. Elapsed time is vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is articulated midpoint and tied to both Lena's ceasefire work and Suki's cast writing. It appears in setup (translator's past), middle (shared project), and ending (promise to translate silence). The friction is internal—Lena's fear of language failing—but is told more than shown through conflicting micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is lyric, aching, and tender throughout—"lotus-hearted ache" and "held its breath" establish the register early. It modulates subtly with pressure (from vertigo to stillness) and charges the final image ("The mist thickened. The twilight deepened. Lena stayed"). Coherent and purposeful, though the "lotus-hearted" coinage is slightly forced.</comment>
