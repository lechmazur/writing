<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Adaeze's interiority is concrete and specific—her "hollow place behind her sternum where faith used to live" and the memory of her grandmother's warm hands drive embodied choices. The "cautious enchantment of a flame finding kindling" at the end earns its weight through the excavation journey and the sundial restoration. Minor slip: the shift from observer to active restorer could show more internal conflict or cost in the decision itself; the move feels slightly frictionless. Her final kneeling gesture carries genuine renunciation of diaspora distance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from catacomb descent through sundial discovery to above-ground placement, with the final image reweighting "interrupted" into "waiting." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by paragraph two. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the kneeling moment crystallizes Adaeze's reconnection with undeniable pressure ("The ground was warm. It had been waiting.") and the cost is the foreclosure of her prior detachment. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to rebuild, narrowing her role from volunteer to active restorer, and the warm ground at the end charges prior material with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not merely described but actively shapes choice: roots threading through ribcages provide the sensory anchor that pulls Adaeze deeper, and the sundial's underground warmth ("warmer than it should have been") primes her decision to restore it. The above-ground orchard serves as the stage for the closure image, where placing the sundial between mango and iroko charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, alcove wandering, village smith, return to surface—and the micro-setting (her palms on warm earth) completes the arc. Every detail serves pressure or closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting with lost faith—is signaled early ("hollow place behind her sternum") and tightens when Adaeze discovers the sundial, a concrete vehicle for restoration. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to rebuild rather than catalog, works across days to restore it, and carries it above ground. The placement scene narrows her options (she kneels, committing to the earth) and the closure image makes the cost legible: she has forfeited detachment and accepted the waiting ground. One meaningful tightening (the rebuild decision) and visible price (embodied vulnerability in the final gesture) satisfy the lens and length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sundial's interrupted hours and the roots' embrace of the dead—tradition suppressed, then restored. The final image answers the thematic question non-literally: Adaeze's kneeling reconfigures "interrupted journeys" into "cautious enchantment," and the warm ground suggests faith as patient substrate rather than lost artifact. No moralizing or prompt-label intrusion; the piece trusts concrete particulars (lemon water on stone, gnomon clicking home) to carry resonance. The "hollow place" motif shifts from absence to kindling without stating a thesis, and the ending reweights all prior material through the single gesture of palms on earth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tight to Adaeze's perceptual signature: "warmly curious reverence," "pressing her palm against the cool stone walls and asking silent questions." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the brush work, slightly wider during Dr. Okafor's historical note, intimate again at the kneeling closure. Diction stays within her lexicon (British passport, diaspora, "drizzle") without register drift. Minor slip: "the cautious enchantment of a flame finding kindling" risks slight overwriting for the POV, though it lands as earned reflection rather than authorial intrusion. No head-hopping, and the single line of dialogue ("I want to rebuild it") serves goal pursuit cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and momentum-forward: "roots had learned to love the dead" and "threaded through ribcages like fingers lacing together" deliver density without clutter. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final two-sentence closure ("The ground was warm. It had been waiting.") earns its weight through prior accumulation. Minor deduction: the opening's lush figurative density ("faintly mineral, faintly floral," "vaulted stone ceiling," "heavy with their impossible harvest") borders on overwriting for a high-pressure descent beat, though it does not obscure causality. No loops, no scaffold, and no filter-verb stacks in peak moments. Information density is high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where roots embrace bones offers a fresh synthesis of ancestor veneration and material ecology, and the buried sundial as ritual instrument adds non-obvious specificity. The piece avoids template diaspora-return beats by grounding reconnection in the tactile work of restoration rather than epiphany or confrontation. Transformation test: the arc would lose coherence with different props or setting; the sundial's interrupted hours and the warm stone are irreplaceable. Minor hedge: the "hollow place behind her sternum" and final kneeling gesture, while well-executed, echo familiar return-to-roots imagery without a bold structural or moral risk that would push into the 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Adaeze is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: deciding to restore the sundial (middle), working with the smith (development), and carrying it above ground to place it (closure). Setup is clean (paragraph one), development shows her agency altering tactics, and the final kneeling gesture is hers alone. The cost—foreclosure of detachment—is tied directly to her enacted journey. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in discovery (beat one), restoration across days (beat two), and placement above ground where it casts shadow and charges the final image (beat three). Its warmth ("warmer than it should have been") primes the ending's warm ground, and removing it would collapse the story's causal spine. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with clear cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys shape the premise (family's flight, suppression of priestesses, sundial buried) and reappear at closure ("interrupted hours," Adaeze's wandering resolved into kneeling). The concept constrains her motive (restoration) and the final image reweights interruption into patient waiting. Setup is embedded early, development threads through Dr. Okafor's oral record, and payoff lands in the shadow's "interrupted hours" and the waiting ground.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" is enacted on-page: Adaeze brushes soil "not with a scientist's detachment but with a warmly curious reverence," presses palms against walls, and asks silent questions. This trait enables her decision to rebuild rather than catalog. Setup is clean, development shows the trait guiding her approach, but the closure beat emphasizes embodied vulnerability more than curiosity itself, slightly reducing payoff weight. Two-gate coverage with mid-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rebuild decision is the central turn: it converts Adaeze from passive volunteer to active restorer, drives the middle passage (smith work, cleaning, fitting the gnomon), and makes the placement scene possible. Removing "rebuild" would leave only observation and memory. Setup at discovery, development across "following days," and payoff when the completed sundial casts its first shadow in a century. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is signaled early ("moved through the catacomb orchard with purposeful wandering, following whichever root system called to her") and frames her discovery method. The method enables the sundial find and supports her final kneeling as an arrival after wandering. Setup is explicit, development is implied in the alcove-to-alcove cataloging, and payoff lands when she "knelt in the orchard soil...at this single point of light." Lyric reprise with cost linkage, though middle dramatization is light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but active setting: roots guide her wandering, the underground coolness contrasts with the sundial's warmth, and the above-ground orchard provides the stage for the shadow and closure. The dual-level geography (catacombs below, trees above) structures the entire arc. Setup paragraph one, development in alcove exploration, and payoff when she places the sundial "between a mango and an iroko" and kneels on the soil. Environment constrains and charges throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is present: "third day of excavation," "following days," "afternoon sun," and the implicit tomb-excavation window. Time allows the restoration work and creates narrative rhythm, but it does not tighten decisions under a live clock. Setup in "third day," development across "following days," and payoff in the afternoon placement. Functional but not high-pressure; time permits rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to restore lost faith is the engine: "hollow place behind her sternum where faith used to live" (setup), the sundial as vehicle for reconnection (development), and the "cautious enchantment of a flame finding kindling" at closure (payoff). The friction between want (reconnection) and cost (vulnerability, foreclosure of detachment) is legible in the final kneeling gesture. Motivation drives all three beats and the ending reweights it with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and consistent: "warmly curious reverence," "the cautious enchantment of a flame finding kindling," and the final "The ground was warm. It had been waiting." The prose modulates from observational curiosity (catacombs) to embodied commitment (kneeling) without breaking the enchantment frame. Setup paragraph one, development in the sundial's warmth and Dr. Okafor's quiet exposition, and payoff in the charged final image. Tone charges closure and supports pressure throughout.</comment>
