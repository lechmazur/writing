<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific—"Rivers don't care about your politics" shows her worldview through idiom. Her subtly confident stance is embodied in measured action (feeding the falcon, drafting the memo with "one small flourish"), though internal contradiction remains mild. The final choice to "begin" drawing feels earned by her eleven-year career arc, and the cost is visible: she acts despite the worrying storm and the incomplete data. Minor slip: the envying-the-falcon beat tells more than it shows about her epistemological burden.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered details (falcon signal, coordinates, phrasebook, condensation pattern, storm clock) that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren begins drawing the blank headwaters with the storm twelve hours out, crystallizing her commitment against incomplete evidence and approaching danger. The cost is felt—she acts on hope and triangulation, not certainty—and the final image ("the first line of ink dried") reconfigures the atlas lie into action. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reads the condensation as a twelve-hour storm window, narrowing her options and forcing the choice to draft now.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and pale sky create coherent atmospheric pressure. The condensation-on-glass micro-setting constrains Maren's choice: she reads moisture patterns to infer the storm's arrival, which tightens her decision window to twelve hours. Sensory selection is purposeful (rust scraping, still air, drained sky), filtered through her cartographic lens. Spatial choreography is clean (window, perch, outpost interior). Minor limitation: the birch forests and basalt ridges beyond the lake are mentioned only in summary at the end, not woven through her perception earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: replace the cartographic shrug with a definitive source point. Pressure tightens when Maren decodes the coordinates, identifies Keskara via the dog-eared phrasebook entry, reads the storm window in condensation, and chooses to draft the memo and begin drawing despite incomplete data. The final act—opening the atlas to the blank headwaters and beginning to draw—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of waiting for perfect evidence. The cost is visible: she commits her eleven-year revision on "triangulation of evidence and hope" with a storm incoming. One meaningful tightening (storm clock) narrows options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: evidence vs. instinct, the labor of precision vs. theCartographic lie of dotted lines. The phrasebook dog-ear and the phrase "the rivers remember" operate as subtext rather than thesis. The final image—ink drying on the blank headwaters—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question of how to replace uncertainty with commitment, without moralizing. Minor slip: "perhaps those were the same river flowing from the same source after all" edges toward overt philosophizing, though it remains anchored in her reflection on the falcon's return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices through a cartographer's lens (borders, gravity, triangulation, barometer checks). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("the cartographic equivalent of a shrug," "invisible architecture of approaching weather"). Free indirect style is clean. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—measured in exposition, tighter when she reads the condensation and makes the final choice. No dialogue is present (Dahl is referenced but not on the page). Minor issue: "subtly confident in her ability to remain calm" tells the trait rather than letting it emerge solely through action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or pressure (e.g., condensation detail both characterizes Maren's skill and sets the storm clock). No loops or scaffold detected. Clarity is strong; figurative language (gravity's sense of humor, the mouth that speaks three tongues) is voice-coherent and sparse. Minor density lapse: "She imagined the memo reaching the capital…imagined Dahl laughing…imagined the atlas" runs three imagination clauses in parallel that restate her hoped-for outcome without adding pressure or altering her stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frame—cartographer at a remote outpost decoding a singular source—offers a fresh angle on the explorer/scientist archetype. The phrasebook dog-ear as talisman and the condensation-as-barometer detail are specific and non-generic. The closure choice (drawing into the blank) transforms the premise from epistemological frustration into committed action. Risk is present but modest: the story relies on accretive atmosphere rather than bold structural experiment. Transformation test passes—removing Maren's cartographic idiom and the specific rusted outpost/phrasebook/condensation particulars would collapse the story's texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (dry-witted atlas editor) appears throughout and her choices drive the story: she decodes the coordinates, consults the phrasebook, reads the condensation, drafts the memo, and begins drawing. Her wit is embodied in "Rivers don't care about your politics" and "the cartographic equivalent of a shrug." Her final decision to begin drawing the headwaters is the story's closure beat. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is strong. The character is indispensable—remove her and the story has no focalization or agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The phrasebook dog-ear is mentioned twice: once when Maren opens to the marked page and identifies Keskara, and again in her imagined future ("imagined Dahl laughing when she told him his dog-ear had been the key"). It enables her to match coordinates to an indigenous name, which validates the source's singularity. Setup and development are clear; the imagined payoff is present but summary-only. The object is swappable with another mnemonic device (e.g., a marginal note) with minor edits; its specific dog-eared form does not constrain tactics. Cap at mid-band for two-beat use without irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Singular convergence (the core concept) frames Maren's eleven-year quest and the survey team's coordinates that "shouldn't have existed." It shapes the dominant stake: to map "the place where the rivers begin" and replace the atlas lie. The concept is dramatized in Maren's realization that three rivers originate from one point, which validates her life's work. It appears in setup (coordinates), development (phrasebook entry "the mouth that speaks three tongues"), and payoff (she begins drawing the singular source). Causal pressure is strong; the concept is not merely thematic but alters Maren's options and drives her final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is attributed to Maren in the opening ("subtly confident in her ability to remain calm") and shown through her measured composure (feeding the falcon, drafting with "one small flourish," reading condensation patterns without panic). The trait enables her to act on incomplete evidence rather than waiting for certainty, which is essential to the closure choice. However, the trait is told in a label rather than inferred solely from embodied action, and it does not face on-page friction or cost—no moment tests her confidence with visible consequence. Setup and payoff are present; development (middle constraint) is weak. Mid-band for enablement without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Herald" (the action of drafting and sending the memorandum) appears explicitly when Maren writes "The source is singular. The rivers remember" and seals it. This action crystallizes her commitment to the expedition's next phase and sets up the final beat where she begins drawing. The memo is not easily swappable—it is the formal, bureau-facing counterpart to her private act of drawing, and the "one small flourish" characterizes her voice. The action is causally central: it marks the transition from passive waiting to active claim-making. Setup (she drafts), development (the memo articulates her finding), and payoff (she then draws) are present. Strong causal role across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The condensation-on-glass method is signaled early ("she had learned to read these patterns years ago") and used in a key beat: Maren presses her palm to the window, watches moisture form and retreat, and infers the storm is twelve hours out. This reading constrains her choice by creating a deadline. The mechanics matter—her skill at reading "invisible architecture of approaching weather" is specific to her expertise. Setup (skill mentioned), development (she uses it to set the clock), and payoff (the cleared glass in the final paragraph mirrors her decision to act) are present. The method is not swappable; remove it and the twelve-hour urgency vanishes. One friction: the final cleared-glass image is passive observation, not a second active use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rusted outpost by a frozen lake is anchored in the opening and provides the spatial frame for the entire story. The outpost supplies the iron perch (where the falcon lands), the window (where Maren reads condensation), and the isolation that amplifies her choice to act on incomplete data. The frozen lake's "worrying tranquility" charges the atmosphere and reflects the thematic tension between stillness and impending change. The setting is present in setup, development (she moves through outpost space), and payoff (the final window view frames her drawing act). Micro-setting (window, glass, perch) constrains and enables. The setting is not easily swappable—remove the outpost's isolation and the pressure attenuates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" is signaled in the opening line ("came back on a Tuesday") and structures the entire story: the falcon's arrival ends waiting and begins the urgency. The twelve-hour storm window (inferred from condensation) tightens Maren's decision to draft and draw now rather than wait. Time is tracked and live: "Twelve hours was enough" directly alters her tactics. Setup (falcon return), development (storm clock set), and payoff (she acts within the window) are present. The timeframe is causally indispensable—remove it and the story becomes static reflection without deadline pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to find where the rivers begin" is dramatized throughout: she has spent "her entire professional life" and "eleven years revising" to replace the atlas lie at the headwaters. The desire is conflicted—she acts on "triangulation of evidence and hope" rather than certainty, and the worrying tranquility signals the cost of her commitment. The motivation drives the final choice: she begins drawing despite incomplete data and an approaching storm. Setup (career arc and stated quest), development (phrasebook and coordinates validate the quest), and payoff (she draws the blank headwaters) are present. Friction between want (definitive point) and cost (acting on hope) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is established in the opening ("the waiting was over and the worrying could finally begin") and sustained through descriptors: the falcon's rust-scraping, the "still air," the "sky so pale it seemed drained of intent," and the "silence that deep usually preceded something." The tone modulates with pressure: calm observation when reading the phrasebook, tightening when she checks the barometer twice and reads the storm window, and crystallizing in the final line ("worrying and perfect") as ink dries. The tone charges the final image by holding stillness and threat in tension. Setup, development, and payoff are present; coherence is strong across turns. The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional texture.</comment>
