<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied ("teeth ache," the cave pearl glowing), and her shift from prophecy-reader to present-moment observer is earned through the pilgrim's impossible request. The contradiction between her reputation and her sudden inability creates genuine pressure. Minor slip: the final "teach me" moment edges toward epiphany-speak but is anchored by the sensory particulars of the cave pearl's layered nacre. The cost—loss of her identity as clairvoyant—is legible and forecloses her former path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's shift from seeking tomorrow to inhabiting the present reweights her entire practice, and the cost—abandoning her prophetic identity—is felt in "the clairvoyant who hadn't seen it coming, finally began to see what had been there all along." The causal lens holds: the pilgrim's request triggers her inability, which forces the revelation about unseen forces, which opens the choice to learn presence. One meaningful tightening (inability → revelation → choice) is sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave is not mere backdrop: the "harmonic vibrations," "luminescent walls," and "overlapping shadows" actively inhabit and constrain Maren's perception, and the cave pearl—formed over centuries by mineral tumbling—charges the final image by embodying the everyday magic she's been blind to. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's professional lens (acoustics, translucence, resonance). The cave's song brackets the piece and shifts meaning from unheard to finally listened-to, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Maren's prophetic gift and identity) is signaled early and narrows when the vision fails. The pilgrim's impossible request—"magnify everyday magic"—tightens options by revealing her gift was never hers. Agency is clear: Maren chooses to ask "Teach me," forecloses her former role, and the price (loss of prophetic reputation and self-concept) is legible. One meaningful turn (gift failure forces recognition) is sufficient. No antagonist required; the revelation itself supplies pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the cave pearl's "layered nacre," "water dripping, crystals singing," and the oxymoron "bright darkness" all dramatize the sacred-in-the-ordinary without stating a thesis. The final image—"every unremarkable, magnificent moment"—reweights the entire prophetic frame through specific sensory detail rather than abstraction. The story answers its central question (what is the source of vision?) by showing rather than declaring, and the cost is conceptual as well as personal: prophecy was "the least interesting thing they could do."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure ("devastating clarity"). Perceptual signature is consistent: acoustic metaphors ("chord that made her teeth ache"), mineral/crystalline focus. The pilgrim's dialogue is spare and distinct from Maren's interior voice. Minor slip: "steadily unpredictable, the way the cave's acoustics shifted without pattern" edges toward authorial explanation rather than strict focalization, but recovers quickly. Diction remains in Maren's professional-mystical register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: "cave pearl—smooth, round, formed over centuries by mineral-rich water tumbling a grain of sand into something luminous" does triple work (object, metaphor, world-building). No paraphrase loops. Minor density slip: "something vast and formless inhabit the space around her — unseen forces pressing against the membrane of her perception" restates the same idea across two clauses without added pressure; this edges toward synonym churn but does not obscure causality. Figurative language ("frozen pipe organs," "hands against a curtain") remains coherent and controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "clairvoyant who didn't see it coming" premise is familiar but transformed through the specific request to "magnify everyday magic" rather than predict disaster, and the reveal that unseen forces were the true source inverts the prophet-as-conduit trope with fresh specificity. The oxymoron "bright darkness" and the cave pearl's dual glow anchor originality in image. The emotional arc (mastery → failure → relearning) is particular to Maren's profession and the cave's acoustics. Slight handicap: the mystical-disillusionment frame is well-trodden; elevation comes from execution and sensory particularity rather than radical premise novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (clairvoyant who didn't see it coming) is present from the opening and drives all major beats: she leads the pilgrim, attempts the reading, experiences the failure/revelation, and makes the final choice to learn. The irony is central to the turn and charges the closure ("finally began to see"). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cave pearl appears in one extended beat (the reading attempt) and charges the final vision of layered nacre as metaphor for everyday beauty. It enables the revelation but does not return or constrain a second distinct action. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is thin. Lyric resonance lifts it above ornamental, but single-beat use and no tactical constraint cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unseen forces are signaled early (the cave's non-repeating song), dramatized in the peak beat ("something vast and formless inhabit the space… had always been here"), and redefine Maren's entire practice at closure. They drive the revelation that her gift was lens-work, not source, altering her options fundamentally. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage all strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is told in an authorial aside ("a Tuesday that felt like no particular day at all — steadily unpredictable, the way the cave's acoustics shifted") but never constrains an on-page choice or alters tactics. It flavors atmosphere without causal work. Present in setup, absent from development and payoff; ornamental. Cap at 4.6 per missing-middle rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Inhabit" is the action tied to unseen forces: "something vast and formless inhabit the space around her" at the revelation beat, and the forces "had always inhabited it, threading through every crystal." This verb choice drives the ontological shift (forces are residents, not visitors) and shapes the final understanding. Present in middle and closure, alters interpretation; not swappable. Minor limitation: not present in setup, and the verb itself could be replaced with "dwell" or "reside" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through overlapping shadows" is signaled early ("their overlapping shadows stretched and merged… something else moved"), returns in the revelation beat ("overlapping shadows on the walls deepened"), and is present at closure ("The shadows overlapped and danced"). It supplies the means by which unseen forces are perceived and participates in all three gates. Causal role is secondary (metaphor more than mechanism), but reprise with shift in agency (from passive "moved" to active "danced") reweights meaning. Specificity moderate; near-synonym "intermingling" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave is the crucible: its acoustics frame Maren's skill, the "dissonant and bright" chord announces the crisis, the Mirror Pool stages the reading, and the cave's song brackets the opening and close with reweighted meaning ("for the first time, Maren listened without reaching for tomorrow"). Environment constrains perception throughout and charges the final image. Setup, development, payoff all strong; irreplaceability very high. Cost is tied to locale (loss of her role in this specific temple).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" is the timeframe anchor, signaled in the title echo ("After the pilgrim arrives — that was when everything changed") and closed with "The cave sang after the pilgrim arrived." The before/after structure is taught and paid off, creating a lyric frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; it's structural rather than pressurizing. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise; no middle tactical constraint. Cap near 6.0 per two-gate allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To magnify everyday magic" is the pilgrim's stated desire, dramatized in his request and tested when Maren sees "every detail blazed with terrifying, ordinary beauty" in the cave pearl. It drives the turn by making her prophetic lens obsolete and forcing the choice to learn presence. Setup and payoff clear; middle development is the failed reading that this desire precipitates. Friction exists (her reputation vs. his request), and cost is visible (she must abandon grand prophecy). Solid causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" is introduced as oxymoron ("light that was simultaneously radiant and dark — bright darkness, the luminescence of deep places") and charges the final callback ("the bright darkness at the heart of every unremarkable, magnificent moment"). Tone is coherent through the shifts: luminous yet subterranean, mystical yet ordinary. It modulates with pressure (the cave's "dissonant and bright" chord at crisis) and integrates with closure image. Setup, development (tonal pivot), payoff all present; strong specificity and thematic load.</comment>
