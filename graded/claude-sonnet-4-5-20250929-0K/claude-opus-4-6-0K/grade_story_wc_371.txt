<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—her noticing filters through concrete memory (iron lampposts, Oskar's score marks) and her tea-house actions show contradictory impulses: preserving while accepting she "had not saved" anything. The final choice to "uncloak" the space is earned by prior causality and visible cost (secrecy as erasure). Minor slip: the epiphany moment ("noticing was itself enough") edges toward diagnostic self-awareness but remains anchored in concrete action (eating the bread, tending the garden).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Maren's decision to uncloak the courtyard crystallizes stakes (witness vs. erasure) with visible cost (ending secrecy = exposing sanctuary to the forgetting city). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently: density increases through layered memory, cadence shifts at "she would uncloak it," and the final image reweights the opening pattern with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by ~100 words; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The courtyard micro-setting constrains choice (overgrowth as wall, hidden tea house as fragile sanctuary) and charges the final image (mint still growing = persistence). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: jasmine, wisteria, chamomile scent—all tied to Maren's guerrilla gardening. The bread's score marks function as setting-as-object, anchoring sacred gesture. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment evolves causally (wild → reclaimed → about to be uncloaked).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing vs. erasure) is signaled early and tightens once: secrecy protects the sanctuary but becomes "its own kind of erasure," forcing the uncloak decision with visible cost (exposure to the forgetting city). The tightening is protagonist-driven and narrows options under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist required; the world's slow forgetting provides coherent pressure. One minor note: the story skirts repetition in the witnessing-loop ("noticed when," "noticed when") but the final turn reweights it rather than loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (witnessing as preservation, sacred in ordinary) emerges through particulars: iron lampposts, Oskar's score marks, guerrilla gardening. The final image offers a non-literal answer—"tenuous absolution"—without stating a moral, and the decision to uncloak reweights prior material (secrecy → shared memory). "This is sacred. This ordinary thing" risks overt thematic statement but is dramatized through bread-eating and the courtyard's presence. No token motifs; the bread returns with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (noticing disappearance, heuristically gentle) is consistent and specific. Diction matches her interior lexicon ("tenuous absolution," "heuristically gentle") with purposeful elevation that fits the reflective mode. Minor slip: "terrible symmetry she lived inside" and "seeking something she could only call tenuous absolution" edge toward over-articulation under pressure, but the voice holds. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer memory and present action efficiently. The opening anaphora ("She noticed when… She noticed when…") is purposeful pattern-teaching, paid off at closure. Minor template cadence in the uncloak sequence: "She would leave… She would let… She would invite… She would serve… She would say" stacks five parallel stems in quick succession, flirting with scaffold (-0.3). No loops or metaphor muddle; figurative language (jasmine strangles, fig trees crack) is concrete. Propulsion is smooth.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise (creeping normality + guerrilla reclamation as counter-erasure) is specific and non-obvious; the tea house in overgrown palace courtyard avoids generic "everywhere" setting. The uncloak decision feels earned in hindsight, not a late rule change. Minor proximity concern: "noticing is not the same as preventing" and "witnessing counted" echo familiar meditations on observation vs. action, but the bread's score marks and courtyard particulars transform the frame. Risk-taking in lyric pacing and reflective density succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as "creeping normality noticer" is established early (lampposts, dialect, Oskar's bakery) and her noticing drives the key turn: recognizing "secrecy was its own kind of erasure" leads to the uncloak decision, which alters tactics (from hiding to inviting). The trait is not merely observation—it compels the final action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Oskar's bread appears in setup (frozen loaf, last from the bakery), is handled in the middle beat (unwrapped, eaten, score marks examined), and charges the final decision ("she would serve them bread… explain what they meant"). The object's specificity (three diagonal slashes, sacred gesture) is irreplaceable; it embodies the witnessing stake and ties directly to the uncloak choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly and shapes the middle stake (Maren seeks it in the courtyard). The concept constrains her tactics (gentle reclamation, no tearing roots) and reappears at closure ("that was absolution enough"). It does not fully transform options on the page—more thematic resonance than causal driver—but it does reweight the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is demonstrated through on-page action (redirecting vines, planting where soil invites, never tearing roots) with visible cost: the method is slow, and she "had not saved" the bakery or lampposts. The trait constrains her approach and is paid off at closure when she chooses to uncloak "slowly, the way the world undid things—but in reverse." Specificity elevates it beyond label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is the major turn, introduced mid-story and driving the final action: leaving the gate open, inviting others, serving bread, explaining the sacred. The decision redefines options (secrecy vs. shared memory) and is causally earned by prior reflection. The specific verb "uncloak" is apt and irreplaceable; swapping it for "reveal" would dilute the voice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (clearing the pavilion, planting chamomile/mint/rosemary, "technically illegal") and its gentle mechanics shape Maren's approach throughout. The method constrains her tactics (no tearing roots) and is present at closure (mint still growing, chamomile scent). It does not drive a distinct middle beat but accumulates pressure and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The secret tea house in overgrown palace courtyard is introduced early, provides the spatial frame for the entire piece, and supplies the key resource (hidden sanctuary) that Maren must risk by uncloaking. The setting's specificity (jasmine colonnades, wisteria canopy, cracked fountain) is irreplaceable and constrains the final choice: exposure threatens the sanctuary's survival.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is signaled early and establishes season (winter quiet, rosemary catching winter sun). It does not tighten a live clock or alter tactics on the page—more atmospheric anchor than pressure device. The timeframe contributes to the courtyard's solitude but remains replaceable (e.g., "after the tourists left" would function similarly).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to find the sacred in the ordinary is dramatized through concrete action: freezing Oskar's bread, examining score marks, tending the courtyard, eating the bread slowly. The desire is conflicted (noticing vs. preventing, witnessing vs. saving) and drives the final choice to uncloak and teach others to notice. The friction between preservation and inevitable loss creates visible cost at closure.</comment>
