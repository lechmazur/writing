<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—somatic markers drive her movements with the wand, chest tightness and palm warmth shape the light painting. Her contradictory impulses (loving Jonah while skeptical of his work) act simultaneously. The closure choice to call Jonah and propose a study is earned by the photograph's revelation, though the final beat leans slightly toward articulate insight rather than raw contradiction under peak pressure. Minor: the "affectionate skeptic" label appears twice, risking over-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—somatic awareness deepens through the light-painting act, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the photograph reveals fractal pathways mirroring the geode. Orientation anchors (Maren, studio, post-withdrawal) land early. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: Maren accepts her altered state and commits to collaboration, foreclosing solitary coping. One meaningful deepening (body cartography made visible) suffices at this length. Backstory (recall, Jonah's gift, static shock) anchors in present stimuli and tilts her stance toward the call.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The studio's sensory detail (ozone, lavender, cameras as sentinels, emergency exit glow) is selective and voice-filtered. The muscovite sliver functions as micro-setting: its fractal layers charge the closure when the photograph mirrors them. Spatial choreography (steel table, monitor, wand in hand) tracks cleanly. The geode's physical constraint (fragile translucency, layered mica) directly charges the final image and Maren's metaphor of "willow glass held up to morning light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: making sense of post-withdrawal somatic experience. One meaningful tightening: the light-painting experiment transforms sensation into legible map, narrowing Maren's options from panic to method. Agency is clear—her decision to move according to markers, then to call Jonah. The photograph's revelation forces a trade-off: accept altered perception as map, not damage. Cost is visible: she moves from solitary struggle to collaborative vulnerability. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (body as cartography, withdrawal as transformation rather than damage) emerges through the light-painting act and the fractal photograph without statement. The geode's recurring presence (gift, sliver, final image) reweights prior material: "hidden pathways" at the opening become literal in the photograph. The ending offers a resonant answer—"my body knows things my mind hasn't caught up with yet"—grounded in the image's recursive geometry. Jonah's playful "not peer-reviewed" prevents sermonizing. The "tuning fork...still ringing" final image charges the thematic question without declaring a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Maren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: technical vocabulary (fiber-optic wands, long-exposure, tethered monitor) and metaphor (muscovite as frozen lightning, willow glass hope) fit her artist lens. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—Jonah's "beautiful...and also not peer-reviewed" carries subtext (affection, caution) and advances plot toward collaboration. Filter verbs ("she could hear his smile") appear once, acceptable for voice. Distance control is clean. Minor: "affectionate skeptic" recurs as self-description, risking slight exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character or atmosphere (geode as gift, somatic markers, light as cartography). "Frozen lightning branching into infinity" and "willow glass held up to morning light" are specific without muddle. Minor scaffold: "She turned the sliver slowly" and "She set the sliver on the steel table" open consecutive beats with similar stems. "Affectionate skeptic" appears twice. No paraphrase loops or register drift. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; figurative language stays coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-pharmaceutical withdrawal mapped via light painting and fractal geometry—feels specific and non-obvious. The geode's fractal structure mirrored in the body's somatic pathways offers a fresh angle on altered perception. Maren's voice (artist meets post-medical subject) avoids template protagonist beats. Risk: the accumulative structure and technical specificity (muscovite mica, fiber-optic wands) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise transforms a familiar "drug side-effect" trope through embodied method and geometric resonance. Emotional truth (fragile hope, skepticism coexisting with love) anchors the conceptual reach.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren embodies "affectionate skeptic" in her relationship with Jonah (kissing him then dismantling his paper, loving him while skeptical of his pharmacology). This trait drives two key turns: her decision to devise a method (skepticism applied to her own experience) and the closure call to Jonah proposing a study where she'll be "the skeptic and the subject." The label appears twice on the page, risking slight over-diagnosis, but the stance shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in four beats: opening description (fractal mica catching light), memory anchor (Jonah's gift from the coast), present handling (held up to monitor), and closure charge (the photograph's fractal pathways mirror the sliver's layered structure). Its physical properties (translucent sheets, recursive patterns) directly enable the thematic revelation. Removing it would collapse the story's geometric logic and the resonance between body, art, and gift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall (Synaptix) shapes the entire stake: Maren's post-withdrawal somatic sensitivity is the problem she must navigate. The recall notice, static shock, and residual markers appear in the opening third and frame the light-painting experiment as response. The concept constrains her options (pills stopped, sensitivity didn't) and drives the closure realization ("withdrawal isn't damage...it's a map"). It could be genericized to "experimental drug recall" with some loss, but the cognitive empathy → somatic markers sequence is specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" constrains the story's visual and thematic logic. The muscovite sliver's fractal mica patterns (opening paragraph) directly charge the photograph's "branching, recursive, fractally precise pathways" at closure. The attribute isn't decorative—it enables Maren's insight that her somatic map mirrors natural geometry. The cost: accepting a perception that operates at scales beyond conscious control. Removing "fractally precise" would flatten the geode/body/photograph resonance into generic similarity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Devise" appears twice: Maren decides to "devise a method" and later invites Jonah to "devise the study." This action is the story's hinge—it transforms passive suffering (panic calls to Jonah) into active experimentation (light painting guided by somatic markers). The photograph resulting from this devised method delivers the closure revelation. The action redefines her options from victim of withdrawal to researcher of her own altered state, with visible cost (vulnerability, collaboration).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" (Jonah's term) are seeded early as the framework making sense of her experience. The method shapes the middle experiment: "When her chest tightened, she swept the wand left. When warmth bloomed in her palms, she drew upward." The photograph's fractal pathways prove the method works—her body's cartography is legible. At closure, Maren tells Jonah "my body knows things my mind hasn't caught up with yet," confirming somatic markers as the operative means. The mechanics matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The light painting studio provides the essential tool set (long-exposure cameras, fiber-optic wands, tethered monitor) that enables Maren's experiment. The ozone-and-lavender smell and emergency exit glow supply sensory anchors. The setting isn't merely backdrop—the cameras' perpetual-open shutters and four-minute exposure window constrain the method. The steel table holds the geode sliver through multiple beats. Removing this exact studio would require substantial rewrite, though the core insight (somatic mapping) could theoretically occur elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the entire story—eleven days post-recall, seventy-two hours post-cessation. The timeframe is signaled early and constrains Maren's state (post-withdrawal, residual sensitivity). The four-minute exposure and the call to Jonah happen "tonight," tightening the present scene. However, the timeframe doesn't escalate pressure beat-to-beat; it's a stable condition rather than a ticking clock. It shapes the stakes but doesn't alter tactics within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire "to illuminate hidden pathways" is dramatized through Maren's light-painting experiment: she literally traces luminous pathways in the dark, seeking to make somatic markers visible. The motivation is stated in her call to Jonah ("I think the withdrawal isn't damage...it's a map") and embodied in her movements with the wand. Friction: the experiment requires accepting altered perception as valid rather than damage, foreclosing her prior panic-response. The cost is vulnerability (calling Jonah, proposing collaboration). Desire drives the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone of "willowglass hope—fragile, translucent...that could shatter but chose, for now, to hold" is established explicitly near the ending and modulates through the piece. Opening dread (ozone smell she never got used to, pressing temples) shifts to cautious experimentation, then to the photograph's revelation, landing on tentative collaboration. The laugh with Jonah and final image ("tuning fork...still ringing") maintain fragility without deflating hope. Tone charges the closure by refusing triumphalism—the hope remains provisional, glass-like, earned through cost rather than cure.</comment>
