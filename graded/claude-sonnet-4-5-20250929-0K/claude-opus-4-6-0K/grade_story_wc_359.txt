<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently rooted in her role as bell ringer, but her interiority leans heavily on declarative statement rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The synesthesia trait is more label than lived constraint—it colors perception but rarely forces a micro-choice with visible cost. The climactic moment (singing the aurora) feels earned by setup, but the weeping afterward ("not from sadness but from the relief of proof") edges toward emotional summary rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. The grandmother's enigmatic instruction and Elara's decades-long wait are told rather than dramatized as choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal lens: grandmother's map → glacier journey → aurora release → sky proof above Aurskog. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. The closure lands on the page—Elara releases the sculpted hush, the sky burns, aldermen witness—but the cost is conceptual (proof delivered) rather than a felt personal forfeiture that alters her own options. The causal chain holds, yet the final image ("wrapped in oscillating repose") abstracts rather than crystallizes a decisive change in Elara's stance or situation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hush cracks and the aurora threads through, narrowing the scene to the act of release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vivid and purposefully detailed: vaulted ceilings, ridges aligned with the amber sheet, the aurora threading through ice. The sculpted hush formation serves as both setting anchor and story object, constraining Elara's approach and charging the final act. Sensory selection is strong (shimmer as chord, vibration up the arm), though some details—"blue-white ice," "faint glow"—lean generic. The cathedral architecture parallel threads setting and theme effectively. The cavern's spatial choreography remains coherent, and the micro-setting (ice wall where she presses the sheet) directly enables the climactic release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove wonder is structural, not ornamental—is signaled early via the aldermen's vote and grandmother's challenge. Pressure coheres through the three-day descent and the discovery of the hush, culminating in the aurora-release act. One clear tightening occurs when Elara matches tone to hue and the formation begins to unfetter. However, the escalation feels more procedural than agonistic: Elara encounters no false path, miscalculation, or moment where her choice forecloses an alternative with on-page cost. The aldermen's witness is asserted rather than shown, and the ending delivers conceptual victory without a visible personal price that narrows her own future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as structural architecture—emerges organically from the prism bells, the sculpted hush, and the aurora's release without overt moralizing until the final phrase ("hidden architecture holding everything else together"), which edges close to a thematic echo. The amber sheet and the hush function as recurring images that shift meaning: map becomes key, silence becomes presence. The ending offers a resonant answer (proof delivered, repose carried home) rather than a stated moral, though the aldermen's awe is told rather than shown. Subtext operates in the grandmother's cryptic instruction and the parallel between cathedral and cavern, but the piece occasionally leans on abstraction ("wonder was not ornamental but structural") where a final image might have carried the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Elara's perceptual signature (color-as-sound) is voice-specific and consistent. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between reflective backstory and present action. A few phrases—"synesthetically blessed," "oscillating repose"—read slightly elevated for the focalizer's lexicon, though they remain legible. No head-hopping. Interiority is concrete in sensory terms ("every shimmer of light…arrived…as a chord") but occasionally slips into exposition ("The congregation called it sacred. The new aldermen called it inessential.") that summarizes rather than dramatizes perception. The final paragraph's diction ("carrying silence and sound in equal measure") is purposeful but borders on authorial summary rather than Elara's lived thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is often vivid ("the color of old honey," "ribbons—emerald, rose, violet, silver"). However, several passages lean on stock metaphor ("the pause before a chisel strikes marble," "the calm that lives between one bell toll and the next") and elevated diction ("unfetter," "oscillating repose") that occasionally floats above concrete action. A few lines approach paraphrase loops: "The hush was not absence but presence" is immediately restated as "silence so intentional it had weight." The climactic beat (Elara singing, the hush cracking) propels cleanly, but the final paragraph abstracts momentum with summary rather than image. No severe artifacts, but density dips in reflective stretches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synesthesia-as-vocational-skill premise and the ice-cathedral-as-proof frame offer a fresh synthesis, and the sculpted hush is a memorable central image. The parallel between prism bells and frozen silence is purposeful and specific. However, the emotional arc—idealistic artisan vindicates craft against bureaucratic dismissal—follows a familiar template, and the ending (proof delivered, wonder certified) resolves without surprise or moral ambiguity. The grandmother's amber sheet and cryptic instruction function as quest tokens rather than character-specific provocations. The aldermen remain off-page abstractions, limiting the story's human complexity. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes at a high level within familiar thematic territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as prism-song bell ringer frames her motivation, explains her synesthetic perception, and drives the decision to journey to the glacier after the bells are decommissioned. Present in setup (cathedral role), development (reason for the quest), and payoff (her voice releases the hush). The role creates two distinct beats: the decommissioning that launches the quest, and the climactic singing where her bell-tuning skill enables the aurora release. Causal pressure is strong—without her specific vocation, the story's logic breaks. Cost is conceptual (career loss) rather than a visible trade-off in the cavern, but the closure hinges on her occupational ability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber music sheet appears early (grandmother's gift), is used twice on-page (held to light to reveal topographic lines, pressed against the ice wall to align ridges), and glows warm in the final paragraph. It enables the middle choice (navigation) and charges the ending image. However, its function is primarily instrumental—a map—and its "reweighted meaning" at the end (glowing warm) is asserted rather than dramatized as a shift in Elara's understanding. Two distinct beats (consultation during descent, alignment at the wall) and closure presence qualify it for mid-band, but the object does not impose a cost or constrain a choice beyond its utility.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sculpted hush is the story's central stake and turning point. Introduced at the structural midpoint, it redefines Elara's goal from "find proof" to "release the silence." It creates a distinct beat (discovery and realization) and drives the climax (matching the aurora's frequency to unfetter the hush). The concept is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the plot. The hush's transformation from "absence" to "presence" to "unbound resonance" reweights the story's thematic question on the page. Specific cost: Elara must sing harder, weep from relief, and carry the hush's resonance home. Late first appearance (past midpoint) slightly limits the score, but causal pressure and closure linkage are undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Synesthesia enables Elara's bell-tuning vocation and her ability to match aurora colors to pitch at the climax. Present in setup (sensory description), development (reason she can perceive the hush's silence as meaningful), and payoff (translating color to frequency). It shapes two beats: the cathedral tuning backstory and the aurora-singing scene. However, the trait is more superpower than constraint—it never imposes a visible cost or forces a trade-off. Elara's perception is consistently enhanced, never overwhelmed or confused. Specificity is strong (color-as-chord), but the lack of friction or price caps the score below high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unfetter" names the climactic action: Elara sings to crack and release the sculpted hush's stored resonance. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it for "free" or "release" would lose the specific texture of knot-loosening the piece establishes. It drives the major turn (silence → exhalation of sound/light) and the closure (sky above Aurskog burns). The verb is seeded early ("unfastened, the way a knot loosens") and executed on the page with visible consequence. Cost is present: Elara "sang harder," pressed her forehead to ice, and wept. The action is essential across setup, development, and payoff, though the cost remains more conceptual than physically or socially limiting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aurora provides the mechanics for the climax: Elara reads its colored bands as frequencies, matches tone to hue, and weaves her voice into the spectral chorus. The method is signaled early (synesthesia as vocational skill) and executed on-page with specificity ("emerald, rose, violet, silver" each singing a distinct pitch). It drives one essential beat (the unfettering) and shapes the ending (the sky above Aurskog). However, the aurora's arrival feels somewhat convenient—no prior hint that it would appear, and no cost to accessing it. The method is functional and irreplaceable for the climax, but its sudden availability slightly undermines causal tightness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ice cavern provides spatial constraint (three-day climb, vaulted ceilings, ridges that must align with the amber sheet) and charges the final image (walls projecting aurora outward). It creates two distinct beats: the descent journey and the wall-alignment moment that enables the climax. The cavern's architecture is irreplaceable—the ridges must match the sheet, the ice must resonate. Micro-setting (ice wall, sculpted hush formation) alters tactics and supplies the resonating chamber necessary for the ending. The cathedral parallel enriches theme without being ornamental. The setting is essential across setup, development, and payoff, with visible causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase appears once, mid-story, as an extended simile to describe the sculpted hush's quality of held breath: "like the pause before a chisel strikes marble—that single held breath at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes and the stone discovers what it has been carrying inside." It enriches metaphor but does not structure the narrative clock or tighten decisions. The three-day journey and the aurora's timing are the functional time pressures; the sculptor's-chisel moment is illustrative, not causal. Present in description but not in setup or payoff, and swappable with another metaphor of anticipation. Ornamental integration caps the score in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to certify wonder as essential—is seeded early (aldermen's vote, grandmother's challenge), drives the glacier quest, and is fulfilled at closure (aurora proof delivered). The desire is dramatized through action (three-day climb, pressing the sheet, singing the aurora) and tested by the hush's challenge (finding the right frequency under pressure). Friction exists between the abstract goal (prove wonder) and the concrete cost (physical journey, weeping relief), though the ending delivers conceptual victory without a visible personal trade-off that limits Elara's future. The motivation is essential across all three beats and charges the final image, but the lack of a felt forfeiture slightly caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tone modulates between reflective backstory (the cathedral, the grandmother's instruction) and immediate sensory immersion (the cavern, the aurora). "Oscillating repose" names the final emotional state and mirrors the story's rhythm between stillness (the hush) and sound (the aurora release). However, the phrase appears only in the last line and is asserted rather than embodied throughout. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the theme of silence-as-presence, but it does not create distinct pressure shifts tied to the protagonist's choices. Present in payoff with a lyric reprise quality, but minimal middle development and late first naming limit causal integration. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
