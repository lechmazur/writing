<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is concrete and coherent—she acts to unmake a prophecy she alone can read—but her interior life leans heavily on abstract constructions ("summoned not demons or spirits but meaning itself"). Embodied contradiction appears when she presses the wing to water "feeling the resonance shift," yet the moment risks becoming conceptual rather than visceral. The final renunciation (turning from the haven without looking back) earns its cost through prior causality, and the piece sustains a singular perceptual filter throughout. Minor deduction for occasional label-speak ("terrible gift," "singular") that could be more embodied under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (summoner, brook, moonlight, nocturnal haven) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece teaches a pattern of attention-as-action early and sustains it: she folds silence into the wing, introduces counter-resonance, and the prophecy dissolves. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she refuses the prophecy's voice, the valley accepts quiet, and the cost is legible (she remains solitary, the prophecy erased but the burden of listening endures). One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy resists and she must press through. No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The brook, moonlight, paper wing, and valley flora are filtered through the summoner's attention and constrain her method: she maps silence by watching water flow beneath the wing, and the brook carries the counter-resonance downstream. The wing's transformation (creases vanish, restored to blank) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("molten silver," "sedge grass," "ancient throat"), matching the summoner's perceptual priorities. The micro-setting (wing above water) functions as both tool and setting, shaping the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unmake the prophecy before it propagates. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the prophecy resists ("low thrum," "owl," "wind"), and the summoner must fold further creases and press the wing to water, narrowing her tactical options. One clear tightening when the prophecy tries to reassemble; she counters by introducing the resonance pulse. The cost is legible—she remains alone, the night "preferred the quiet," and her burden of listening persists. Agency is renunciation with visible consequence: the prophecy is erased, but she walks home solitary as ever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the crane's single wing as "honest about the impossibility of flight," the architecture of hush built from attention rather than words, and the choice of which futures deserve voice versus erasure. The final image (blank wing returned to her heart, brook carrying only "water-words") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece commits fully to its premise—meaning as summonable substance—and the summoner's arc is inextricable from the thematic question of silencing catastrophe through refusal. Minor deduction for one abstract phrase ("presence of refusal") that borders on theme-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization; all perception is filtered through the summoner's idiom ("terrestrially cosmic hymn," "living notation"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the folding ritual, wider when describing the valley's response. Register occasionally elevates ("cipher," "propagate") but remains within the summoner's plausible lexicon given her role. No head-hopping; the narrative stance is stable. Diction and rhythm reflect her analytical yet lyrical mind. One minor slip: "smoothed hush so complete that she could hear her own blood circling" risks over-articulation at the peak beat, though it remains voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("molten silver," "tranquil blaze," "architecture of hush") is purposeful and coherent. Two areas lower the score: (1) mild paraphrase loop in the teacher's memory ("She had not understood then. She understood now.") adds conceptual redundancy without pressure; (2) the phrase "a silence that was presence—the presence of refusal" over-explains the metaphor mid-climax. Propulsion remains strong, and the final line ("It always held, for as long as someone was willing to listen harder than the world was willing to speak") reconfigures prior material cleanly. No grammar errors or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—summoning meaning to unmake a coded prophecy—synthesizes familiar tropes (solitary mage, prophecy, origami symbol) through specific choices: mapping silence as counter-resonance, a single wing as philosophical stance, and the brook as medium. The emotional truth (choosing erasure over propagation, accepting solitude as cost) avoids generic templates. The final turn (blank wing, water-words) feels earned in hindsight. Minor deduction: the core conflict (prophecy in starling wingbeats) leans slightly toward writing-exercise particularity rather than lived-world necessity, and the transformation test passes but without bold subversion. Risk-taking in the attention-as-action method elevates within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and drives all key turns: she decodes the prophecy (setup), folds the wing under resistance (development), presses it to water to dissolve the prophecy (closure). Her choices narrow options and bear visible cost (solitude, the burden of listening). Early signal in the first paragraph; causal pressure across three beats; closure participation is decisive. Irreplaceable: the story hinges on her singular gift and her renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in paragraph three (setup), is folded further under pressure (development), pressed to water to transmit the counter-resonance (climax), and returns blank in the final beat (closure). Four distinct beats; causal pressure (its geometry maps silence); closure linkage (blank wing charges the final image with visible cost). Specificity: the single wing's "honesty about impossibility" and its transformation are irreplaceable. Reaches high band via beat involvement, causal work, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The smoothed hush is introduced early ("silence she needed to silence," "mapping silence"), shapes her method (identifying pockets of quiet, folding them into the wing), and defines the climactic moment ("smoothed hush so complete"). It alters tactics (she must lean into rests, not words) and charges the final image ("the silence she had mapped would hold"). Two beats of functional pressure; closure participation is clear. Moderate causal role and cost connection; could be swapped for "counter-vibration" with effort, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears once as a descriptor for the brook's hymn ("terrestrially cosmic hymn that connected the mud beneath her knees to the spinning of galaxies"). It colors perception but does not constrain an on-page choice or tactic. Present in the middle third; functions as atmospheric texture rather than a trait with visible cost. Lyric-resonance potential exists (connecting local to universal) but is not dramatized as a trade-off. Functional but replaceable; trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Flow" is threaded throughout: the brook flows beneath the wing (setup), the counter-resonance flows downstream (climax), and the brook "resumed its murmuring" with only water-words (closure). Three beats; causal pressure (flow as medium for transmission); closure participation (the brook's resumed flow signals success). Early signal and specificity: the flowing water is the mechanism for spreading the hush. Strong integration; removing flow would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced early ("by mapping silence, she could locate the exact frequency"), operationalized in the middle (she marks pockets of quiet by folding the wing, "building an architecture of hush"), and pays off at closure ("the silence she had mapped would hold"). Three beats; causal pressure (the method shapes her tactics under resistance); closure linkage (her success depends on this exact means). Specificity: the method is unique and irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook anchors the entire scene: she kneels beside it (setup), uses the brook's flow to carry the counter-resonance (development and climax), and the valley's response (owl, wind, sedge grass falling quiet) confirms success (closure). Early signal; three beats of participation; causal pressure (the brook is the medium). Micro-setting qualification: the brook and its flow constrain her method. Closure linkage is strong. Reaches mid-high band via beat involvement and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" functions as atmospheric setup (the brook "carried downstream from the mountain's ancient throat") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time is present (she came "as she always did," the prophecy reached her "three seasons ago," and she will "finally attempt" tonight) but is not tracked beat-to-beat. No urgency that alters tactics. Present in setup and closure participation is oblique (the night "reassembled itself"), but middle development lacks temporal pressure. Lyric-resonance role; trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to hush a prophecy spoken in code is dramatized: she decodes starling wingbeats (setup), acts to unmake the prophecy before others decode it (stated goal), faces resistance when the prophecy tries to reassemble (development), and succeeds with visible cost (she remains solitary, the burden of listening endures). Early signal; causal pressure across two beats; closure participation is clear. Friction between the want (erase the prophecy) and cost (solitude, the weight of choosing which futures deserve voice) is legible. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears once at the climax ("a tranquil blaze igniting in her chest, warmth without violence, light without consumption") and colors the counter-resonance moment. The piece sustains a coherent tone—nocturnal, contemplative, quietly charged—that modulates with pressure (intensifies during resistance, releases into the final quiet). Closure linkage is present (the valley "preferred the quiet," and she walks home without looking back). One explicit use plus tonal coherence; the phrase charges the climactic image. Mid-high band for purposeful modulation and closure participation.</comment>
