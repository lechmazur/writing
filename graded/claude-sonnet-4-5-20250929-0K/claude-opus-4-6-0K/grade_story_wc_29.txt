<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific—her four-day insomnia, the "cautiously hopeful reputation," and her recognition that both factions are being played show character-particular thinking. Her micro-choices (opening the broadcast, proposing the third option) arise from established traits and successfully alter the situation with visible cost: she risks professional isolation and exhaustion to interfere. Minor slip: the final "fragile, gritty edge of hope" tilts slightly abstract after strong embodied work, and the ending phones could feel more pressured, but the choice to broadcast is well-earned and forecloses passivity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The escalation follows motivated linkage: Maren notices the subsonic pattern → maps it to blind spots → realizes both factions serve the tricksters → broadcasts a third option → receives calls from both leaders. Closure is Charged Poise: she has acted, the factions respond, and the final image ("she knew they were watching") crystallizes the new stance with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost—she's now visible to the tricksters. One meaningful tightening (the broadcast) narrows options and reweights the conflict. Cost is legible in her exhaustion, isolation, and the tricksters' awareness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio station basement (burnt coffee, ozone, ventilation draft, dead air hum) and the pinned astronomical charts function as micro-setting that constrains her solo work and charges the broadcast act. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the smell "confirmation that something was very wrong with the sky" filters through her exhausted POV). Spatial choreography is clean. The charts recur and shift meaning from diagnostic tool to broadcast evidence. Minor gap: the university and department war remain somewhat abstract backdrops rather than lived-in pressure, but the booth itself does meaningful work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: prevent humanity from being manipulated by the tricksters. The tightening is protagonist-driven: Maren's recognition that both factions serve the signal's probe logic forces her to interfere, and her broadcast proposal (randomized frequency rotation) directly counters the trap. The cost is visible: professional isolation, sleep debt, and she's now on the tricksters' radar ("she knew they were watching"). One meaningful escalation (the broadcast) narrows options under causal pressure. The ending calls from Asante and Lund show immediate consequence and setup further friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of manipulation versus agency emerges from concrete action rather than statement. The recursive signal structure, the faction war, and Maren's third-option response dramatize the central question without sermonizing. The final image—"she knew they were watching"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material: surveillance is now mutual, and her advantage (awareness) becomes both tool and vulnerability. Subtext operates in the "cosmic tricksters" framing and the burnt coffee/ozone sensory layer. Minor gap: "the fragile, gritty edge of hope, like starlight filtered through smoke" edges toward decorative metaphor rather than necessity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: Maren notices subsonic frequencies others filter out, thinks in pattern-matching terms ("recursive structure"), and her exhaustion colors perception (burnt coffee as cosmic confirmation). Narrative stance modulates purposefully—calm analysis during chart study, urgency during the broadcast decision. Diction stays within her lexicon (interpreter, arrays, coordinates) without register drift. The two phone calls at 2:47 and 2:51 a.m. show precise focalization. Minor issue: "brilliant but unproven" and "chasing something that was chasing them back" feel slightly authorial rather than Maren's exact idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs (character state, world logic, escalation). Rhythm varies and accelerates into the broadcast beat. The opening "Maren Soloway had not slept in four days, and the university radio station smelled like burnt coffee and ozone" anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears in mid-story exposition: "Standard practice dismissed anything below twenty hertz" and the Dr. Yuen anecdote feel like necessary setup but slightly stall momentum. The phrase "cautiously hopeful reputation: brilliant but unproven" reads template-like. No severe loops or filter-verb stacks, but a few constructions ("the kind of mind that might be visionary or might be chasing ghosts") could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "cosmic tricksters" concept transforms first-contact tropes through the probe-logic twist: signals that test rather than greet, exploiting human blind spots and faction divisions. The subsonic-frequency method and the third-option resolution (randomized rotation) feel specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise with grounded detail (coordinates, arrays, recursive structures). Minor familiarity: the exhausted-lone-scientist and warring-academic-factions are well-worn frames, though the manipulation-detection layer adds freshness. The ending's mutual-surveillance reversal earns its hinge but doesn't radically transform the genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren (celestial signal interpreter) is introduced in the opening line and drives every major turn: she notices the subsonic pattern (week -3), maps the blind spots, recognizes the faction trap, decides to interfere, broadcasts the evidence and proposal, and waits for response. Her professional skill (filtering subsonic frequencies, pattern recognition) enables the discovery and shapes her tactical choice. The ending positions her awareness ("she knew they were watching") as her advantage. Setup, development, closure all present; causal pressure high; specificity (subsonic interpretation, array coordinates) irreplaceable. Cost visible in exhaustion and exposure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in paragraph two ("pinned to every available surface"), are handled and studied in paragraph four ("she mapped it against her astronomical charts"), anchor the broadcast beat ("reading coordinates from her charts, playing the subsonic frequencies"), and recur in the closing beat ("studied the charts once more"). The charts enable discovery (mapping the blind-spot coordinates) and serve as broadcast evidence. Setup, development, closure participation all clear. Evolving use: diagnostic tool → proof → renewed vigilance. Charged reprise in final paragraph. Specificity: coordinates and deep-space arrays depend on them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Power plays (core concept) structures the entire conflict: the signals probe humanity's attention architecture, the factions' responses serve the tricksters' probe logic, and Maren's third option is explicitly framed as "outwit them by refusing to be predictable." The concept changes options on the page—both broadcast and shutdown are traps; only randomized rotation evades manipulation. Dr. Yuen's "power plays conducted across light-years" seeds the frame early. The ending ("she knew they were watching") confirms the power dynamic is now visible and mutual. Setup, development, closure all present; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" appears as reputation backstory ("cautiously hopeful reputation: brilliant but unproven") and returns transformed in the ending: "the fragile, gritty edge of hope, like starlight filtered through smoke." The trait constrains her approach—she doesn't claim certainty in the broadcast ("here is what I see, here is what I fear, here is what I cautiously hope we are still smart enough to do")—and her final hope is "fragile, gritty," tempered by exhaustion and risk. Setup and closure present; middle development is implicit in her measured tone. Cost: the caution nearly kept her silent; hope now coexists with exposure. Lyric reprise functional but the closure phrase edges decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Interfere" is named explicitly ("She had to interfere") and drives the climactic turn: opening the campus-wide broadcast, presenting evidence, and proposing the third option. The action is irreplaceable—neither silent observation nor passive reporting would create this pressure. It redefines the situation: both faction leaders call her, she's now exposed to the tricksters, and the stalemate shifts. Setup (recognition that both moves serve the tricksters), development (the broadcast itself), closure (calls, mutual awareness) all hinge on this verb. The mechanics (booth access, coordinate recitation, subsonic playback) are specific. Visible cost: professional risk, exhaustion, surveillance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are seeded early ("buried in the subsonic frequencies that most interpreters filtered out"), explained as her signature method ("Standard practice dismissed anything below twenty hertz. Maren had not followed standard practice"), enable the discovery (recursive structure in subsonic layer), and shape the broadcast tactic ("playing the subsonic frequencies boosted into audible range so listeners could hear the recursive structure"). The method is causally necessary—without subsonic access, the probe pattern remains invisible. Setup, development (mapping coordinates), closure participation (broadcast evidence) all clear. Specificity: "below twenty hertz," filtering, boosting into audible range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>University radio station (WHGV 91.3, basement broadcast booth) appears in paragraph one, provides the resource that enables the climactic action (campus-wide broadcast channel, "something she technically had authority to do"), and anchors the final waiting beat ("sat in the hum of dead air, charts rustling in the ventilation draft"). The booth's isolation supports her solo stance and the sensory details (burnt coffee, ozone, dead air hum) charge atmosphere. Setup and closure clear; middle pressure is implicit (the booth as refuge and tool). Minor gap: the station itself doesn't constrain a choice—she has access—so it's more enabling resource than obstacle. Functional but closer to backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames the entire narrative present: the department war is ongoing (Asante's contact faction vs. Lund's skeptics), Maren is "the only celestial signal interpreter left... who hadn't joined one of the two factions," and the ending calls (2:47 a.m., 2:51 a.m.) show the division persists even after her broadcast. The timeframe tightens her decision—waiting would let one faction act—and her interference is urgent ("She had to interfere"). The three-week discovery window and four-day insomnia establish duration. Setup and closure both tied to division; middle escalation implicit. The live clock (2:47, 2:51) adds specificity but doesn't materially alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Outwitting cosmic tricksters is the explicit motivation: "Outwit them by refusing to be predictable" and the closing line "she had one advantage they hadn't accounted for. She knew they were watching." The desire is dramatized in her detective work (mapping blind spots, recognizing the faction trap) and the broadcast choice. Friction is visible: exhaustion, professional isolation, and the risk that even her countermove might be anticipated. The motivation shapes every choice from noticing the subsonic layer to proposing randomized rotation. Setup (Dr. Yuen's "cosmic tricksters" frame), development (pattern recognition), closure (mutual awareness) all tie to this drive. Cost: she's now exposed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ethereal grit coheres across the piece: technical precision ("subsonic frequencies," "recursive structure," "deep-space observation arrays") grounds the cosmic scale, while exhaustion and burnt coffee anchor bodily toll. The opening simile "burnt coffee and ozone, which she took as confirmation that something was very wrong with the sky" braids mundane and cosmic. Tone modulates under pressure—calm analysis during discovery, urgency at the broadcast decision, quiet resolve in the ending. The final image ("fragile, gritty edge of hope, like starlight filtered through smoke") attempts to fuse both registers but tilts slightly ornamental. Coherent and purposeful; minor decorative slip at closure.</comment>
