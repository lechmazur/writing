<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("cautious exuberance," "cyclically reversed") rather than embodied contradiction. The tearing of seven pages suggests a meaningful choice, but the decision lacks dramatized internal conflict—we're told the gravity of preservation without seeing her wrestle with competing impulses in the moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; tears appear once but don't degrade perception or complicate the transcription work. The final choice reads more like thematic positioning than a character-driven renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: first letter → search → library discovery → watch-as-translator → second letter → choice. Orientation anchors arrive late (library found on "the fourth evening" but we lack grounding in the opening ~120 words), triggering a −0.3 penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara tears seven pages and keeps four, foreclosing total documentation. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatically legible—"the knowledge that some silences are not emptiness but seeds" reads as theme summary, not a felt consequence that alters her options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist offers vivid atmosphere, and the "walls translucent as amber" grounds the space. The watch functions as a recurring object that constrains her decoding process across multiple beats, qualifying as micro-setting. However, spatial choreography inside the library is thin—no sense of how she moves among shelves or where the pedestal sits relative to the books. The mist closes behind her at the end, providing a lyric reprise that reweights the space, but the setting doesn't force a tactical choice; it remains backdrop to her contemplation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the library and decode unspoken words—is clear. Pressure tightens when the second letter forces a decision: document all, none, or selectively. Yet the escalation is conceptual rather than dramatized: no competing pressures (time, stamina, external threat) test her commitment on the page. The watch's propagation delays add method texture but don't narrow options; she completes transcription without friction. The final choice (tearing seven pages) arrives without visible tradeoff—no scene work shows what she sacrifices by releasing those particular words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly: the value of silence, the ethics of preservation, the space between intention and utterance. The watch and mist function as recurring images that shift meaning at closure. However, the second letter's prompt ("document everything... nothing... or only what dreamers need") reads as external moralizing rather than a question earned through Elara's prior struggle. The final line—"some silences are not emptiness but seeds"—states the theme outright instead of letting the image of torn pages and dimming library carry the resonance. Thepiece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a dreamy, elevated register ("translucent as amber," "bloom") that fits the fantastical frame. Psychic distance is controlled, though phrases like "cautious exuberance" and "cyclically reversed" feel more like prompt echoes than organic narration. Diction remains consistent but leans abstract at peak moments: "gravity of what she was preserving" tells rather than shows embodied weight. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic noticing that distinguishes Elara's way of filtering the world under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear but carries scaffold and template cadence: "She had received... Its ink still wet as though..." uses a stilted opener; "the library of unspoken words" repeats verbatim across paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("unspoken words... thoughts people had swallowed, confessions they had rehearsed and abandoned") without added pressure. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "symbols blooming," "amber silence," "seeds waiting for the right delay" cluster in adjacent lines, blurring rather than sharpening. Stock metaphors ("mist refuses to leave") and near-clichés ("tears wept") reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—library of unspoken words decoded via backward watch and dream cipher—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (hidden archive, dreamwalker, moral choice). However, execution leans on genre scaffolding: the veiled dreamer archetype, the cryptic letters, the choose-your-burden finale all follow template logic. The propagation-delay mechanic is specific but ornamental; it doesn't alter tactics or stakes on the page. Emotional truth is present in the intimacy of the unspoken words (mother's apology, soldier's love letter) but these examples feel illustrative rather than lived. The transformation test reveals swappability: replace "library" with "vault" and the emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and makes the final choice to tear seven pages. However, most beats are observation and documentation; the key turn (tearing pages) arrives without prior on-page hesitation or competing desire. She qualifies for functional integration but her decisions don't create reversals—setup and closure present, middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The watch appears at the library entrance, is picked up and held to decode intervals across hours, and synchronizes with her heartbeat at closure. It constrains the decoding method and returns with reweighted meaning (folded beside the pages). Setup, development, and payoff all present, but the watch is more translator than obstacle—it doesn't narrow her options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cipher unfolds across her dreams and the watch ticks; she documents intervals to decode it. It shapes her method and appears in the opening dream sequence, the watch-decoding beat, and the final mention of "space between ticks." Setup and payoff present; development functional. However, the cipher mechanics remain abstract—no on-page puzzle that forces a tradeoff or wrong turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" is explained in paragraph two (dreams replay backward, transparencies on light table) and mentioned at closure ("cyclically reversed, the pattern would repeat"). It enables her to read the cipher but doesn't constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is present and logically consistent but remains ornamental; easily replaceable with "layered" or "iterative."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Document" appears in the inciting setup (her role), the middle transcription work (eleven pages), the second letter's choice ("Document everything... nothing... only what dreamers need"), and the final act of tearing/keeping pages. The action defines the stakes and the closure hinges on selective documentation. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure moderate (she could refuse entirely but doesn't). Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Propagation delays are named and explained: the watch ticks "a half-second after she expected," encoding information in gaps, each interval documented. The method is signaled in setup and used in the middle beat, qualifying for two gates. However, the delays don't create friction or failed attempts—she simply transcribes them successfully. Functional but not indispensable; "rhythm" or "pattern" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library is the literal destination, appears vividly (glowing walls, honeyed light, fog), and returns at closure (dims but does not disappear). Setup, development (she enters and works inside), and payoff all present. However, the library supplies resources (books, watch) without constraining choice—no locked doors she must solve, no environmental hazard. It's essential as goal-object but passive as setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seven-day window is declared in the opening and tracked: "three days wandering," "fourth evening," "sixth day," "seventh morning." Time shapes her urgency and the second letter's arrival provides a deadline beat. Setup and payoff present; middle tracking is summary rather than dramatized pressure (no scene shows her racing the clock or forced to choose speed over completeness). Functional but the clock doesn't alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to find the library is stated in the opening ("what she had been dreaming about since childhood") and drives her search across days. The motivation is present in setup, middle (search and decode), and payoff (the choice over what to preserve). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where she's tempted to abandon the search or keep secrets for herself. Functional across beats but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" appears once as a label when she realizes the library's contents. The tone elsewhere is elevated and dreamy but not consistently modulated—wonder, weeping, and decision are narrated at similar emotional distance. No sentence-level rhythm shift at peak beats. The tone is coherent but static, failing to charge the final image or deepen under pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>
