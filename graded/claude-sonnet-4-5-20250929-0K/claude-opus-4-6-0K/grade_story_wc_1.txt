<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, grounded in her glass-artist expertise. The transformation from active revenge-seeking to "purpose in the pauses" feels earned through the frost-reading practice. Internal contradictions appear ("not seeking revenge...surprised her") but could be more embodied in simultaneous impulses during key beats. The final choice to walk deeper into the canyon with both ledgers represents endurance with visible cost—she foregoes immediate action—though the stakes of that renunciation could land more sharply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story builds through frost patterns, ledger decipherment, and the canyon's resonance, deepening Maren's stance from flight to purposeful study. Orientation anchors (canyon, eleven days post-fire, alone with ledger) arrive clearly within the first ~150 words. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she defers confrontation and walks deeper, with the cost legible in "the path would emerge...for those who understood that light must first pass through something broken." The discovery of the second ledger at the 12-day mark provides the meaningful tightening; she now holds complete evidence but chooses patience over revenge. One persistent constraint (the scorched ledger's fragmentary nature) shapes her methodology.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The canyon setting and frost patterns constrain Maren's investigative method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her glass-artist perception ("feathering along cracks, crystallizing where moisture gathered"). Spatial choreography is clean; the cleft, cache, and deeper canyon progression track coherently. The frost functions as micro-setting that alters tactics by revealing smuggler trails, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the body itself (burns healing) could more actively shape a mid-story choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: what to do with the smuggling evidence after the attempt on her life. The discovery of the second, complete ledger provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options—she now has full testimony and must decide. Agency appears as endurance and deferral rather than confrontation, with the cost visible in her choice to walk away from immediate justice. The piece would benefit from a more explicit foregrounded cost; the final walk feels contemplative rather than a visceral trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glass-artist lens: transformation, breakage as prerequisite to beauty, and the liminal spaces where purpose crystallizes. The final image—"light must first pass through something broken before it becomes beautiful"—reweights prior material (her burns, the scorched ledger, shattered glass windows) without overt moralizing. "Purpose lived there, in the liminal, the transitional, the not-yet-decided" risks stating the theme but is anchored to her physical practice of reading frost. The piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Maren's glass-artist expertise. Perceptual signature is distinct: "the behavior of molten glass," "glass singing under heat," "that moment just before it becomes something new." Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; the elevated register ("luminous," "drifting resonance") fits an artist's internal voice. Occasional filter verbs ("she had learned," "she was slowly deciphering") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Rhythm modulates appropriately from urgent opening to contemplative close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; the opening long sentence establishes cadence, later balanced by shorter declaratives. Information density is high—most lines advance character, stakes, or atmosphere. Minor scaffolding appears: "She was steadily adaptive, Maren" reads slightly authorial, and "The ledger strip was a scorched testament—its edges blackened from the very fire meant to destroy all evidence, including her" contains mild redundancy (fire/blackened/scorched). The "glass singing" metaphor recurs purposefully but risks over-reliance. No template runs or loops, and the final image propels cleanly without summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of glass-artist expertise with smuggler investigation offers a fresh angle; using frost patterns as investigative method feels specific and earned. The "scorched testament" core concept integrates tightly. The transformation from revenge to purposeful patience subverts the expected vengeance arc without retreating into abstraction. Risk-taking in pacing—deferring confrontation for contemplative study—heightens thematic stakes. The piece would reach higher bands with a more surprising or less metaphor-announced final insight, as the "broken glass becomes beautiful" line lands close to familiar territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (luminous glass artist) is present from the opening, her expertise shapes her frost-reading method (two beats: daily study, cache discovery), and her choice to walk deeper with both ledgers—deferring justice—drives the closure. Causal pressure is strong: her glass knowledge enables the investigation. Specificity is high; removing "glass artist" would break the frost-pattern methodology.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in the opening (setup), is used actively in multiple beats (matching route markers to canyon features, laying it against frosted rock, discovering the second ledger beneath the cache), and its "scorched testament" quality charges the final image when she rolls both ledgers together. Cost is tied to it: carrying the evidence forces the choice between revenge and patience. Irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" drives stakes from the opening (evidence of the arson and smuggling network) and reappears charged in the cache discovery and final decision. The burnt edges function both literally (fire damage) and thematically (broken beauty). It shapes her options: the incomplete first ledger compels the search; the complete second ledger crystallizes the choice. Removing the concept would collapse the investigation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is stated explicitly ("She was steadily adaptive, Maren") and demonstrated: she pivots from glass artist to investigator, learns frost-reading, and shifts from revenge to purposeful patience. However, the trait is more narrated than tested with visible cost in a single pressured choice. It enables multiple beats but lacks a moment where adaptability itself costs her something specific on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Retrace" structures the entire investigation: she retraces the ledger's geography using frost patterns, follows smuggler trails, and discovers the cache. The action is signaled early (morning unfurling of the strip, matching markers to canyon features) and pays off in the cache discovery. Removing it would eliminate the plot engine. The final walk deeper continues the retracing impulse, though the closure leans contemplative rather than action-driven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" is introduced early (third paragraph), used mechanically across multiple beats (direction, water veins, thickest frost reveals trails), and directly enables the cache discovery (the cleft symbol). The method is specific and irreplaceable: Maren reads frost the way she reads molten glass. Cost is implicit in the daily discipline and the method's fragility (frost melts by midday). Closure participation is strong: frost melting frames the decision moment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "quiet canyon under stars" is established immediately and constrains Maren's choices: isolation enables her investigation, the canyon's features (cleft, loose stone, chambers) provide cache hiding spots, and the acoustic resonance ("wind threading through stone chambers") charges the final image. The setting pressures her to work alone and shapes her pacing (dawn work before frost melts). Micro-setting elements (frosted sandstone, narrow cleft) alter tactics directly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" is signaled in the opening and marked precisely (eleven days ago, twelfth morning). The timeframe establishes stakes (recent trauma, healing burns) and provides light pressure (daily frost cycles). However, the time window does not tighten decisions urgently; Maren's investigation unfolds at a contemplative pace without a live deadline. The passage of days tracks clearly but functions more as backdrop than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is dramatized through Maren's shift from imagined revenge to finding meaning in "the silence between footsteps...the gap where frost formed." The motivation is conflicted (surprise at her own lack of vengeance) and tested in the cache scene: holding complete evidence, she chooses to defer action. The friction between wanting answers and accepting liminal uncertainty drives the closure. The desire is slightly over-articulated ("purpose in the pauses" risks thematic echo) but earned through scene work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" as tone is established through sensory detail (wind through stone chambers, glass singing, frost melting) and modulates with pressure: urgent opening → contemplative study → crystallized final image. The tone charges the ending without becoming static; the canyon's acoustic metaphor ("sound was like glass singing") unifies the sensory palette. The tone stays coherent through the decision beat, supporting the Earned Stasis closure without flattening into single-note lyricism.</comment>
