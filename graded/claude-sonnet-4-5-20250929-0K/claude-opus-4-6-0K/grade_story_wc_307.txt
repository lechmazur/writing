<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's backward-aging condition is established with concrete detail (sixty-one to twenty-five), and her choice to withhold information is motivated by pedagogical philosophy. The student Cael's grief-driven motivation arrives only in the final third, feeling late for full development. Internal contradictions are present (reverence vs. withholding) but the embodied emotion remains abstract in key beats—"warmth rising through the trance" lacks the sensory particularity needed for 8+ work. The final realization about grief feels delivered rather than discovered through concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the wave-interference pattern accumulates meaning through the trance sequence and reweights Cael's understanding of loss at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pond's rings demonstrate vanishing-as-relocation, changing Cael's knowledge with conceptual cost (the grief he must now reframe). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing that lands on the page, though the cost remains largely intellectual rather than viscerally felt. No causality breaks, but the escalation is primarily contemplative rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock, magnetic grotto, iron veins, and basalt pond create a vivid, purpose-driven environment. The grotto's magnetism constrains the meditation by aligning Lira's heartbeat with the planet's core, a tactile detail that charges the setting. The pond becomes a teaching instrument rather than backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (platform edge, grotto below, pond beneath). The setting charges the final image when the platform turns and starlight bends in iron, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape choice or closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching Cael to understand vanishing—is signaled early and maintained. The stone-drop demonstration provides one meaningful deepening when the interference pattern reframes the concept. However, Cael's agency is mostly observational; he tracks rings and receives insight rather than making choices that narrow options. The grief revelation in the final third introduces emotional cost, but it arrives as explanation rather than earned through prior pressure. One tightening occurs (flat water → redistributed energy), meeting minimum requirements but lacking the visible trade-off or foreclosed path needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the wave-interference demonstration: loss as energy redistribution rather than absence. "Delayed revelation was the only kind that changed a person" integrates the core concept without sermonizing. The final image—"you simply have not yet learned to look at the right part of the pond"—offers a resonant answer to grief's question. However, the pedagogical framing ("reverence for the moment a mind discovers its own shape") edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. The sycamore-hush motif recurs but functions more as atmospheric texture than constraint on choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and controlled ("sycamore hush," "molten core"), though some phrases verge on purple ("voice carrying the tone of sycamore hush, that particular stillness found beneath broad leaves"). The perceptual signature is consistent—Lira notices pedagogical moments and magnetic phenomena. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lira's Socratic questions advance the teaching beat. The phrase "woman who weaves truth carefully" appears in exposition rather than demonstrated choice, and register remains uniformly elevated even in moments that might warrant compression under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "held breath," "dark mouth," "sycamore hush," "dawn entering a room" cluster without clear pattern-teaching or payoff proportional to frequency. The exposition "Lira smiled with her young-old face. This was why she withheld—not from cruelty but from reverence..." tells the pedagogical philosophy that prior action already implied, creating a paraphrase loop. Template cadence appears in the trance sequence: "They expand / They fade / Do they?" The prose is clean and grammatical but the metaphor density in non-peak beats (grotto opening, platform drift) reduces propulsion. Information density is adequate but scaffold phrases like "She was a woman who weaves truth carefully" function as telling rather than compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The backward-aging researcher teaching through withholding offers a fresh synthesis of mentor-student tropes. The wave-interference physics as grief metaphor is specific and non-obvious. However, the pedagogical frame (wise teacher, seeking student, delayed revelation) follows a familiar template. The magnetic grotto and floating platform provide distinctive setting details, but the emotional arc—student arrives grieving, receives reframing insight—is well-trodden. Transformation test: the core beats (demonstration, epiphany, application to loss) could transfer to other settings with minor adjustment. One fresh inflection: the backwards-aging curriculum metaphor integrates with the teaching method, though this remains more conceptual than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's backward aging is established early (first paragraph) and referenced at closure ("felt herself a year younger"). Her decision to withhold shapes the teaching method in the middle beat. However, her choices are largely presentational—she demonstrates rather than struggles. The aging trait colors her philosophy ("each reclaimed year peeling back another layer of knowing") but doesn't constrain a key turn with visible cost. Present across three beats but largely ornamental to the central wave-demonstration action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in paragraph two, structures the trance meditation in the middle, and returns at closure when "the grotto's magnetic light pulsed beneath them, stars bending in the iron." The grotto's magnetism aligns Lira's heartbeat with the planet's core, a specific constraint on the meditation. The platform's rotation responds to the grotto's field, shaping choreography. The element is causally active across setup, development, and payoff, though the grotto functions more as atmospheric container than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is named explicitly and frames Lira's teaching philosophy: "She could have told him everything in a single sentence, but a revelation delivered too early becomes information, not understanding. So she chose to withhold." The concept shapes her tactics (Socratic questions, silence, the stone-drop demonstration) and is paid off when Cael's understanding "shifted" through the trance. However, the concept is heavily explicated rather than demonstrated through high-stakes choice. The narrative tells us delayed revelation works rather than showing a costly decision to withhold that risks failure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully, never offering the full shape until the student's own attention had traced its outline" appears as exposition in paragraph six. The trait is demonstrated when Lira asks "Do they?" and waits for Cael to notice the interference pattern. However, the trait is largely synonymous with "delayed revelation" and doesn't introduce a distinct constraint or cost. No moment where careful weaving forecloses an option or creates friction. Present and consistent but functionally redundant with the core concept.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Withholding is introduced in the exposition ("she chose to withhold") and executed in the trance sequence when Lira waits for Cael to track the rings rather than explaining immediately. The action shapes the middle beats (questions, silence, "follow the pattern"). However, the withholding succeeds without complication; no cost or risk is dramatized. The action could be replaced with direct teaching and the emotional arc (grief reframed) would land similarly. Functional but not indispensable to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pond-rings method is signaled early ("I'm going to throw a stone into the water"), demonstrated in the central beat (rings expand, reflect, create interference patterns), and directly applied at closure ("the peak where the flat water sent its energy"). The method's mechanics—wave cancellation and redistribution—shape Cael's realization about grief. The physics are specific enough to feel earned. The method is causally active across all three gates and delivers the conceptual repricing. Strong integration, though the application to grief is explained rather than discovered through Cael's choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating rock platform is established in the opening line and anchors the spatial choreography (Cael "knelt at the platform's edge, afraid to look down"). The platform's rotation in response to the grotto's magnetism creates dynamic staging. At closure, "the platform turned" as Lira feels herself younger. The setting shapes the trance meditation and charges the final image. However, the platform doesn't constrain choice—Cael could receive the same teaching on solid ground. Present across beats and visually distinctive but not mechanically essential to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through the trance" appears as timeframe marker but functions more as a state descriptor than a tightening constraint. "Minutes passed" during the ring-tracking, but no clock pressure emerges. The trance enables the visualization ("he would see them anyway—the trance made observers of the mind") but doesn't impose urgency or limit the teaching window. The element is mentioned at setup and middle but doesn't shape tactics or the closure beat. Functional container, easily swappable with "during the meditation" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To teach vanishing to appear" is introduced as rumor-phrase in paragraph three, explained through the demonstration (vanishing as relocation, not absence), and applied to Cael's grief at closure. Lira's motivation drives her pedagogical choices (withholding, the stone demonstration, the Socratic method). However, the motivation is never tested or conflicted—she succeeds cleanly. No friction between her desire to teach and a cost or competing priority. The motivation shapes the sequence but lacks the struggle or trade-off needed for 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush, that particular stillness found beneath broad leaves when the wind pauses" is introduced in paragraph four and recurs at closure: "suspended above the earth in sycamore hush." The tone—contemplative, quiet, reverent—remains coherent throughout and charges the ending image when paired with the trance holding them "like water holds a stone." The tone modulates slightly when pressure rises (Cael's breath catches) but remains fundamentally still. Purposeful and consistent, meeting the lyric-resonance allowance for early-seed/final-reprise, though the tone doesn't shift meaningfully under pressure.</comment>
