<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—her wax-casting background shapes her perceptual signature and the "technically gentle" touch becomes a visible constraint. The self-forgiveness beat moves into diagnostic territory ("After forgiving yourself...your hands do not become steadier. They become more honest"), but it's anchored to a past failure with the cracked memorial and informs her present stance. Internal contradiction appears in the guilt/worthiness tension, and the final weeping carries embodied specificity. Minor register elevation ("specific grief of someone hearing music they had always known but never encountered") nudges the score down slightly but doesn't flatten the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, under the aurora). The rope-as-memory premise escalates through a single meaningful deepening: the braids encode sound, she reconfigures them, the names blaze forth. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the sanctum fills with voices, ice melts where sound touches, spring is named—with felt cost legible in Elara's weeping and the invocation of her grandfather. One structural ellipsis: the forgiveness reflection occupies ~15% of the text but anchors to the present via the cracked-memorial memory and tilts her present worthiness to do this work. The final image reweights the rope, the names, and the grandfather motif without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is not mere postcard—aurora hues guide her tuning ("adjusting until each name blazed"), ice walls melt where sound touches them, and the cold tightens braids over centuries. The rope itself functions as micro-setting: its copper filaments vibrate, catch light, and constrain her reconfiguration work. The street-organ scrap in her coat pocket and the calipers are handled objects that anchor her method. Spatial choreography remains coherent (kneeling on frozen floor, altar, tools arranged), and sensory hierarchy reflects her craftsperson's attention (copper spacing, wire frequency felt in her teeth). The environment charges the final image directly—melt streams and aurora flare as the names sing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the sound of forgotten names by correcting the rope's encoded braids. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "used the light as her tuning guide," narrowing her method to aurora-responsive reconfiguration. Agency is embodied in her micro-choices—unwinding, caliper-reading, rebraiding—each foreclosing looser alternatives. The cost is legible on the page: the weeping, the invocation of her grandfather, and the acknowledgment that failure was not unworthiness. No antagonist; pressure coheres through the technical precision required and the emotional weight of eight-hundred-year-old voices. The coincidence of the glacier crack that opened the sanctum complicates access but does not resolve the task.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars: destruction as first step of creation (wax casting, unwinding braids), absence making music (punched-card logic, gaps encoding notes), forgiveness yielding honesty rather than steadiness. The street-organ scrap seeds early and returns charged at closure when she presses it to her heart. No overt moralizing; the final image—"making absence sing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without stating a thesis. The forgiveness reflection risks didacticism ("After forgiving yourself...") but ties to the cracked-memorial failure and reframes her present worthiness. Minor thematic echo in "specific grief" but it's woven into sensory experience (weeping, melt, echo) rather than replacing scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance and perceptual signature throughout: Elara notices via a caster's eye (investing wax, caliper precision, mold pressure analogies). Diction remains within her artisan lexicon except for the slightly elevated "specific grief of someone hearing music they had always known but never encountered," a brief register lift that doesn't break focalization. No dialogue to evaluate. The forgiveness reflection uses clean free-indirect style anchored to the present task. Rhythm modulates purposefully—compressed technical beats during the reconfiguration, longer lyric cadences at closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the final paragraphs accelerate without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences layer image, action, and thematic weight ("Each braid was a strand of horsehair and sinew twisted with filaments of copper wire so fine they caught the aurora's glow and held it"). Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports pressure. Two minor loops: "She had come...not for glory or discovery but to preserve" and "She had not always believed she deserved to do this work" both open reflective blocks with similar syntax, but the content advances distinct stakes. The metaphor "veins of molten color" is coherent. One stock phrase: "with all its patient ardor" leans purple without harming clarity. No scaffold, no contradictory vehicles, and the closure paragraphs propel cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting expertise, street-organ punched-card logic, and aurora-tuned acoustic reconfiguration feels specific and non-obvious. The premise risks leaning into mystical convenience (copper wire encoding sound for eight centuries), but the story commits to the technical analogy and grounds it in Elara's artisan knowledge. The forgiveness-as-honesty insight is well-worn material freshened by its tie to casting failure and the rope's correction. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet, lyric closure elevates without obscuring stakes. The final image—grandfather's organ, absence singing, spring arriving—synthesizes prior motifs into inevitable resonance rather than template resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive every major turn: she decides to reconfigure the braids, uses calipers and light-guided tuning to adjust them, and completes the work. Early signal in paragraph one (her tools, her precision). Her casting background enables the "technically gentle" approach and the mold-pressure analogy. The forgiveness reflection shifts her stance from guilt to honest hands, altering her self-permission to do the work. Causal pressure is strong—remove her decisions and the rope remains unreconfigured. Closure linkage: she finishes the last braid, draws the full length through her fingers, and the sanctum fills with voices. Cost is visible in her weeping. Swappability: another artisan could perform the task, but the wax-casting specificity and the grandfather tie make her irreplaceable to this thematic design.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The street-organ scrap appears in three beats: pocket mention when she first understands the rope (paragraph four), comparison of punched-card logic to braids, and the final image when she presses it to her heart. Setup is early; it enables her recognition that "absence made music" and primes the grandfather motif. Development: she holds it against the copper filaments, comparing hole-logic to braid-logic, a concrete micro-choice that validates her method. Closure reprise: pressing it to her heart while weeping charges the ending. Cost is implied—her grief is "specific" to hearing the music she knew through her grandfather now manifested in the rope. Swappability: the punched-card principle could be conveyed another way, but the Prague street organ tie is thematically specific. Two-gate achievement (setup, closure) with light middle involvement caps at ~6.0; the lyric reprise lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transcribed memory shapes stakes immediately: the rope encodes sound via braids (paragraph four, "It was a transcribed memory"). Development: the concept constrains her method—she must decode braid spacing, reconfigure to recover true pitch, and use aurora feedback. Causal pressure is strong: without this premise, the task collapses. Closure: the sanctum fills with voices, "names that had not been spoken aloud in eight hundred years." The concept is irreplaceable—swap it for any other encoding and the street-organ analogy, the copper-wire vibration, and the theme of absence-as-presence all break. Cost: the emotional weight of hearing the dead speak and the forgiveness arc tie to the concept. Three gates (setup, development, closure) with high causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is signaled early (paragraph one, "precision of someone who had spent thirty years") and embodied in paragraph eight: "too much pressure would crack the mold." Development: she unwinds braids with this controlled touch, using calipers and adjusting tension. Causal constraint: rough handling would ruin the encoding, mirroring the cracked-memorial failure. Closure: the attribute enables completion of the last braid without error. Cost: the trait is earned through past failure and forgiveness, making it a visible tradeoff (she had to fail and forgive to gain honest hands). Swappability: another precision trait could work, but "technically gentle" ties specifically to wax-casting and mold investment. Three gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives multiple beats: the aurora responds to corrected braids, brightening where sound is purest (paragraph nine, "She used the light as her tuning guide"). Setup is mid-story but causal—without the feedback, her method lacks verification. Development: each rebraided name causes the aurora to flare, guiding further adjustment. Closure: "the aurora flared emerald overhead" as she finishes, and ice walls melt where sound waves touch. The action is irreplaceable—remove it and her tuning method collapses. Cost: the illumination is both tool and witness, charging the final image. Two-gate (development, closure) with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the braids is signaled in paragraph eight ("Her task was to reconfigure them") and occupies the story's central action. Development: she unwinds each braid, reads copper spacing with calipers, rebraids according to altar notation, tightens until each name sings. The method is specific—not decoding, not repairing, but reconfiguring to recover lost pitch. Causal pressure: without this exact mechanic, the rope remains silent. Closure: "She finished the last braid...the rope lay coiled on the altar, reconfigured, alive with names." The mechanics shape every middle beat and enable the ending. Irreplaceable and tied to visible cost (the precision required, the forgiveness-earned honesty). Three gates with high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora is present from line one ("aurora threaded itself through the ice ceiling"). Setup: frozen floor, blue-white chambers, hummed light. Development: the setting supplies the aurora as tuning guide and the ice as resonant medium; cold has tightened braids over centuries, creating the problem. Closure: ice walls melt where sound touches them, spring is invoked. The environment constrains her work (cold, isolation, aurora feedback) and charges the final image. Swappability: another remote site could work, but aurora-as-feedback and ice-as-witness are irreplaceable to this design. Three gates with strong closure linkage and moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" appears in the reflection (paragraph ten) and reframes her worthiness. Setup is delayed to mid-story but anchors her present stance. Development: the forgiveness allows honest hands rather than steady ones, altering her self-permission. Closure: the weeping and the specific grief tie to the forgiveness arc, though not explicitly named. The timeframe is conceptual rather than a ticking clock—it's a before/after shift, not urgent pressure. Causal role is present but oblique. Cost: she had to forgive to do this work. Swappability: another internal shift could substitute. Two gates (setup via reflection, closure via emotional payoff) with light causal pressure. The lyric reprise (forgiveness enabling completion) lifts slightly above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Preserving the sound of forgotten names is stated explicitly in paragraph six ("She had come to this icebound place...to preserve the sound of forgotten names") and drives every choice. Setup is clear; the motivation shapes her decoding and reconfiguring work. Development: the rope holds "names of the dead recited so they would not be lost," and her labor is to recover them. Closure: the sanctum fills with voices, "each one a person who had once stood in firelight and been called to supper, to prayer, to love." Friction: the forgiveness arc and the grandfather memory complicate the desire, adding personal cost. Irreplaceable—remove this motive and the story's stakes vanish. Three gates with strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is not named but embodied throughout: ice walls run with thin melt streams at closure, "Spring, with all its patient ardor, was already on its way." Setup: aurora colors (violet, pale green, emerald) establish lyric tone. Development: the tone modulates from technical precision (calipers, wire spacing) to lyric intensity (weeping, voices overlapping). Closure: the melt and spring invocation charge the final image with warmth emerging from cold. The tone coheres without static mood—precision gives way to resonance. Swappability: another tone could fit, but "snowmelt ardor" (cold yielding to warmth, preservation enabling release) is specific to this thematic design. Three gates with strong closure modulation.</comment>
