<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied through sensory memory: "Her hands remembered the vibration of reactive compounds." The motivation to rebuild is earned through eleven years of carrying the bottle and rejecting false comfort, with visible cost in her isolation. Internal contradiction surfaces in "deserted" versus "last alchemist"—she frames abandonment as identity. Minor slip: the final choice to rebuild lanterns feels somewhat solitary and declarative rather than tested by on-page friction with another character or immediate obstacle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Maren, dock, post-wish Cove. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory memory layers ("copper and wet stone and something sweeter") deepen until the conception of resonance replaces extraction. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "a beginning that had rejected the need to be wished for" reweights the premise with conceptual cost—she commits to labor over magic. The cost is felt in her solitude and the enormity of the task, though the final image stops just short of showing a tangible consequence that alters her immediate situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Cove's hollow lanterns, rusted hooks, and chalk-dry well anchor the setting with decay that mirrors lost purpose. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting, constraining choice: its sealed nature forces Maren toward resonance rather than extraction. The restored lanterns "humming faintly in the wind" charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (dock, boardwalk, laboratory). The setting drives the central conflict and supplies the tool for closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: whether to abandon or reimagine the Cove. Pressure accumulates through rejection of wagon seats, eleven years carrying the bottle, and the sleepless conception. The tightening occurs when she shifts from trying to open the bottle to using it sealed—a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her isolation and the labor of rebuilding ("slowly, precisely"), though the piece ends at the threshold of consequence rather than showing a complication arising from her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sealed amber as seed, resonance versus extraction, labor versus granted wishes. The final image—"a beginning that had rejected the need to be wished for"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether magic or effort sustains civilization. No moralizing; the restored lanterns embody the theme without stating it. The piece resists tidy binaries (magic bad / labor good) by showing the Residuum still matters, just differently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV stable, third-limited on Maren. Perceptual signature is distinct: "copper and wet stone and something sweeter beneath, like crushed night-blooming flowers." Diction matches an alchemist's lexicon ("transmutation," "harmonic frequency," "Residuum") without clinical coldness. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("working memory") to distanced closure observation. Minor register drift: "fertile soil, clean water, breathable purpose" edges toward elevated abstraction in a high-stakes beat, though "breathable purpose" rescues specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("seamless, a solid teardrop of fossilized resin with no opening, no stopper, no seam"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor template cadence in middle beats: "She rejected each offer. She rejected every false comfort..." reads as purposeful parallelism but borders on pattern repetition. No loops or muddy metaphors; figurative language (lanterns "eyeless," throat "that had forgotten song") is clear and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, resonance physics, and post-magical-infrastructure collapse feels specific and non-obvious. The reversal—sealed bottle as seed, not extractable fuel—is earned by prior exposition of her failed opening attempts. Risk-taking in the quiet, solo ending elevates without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative trace: abandoned magical town + lone practitioner echoes familiar post-fantasy templates, though the resonance solution and labor-over-wish theme transform it enough to avoid template scoring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices create all key turns: rejecting wagon seats, conceiving resonance overnight, stripping the first lantern. Present throughout; her decision to rebuild rather than open the bottle defines the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber bottle handled in multiple beats: carried eleven years, held up to light, failed opening attempts recounted, resting on dock, its frequency calibrated for lanterns. Its sealed state forces the resonance solution; its presence charges the final image. Removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost town revival shapes the dominant stake and all tactics on the page. The emptiness ("silence of a throat that had forgotten song") creates pressure; her choice to restore lanterns rather than leave enacts the revival. The concept is not merely thematic—it alters every on-page option.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rejecting false comfort constrains on-page action with visible cost: she turns down wagon seats, warm rooms, and university posts, resulting in her solitude. The trait appears early and drives the refusal to "pretend the Cove had not mattered." Cost is isolation and the enormity of solo labor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Conceive" anchors the major turn from extraction to resonance. The conception occurs on-page ("sleepless and pacing the empty laboratory") and redefines all subsequent options. Swapping this action would require reconstructing the climax; it is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is signaled early and mechanically matters: "not through books or formulae, but through the accumulated weight of everything she had handled, smelled, tasted, and measured." The method shapes her attempt—sensory recall leads to resonance insight. Without this specific means, the turn feels unmotivated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove pressures all choices: hollow lanterns symbolize lost purpose, rusted hooks supply the rebuild infrastructure, the dock stages her reflection and labor. The setting's decay and her restoration alter tactics and charge the final image. Removing the Cove's specifics breaks thematic and plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe ("three days ago," "eleven years") anchors urgency and investment. The recent cessation ("last wish had been granted three days ago") creates the inciting void. The eleven-year carry establishes stakes. Time does not tick on-page during the rebuild, limiting upper range, but the frame shapes all decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation dramatized through rejection of comfort, sleepless pacing, and the labor of stripping lanterns. Internal friction surfaces: "something harder and more honest than wishes" versus the enormity of solo rebuilding. The desire to "reimagine" rather than resurrect defines the closure choice and its cost.</comment>
