<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Senna's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her translator's methodical care. The motivation to understand transition—driven by Tariq's death—shapes her present choices with embodied grief ("the ambition itself, the unresolved question that clung to her ribs like a second skeleton"). Internal contradiction surfaces when scholarly tenderness meets desperate need, though the final act of planting the seed feels more contemplative than agonized. Minor slip: the epiphany about "architecture of the question" risks abstraction, though it's quickly grounded in the physical act of planting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph: Senna, magnetic arbor, post-spirit departure. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, translation work, and the seed's cuneiform, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she plants the seed and whispers Tariq's name, reweighting her solitary grief into collaborative continuity. Cost is felt (accepting ongoing incompleteness, rooting work that will outlive her) but slightly oblique—the whisper and planting carry emotional weight without a sharp before/after in her situation. The closure image is legible and the lens holds, though the tightening is more deepening than escalating.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: branches following invisible field lines, hum through teeth and kneecaps, bark fissures where field lines converge. The seed as micro-setting object constrains her choice—she must decode it, then plant it where magnetism will nurture it. The arbor's sensory signature (ozone, hum, magnetized bark) filters through Senna's scholarly attention and charges the final image when the tree "carries [Tariq's name] downward through its roots." Environment enables the closure act and imbues it with resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understand the physics of transition to resolve Tariq's unfinished work and her own haunted grief. Pressure accumulates through the translation sequence (archaic cuneiform, analogical bridges, crystallizing insight about resonance) and deepens when the seed pulses magnetically against her chest. The planting is an active choice that forecloses solitary mourning in favor of shared continuity, with visible cost (accepting incompleteness, rooting work beyond her lifespan). One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient here, though the escalation reads more as layering than narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—haunted ambitions as ongoing work, transition as resonance rather than departure—emerges through concrete particulars: cuneiform wedges, the seed's pulse, the arbor's magnetic hum. The final image (whispering Tariq's name into bark, roots carrying it downward) reweights the opening absence without stating a moral. "All unfinished sentences eventually find their endings" risks thematic summary but is integrated into the magnetized world's logic. Subtext operates in the contrast between Senna's methodical care and her desperate need, and in the invitation to "reestablish" rather than complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited with tight focalization through Senna's scholarly, methodical lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices cuneiform wedges, analogical bridges, the texture of symbols as "small creatures she was trying not to startle." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("touching distance—so close to the stars she could almost feel their warmth"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "haunted ambitions...are worse than haunted houses because you carry the haunting with you" reads slightly writerly for peak interiority, though it coheres with her journal-keeping habit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful: "cathedral of living iron," "clouds shifted like pages turning," resonance as frequency change. Sentence structures vary, propelling through the translation sequence and breathing at the planting. Minor deductions: "kindly methodical" appears twice in similar phrasing (opening and later reflection on analogical thinking); the phrase "touching distance" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly decorative rather than necessary. No loops or scaffold, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of magnetic arbors, cuneiform translation, and spirit-transition physics is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of grief into collaborative continuity through planting a knowledge seed avoids the generic mourning arc. However, the "scholar decoding ancient wisdom after a mentor's death" frame is familiar, and the piece does not fully subvert it—Senna enacts the arc without significant resistance or complication. The magnetic world-building and the resonance metaphor elevate, but the emotional trajectory follows a somewhat expected path from solitary grief to symbolic reestablishment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Senna's translator skills drive two key beats: decoding the seed's cuneiform (middle) and deciding to plant it (closure). Her methodical care shapes her approach throughout, and the planting choice is causally earned by the translation insight. Present early, active in escalation, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The seed appears early (spirit leaves it), is handled and translated at length (middle third), pulses against her chest (raising stakes), and is planted in the fissure where field lines converge (closure act). Its cuneiform inscription provides the key insight about resonance. Removing it would collapse the story's structure and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Haunted ambitions frame Senna's motivation from the outset ("the ambition itself...clung to her ribs like a second skeleton") and shape her decision to follow the spirit and plant the seed to continue Tariq's work. The concept is named and explored but operates more as thematic coloring than a constraint that narrows tactical options on the page. It appears in setup and closure but does not create visible friction in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is named early and demonstrated through her translation approach ("numbered her notes and color-coded her uncertainties," treating symbols as "small creatures she was trying not to startle"). It enables her successful decoding but does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost—her care works smoothly without tradeoff. Present and consistent, but more coloring than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The act of reestablishing Tariq's work by planting the seed is the story's culminating choice, directly shaped by the translation insight and her grief. It transforms her stance from solitary mourning to collaborative continuity and charges the final image. Swapping "reestablish" for a synonym like "continue" would preserve logic but lose the precision of rooting interrupted research in living wood.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Analogical thinking is named early as Senna's method and demonstrated on the page: comparing unfamiliar signs to known forms, building bridges of resemblance, the "water" sign with extra vertical suggesting "flow with resistance." The method enables her to decode the seed's inscription, which then motivates the planting. Present in setup and active in the middle beat, though not explicitly invoked at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is introduced immediately, provides vivid sensory grounding (hum through teeth, magnetized bark, field lines), and directly enables the closure: Senna plants the seed in a fissure where two field lines converge, and the tree carries Tariq's name downward through its roots. The setting is indispensable—no other location could perform this function within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the spirit leaves" anchors the opening and establishes the seed as the spirit's legacy. It shapes Senna's immediate situation (she climbs to find what was left behind) but does not create ongoing temporal pressure or narrow her decision window. The "after" is more situational setup than live constraint; the story does not track elapsed time or impose a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to understand transition is rooted in Tariq's death, voiced explicitly ("she needed to understand the physics of transition"), and dramatized through her choice to follow the spirit and later to decode and plant the seed. The motivation shapes both her presence at the arbor and her final act. Slight friction: the translation work proceeds smoothly without visible internal conflict between grief and scholarly rigor.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone of "touching distance" is established early ("the deep indigo of touching distance—so close to the stars she could almost feel their warmth") and modulates with pressure: intimate in the translation sequence, charged at the planting when she presses the seed and whispers Tariq's name. The tone coheres through the lyric/accumulative mode and imbues the final image with quiet resonance. Slightly abstract as a label but enacted concretely on the page.</comment>
