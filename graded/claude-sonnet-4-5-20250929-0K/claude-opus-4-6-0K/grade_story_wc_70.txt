<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's involuntary truthfulness is embodied through consistent constraint—she "could not lie, not even politely"—and drives the climactic toll-payment when she names Gareth despite the ash-taste cost. Her interior is specific: "the terrible gravity of involuntary truth" anchors motivation without therapy-speak. Gareth's backstory is economical and his motivation (preserve wonder) arrives through Maren's understanding, adding pressure to her reveal. Minor: Luce remains functional but one-note; his surprise is asserted rather than shown through micro-reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → Luce climbs → riddle discovered → Maren reveals Gareth, each beat linked by because/therefore. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren chooses to keep the riddle and ask it of future climbers, a refusal to let wonder fade that forecloses silence with visible cost ("the words tasted like ash"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when the riddle forces Maren's hand. Cost is felt on the page in her choice to preserve the question despite betraying Gareth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower's "subsonic groan," "conductor rods," and "hive chambers empty and waiting" constrain the stakes and charge the final image. Dusk described as "spilled honey" and "nectar" recurs to frame tone and setting without becoming ornamental. Spatial choreography is clean: booth, stairs, landing. The lacquer box and matchbox are tactile anchors. The tower functions as micro-setting whose mechanics (drones, capacitor rods) drive the blackout and Maren's choice to preserve wonder through her toll-question.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Maren will reveal the saboteur—is signaled when Luce says "You know who did this." One meaningful tightening: the riddle's answer (the drones themselves) forces Maren's involuntary truth into collision with loyalty. Agency is decision with on-page cost: naming Gareth tastes like ash, yet she adds context to preserve his intent. The resolution is earned by her trait and her final choice to keep the riddle, narrowing options (she cannot unsay his name, but she can honor his motive). Coincidence does not resolve; Maren's constraint does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder in routine, the cost of being seen—emerges through the riddle, the drones' "ten thousand tiny wings," and Maren's final choice to ask the question as her toll. No thesis statement; the ending image (she will watch faces "remember to wonder") reweights prior material without a moral. Gareth's sabotage and Maren's involuntary truth create a non-literal answer: transparency and visibility carry costs, yet silence erases the miraculous. The lacquer box and matchbox accumulate meaning without symbolic convenience. Subtext operates in Maren's added defense of Gareth and her pocket-keeping of the riddle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited, close to Maren, with stable distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "spilled honey," "ash," "humming dark" reflect her attentiveness to small wonders. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Luce's "You know who did this" and Maren's added explanation pursue subtext (she cannot lie, but she can contextualize). Diction ("subsonic groan," "lacquer box," "gold leaf patterning") fits an observant toll keeper. Rhythm modulates: lyric in the opening dusk, terse at the reveal, reflective at closure. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Information density is high: "She was involuntarily truthful. Something in her neurology, the doctors said, some misfired circuit that made deception impossible" conveys backstory, trait, and consequence in two sentences. Rhythm varies: lyric opening ("amber light...pooled...like spilled honey"), compressed peak ("'It was Gareth,' she said, and the words tasted like ash"), reflective close. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (honey/nectar/amber/dusk form a pattern). No template cadence, synonym churn, or register drift. Sentence openings and lengths vary naturally. Propulsion is consistent; every line advances character, world, or theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination—involuntary truth + sabotage riddle + toll keeper—feels specific and non-obvious. The riddle's answer (the drones themselves) is a fresh inflection: Gareth's act forces visibility onto overlooked infrastructure. Maren's choice to honor his intent by preserving the question (rather than simply condemning or forgiving) avoids binary resolution. The toll-as-conversation frame and the drones-as-pollinators metaphor are grounded in world logic, not ornament. Risk is moderate: the premise could have leaned harder into the ethical calculus of involuntary truth versus loyalty. No close echoes of famous lines; emotional specificity (ash-taste, the riddle kept in her pocket) avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's toll-keeper role is signaled in the opening third and drives two key beats: she lets Luce pass after questioning, then names Gareth under constraint. Her final choice to keep the riddle and ask it of future climbers shapes the closure image. Her involuntary truthfulness constrains the reveal and adds visible cost (ash-taste, conflicted loyalty). The character's decisions alter tactics (she cannot lie, so she contextualizes) and charge the ending. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lacquer box is introduced in the first third when Luce sets it on the counter. It holds the matchbox and riddle, enabling the reveal. It reappears when Luce takes it back. The box's beauty ("black and deep red, with gold leaf patterning") is noted but does not constrain choice beyond containing the riddle. Two beats (arrival, departure), but the box itself is more container than active agent. Closure credit is indirect: the riddle matters more than the vessel. Swappable with any distinctive container.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is the inciting event (tower shudder at 4:47 PM, blackout) and stakes anchor: without the drones, the city loses power. The riddle's answer is the drones themselves, making the concept central to Gareth's motive and Maren's understanding. The failure shapes tactics (Luce investigates, Maren names Gareth) and charges the final image (empty hive chambers, Maren's vow to preserve wonder). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, high irreplaceability, cost connection. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren's involuntary truthfulness is introduced in the first third ("she could not lie, not even politely") and constrains the climactic reveal: "And there it was, the terrible gravity of involuntary truth." The trait enables one key turn (naming Gareth) with visible cost ("the words tasted like ash") and shapes her final choice (she adds context because truth keeps moving). Early signal, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, high specificity (neurological detail), cost connection. The attribute is indispensable; removing it collapses the central conflict.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The reveal ("It was Gareth") is the major turn that alters the scene's stakes and Maren's stance. It arrives at the peak beat, driven by Luce's question and Maren's constraint. The reveal enables her follow-up defense of Gareth's motive and sets up her final choice to honor his intent. Causal pressure is high; the action is not swappable (Maren's involuntary truth makes it inevitable). Cost is visible (ash-taste, betrayal). Closure linkage is strong: the reveal leads directly to her decision to keep the riddle. Two distinct beats (reveal, contextualize).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the riddle is introduced in the first third when Luce opens the lacquer box. It enables the reveal by giving Maren the answer (the drones) and thus the knowledge that Gareth is responsible. The riddle's final sentence ("Kill the answer and the city forgets how to breathe") charges Maren's understanding and her choice to preserve wonder. Two beats (discovery, Maren's reflection). The riddle is not swappable; its specific content (what feeds on lightning, hums, builds) is essential. Causal pressure and closure linkage present, but the matchbox itself is less critical than the riddle inside.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lightning Tower Seven is present from the title and opening paragraph. The tower's mechanics (drones, capacitor rods, conductor arrays) drive the blackout and Gareth's motive. Maren's booth at the tower's base is the sole location, anchoring spatial clarity. The tower's "subsonic groan," "hive chambers empty and waiting," and "conductor rods bare" charge the final image. The setting constrains choice (Luce must climb, Maren must toll) and shapes the ending's resonance (wonder in infrastructure). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, high irreplaceability. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("three hours old now," "4:47 PM") is signaled in the opening third and shapes urgency: the blackout has already occurred, the city is dark, and Luce is investigating. The evening dusk ("last amber light," "nectar at dusk") tightens atmosphere and charges the closure image (stars "only appeared when the grid went silent"). Two beats (blackout as inciting event, dusk as closure frame). Time constrains tactics (Luce investigates immediately, Maren reflects on what happens "tomorrow") and charges tone. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; cost is implicit (the city waits in darkness).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gareth's desire to "preserve wonder in routine" is introduced when Maren reflects on his motive and anchors the thematic question. It drives his sabotage (the riddle, the blackout) and Maren's final choice: she keeps the riddle to make technicians "remember to wonder." The motivation is dramatized through Gareth's act and Maren's conflicted loyalty, creating friction between cost (betrayal, blackout) and intent (visibility, wonder). Early signal, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, high irreplaceability, cost connection. The motivation is indispensable; removing it empties the story's thematic charge and Maren's choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "nectar dusk" tone is established in the opening line ("amber light...pooled...like spilled honey") and recurs throughout ("sky the color of nectar," "thick and golden as old honey"). Tone modulates with pressure: lyric and reflective in the opening, terse at the reveal ("the words tasted like ash"), back to reflective lyricism at closure. The tone charges the final image (dusk, bare tower, waiting hive chambers) and coheres with the theme (wonder, delicacy, loss). Early signal, closure linkage, purposeful modulation. Slightly less indispensable than other elements but deeply integrated.</comment>
