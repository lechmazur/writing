<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and driven by contradiction—she opens wounds for others but mourns the erasure of her own scars. The telepathy attribute remains label-only until the oak's message; it generates a realization but no prior struggle or cost. Embodied emotion is present ("hands trembling," gripping the table) but the shift from mourning to acceptance feels rapid, with the final stance emerging more from the plants' assertion than from on-page choice under pressure. Internal conflict is more sequential than simultaneous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (tower, garden, post-surgery dawn). The piece employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: scars → excision → organic return → closure choice to "walk both passages." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren inverts the hourglass and descends, crystallizing dual options with palpable cost (letting time resume, accepting transformation). The drive holds, and the final image reweights the opening wound. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and cost is legible in her descent into uncertainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tower and garden are vivid and selective: frosted hourglass catching bruised-purple light, jasmine along the eastern wall, oak roots through centuries of soil. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (tower to garden descent). The oak constrains the closure choice by asserting "the scars are not gone," making the environment a participant rather than backdrop. Coffee rings function as micro-setting, charging the dual-tunnel image. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's attention without catalog-listing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to read her scars versus accepting their erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the oak reframes removal as translation. The reversal (scars will return as chlorophyll) narrows her mourning into a choice to walk both passages. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she inverts the hourglass, letting frozen time resume. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single meaningful deepening; the cost is more conceptual (accepting transformation) than viscerally tested on the page, keeping the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wounds as testimony versus transformation through organic return. The coffee rings and hourglass recur purposefully, charging the final image without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (scars becoming wisteria, walking dual passages) without thesis-stating. One small slip: "displaced miracle" appears only as a phrase without dramatized cost, and "already learning a new language" leans slightly abstract. Otherwise, the piece earns its thematic question through particulars and refuses tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren reads coffee rings, hears green hum, interprets remnants. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("meteor-hush," "tectonic murmur"). No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "the scars are not gone" is quoted as the oak's direct thought, which edges toward telepathic clarity that might strain plausibility, but the piece has taught its own rule (accidental telepathy). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and the final sentence's syntactic build supports closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly strong: varied syntax, selective detail, high information density. Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Two frictions lower the score: "It was saying: the scars are not gone" and "groaned with something she could only call approval" are slight tell-scaffolds in otherwise showing prose. The phrase "something enormous passing through the atmosphere" in the meteor-hush simile is evocative but borders on over-extension. No loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion hold. Minor filter-verb use ("felt it," "could hear") is acceptable given the telepathy premise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—accidental plant telepathy post-fertilizer accident, scars excised then composted into the garden—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of closure-seeker, organic return, and dual-passage choice feels earned in hindsight. Execution is careful, not flashy; emotional truth (mourning lost stories, accepting transformation) avoids template arcs. One constraint: the telepathy and organic-return conceit are introduced rather than discovered through protagonist struggle, which slightly softens ingenuity. Still, the combination of elements and the frosted-hourglass anchor create a memorable, coherent vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as closure seeker is established early (finding the missing, sitting with the dying) and her scars are residue of that work. Her final choice—to walk both passages, to let time resume—grows from this trait. The attribute shapes the dominant stake and participates in closure (descent into the garden where scars will bloom). Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending action. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice is more acceptance than struggle. Two beats (opening mourning, final descent) plus closure linkage place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in the opening (sand suspended) and returns at the closure turn (Maren inverts it, sand falls). The object carries symbolic and causal weight: her refusal to let time advance after her mother's death, then the choice to resume. Two distinct beats plus closure participation. Its inversion is the hinge action that enables her descent. Irreplaceability is high—no generic timepiece would carry the freeze/flow logic. Strong integration, just shy of indispensable because the scars-to-chlorophyll revelation drives the turn more than the hourglass itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Displaced miracle" is named once ("A displaced miracle: her history, translated into chlorophyll") and shapes the conceptual resolution—scars excised in one place, returned as plants elsewhere. The concept enables the closure choice (walking both passages, scars becoming wisteria). Present in setup (surgery removes scars), middle (oak's message), and ending (descent into transformed garden). Causal role is moderate; the miracle is told more than dramatized. No visible cost tied specifically to displacement. Lyric reprise structure with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accidental telepathy with plants is introduced early (fertilizer accident three years ago) and enables the oak's message ("the scars are not gone"), which reframes Maren's mourning and triggers the closure choice. The trait supplies the key information that organic matter returns. Present in setup, drives one major beat (oak's revelation), and indirectly shapes the ending. One constraint: the telepathy itself incurs no visible cost or struggle on the page; it functions as a convenient channel. Two beats (green hum, oak's message) plus closure linkage, but swappability (a gardener's intuition could substitute) lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears metaphorically in the coffee-ring image (overlapping circles as cross-section of a tunnel, dual passages) and literally in the oak's roots tunneling through soil. The dual-passage metaphor shapes the final choice ("walk both passages"). Present in middle and ending. No physical tunneling action; the element is figurative scaffolding. Swappable with "path" or "passage" with minor edits. One thematic beat plus closure participation, but ornamental use and high swappability cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Maren examines coffee rings in one beat, reading them as "two circles intersecting… like the cross-section of a tunnel" and "overlapping lives she kept trying to stitch together." This act of interpretation signals her method (reading meaning in remnants) and primes the dual-passage closure choice. Present in setup (her habit of reading scars, rings, sediment) and middle (coffee-ring examination). The method shapes one key turn (recognizing dual paths). No return at closure itself; the examination occurs once. Functional but limited causal role; one beat plus thematic link places it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn is anchored early and supplies the spatial frame: Maren sits above the garden, watches sky shift, handles the hourglass. The setting's verticality enables the final descent, and the garden below (where scars will bloom) is the destination that completes the closure. Dawn's "meteor-hush" light charges the atmosphere. Present in setup, middle (view of garden), and ending (descent). The tower-to-garden axis constrains the final action. Three beats plus closure participation, with moderate causal pressure. Strong integration just below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" is signaled in the opening line and the dawn setting tracks through bruised purple to gold. Anesthesia wearing off generates the immediate pain and heightened perception that frame the story. Time is tracked (dawn breaking fully) but does not tighten decisions tactically; the hourglass inversion marks emotional release, not a deadline. Present in setup and ending. One beat (opening sensation) plus atmospheric continuity. Moderate causal role; the timeframe sets tone more than it pressures choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's desire to read scars as strata is stated early, mourned when surgery erases them, and transformed when the oak reveals they will return. The motivation drives the dominant stake and is tested in the closure choice (accept transformation, walk both passages). Friction is present: she wanted scars as testimony but must accept their new form (chlorophyll). Present in setup, middle conflict, and ending resolution. The motivation is dramatized through her grief and the final descent. Three beats, clear cost (letting go of scar-reading as she knew it), strong causal link to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named once and enacted throughout: "the silence that follows something enormous passing through the atmosphere, when the world holds its breath." The tone is quiet, suspended, reverent, held steady from bruised-purple dawn through the final descent. Modulates subtly (mourning to green hum to gold breaking) without breaking coherence. The tone charges the final image (descent into the garden) and supports the Charged Poise closure. Consistent across turns, integrates with concept and setting. Strong tonal control that elevates the ending without becoming static.</comment>
