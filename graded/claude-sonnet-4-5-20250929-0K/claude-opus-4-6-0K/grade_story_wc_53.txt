<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's scavenging task is coherent and her embodied confusion about chronology creates genuine interior pressure. The ghost encounter shows purposeful character-specific perception (she seeks negotiation, not apology), and the camera wheel moment earns a micro-turn via concrete memory fragments. However, the final choice lacks visible cost—the ghost's response "rearranged every fragment" is told rather than shown through a decisive forfeiture or stance crystallization on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Maren, scavenger), where (kinetic lagoon above clouds), and when (after carousel halts) by the opening paragraph. The piece sustains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments accrue, time folds, and the ghost negotiation lands as Charged Poise—a crystallized moment where Maren's question ("what's worth wanting now") reconfigures the stake without requiring an explicit decision. Cost is felt (all prior ambitions laid bare) though the final image tells us cards are "almost, almost" readable rather than showing the reordering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon—cloud-salt, carousel base, stone lip—grounds every beat. The camera wheel as micro-setting object charges the closure by returning with reweighted meaning (film advancing = forward motion). Sensory detail (mist curling, cloud-salt corrosion, kinetic pulses fading) filters through Maren's scavenger priorities. The lagoon's stillness at closure acts as purposeful environmental pressure that brackets the negotiation scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate with the ghost / reckon with eroded ambitions) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through fragment collection. The camera wheel beat functions as a meaningful tightening: Maren's recognition that "these were her stories" narrows options by forcing her to face the ghost. The final negotiation deepens the stake via Maren's question, which reweights all prior scavenging. Cost is legible in the laying-down of fragments as confession, though the ghost's reply withholds on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (eroded ambitions, the cost of survival over aspiration) emerges from concrete particulars—hairpin, bolt, ticket stub—without overt statement. The camera wheel's "resolute click" at closure offers a non-literal answer to "what's worth wanting now": the ghost models forward motion (film advancing) as stance. Subtext operates cleanly in Maren's "I'm not here to apologize" and the ghost's silent kneeling. The final image resists moralizing and reweights all prior fragments without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual signature is distinct: she perceives time as "shuffled cards" and ambitions as "silt," filtering sensory detail through scavenger priorities (cloud-salt corrosion, kinetic pulses). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("I know what we wanted…") carries subtext (confession, negotiation) and advances the ghost encounter without exposition. Purposeful compression ("or was it years?") and temporal elision teach the chronological confusion without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("It didn't matter. What mattered was the ghost.") accelerate, longer accretive sentences ("She had first seen it three stops ago…") breathe. Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "cloud-salt" anchors setting and scavenger wear). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "Had she picked the cloud-reefs first, or the drowned pavilions? Had the carousel still been spinning…" cycles the same question structure, costing −0.3. No loops touch closure; the final image ("cards face-up in an order she could almost, almost, read") is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above clouds and chronological confusion synthesize fresh constraints; the ghost-as-younger-self negotiation avoids therapy-speak by grounding it in scavenger fragments. The camera wheel's "resolute click" (film advancing) transforms the trope of confronting past selves into a forward-motion gesture earned by prior particulars. Risk-taking in the temporal fold and the withheld ghost dialogue heightens stakes without gimmickry. The specific micro-setting (disposable camera wheel, cloud-salt, carousel) feels irreplaceable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's scavenger role drives three beats: collecting the camera wheel (early), recognizing her own stories (middle tightening), and laying fragments before the ghost (closure). Each beat involves a choice (listening, pressing palm to forehead to hold timeline, setting bag down as offering) that narrows options. She is present in the final image but the ghost's reply does the reordering work; Maren's agency at closure is receptive rather than decisively altering.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears in three beats: found and listened to (early third), recognized as her story (middle), and offered to the ghost who turns it once with a "resolute click" (closure). Its grooved thumbscrew and film-advancing function are irreplaceable; the click charges the final image as forward motion. The wheel's corrosion and the ghost's handling reweight its meaning from relic to active gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions shape the dominant stake from the opening (carousel halted, kinetic system winding down) through every fragment (hairpin/scholarship, bolt/lover, ticket stub/survival choice) to the negotiation with the ghost who holds the camera "that still had film in it." The concept constrains Maren's tactics (she collects evidence to bargain) and charges the closure question: "what's worth wanting now." It is thematic and structural.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chronological confusion appears early ("though she had long since lost the ability to place days") and recurs in four beats: scavenging order unclear, "three stops ago—or three stops from now," photographer ambition timeline slip ("Or was that next?"), and the deck-shuffling metaphor. It constrains one visible action (pressing palm to forehead) and charges the final image (cards laid face-up in readable order). The trait is more thematic coloring than a cost-bearing choice driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Regret operates as motive (Maren recognizes "her eroded ambitions" in the fragments) and drives the middle tightening ("the regret hit her sideways"). It propels the ghost negotiation but does not itself turn the plot—the camera wheel's click and the ghost's unspoken reply do. Regret is felt and embodied ("raw from the thin air") but the peak choice is Maren's question, not the regret itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fragment collection is signaled early (salvage bag, "looking for fragments… stories clung to objects"), demonstrated in the camera wheel beat (she holds it and listens), and itemized at the ghost encounter (hairpin, bolt, ticket stub laid as evidence). The method shapes two beats: the listening ritual and the offering. The ghost's film-advancing click mirrors the method, turning collected evidence into forward motion at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lagoon is present in every beat: opening (carousel halts, currents grind to silence), middle (stone lip, cloud-salt corrosion, kinetic pulses fading), and closure ("for the first time… truly still"). Its kinetic system winding down mirrors Maren's eroded ambitions. The "edge where cloud became nothing" supplies the negotiation arena. The lagoon's stillness at closure pressures the ghost's response and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The carousel's halt anchors the opening and frames all action as "after." The fading kinetic pulses track elapsed time across beats. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—Maren's scavenging pace is unchanged—and the lagoon's stillness at closure is atmospheric rather than a deadline. The halt is a structural frame but does not constrain choices under time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ghost negotiation is Maren's explicit goal from mid-story ("she needed to speak with it, to negotiate some kind of truce") and structures the final third: approach, offering fragments, and the question "what's worth wanting now." Friction appears in "I'm not here to apologize"—she seeks forward terms, not reconciliation. The ghost's silent response and the unreadable reordering create cost by withholding resolution. The desire is dramatized in gesture (setting bag down, placing the wheel) and drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fractured stillness is introduced in the opening ("peace was too whole a word… Fractured stillness—that was closer") and sustained through contradictory images: kinetic pulses fading but not gone, memories of motion rippling the surface, time folding. The tone modulates under pressure (sharper at "the regret hit her sideways") and reaches peak coherence at closure: "truly still" yet charged by the ghost's click and the almost-readable card layout. The tone charges the final image without stating a moral.</comment>
