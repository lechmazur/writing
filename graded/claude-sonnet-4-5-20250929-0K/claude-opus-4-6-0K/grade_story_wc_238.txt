<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("carried it for seven years like a rosary she couldn't pray"), and her professional metaphors ground her worldview. The emotional progression from armored to raw weeping feels earned, embodied through the perfume bottle and the unfinished score. Minor slip: the final apology ("I'm sorry I didn't answer") verges on diagnostic self-awareness, though it's anchored in the scene's physicality. The choice to deliver the apology and then leave is credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren delivers the apology "both too late and just in time," forecloses the path of perpetual avoidance, and the cost is felt in herweeping and the impending demolition. Orientation is swift (archive, Thursday, late October, trees scheduled for Monday). The accumulative/textural lens holds: jasmine rises, memory surfaces, apology is spoken, and the final image of her humming through the orchard reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening (the scent triggering the memory) tightens her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archive's "dust and faint sweetness of decomposing paper," the desk where Elise collapsed, and the cherry trees under reprieve create a charged micro-setting. The perfume bottle functions as object-as-setting, constraining Maren's choice to hum through it and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (desk, shelves, orchard). The setting's imminent destruction (trees cut Monday, archive by winter) subtly pressures the timing of Maren's act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnecting with her mother and delivering the overdue apology—is signaled early and pressured by the archive's impending demolition. One meaningful deepening: the jasmine scent triggers the memory, which shifts Maren from carrying the bottle as "a rosary she couldn't pray" to finally speaking the apology. The cost is visible (weeping "with raw, ethereal grit," the trees' last reprieve) and forecloses the path of perpetual deferral. Agency is clear: her choice to hum, to speak, to walk through the orchard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—imperfect grace, introduced narratives strong enough to make the old bearable—emerges from Maren's professional metaphors and is tested in her personal life. The final image (humming, trailing fingers, carrying "the apology she'd finally delivered") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The perfume bottle and unfinished score constrain and charge the closure. Minor slip: "imperfect miracles" is named twice in the text, though it's enacted more than asserted. Thematic resonance deepens through specificity (jasmine, bergamot, cold stone).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization through Maren; perceptual signature is clear (professional metaphors, "induced currents," "stronger note beside it"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("half-life longer than plutonium," "raw, ethereal grit"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the weeping beat. Brief filter verbs ("thought about") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No head-hopping; the narrative certainty matches what Maren can know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; figurative density is high but purposeful (induced currents, tuning fork, magnet) and tied to Maren's profession. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. "She'd done it for senators, actresses, disgraced chefs" and the perfume's scent description ("jasmine, bergamot, something underneath like cold stone") are specific and propulsive. Minor slip: "the kind that gathers before a blade falls" is a touch elevated for the moment, though consistent with the reflective tone. Information density is strong; every sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" premise is fresh, and the induced-currents metaphor woven through the story is specific to Maren's profession. The perfume bottle as the vehicle for reconnection avoids cliché through the sensory specificity (jasmine, bergamot, cold stone) and the unfinished score. The transformation is earned: Maren applies her professional insight to her own ghost. The proximity to "unfinished business" narratives is mitigated by the voice and the charged particulars (archive, orchard reprieve, the memory's exact words). Risk-taking is moderate; the arc is emotionally honest without formal experiment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's identity as gossip-column exorcist frames her worldview (induced currents, counter-narratives) and is present in the opening, middle reflection, and closure reasoning. Her professional metaphors shape how she approaches her personal crisis. However, the profession itself doesn't create a key turn; the humming and apology would function similarly if she were any other profession. Two gates (setup, closure linkage via metaphor) but middling causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The perfume bottle is handled at the desk, opened, and its scent triggers the memory; it returns in "stoppered the bottle" and is carried out, reweighted as both rosary and delivered grace. Three distinct beats (placement, scent/memory, closure). Causal pressure: the bottle's scent is the immediate stimulus for the memory that shifts Maren's stance. Closure linkage: the act of stoppering it marks the completion of the apology. Irreplaceable specificity (jasmine, bergamot, cold stone, art nouveau vines, Elise's prized possession).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is named twice and shapes Maren's professional method and personal resolution. The concept is present in setup (counter-narratives as strategic charges), development (the scent rising "impossibly fresh" yet yielding only a memory, not a literal reunion), and closure (the apology delivered "both too late and just in time"). It alters tactics: Maren applies the principle to herself, accepting partial grace. Cost is visible (weeping, the trees' reprieve ending). Strong thematic integration but slightly abstract at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maren's habit of advising through metaphors is established early ("Think of your scandal as a tuning fork") and recurs in the middle ("induced currents," "magnet past it"). However, the trait doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it colors her interiority but the humming and apology don't depend on metaphor-thinking. Two gates (setup, development) but weak causal pressure. Functional but replaceable with "reflective professional" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the dominant action: Maren comes to the archive explicitly "to reconnect," hums through the bottle to induce a current, and the scent/memory moment is the reconnection's imperfect fulfillment. Two beats (humming/memory, spoken apology) and closure (walking the orchard as embodied reconnection). Causal role is strong: the action redefines her stance from avoidance to delivered grace. Irreplaceability: "mourn" alone wouldn't carry the active, metaphor-driven attempt; "forgive herself" would be too passive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is signaled in the opening (Maren's professional method) and applied at the key beat: she hums through the perfume bottle to let vibration pass through it, expecting physics to do the work. The mechanics matter—she doesn't pray or confess directly, she tries to strike a resonance. Two gates (setup as metaphor, enacted in the humming beat). Weak closure participation: the final image doesn't emphasize the method, though the apology is its result. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sheet music archive supplies the unfinished score (resource that enables the humming attempt), anchors Elise's death (the desk where she collapsed), and the orchard frames the ending. Three beats: arrival, the desk/score/humming, final walk through trees. The archive's impending demolition tightens the timeframe. Closure linkage: the orchard walk embodies the apology's delivery. Spatial choreography is clear (shelves, desk, east windows, orchard). Causal pressure: the score and desk are the immediate tools for reconnection.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" is signaled early (Thursday late October, trees cut Monday, archive by winter) and pressures Maren's choice to act now. The "hush" and "anticipatory silence" charge the atmosphere. Two gates (setup, closure atmosphere). Moderate causal pressure: the deadline tightens urgency but doesn't alter tactics on the page. The final image ("last of their reprieve") reweights the opening frame. Cost is visible (the trees will be stumps, the archive demolished).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to deliver an overdue apology" is dramatized in the opening ("never managed to exorcise her own ghost"), the memory's mother saying "You just have to come back," the spoken apology ("I'm sorry I didn't answer"), and the closure acknowledgment ("the apology she'd finally delivered"). Friction is clear: seven years of avoidance versus the archive's last days. Three beats and strong causal pressure. Cost is visible (weeping, the recognition of "too late and just in time"). Irreplaceable: the entire arc depends on this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is embodied in "the raw, ethereal grit of someone who'd spent years armoring herself" and coheres through the piece: the professional cool ("gossip-column exorcist, half-mocking, half-reverent"), the jasmine rising "impossibly fresh," the weeping "not prettily," the orchard's "anticipatory silence." Tone modulates with pressure (cool → reflective → raw at the weeping beat → quiet in the orchard). The final image (humming, trailing fingers) charges the duality of fragility and determination. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
