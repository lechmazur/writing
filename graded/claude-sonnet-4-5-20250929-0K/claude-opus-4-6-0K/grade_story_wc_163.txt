<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and particular—"pressing her face to the glass" of belonging, her softly ingenious shorthand as both tool and isolation. The motivation to learn belonging is embodied through her alienation from facility rhythms and enacted when she finally translates her work aloud to Kosta. The shift from observer to co-creator emerges through specific actions (showing him the feather, working through the night), though the final realization "Belonging wasn't a rhythm you learned by listening" teeters toward articulated wisdom rather than purely earned insight. Internal contradiction is present but muted; her fear of rejection competes with her need to share, visible in how she keeps her shorthand private until this night.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of shared observation, the night cycle's duration, and the climactic plankton bloom that reweights Marina's isolation into connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"She understood then" crystallizes the shift from outsider to participant, and the feather offering plus the co-watching until simulated dawn constitute visible cost (vulnerability, time, energy). Orientation anchors within the first 120 words (research facility, Dome Seven, Marina's title and mission). The before/after is legible: she arrives as foreign body, departs having made a rhythm by staying. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vivid and purposeful: "pressure-treated glass," "bioluminescent lighting," "deep-water pressure" creaking. Spatial choreography is clear (Dome Seven as deepest observation chamber, Kosta arriving from the hatchway). The plankton bloom functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, and the burnt feather's "prismatic shadows" tie tactile detail to thematic work. Sensory selection reflects Marina's professional filter (celestial coordinates, grid references, altar district orientation). The simulated dawn and terrible reconstituted coffee ground the world without excess. No constraint directly narrows a tactical choice, keeping this below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to belong—is signaled early and tightens when Marina risks vulnerability by translating her private shorthand to Kosta. The plankton bloom at 4 a.m. deepens pressure by offering proof that wonder can be shared, reweighting her isolation. Agency appears in her choice to stay, to show him the feather, and to offer it on the console as symbolic acceptance. One meaningful tightening is present: her decision to remain in Dome Seven rather than retreat to sleep, which forecloses safety and opens connection. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (the bloom) complicates but does not resolve, as the final understanding still requires her active offering and Kosta's reciprocal presence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of fire (burnt feather) and water, isolation and connection, ancient city and present community. The plankton/firefly simile ties celestial work to embodied wonder without stating a moral. "Belonging wasn't a rhythm you learned by listening. It was one you made by staying" articulates the theme rather than letting the final image alone carry it, nudging toward Thematic Echo territory though the line is earned by prior dramatization. The burnt feather as talisman—"proof that fire had once existed in this place of water, that transformation was always possible"—borders on over-explicit symbolic reading. Subtext operates effectively in Kosta's silence and the shared exhale, and the simulated dawn both characters "could feel" offers resonance without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Marina's perceptual signature: she maps plankton "as if even microorganisms might follow celestial logic," notices facility rhythms she cannot join. Diction stays character-particular ("shadowseam," "softly ingenious shorthand") without register drift. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and advances stakes: Kosta's "You see patterns out there" and "Show me" drive the shift from isolation to collaboration. Psychic distance tightens during the plankton bloom, pulling us close to Marina's gasp and the shared breath. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—short, breathless during the bloom, longer and contemplative during setup—without losing Marina's voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—nearly every line advances Marina's isolation, her method, or the facility's texture. "The facility lights dimmed to night cycle. She should sleep. Instead she stayed" shows propulsion and clarity. Minor scaffold appears: "That was her real motivation, if she was honest" and "She understood then" are tell-bridges that could be cut, and "somewhere past four in the morning" + "before dawn" repeat temporal markers. The plankton description "Thousands of luminous points swirled upward past the glass in spiraling columns" is vivid but edges toward decorative length in a peak beat. No loops or metaphor muddle; grammar and tense are clean. Read-aloud test passes with natural variance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater-city-as-research-site premise offers a fresh angle, and "landscape astrologer" as occupational synthesis is memorable. The burnt feather in a drowned city is a strong, non-obvious image pairing fire/water, past/present. The emotional arc—belonging through shared perception rather than assimilation—feels specific to Marina's discipline and setting. The plankton/firefly simile risks proximity to familiar "bioluminescence = wonder" tropes but earns its keep through the altar-district/celestial overlay and the feather's thematic echo. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is conventional (single scene, linear time), and the resolution is warm rather than surprising. Transformation test: the arc would lose significant texture if stripped of astrology/underwater specifics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's choice to stay in Dome Seven rather than sleep, to show Kosta her charts and shorthand, and to offer the burnt feather as symbolic acceptance are all character-driven decisions that create the key turn from isolation to connection. Her specific skillset (landscape astrology) frames the stakes and enables the collaboration. Present early, drives middle collaboration, and charges the ending offering.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The burnt feather is recovered by Marina (setup), kept as talisman and explained to Kosta (development), and finally set "on the console between them like an offering" in the closing beat (payoff). It appears in three distinct beats, embodies the fire/water transformation theme, and its final placement charges the closure image. Swappability is low; removing it would weaken the thematic resonance and the concrete object that bridges their connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" appears explicitly late ("A luminous respite. That was all it was, and it was everything") as thematic label rather than shaping stakes throughout. The plankton bloom enacts the concept, but the phrase itself is ornamental summary. The concept of pause/wonder does shape Marina's final understanding, and the bloom creates the shared exhale, so it has closure linkage and emotional pressure. Early implicit presence (the desire for softening, the shadowseam metaphor) seeds the concept, but the exact phrase arrives only at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" describes Marina's shorthand system early, establishing her unique method that isolates her (no one else can read it) and later enables connection when she translates it aloud. The trait constrains one choice (keeping her work private initially) and enables another (teaching Kosta), with cost (vulnerability). However, it is largely label-only; we do not see the ingenuity enacted in specific problem-solving under pressure, only in the annotated charts' existence. Present in setup and development, touches closure as the mechanism of breakthrough, but the adverb "softly" does no additional causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Captivate" drives the major turn: "she could feel the moment her work began to captivate him—not as novelty but as genuine revelation" marks the shift from isolation to collaboration. The action is irreplaceable—Marina's specific demonstration of altar-district/star-path alignment captivates Kosta, leading to their shared work through the night. Present in setup (her desire to be understood), executed in the middle beat (showing him), and its consequence (his request "Show me the processional avenue alignment") propels them to the plankton bloom and closure. The verb's specificity matters: mere interest would not convey the depth that justifies his staying until dawn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" is signaled by the plankton bloom's visual parallel to fireflies and enacted exactly as specified: "They exhaled together—a shared breath spotting the first fireflies of summer, even here, even underwater." The mechanics matter—it is a moment of simultaneous perception and release that crystallizes their connection. Present implicitly in Marina's firefly memory, dramatized at the climactic plankton bloom, and charges the closure by proving shared wonder is possible. The method is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's central image and the pivot from isolation to belonging.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater research facility pressures Marina's isolation (she is a foreign body the facility tries to reject), supplies the observation dome where connection becomes possible, and provides the plankton bloom resource that delivers the climactic shared exhale. Spatial details constrain: Dome Seven as "deepest observation chamber" isolates her, the hatchway stages Kosta's arrival, the console becomes the workspace and altar for the feather offering. The facility's night-cycle dimming and simulated dawn bookend the timeframe and reinforce the temporal pressure. The drowned city of Pavlopetri anchors her professional work and the burnt feather's origin, making the setting indispensable to character, conflict, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is signaled early ("Tonight she sat"), tracked through "night cycle," "past four in the morning," "before dawn," and resolved with "until the facility lights brightened to simulate a dawn." The timeframe tightens Marina's decision (she should sleep but stays) and measures the cost of her vulnerability (hours spent, exhaustion implied). The constraint is soft—no hard deadline forces a choice—but the duration accumulates pressure and makes the bloom's timing (current shift before dawn) causally relevant. Present across all three gates, shapes one key choice (staying vs. sleeping), and the simulated dawn charges the final image with ironic wonder.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina's desire "to learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated early, dramatized through her observation of facility rhythms she cannot join, and tested when she risks translation of her private shorthand. The friction between her want (connection) and her fear (rejection, being a "foreign body") creates authentic tension. Her epiphany—"Belonging wasn't a rhythm you learned by listening. It was one you made by staying"—is earned by her choice to remain in Dome Seven and her active offering of the feather. The motivation drives setup, middle collaboration, and closure realization with visible cost (vulnerability, energy, the foreclosure of safe retreat). The final understanding reweights the motivation from passive learning to active creation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" as tone is present throughout: the facility's "permanent twilight," the dome as threshold between dark water and glow, "where wonder lived, where the dark water met the glow and neither won." The tone modulates appropriately—contemplative isolation in the opening, shared awe during the plankton bloom, quiet resolution at the simulated dawn. The phrase "shadowseam" appears once explicitly but the liminal quality (water/fire, isolation/connection, ancient/present) charges recurring images. Coherent through turns, tone shapes the final image's register (wonder without triumph, hope without sentimentality). The concept is specific and the execution consistent, though the word "shadowseam" itself does minimal additional causal work beyond metaphoric coloring.</comment>
