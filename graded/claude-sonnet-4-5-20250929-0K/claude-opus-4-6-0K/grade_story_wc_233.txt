<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied—the metallic taste, bruise behind sternum—and her disenchantment is grounded in specific events (seventh peace accord, twelfth state funeral). The turn from crown to grotto is motivated by cumulative erosion rather than epiphany. Maren's "softly commanding" silence reads as label-only; her function is structural support without demonstrated internal conflict. The final stance—"not going back"—follows logically but the cost (abandoning throne) is declared rather than physically enacted in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The accumulative lens is taught early (eleven months of dreams) and held through the climb-and-revelation structure. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: the "wound" reframes as "seam," reweighting the entire dream sequence with undeniable thematic cost (the queen's role was never to command power but kneel inside it). The felt cost—renunciation of throne—is clear, though the final image leans toward metaphor rather than a concrete forfeiture that alters immediate options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember grotto's warmth and the cobalt grotto's lapis-glass walls are vivid and body-anchored ("warmth seeped into Elara's palms"). The two grottos structure the climb and charge the closure image where starlight and fireflies meet. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: the hiss of threads, the exhale spotting fireflies. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The grottos are not merely setting but a causal lattice—dream-recognized wound becomes the literal stage where worlds touch—thereby constraining the protagonist's final realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why the sky unravels for her alone—is signaled in the opening and tightens through the council's warnings and the climb. The hiss of starlight and the rise of fireflies constitute one meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding: destruction as mutual yearning. The cost (throne abandoned) is declared but not physically tested on the page; the ending crystallizes her renunciation without an on-page consequence that narrows later options. Agency is present but leans conceptual rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: protocols vs. raw yearning, bleeding starlight as seam rather than wound. The final image—queen kneeling in "lacy wreckage of heaven"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what power wants of her) without moralizing. The firefly-and-starlight convergence reconfigures the dream residue into mutual reach rather than collapse. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion. The piece earns complexity through embodied contradiction: menace and gift, destruction and touch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "beautiful pretenses," "calcified into cold treaties." Diction remains within Elara's plausible lexicon; elevated register ("hemorrhaging," "lacy wreckage") fits a queen's education and poetic dream-logic. Dialogue is minimal, purposeful, and goal-driven ("We keep going"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the closure beat. Minor: the phrase "delicate as lace" in paragraph one and "lacy wreckage" at the end read as engineered callback rather than organic reprise, though voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Information density is high: "threads delicate as lace, pooling in a grotto she had never visited but recognized the way one recognizes a wound." Figurative language is dense in the opening and closing thirds; "hemorrhaging," "lacy," "seam," "wreckage" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff, approaching overwriting in the final beat. Minimal scaffold or loops. The closure beat leans on metaphor stacking ("lacy wreckage of heaven," "kneeling inside power") that risks obscuring the concrete cost. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—bleeding starlight as seam where worlds touch—transforms a familiar "disenchanted ruler seeks meaning" trope through specificity: ember/cobalt grottos, fireflies rising to meet falling threads. The reframe (wound→seam, command→kneeling) feels earned in hindsight. Execution is confident but not bold; the emotional arc and queen-abandons-throne structure follow a median path. The firefly-starlight convergence is fresh in image but anticipated in function once the pattern is taught. Risk is present but measured; no structural gambles that heighten stakes beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's disenchantment frames the opening and her decision to leave drives the climb. Her observation of starlight and fireflies precedes the conceptual turn ("not going back"), which alters her stance but does not create a tactical choice within the scene. Present in setup, middle (climb), and closure (renunciation), but the final beat leans passive witnessing rather than active decision-making.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears at the halfway climb, its warmth tactile ("seeped into Elara's palms") and dream-linked as "doorway." It reappears conceptually at closure when fireflies rise from it to meet the starlight. Two distinct beats with causal linkage and charged reprise. Specific properties (warmth, exhale of fireflies) matter to the ending image. Introduced past the opening third, limiting ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is signaled in the opening ("light hemorrhaging from the stars"), drives the climb's purpose, and arrives on-page in the cobalt grotto where its hiss and threads pressure Elara's understanding. The convergence with fireflies redefines it from wound to seam, altering the stakes and enabling the conceptual closure. Present in setup, dramatized in the middle-to-end turn, and indispensable to the final image's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maren is described as "softly commanding" in silence once. The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; her function is logistical (rope, anchor) rather than pressuring. Label-only; swappable with "steady" or "calm" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire middle, from basalt base through ember grotto to cobalt grotto above cloudline. It enacts the queen's physical commitment after the council's warnings and delivers her to the revelation site. Removing the climb collapses the causality and setting participation. Present across setup (departure), development (ascent), and closure (arrival enables witnessing). Essential but not entirely irreplaceable—another journey form could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shared exhale appears once in the climax beat, marking the fireflies' first visibility and anchoring Elara and Maren's simultaneous perception. It does not shape prior tactics or recur; late arrival (final third) and single-use limit ceiling. Lyric reprise potential unrealized; the exhale does not reweight earlier material. Functional in the moment but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is the destination, scene of the starlight revelation, and charged with specific physical properties (lapis-glass walls, open to sky, above cloudline) that enable the convergence. It pressures the closure by staging the encounter between falling threads and rising fireflies. Present in dream-setup, arrived at in the final third, and indispensable to the ending image. Micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final realization.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the final warning," "the morning after") is signaled and frames the departure. The climb's duration (to evening) provides light progression that tightens the encounter timing. Does not impose a live countdown that alters tactics within the scene; time passage is tracked but not weaponized. One causal link (evening enables first stars) but not indispensable—removing the time marker would not break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dream mystery is foregrounded in the opening, motivates the departure against council warnings, and drives the climb to the cobalt grotto. Friction is present: abandoning throne vs. understanding the wound. The revelation reframes the mystery, paying off the motivation. Demonstrated across setup (dreams, council conflict), development (climb decision), and closure (realization). Cost is conceptual (throne) rather than physically tested, limiting the ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lacy menace coheres from the opening ("threads delicate as lace") through the climax ("precise and menacing, lace made of something that could cut") to closure ("lacy wreckage of heaven"). The tone modulates with pressure: dream residue, council threat, hiss of starlight, convergence wonder. The final image charges the phrase "lacy" with both beauty and danger, elevating it beyond decoration. Consistent through turns and indispensable to the conceptual payload.</comment>
