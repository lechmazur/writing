<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's grief and professional guilt are embodied through concrete actions—listening to water, carrying the chrysalis, planning the new paper. Internal contradiction operates when she simultaneously accepts Jonas's erasure and refuses to forgive it. The shift from sealed grief to "loosened grief...in motion" reads earned through the foam observation, though the epiphany about "resilient networks...remember their separations" edges toward thesis articulation. Minor: the administrative erasure feels convenient (why did she accept it?) and the final resolve to write with Jonas's name first arrives cleanly but without on-page friction or visible institutional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through observation (braided water → foam patterns → chrysalis meaning) to a conceptual repricing: separation encodes information, the wound's history belongs in the record. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maren commits to the new manuscript with Jonas first-named, a decision that reweights her career and the prior erasure. Cost is visible (professional risk, "anyone who wanted to question the irregularity could take it up with her directly") and felt (grief in motion, the acknowledgment). Orientation anchors quickly (ravine, Maren, three months post-publication). One meaningful deepening when foam geometry unlocks the polymer insight and the ethical resolve. The lens holds; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The braided ravine functions as both setting and conceptual constraint: three channels, confluence, foam encoding junction geometry. Sensory detail (gray-green water, birch canopy light, wet stone) filters through a chemist's pattern-recognition. The chrysalis as micro-object charges the final image (holds shape/holds nothing) and constrains her choice to memorialize transformation. Spatial choreography clear (crouching, sitting, standing, hiking out). Minor: the cabin at the end feels unanchored—no prior setup of where she'll write or how far the hike is.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: atone for the professional/personal betrayal of Jonas's erasure. Pressure accumulates through observation (foam, chrysalis) to insight to ethical crystallization. The tightening is conceptual: she moves from numb acceptance to active correction, forecloses the path of silent complicity. Cost is professional (institutional pushback) and relational (public record of her prior failure). No reversal required under Accumulative lens; the deepening—foam insight unlocking both polymer principle and ethical stance—narrows her options and charges the commitment. Agency is decision with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of separation-as-information and memory-in-structure emerges from concrete particulars (foam, chrysalis, polymer networks). The final image (water braiding, chrysalis holding shape/nothing) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "you could hold someone in the structure of your work the way a crystal holds the axis of its growth" edges toward thesis articulation rather than letting science carry the thematic weight. The acknowledgment line "letting the science carry the weight so the grief didn't have to" is self-aware about method but risks meta-commentary. Subtext in the chrysalis label "Phase Two" and thrush's modulating phrase work well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with tight psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "symphonically minded, hearing the whole chord before isolating any single note," noticing foam geometry through a polymer chemist's lens. Diction controlled ("self-healing polymer networks," "crosslinking mechanism," "molecular signature") without register drift. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short beats when grief loosens ("She sat back on the wet stone and let it move through her"), longer syntax in the resolve paragraphs. No head-hopping, no filter clutter. The prose as character: observation before emotion, structure before sentiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density high; nearly every sentence advances insight, memory, or resolve. Figurative language (foam braiding, chrysalis as record, crystal axis) serves the polymer theme without overwriting. Sentence variety strong. Minor: "ancient negotiation with stone" and "small symphony from variation and return" are slightly elevated but stay within a scientist-poet register. One paraphrase slip: "The foam braided, separated, braided again" and later "The water braided on below her" echo without adding pressure. Propulsion steady; no loops or scaffold in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The polymer-chemist-at-ravine frame is specific, and linking foam patterns to crosslinking memory feels fresh. The chrysalis as "proof...record of transformation" and the ethical decision to re-author with Jonas first offer a non-obvious synthesis of grief, science, and professional integrity. Minor: the grief-journey-to-insight arc is familiar, and the "insight unlocked something in her chest" moment follows a common template. The piece transforms through occupational specificity and the unusual polymer metaphor, but the emotional trajectory (numbness → observation → epiphany → resolve) is well-worn. Risk-taking in the科學-ethics braid elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Polymer chemist shapes perception (foam geometry, crosslinking), drives the insight that reframes the work, and makes the key choice (new manuscript, Jonas first-named). Present in setup, middle insight, and closure resolve. Causal pressure: her training enables the observation; the observation alters tactics. Irreplaceable—another scientist type would notice different patterns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Empty chrysalis introduced early (Jonas's bench, "Phase Two"), handled physically ("holding it against the light," "closed her hand gently"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (holds shape/holds nothing, record of transformation). Drives the insight about resilient networks remembering separations. Three beats: memory, interpretation, final image. High irreplaceability—metamorphosis object essential to the theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Divergent path operates literally (three ravine channels) and conceptually (Jonas's death as a break, Maren's career fork). Shapes her insight ("Separation was not loss. It was information") and the resolve to write divergently from the administration's script. Present in setup (braided ravine), middle (foam encoding junctions), and closure (each channel belongs to the same watershed). Alters options: she chooses the divergent manuscript path. Cost tied to it (professional risk of irregularity).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symphonically minded introduced in the opening sentence, enables her pattern-recognition (hearing the whole chord, isolating notes in foam), but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Functions as perceptual flavor rather than a limiting trait. Present early, colors middle insight, but the closure decision (reauthoring) does not hinge on this attribute—any attentive scientist might reach the same choice. Lyric reprise potential (thrush's modulating phrase echoes it) but no cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atone frames the story ("She had come here to atone") and drives the major turn: from numb acceptance of Jonas's erasure to active correction via the new manuscript. Signaled early, shapes middle reflection on the bureaucratic severance, and resolves in the commitment to write with Jonas first-named. Redefines her professional and ethical options. Cost clear (institutional pushback). Not easily swappable—another motive (e.g., "remember" or "honor") would lack the chemical/structural resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>River foam patterns are the story's engine: signaled early (confluence, braided channels), drive the insight ("foam did not resist its own splitting...Separation was not loss"), unlock the polymer principle ("resilient networks...remember their separations"), and lead directly to the manuscript decision. Three beats: observation, interpretation, application. Mechanics matter—foam encoding junction geometry is specific. High irreplaceability. Cost: the insight forces her professional and ethical hand.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine provides the confluence/divergence metaphor, supplies the foam observation, and houses the final image ("water braided on below her...single rushing voice"). Constrains her perception (three channels, each thread carrying its own voice) and enables the insight. Present throughout; the structure (split/converge) shapes the conceptual stakes. Not mere postcard—it's the laboratory for her realization. Minor: the cabin at the end is ungrounded, slightly lowering setting coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "as the pieces fall into place" marks the insight beat but does not tighten decisions or track pressure across the story. Three months post-publication anchors backstory; the present-scene unfolds in an unmetered ravine visit. No live clock. The phrase captures a cognitive moment but does not shape tactics or escalate stakes. Functional but replaceable—"in a single afternoon" or "while watching the water" would serve similarly. Lyric color, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation to translate separation into connection is stated late-middle ("she had spent her career trying to...") but operates throughout: her grief is a severed bond, the polymer work is about reknitting, the new manuscript will rebond Jonas to the record. Drives the choice to write with Jonas first-named and cite the chrysalis. Friction visible: her prior acceptance of the erasure conflicts with the new resolve, and the institutional cost is acknowledged. Three beats: career framing, insight linkage, closure decision. High specificity—another motive (e.g., "justice" or "truth") would lack the polymer resonance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Loosened grief introduced at the insight beat ("this loosened grief that was not less painful for being released but was at least in motion now"), modulates the tone from sealed numbness to flowing sorrow, and charges the final image ("slow, precise work of making the record whole"). Coherent through turns. The tone shift is the story's emotional engine: grief moving from static to kinetic mirrors the polymer insight (breaks carry information). Cost felt in the acknowledgment of pain. Not static; the modulation from sealed to loosened to carried drives the emotional arc.</comment>
