<comment>Lenora's interiority is specific and consistently embodied through her relationship with data, death, and objects. The Marcus drowning backstory (~19 years ago) anchors her present analytic detachment without therapy-speak, and her handling of the snow globe demonstrates contradictory impulses—crossing out sentiment while the thought persists. Minor slip: the final renunciation (diving again tomorrow) carries visible cost in her resigned familiarity with death, but the choice itself doesn't narrow options dramatically on the page; it reads more as Earned Stasis than a foreclosed path with sharp trade-off.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Lenora, SS Meridian library, seven months of dives, post-Earhart discovery). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each dive, object, and reflection layers meaning toward the final snow globe tilt and "steady, steady, steady" reprise, which reweights her quest to understand terminal signals with undeniable conceptual cost—the recognition that containment is temporary and silence will be heard. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she will return tomorrow, patient as the library, with the cost legible in her acceptance that objects outlast owners "through the simple accident of being less alive." One meaningful deepening through rising sediment and recursive motif is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The sunken library's "soft geometry," swollen oak, pulp sculptures, and brass instruments create a tactile, waterlogged specificity that charges Lenora's retrieval of the snow globe. The snow globe itself functions as micro-setting: its cracked dome, sediment drift, and porcelain lighthouse constrain her analytic method (she turns it, notes the manufacturer's mark, watches sediment rise) and directly charge the final image when she tilts it a last time. The Pacific's "indifference...trying to distinguish from grace" and the library's "permanent dusk" are filtered through Lenora's occupational and grief-shaped perception, avoiding postcard generality.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lenora wants to understand "the physics of letting go," the mechanics of terminal signals before vanishing. The escalation is textural and conceptual: each object (compass, snow globe, radio transcripts) deepens her inquiry, and the Earhart parallel reopens "a door she'd spent years sealing." The cost is legible—she crosses out sentiment but the thought persists, she sits with death "with resigned familiarity," and her return dive tomorrow acknowledges that the dead's silence "will eventually be heard." No reversal is required under the Accumulative lens; the tightening comes through recursive motif (steady, sediment, acceptance) that narrows her stance to Earned Stasis with visible opportunity cost (the sealed door now ajar).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the snow globe's cracked containment, Marcus's shallow-lake drowning, and the Meridian's "steady, steady, steady" refrain: every sealed system admits the world, vanishing is not erasure, and letting go has observable mechanics. The final image—tilting the snow globe, watching sediment rise—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: Lenora's analytic detachment is itself a kind of letting go, her method a parallel to the library's "permanent dusk" that waits to be heard. The piece resists tidy resolution; her tomorrow dive is acceptance, not escape. Minor note: "indifference...distinguish from grace" flirts with abstraction but is saved by the concrete Pacific and her occupational lens.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single-POV focalization is controlled and character-particular: Lenora's perceptual signature filters the world through "grant applications and peer-reviewed detachment," yet her syntax admits contradictory impulses ("the thought persisted"). Free indirect style is clean ("What frightened her was the moment just before"), and diction remains within her analytic register without drift. The prose modulates under emotional pressure: the opening's measured catalog of "rotted shelf" and "swollen oak" tightens to the recursive "steady, steady, steady" and the final tilt of the snow globe. No head-hopping, no dialogue to test, and the distance stays aptly close-third throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("Death did not frighten Lenora") alternate with longer, syntactically complex reflections ("She had been on first-name terms with death..."). Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or thematic layer. Minor slips: "signal attenuates across distance until it becomes indistinguishable from noise" and "the simple accident of being less alive" edge toward elevated abstraction in peak beats, and "holding its countless graves with an indifference" carries a faint whiff of stock poetic phrasing. No loops or scaffold, and the final "steady, steady, steady" reprise is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Earhart discovery, sunken library, snow globe as containment metaphor, and Lenora's grief-fueled inquiry into terminal signals is specific and non-obvious. The "first-name terms with death" frame and her analytic method ("sit with a data set the way others sat with grief") avoid generic mourning tropes. The piece risks a quiet, lyric structure and commits fully to its premise—no forced epiphany, no tidy catharsis—letting the snow globe's sediment and the library's patience carry the conceptual weight. The transformation of Earhart's fuel-and-position pragmatism into Lenora's search for the "mechanics of letting go" is a fresh angle that works in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Lenora's "first-name terms with death since she was nineteen" is signaled early (Marcus drowning) and shapes her analytic detachment ("resigned familiarity," crossing out sentiment). It constrains her method—she handles the dead's belongings "with the tenderness of someone who knows objects outlast their owners"—and charges the final image: her return dive is an acceptance that death's silence "will eventually be heard." The trait drives two beats (snow globe retrieval, final tilt) and participates in closure (Earned Stasis), though the cost is more conceptual than decisively enacted choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The snow globe appears on third dive, is handled in the lab beat (turned over, noted, manufacturer's mark, hairline crack), and returns in the final image when Lenora tilts it and watches sediment rise. Its cracked containment and sediment-as-snow metaphor directly charge the thematic question (containment is temporary, the glass always cracks) and participate in closure. The globe's specific details (porcelain lighthouse, waterlogged leather case) are irreplaceable and enable Lenora's note-taking method. Two substantive beats plus closure linkage elevate the score, though the globe does not narrow a tactical choice on the page, keeping it below the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Last transmission" is signaled early (Earhart's fuel/position, Meridian's "steady, steady, steady") and shapes Lenora's dominant stake: understanding "the moment just before...the final signal a person sends." It constrains her method (radio transcripts, recovered letters) and charges the closure when she repeats "steady, steady, steady" while tilting the snow globe. The concept reweights the ending—her tomorrow dive is itself a kind of transmission into patience—with conceptual cost (acknowledging that vanishing is not erasure). The concept participates across beats and closure, though it does not alter a specific tactic on the page, capping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Quietly analytic" is established early ("sit with a data set the way others sat with grief," "precise, granular" logbook entries) and enables her snow globe examination (noting manufacturer's mark, hairline crack, sediment shift). The trait is contrasted with her colleagues' "cold" and therapist's "avoidant" labels, and it constrains her crossing-out of sentiment while the thought persists. The cost is visible in her "resigned familiarity" with death and her method as a seal against grief. The trait shapes two beats and primes closure, but does not drive a decisive pivot, holding it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Note" is signaled early ("she wrote in her logbook the way she always did—precise, granular") and enacted on-page when Lenora notes the snow globe's details, then crosses out the parallel ("wary of sentiment"). The action shapes her analytic method and participates in closure—her final tilt of the globe is another act of noting, now with acceptance rather than detachment. The verb "note everything" recurs and charges the ending's conceptual cost (the crossed-out thought persists). Two beats plus thematic payoff, though it does not create a tactical turn, placing it in the lower 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"By untangling threads" is explicitly stated ("by untangling threads: radio transcripts, recovered letters, waterlogged personal effects") and demonstrated in Lenora's handling of the snow globe (turning it over, examining the case, noting sediment). The method shapes her inquiry across beats and aligns with the thematic question (untangling terminal signals), but it does not constrain a choice or create friction on the page—it is shown as her consistent practice rather than a method under pressure. Present in two beats and thematically coherent, but replaceable with "by examining" or "by cataloging" without structural loss, capping it at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The "forgotten sunken ship library" is anchored early (SS Meridian, underwater sixty-three years, twelve feet across, oak paneling, pulp sculptures) and supplies the snow globe that drives Lenora's inquiry. The library's "soft wreckage" and "permanent dusk" charge the closure when Lenora acknowledges it "waits...patient as any silence that knows it will eventually be heard." The setting's specific details (brass instruments, frozen compass, librarian's desk) enable her retrieval method and constrain her dives. The library participates in three beats (dive history, snow globe retrieval, final acknowledgment) and shapes the ending's conceptual cost, reaching the lower 8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"After finding Amelia Earhart's plane" is signaled in the opening paragraph and establishes the inciting realization ("vanishing is not the same as being gone"). It reopens "a door she'd spent years sealing" and motivates her seven months of dives, but does not create a live clock or tighten tactics on the page—the Earhart discovery is backstory catalyst rather than present pressure. The timeframe enables the premise and primes thematic resonance (Earhart's last words parallel the Meridian's), but it is swappable with any similar high-profile recovery. Present in setup and thematic echo, earning mid-5s for functional integration without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is explicitly stated and dramatized: Lenora wants "the actual mechanics...the way a hand opens...the way a signal attenuates." The desire drives her choice to dive repeatedly, handle the snow globe, and cross out sentiment while the thought persists. The motivation is conflicted—she uses method to seal grief yet the Earhart discovery reopens the door—and participates in closure when she accepts that "the glass always cracks" and returns tomorrow. The friction between analytic detachment and persistent thought creates visible cost (Earned Stasis), earning lower 7s, though the motivation does not force a sharper on-page pivot.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>"Sophisticated melancholy" is established in the opening's measured catalog of "rotted shelf" and "pulp sculptures" and modulates through Lenora's contradictory impulses (crossing out sentiment, the thought persisting). The tone tightens in the final paragraph: the Pacific's "indifference...distinguish from grace," the snow globe's sediment rise, and the recursive "steady, steady, steady" charge the closure without sentimentality. Diction stays controlled ("the simple accident of being less alive," "patience that mimicked snowfall") and the rhythm slows to match her acceptance. The tone is coherent across turns and directly charges the final image, reaching high 8s.</comment>
