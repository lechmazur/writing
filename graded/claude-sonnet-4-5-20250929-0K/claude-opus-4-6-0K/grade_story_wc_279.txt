<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and particular—"fingers dusted in pigments she could no longer name" anchors her craft in the body. The progression from observing neighbors' silence to constructing the mandala to drawing shapes on the wall shows agency under pressure. The final choice to build "a new alphabet from dust and whisper" feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (abandoning her original goal of mapping silence for a more honest mode of communication). Internal contradiction is present but muted: she moves fromanalytic mapping to embodied expression without much friction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates through Sable's sand-mandala work, the tile flake micro-turn, her spoken word, and the final wall-drawing, deepening the stakes from "chart the silences" to "language molting." The closure reweights the premise—unlearning as transformation rather than loss—with conceptual cost legible in the final image: impermanence accepted, the city above still unraveling. One meaningful deepening present; cost is felt but oblique, keeping this out of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto's violet mist, ceramic tiles, and acoustic architecture constrain Sable's choice to work there and charge the final drawing on the damp wall. Sensory detail (mist shifting from gray to palest lilac, whispers as "deep water" pressure) is vivid and filtered through her POV. Spatial choreography is clear: she kneels, reaches, sits back, draws on the wall. The grotto's lived-in qualities—orphaned whispers, iridescent tile flakes—shape her realization. Missing the 9-band gate: the setting enables rather than sharply constrains a pivotal choice, and the final image draws from the grotto but is not impossible without it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "discover meaning in the mess that language was becoming." One clear tightening when the tile flake lands and she hears her mother's voice, forcing the interject action that shifts the grotto's response. The mandala's emergent patterns narrow her options from analytic charting to embodied creation. Agency is present (she speaks the word, then draws on the wall), and the cost—accepting impermanence and the city's ongoing unraveling—is legible. Escalation reads as a cadence shift and deepening under the Accumulative lens rather than a sharp reversal, keeping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the mandala rings, the tile flake, the shapes drawn on the wall. The ending offers a resonant answer—language shedding its brittle shell for "something more honest"—without stating a moral. "The ache of almost understanding" recurs with reweighted meaning. Subtext operates in image and gesture (mist color shift, sand trembling, whispers reorganizing). The piece resists tidy resolution: the city continues unraveling, Sable builds "from dust and whisper and impermanence." Minor thematic drift: the opening emphasizes social hollowing, but the resolution turns inward to personal artistic transformation without fully closing the communal loop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Sable filters the world through her chalk-artist's lens of impermanence. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("tonal residue," "orphaned fragments," "geometric voids that felt like grief"). Narration modulates from analytical observation to lyric compression at the ending without losing coherence. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "the ache of almost understanding" feels slightly elevated for a chalk artist mid-crisis, though it's framed as her mother's recovered word. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, especially in the final paragraph's cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled: "words losing their edges, meanings sliding off tongues like rain from glass" is clear and apt. Minor overwriting in the middle section: "achingly, terrifyingly full" stacks modifiers, and "the emergent hush—not silence, but a new kind of quiet" paraphrases across clauses. The final paragraph's compression ("one beautiful smudge at a time") is purposeful and earned. No scaffold or artifact that obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—language erosion mapped through sand mandala in an acoustic grotto—is a specific synthesis that transforms the familiar "loss of words" trope through Sable's craft and the grotto's architecture. The tile flake and mother's voice are fresh inflections. The ending's shift from mapping to embodying avoids the explain-everything trap. Emotional specificity (watching neighbors "stop mid-sentence, blinking") grounds the concept. Minor hedging: the resolution ("language molting") is asserted more than dramatized in the final beats, softening the boldness. The transformation test holds: swap names/places and the arc loses much of its charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable's role as chalk artist frames her understanding of impermanence and motivates her mandala work. The trait shapes two beats: constructing the mandala and drawing on the wall. Her choice to draw "shapes that, when you looked at them, made you feel the way a lullaby sounds" at the ending is causally tied to her craft. Whimsy is present in "spirals that suggested laughter," though not foregrounded. Setup by end of first paragraph, development in mandala construction, payoff in wall drawing. Swappability: another visual artist could fulfill the role with edits, but "chalk artist" uniquely underscores impermanence. Cost is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tile flake appears twice: it lands at the mandala's edge (beat one) and she presses it into the center while speaking the word aloud (beat two). Its captured sound—her mother's voice—enables the interject action and triggers the grotto's response. Setup in the middle third, development when pressed into mandala, payoff when the whispers reorganize around her offering. Cost: she trembles, her voice cracks on unfamiliar syllables. The flake's iridescent hum is specific. Missing higher bands: it does not reappear in or directly shape the final wall-drawing image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emergent hush is signaled when "the grotto's whispers began to change...layering into something she could only describe as an emergent hush." It reweights her understanding from "silence...hollowing" to "full...with everything humans had ever meant." Setup in the middle section, payoff when she realizes "The hush was not empty." The concept shapes her final action (drawing shapes between words and pictures). Cost is conceptual: accepting language's molt. Missing higher bands: the hush is described more than dramatized, and its mechanics (how it constrains her choices) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive" is label-only in the opening: "She was socially perceptive enough to recognize that the silence wasn't healing anyone—it was hollowing them." The trait enables her descent to the grotto but does not visibly constrain or enable on-page choices with cost after that line. No development beat where social perception creates friction or tradeoff. Setup present, development and payoff absent. The trait reads as exposition rather than demonstrated capacity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interject is the pivot action: "she pressed the tile flake into the center of the mandala and said the word aloud, her voice cracking on its unfamiliar syllables." This triggers the grotto's response (mist shift, whispers reorganize, new mandala patterns emerge) and leads directly to her realization and final drawing. Setup via her desire "to interject into the grotto's ancient conversation," development in the speaking act, payoff in the grotto's reception and her subsequent choices. Cost is visible (trembling hand, cracking voice). Swappability: the specific verb "interject" is apt but the action itself (speaking into the space) could be phrased otherwise with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sand mandala is signaled early ("she had brought sand...and begun constructing a mandala") and its construction occupies multiple beats: each ring represents lost speech categories, the design grows "precise and whimsical," and unbidden patterns emerge after she speaks. The mandala's mechanics matter: it functions as both map and offering, and its trembling signals the grotto's response. Setup in second paragraph, development throughout middle section, payoff when new patterns emerge "unbidden—connections she hadn't drawn." Cost: her analytic method is transformed by the grotto's reply. Missing top band: the final wall-drawing replaces the mandala rather than extending it, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The whispering grotto is present from the title beat onward, anchoring who/where/when. Its mist, ceramic tiles, and acoustic architecture enable Sable's work and constrain her method: she works on the stone floor, the whispers alter her perception, the damp wall becomes her final canvas. The grotto's orphaned whispers pressure her to interject. Setup in opening paragraphs, development when the grotto breathes and shifts mist color, payoff when she draws on its damp wall. The setting's mechanics (sound spirals, tile flakes) are specific and irreplaceable. Cost: she accepts the grotto's terms (impermanence, endless circulation). The final image would fail without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The unlearning timeframe is established in the opening ("She had come here during the unlearning, when the city above was shedding its languages one syllable at a time") and provides context for Sable's descent. It shapes the dominant stake (discover meaning in the language loss). Setup early, payoff when she realizes "The unlearning...was not an ending. It was language molting." Missing development: the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock during her grotto work. The unlearning continues above while she works below, but elapsed time and urgency are vague. Cost is conceptual (the city's ongoing erosion) rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early: "she found she could not let go of the need to understand what was happening, to discover meaning in the mess that language was becoming." This desire drives her mandala construction and interject action. Friction appears when her analytic approach (mapping silences) is transformed by the grotto's response into embodied creation. Setup in opening section, development in mandala work, payoff when she builds "a new alphabet" instead of a map. Cost: she abandons certainty for impermanence. The want is told more than dramatized in micro-choices, keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is established through "violet curtains," "palest lilac" mist shift, and the phrase "lilac unease" never appears but the unease is present in "hollowing," "orphaned fragments," and Sable's trembling hand. The tone modulates from analytical unease (opening city observations) to lyric acceptance (final paragraph's "dust and whisper and impermanence"). Coherence holds through turns; the mist color shift mirrors emotional progression. Missing higher bands: "lilac" is primarily a visual cue; the unease component is present but not uniquely charged by that color in the final image. The ending leans more toward tentative hope than sustained unease.</comment>
