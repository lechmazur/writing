<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harmon's motivation is consistent and rooted in grief and vocational displacement. His micro-choices—collecting seeds, following bird calls, mixing compounds at dusk—are specific and embody his character's patient, ritualistic approach. Internal contradiction is present but muted: he believes in ancient pacts yet the text never dramatizes doubt or friction between belief and failure. The final kneeling moment earns quiet closure, but the protagonist's emotional arc remains largely stable rather than contradictory under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes pattern and image—jetty blooms, bird calls as coordinates, dead languages as pacts—and the final paragraph delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Harmon's patient carrying "as though the ancient agreement...had never been broken, only submerged" reweights the entire ritual with felt cost (isolation, obsolescence, endurance). Orientation is anchored early (Harmon, Gloom Hill, post-reef collapse). One meaningful deepening occurs when the first shoots appear, narrowing his stance from hope to commitment. Cost is legible in the image of him kneeling "with no passengers," alone in his belief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, battlefield hardpan, tidal pools, and Harmon's satchel all constrain his tactics and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "violet and green," "black, mineral-rich paste," "iron" taste of dead tongues. The jetty's impossible vitality juxtaposed against the dead reef and barren battlefield creates a spatial crucible that drives every choice. The final image—"narrow place to another"—depends entirely on the established geography and its constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: restore life to the battlefield that "remembered violence." Pressure coheres through accumulative deepening—buckets, mixing, whispering, planting—culminating in the autumn shoots. One meaningful tightening: the first primrose appearing validates his method and narrows his path to continuation. The cost is visible in his isolation ("no passengers") and the ongoing erosion ("the sea kept coming"). Agency is patient endurance with visible tradeoffs (time, solitude, the town's abandonment).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: grief, ritual, and the persistence of care in the face of ecological collapse. "Submerged concords" and "ancient agreement" recur with shifting weight, never stated as thesis. The final image—"as though the ancient agreement...had never been broken, only submerged, only waiting"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether restoration is possible. The piece resists tidy closure (the reef stays dead, the sea advances) while asserting the value of small, patient labor. No moralizing; the particulars (seed pods, bird calls, dead languages) generate meaning without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Harmon notices seeds, tonal intervals, and soil chemistry through a vocational and grief-steeped lens. Diction is elevated but consistent—"calcium-locked," "mycorrhizal," "Proto-Sinaitic"—and voice-motivated by his autodidact erudition. Rhythm modulates purposefully: long, meditative sentences in reflection, shorter beats at key moments ("The sprouts did not answer, but they grew"). No dialogue; the piece maintains control through interiority and image. Free indirect style is clean, with no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is controlled and apt ("narrow vastness," "bruised fruit," "blooming jetty"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor loop: "he believed—had always believed" is a paraphrase within one beat (−0.2). "Narrow vastness" is repeated as both feeling and image, which reads purposeful rather than artifactual. Clarity and momentum are strong; no major scaffolding or template cadence. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead languages, bird-call navigation, and battlefield restoration is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the familiar "nature reclaims" trope through Harmon's idiosyncratic method and the particularity of the jetty ecosystem. The piece commits fully to its conceit without retreat. Risk is present in the elevated diction and the absence of conventional plot turns, and both serve coherence. Slight derivativeness in the post-apocalyptic/ecological-grief frame, but the execution through sensory and ritual specificity lifts it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening; frames his displacement and vocational history. Drives the middle beats (collecting, translating bird calls, carrying materials). His patient, ritualistic choices shape every turn and the final kneeling image. Removing "coachman" would erase the thematic weight of driving/carrying and "no passengers."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("coat pockets heavy with dried seed pods"). Handled in multiple beats: collecting, labeling, crumbling husks, mixing with jetty gifts, planting. Returns in the closure paragraph ("One dead language, one bird call, one seed pod at a time"). The pods enable his method and charge the final image with specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("agreements the modern world had forgotten. Submerged concords"). Shapes his belief system and stakes (waking those pacts). Returns with reweighted meaning in the closure line ("as though the ancient agreement...had never been broken, only submerged"). Functions more as thematic resonance than tactical constraint, but it charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early and used across beats (Sumerian for roses, Akkadian, Hittite, Elamite at planting). Enables his ritual method and signals his isolation. Cost is implicit (no one else speaks them; his solitude is tied to this trait). However, it could be swapped for another esoteric knowledge system with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Central action signaled early ("tried to fertilize that ground") and developed across the arc: initial failure, discovery of jetty resources, mixing and planting, autumn shoots. The first sprouting is the key turn that narrows his stance to continuation. The closure image depends on this repeated action ("kept carrying...planting"). Removing it collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced in the middle ("Then he began listening to the birds") with a clear setup (whimbrel call matched to Sumerian hymn pattern). Mechanics matter: bird calls as coordinates guide him to nitrogen, fungi, algae. Shapes multiple beats and enables the fertilization method. Could be slightly more foregrounded early, but it drives the middle and supports closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Present from paragraph two and returns in nearly every beat. Supplies the ecosystem resources Harmon needs; the twilight glow ("violet and green") charges the atmosphere and final image. The jetty's blooming is the counterpoint to the battlefield's barrenness and shapes his hope. The setting constrains his tactics (he must carry materials from jetty to battlefield) and the closure image depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening line and recurs ("Now the coaches no longer came...the jetty refused"). Establishes the world state and Harmon's displacement. However, it functions more as backdrop than active pressure; no ticking clock tightens his decisions within the story window. The timeframe enables the premise but does not alter tactics beat to beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("He would let the garden reclaim what war had taken") and dramatized throughout: his grief for his grandfather, his repeated attempts to fertilize, his patient carrying and planting. Friction between want (restoration) and cost (isolation, ongoing effort, the sea's advance) is visible. The autumn shoots moment shows the want validated, and the closure reaffirms his commitment despite the reef staying dead.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful from the opening ("narrow corridor of life jutting into a vastness of gray water") through the closure ("as though the hill still had a destination"). The phrase "narrow vastness" appears twice, reweighted: first as feeling, then as stance. The tone modulates with pressure—meditative in description, tighter in action beats—and charges the final image with the cost of smallness and persistence.</comment>
