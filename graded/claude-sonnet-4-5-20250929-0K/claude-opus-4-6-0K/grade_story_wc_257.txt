<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between crafting mourning jewelry for others and her inability to process her own grief is embodied and specific. The micro-choice to ask for ink and trace the pattern is earned by the accumulation of Sable's gestures and her workshop loss. Interiority sometimes edges toward abstraction ("curtains of intention," "subdued ardor") but remains grounded in concrete action—picking up vellum, tracing lines. The transformation from paralysis to "her hand steady for the first time in months" is credibly motivated by the preceding beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, observatory, post-fire) land within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's act of drawing the first line reweights the dominant stake (resuming her craft, integrating loss) with visible cost—she must merge her mourning-jewelry practice with Sable's pattern of renewal. The final image ("at last, now") crystallizes options and forecloses avoidance with undeniable pressure. One micro turn (asking for ink, adding her own flourishes) deepens the stake without requiring multiple reversals. The lens holds; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory dome, vellum stencil, and starlight pinhole projection constrain Elara's choice: she must work within the space's tools and Sable's frame to begin again. The body detail (hand steadying, tracing with fingertip) charges the final beat. Micro-setting (drafting table, eyepiece, vellum warmth) shapes the closure image. Sensory specificity ("air tasted of copper," "starlight… warm") is selective and purposeful, though "granite ridge" and "no clocks, no calendars" edge toward postcard phrasing in the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resuming creative work after loss) is signaled early and tightens through the origami figures, Sable's explanation, and Elara's request for ink. The tightening choice—picking up the vellum and adding her own flourishes—narrows options (she can no longer hide behind avoidance) and is driven by protagonist agency. Visible cost: she must marry her craft to Sable's cartography, integrating the withering she resisted. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, and coincidence (Sable's gifts) complicates without resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (transformation of grief, "genuinely artificial" permanence, letting dead light still illuminate) emerges through the vellum projection, hair-behind-glass parallel, and the Cassiopeia star. The final image (graphite meeting vellum, "at last, now") reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Sable's refusal to argue and Elara's silence before action. Minor slip: "curtains of intention" is stated rather than fully dramatized, and "subdued ardor" edges toward meta-label. The resonance is non-literal and grows from particulars, though one or two abstractions dilute full integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara's perceptual bias (mourning jewelry, workshop fire, hand steadiness). Sable's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; his speech ("Genuinely artificial," "readiness is a lie") is distinct and philosophically tilted without breaking plausibility. Elara's internal voice is character-specific, though phrases like "subdued ardor" and "curtains of intention" occasionally slip into slightly elevated register. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Distance control is strong, though one or two abstract descriptors reduce perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high (vellum stencil, origami coordinates, Cassiopeia star, hair brooches all layer meaning). Clarity and concision are strong in most beats. Two prose artifacts touch high-pressure moments: "subdued ardor" in the climactic explanation reads as elevated diction outside Elara's established lexicon, and "curtains of intention" recurs without full dramatic grounding. Minor filter-verb cluster ("she'd come," "she'd ignored," "she'd been") in the opening third. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is consistent. Line-level control is strong but not flawless under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, dead starlight, and tattoo stencil as parallel forms of "genuinely artificial" permanence feels specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (grief as creative paralysis) avoids generic templates. The origami-coordinates method and vellum-pinhole projection are particular to this setting and character. Minor proximity risk: the dead-star-as-metaphor and "teaching withering to bloom" edge toward familiar lyric territory without full transformation. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications, but the central image (light from extinct sources) is not entirely fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession (mourning jewelry maker) frames the opening, middle recognition (she shaped others' grief but not her own), and closure choice (adding brooch and locket to the stencil). Present in all three gates; her decision to trace the pattern with her own flourishes drives the ending. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; cost is visible (merging her craft with Sable's frame). Specificity is high (hair behind glass, jet and gold). Score reflects solid integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil appears early (drafting table), is handled mid-scene (held to eyepiece, casting pinholes), and Elara picks it up at closure to trace and add her own marks. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (the stencil's design teaches her the architecture of grief reshaping) and closure linkage (she makes the pattern hers) are clear. The vellum's warmth is embodied. Removing it would break the closure logic. High integration; swappability is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is introduced mid-scene, explained by Sable, and Elara acknowledges the curtain parting at closure ("The curtain of intention parted… now"). Present in two gates (middle, ending). The concept shapes her recognition but is more thematic echo than on-page constraint. The final image gains some charge from the metaphor, but the concept is told more than dramatized. Moderate integration; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is introduced early (Sable's explanation of dead starlight), applied to Elara's brooches mid-scene, and implicitly present at closure (she draws, making new from withered sources). Three gates; the attribute frames the thematic premise and enables her choice to resume work. Causal role is moderate (it reframes her loss as still-useful light), but no single on-page action hinges on this exact trait with visible cost. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; integration is solid but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in the title metaphor (dead star still illuminates), Sable's stencil projecting starlight pinholes, his stated goal ("to teach withering to bloom again" via illumination), and the final beat (Elara's drawing as illumination of her path forward). Four touches; causal pressure is moderate (the concept enables her shift), closure linkage is strong. The action is more conceptual than physical; swappability is low. Integration is strong; removing it would weaken thematic coherence and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Origami figures with coordinates appear early (mailbox, coat pocket, tree, pillow), prompt Elara's climb to the observatory (setup and middle), and recur at closure (Sable folds another; "She didn't need to unfold it"). Three gates; the method is the causal bridge that moves Elara from paralysis to the observatory and frames the ending's confidence. Specificity is high (paper lotus, Cassiopeia coordinates). Causal pressure and closure linkage are both strong. Removing the method would break the inciting action and final reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory is present early (first paragraph anchor), houses the mid-scene stencil work, and is the closure location. Three gates; the setting supplies the tools (dome, eyepiece, vellum, starlight) that enable Elara's choice. The "timeless" quality (no clocks, no calendars) mirrors her grief paralysis and contrasts the closure's "now." Spatial choreography is clear (drafting table, dome, floor). The setting constrains resources and charges the final image moderately. Solid integration; could be made slightly more indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" (fire destroyed her workshop) is established in the opening and frames the entire arc. Present at setup; implicit pressure throughout (she "couldn't get out of bed"); closure resolves the timeframe ("at last, now"). Two gates (setup, ending). The timeframe provides context but does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat. No live clock or deadline. Functional integration; the backstory loss motivates the present choice, but the timeframe itself is static rather than escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sable's stated goal ("to teach withering to bloom again") appears mid-scene, Elara recognizes the architecture (grief reshaping), and her closure choice (drawing, adding flourishes) enacts the motivation. Two gates (middle, ending). The desire is dramatized in Sable's gestures and Elara's decision; friction arises from her prior avoidance. Causal pressure is moderate; the motivation enables the ending but is partly told. Cost is visible (she must integrate loss, not erase it). Solid integration; could be more fully embodied in on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is named once (describing Sable's voice) but the tone is coherent throughout: Sable's patient gestures, Elara's quiet recognition, the restrained final beat ("a whisper that said, at last, now"). The tone modulates from paralysis (opening) to charged stillness (closure) and supports the final image. Present across the arc; coheres through turns. One on-page label slightly reduces organic integration, but the tone charges the ending and is irreplaceable. Strong integration; nearly indispensable.</comment>
