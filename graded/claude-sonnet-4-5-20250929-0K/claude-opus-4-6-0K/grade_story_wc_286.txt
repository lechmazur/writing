<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("fingers reading the warped wood the way they once read wet clay"), with clear professional grounding that colors perception. Her motivation—understanding why some places resist erasure—drives present choices (examining the lantern, interpreting the thrumming) and earns the final stance of stillness as an answer rather than evasion. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her urge to act (walking three days, planning to return to her wheel) and the oasis's lesson in passive presence. The final renunciation (staying still, giving presence "freely, without calculation") forecloses the path of extraction with visible cost: she delays her return journey and suspends her maker's identity to receive the oasis's testimony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers sensory detail, fractured-timeline imagery, and the "phototropic to kindness" thesis toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Sable's stillness and presence as answer). Orientation anchors (Sable, oasis, present action) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—"she was still" and the final paragraph's testimony—reconfigures the opening question with conceptual cost: she relinquishes the potter's agency (making, shaping) to embody the keepers' mercy. One pressure turn: the lantern-triggered thrumming that reveals fractured timelines and reweights her question from "resist change" to "resist erasure." Causal linkage is soft (lens, thrumming, understanding) but the accumulative design teaches the pattern and the closure lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The oasis's green-amid-scorched-wasteland materiality constrains Sable's journey (three-day walk, no other destination) and charges the final image: kneeling "in the green among the ruined hives" embodies the phototropic thesis. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "sand that had no business being there," "chimney smoke…flattened against the horizon," lantern glass "faded to the color of weak tea." The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, reappearing with reweighted meaning (light-focusing tool → timeline-revealing lens → carried artifact of understanding). Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling beside frame, walking to shed, sitting among hives). The setting's recursive timelines (lush/scorched/green/abandoned) supply the conceptual constraint that answers Sable's question and shape her final choice to stay still.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding why some places resist change, signaled in paragraph two and reweighted at closure as "resist erasure" via accumulated small mercies. One meaningful tightening: the lantern-triggered thrumming forces a perceptual shift (oasis as singular entity → oasis as overlapping timelines) that narrows Sable's interpretive options and crystallizes the phototropic-to-kindness thesis. Agency is renunciation with cost: she abandons the question's frame ("resisted change" → "resisted erasure") and defers action (walking back tomorrow, not today) to give presence. The price—delayed return, suspended maker identity—is felt rather than decisive but legible on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases from physical oasis to fractured-timeline vision to conceptual answer, each layer reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—gentleness as resistance mechanism, mercy as structural accumulation—emerges through concrete images (water left for strangers, seedling pressed into cracked earth, Sable's stillness). The lantern-glass revelation and the closing testimony avoid overt moralizing. However, the final two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary: "accumulated small mercies, stacked like clay coils" and "someone chose to be gentle" articulate the thesis rather than leaving it implicit. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy morals (the oasis's survival is contingent, not guaranteed), but the closing lines ("without calculation, without guarantee, knowing only…") declare meaning rather than trusting the dramatized stillness to carry it. Subtext operates cleanly in earlier beats (sun-following as navigation metaphor, chimney smoke as atmospheric constraint) but thins at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Sable's potter's lens colors all observation ("fingers reading," "clay coils," "vessels…meant to be held"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "wound that refused to stop bleeding green," "sharp gentleness," "phototropic to kindness" (the last borrows scientific register but reads as Sable's synthesis). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences during the lantern vision ("not as it was, but as it had been and would be, layered like transparencies"), shorter declaratives at closure ("She gave it freely"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no POV leakage. Purposeful compression in the thrumming sequence ("resonance…not a vibration she could attribute to machinery") maintains clarity and momentum. Minor slip: "phototropic to kindness" in the thesis paragraph reads slightly elevated for immediate interiority, though the scientific idiom fits a potter's educated voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance image, understanding, or Sable's stance. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (long accumulative vision sequence, short declaratives at closure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "wound that refused to stop bleeding green," "patience was not passive—it was the most aggressive form of attention," "phototropic to kindness" (extended botanical metaphor). Minor overwriting in the final two paragraphs: "accumulated small mercies, stacked like clay coils, each one fragile, the whole structure strong" restates the thesis already shown; "someone chose to be gentle" appears three times in close proximity (final paragraph). The closing lines edge toward summary rather than trusting the image to carry weight. No grammar errors, clear action order, no scaffolding. The overwriting touches the closure beat but does not obscure causality—apply mid-deduction within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fractured-timelines premise is fresh within the oasis-survival frame, and the phototropic-to-kindness synthesis offers a non-obvious angle on post-apocalyptic persistence. Sable's potter identity is purposefully integrated (clay-reading fingers, wheel patience, coil metaphor) rather than ornamental. The lantern glass as timeline-revealing tool is specific and irreplaceable. However, the emotional arc—solitary seeker walks to mysterious place, receives vision, gains understanding, departs changed—follows a familiar template. The ending's articulation of the thesis ("accumulated small mercies," "someone chose to be gentle") reduces risk by explaining rather than trusting image and action. Transformation test: the core arc (journey, revelation, return) could function in other settings with different objects; the oasis and potter specifics elevate but do not fundamentally alter the shape. Within-band risk credit (+0.2) for the fractured-timeline lens and phototropic metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sable (zen-minded potter) frames the narrative and makes two key choices: examining the lantern glass (triggers thrumming vision) and choosing stillness over immediate return (closure). Her potter's lens colors all perception and the clay-coil metaphor charges the thesis. Setup by paragraph one; middle choice (holding lantern to sun) enables the timeline vision; closure participation (staying still, giving presence) answers her question. Causal pressure: her decision to examine the lantern narrows interpretive options, and her final stillness forecloses the maker's path with felt cost (delayed return, suspended craft identity). Score reflects clean integration across all three gates and strong causal/closure linkage, reduced slightly because observation dominates over high-stakes decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lantern glass appears in three beats: discovery near shed, sun-focusing examination (triggers thrumming), and carried artifact in closure paragraph. Setup after opening (≤33%); middle use enables the fractured-timeline vision (reweights Sable's question from "resist change" to "resist erasure"); closure participation as carried symbol of understanding. Specificity: "faded to the color of weak tea, scratched by decades of grit" and light-focusing property are irreplaceable. Causal pressure: without the glass, no timeline vision, no phototropic thesis, no earned stillness. Cost tied to element: the vision forces Sable to abandon her original question and defer action. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff; slight reduction because the glass is handled rather than physically constrained.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fractured timelines structure the lantern-glass vision (oasis layered across past/future versions, each showing kindness) and articulate the phototropic-to-kindness thesis. Setup deferred until midpoint (lantern vision paragraph); middle use shapes Sable's realization; closure participation via the understanding she will carry ("fractured and reformed across countless timelines"). The concept reweights the dominant stake (why resist change → how resist erasure) with conceptual cost (abandoning the original question's frame). However, the timelines remain perceptual/thematic rather than tactical: Sable does not navigate or choose between timelines; they inform her understanding but do not constrain on-page action. Score reflects strong thematic integration and closure linkage but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" appears as the thesis emerging from the timeline vision: the oasis persists because "enough people, in enough versions of this place, had chosen gentleness over extraction." Setup implicit in opening (oasis as "one wound that refused to stop bleeding green"); explicit articulation at midpoint; closure participation as the conceptual answer Sable carries. The attribute constrains interpretation (reframes "resist change" as "resist erasure via accumulated mercy") and enables Sable's final stillness (she enacts the phototropic pattern by giving presence without calculation). Cost: the realization forecloses other explanations and obligates Sable to embody the keepers' mercy. Score reflects strong thematic/conceptual integration but limited tactical constraint—the attribute shapes understanding more than on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thrumming triggers the fractured-timeline vision that reweights Sable's question and delivers the phototropic-to-kindness thesis. Setup at midpoint ("thrumming began…rose from the ground"); middle use enables the timeline revelation; closure participation as the "quiet testimony" Sable feels while kneeling. Causal pressure: without the thrumming, no vision, no reweighted question, no earned stillness. Specificity: "resonance, as though the earth itself were a string plucked by an unseen hand" and amplification via lantern glass are irreplaceable. Cost: the thrumming forces Sable to abandon her original question and defer action. Strong integration across beats and closure; reduction for midpoint first appearance (−0.3 per late-signal friction) and because the thrumming is perceptual rather than physically constraining.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Following sun patterns" anchors Sable's three-day journey to the oasis in the opening paragraph: "following sun patterns the way a navigator follows stars, tracing the arc of light across the blackened earth." Setup clear; the method enables her arrival (development gate) but does not reappear or constrain middle choices. Closure participation absent—the sun's arc is mentioned again ("the sun carved its familiar arc overhead") but as atmospheric detail, not causal element. Swappability: any navigation method (landmarks, maps, memory) could replace sun-following with minor edits. The method is functional but not irreplaceable or charged with cost. Score reflects setup + arrival enablement, reduced for missing closure linkage and low specificity pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland frames all action and constrains Sable's choices: no other destination within three days' walk, green materiality charges the phototropic thesis, ruined hives supply tactile grounding. Setup in opening paragraph; middle pressure via lantern discovery "near the old keeper's shed" and thrumming "from the ground"; closure participation as the spatial anchor for Sable's stillness ("kneeling in the green among the ruined hives"). The oasis's persistence across fractured timelines drives the conceptual answer. Causal pressure: without the oasis's inexplicable survival, no question, no timeline vision, no thesis. Cost: the oasis's testimony obligates Sable to embody the keepers' pattern (stillness, presence). Strong integration across setup, development, payoff with high irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" provides atmospheric detail in paragraph three: "Chimney smoke from her small camp stove flattened against the horizon…as though the atmosphere wanted nothing rising today. Sable took this as a sign to stay low, to listen." Setup after opening; the smoke signals caution but does not constrain later choices—Sable's stillness at closure is driven by the oasis's testimony, not the smoke's warning. The timeframe is present-continuous (one afternoon/evening) but not ticking; no clock tightens decisions. Closure mention ("chimney smoke continued its flat drift") is atmospheric, not causal. Swappability: any weather/atmospheric cue could replace smoke. Score reflects setup + one interpretive choice (stay low) but missing development and closure pressure; time is stable rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sable's motivation "to understand why some places resist change" is signaled in paragraph two, drives her three-day journey and on-page investigation (examining hive frame, lantern glass), and is reweighted at closure as "resist erasure" via the phototropic thesis. Setup early; middle choices (holding lantern to sun, interpreting thrumming) pursue the question; closure delivers the answer with cost (she must abandon the question's original frame and embody the keepers' mercy through stillness). Internal friction: her maker's identity (potter, shaper) tensions the oasis's lesson in passive presence. The motivation is dramatized through concrete action and charged with conceptual cost at closure. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff; reduction for limited on-page conflict between wanting and fearing (the friction is conceptual rather than visceral).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is articulated in paragraph three ("gentleness could cut deeper than cruelty…the sharpest truths arrived wrapped in softness") and modulates through the piece: precise attention (examining lantern), soft purpose (staying still, giving presence), the oasis's lesson (small mercies stacked into structural strength). The tone charges the final image: Sable's stillness is both precise (forecloses the maker's path) and soft (gives presence without calculation). Coherence across turns: initial investigation (sharp observation) → timeline vision (gentle understanding) → closure stillness (embodied mercy). The tone is consistent yet modulates with pressure, though the final paragraphs' thematic articulation ("sharp gentleness the desert had taught her") edges toward label rather than embodiment. Score reflects strong tonal coherence and closure charge, reduced slightly for late explicit statement of the tone rather than trusting image alone.</comment>
