<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—her careful gardening, the counting of buds, the handling of the gauge tooth all convey pragmatic grief without label-speak. The contradiction between hope and realism is enacted rather than described ("hoped, in that quiet way that costs nothing and changes everything"). The closure choice—embedding mirrors—feels earned by her history and her parents' legacy, though the action itself is more symbolic gesture than high-stakes decision. Minor slip: the phrase "wistfully pragmatic" appears as a narrator label rather than emerging fully from dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (fire escape, dusk to moonlight, bare rosebush) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the petal's fall triggers a ritual of mirror-planting that reweights the opening loss. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maren standing with "hands in the light," having transformed the alley through precision and care, with the cost legible in the season's end and her solitary vigil. The tightening is modest but present: from passive observation to active choice, from bare bush to scattered light. One persistent constraint (the rosebush's bareness, her parents' absence) shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fire escape, harbor, alley, and window box are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Maren's gardener's attention. The mirrors she plants are not mere decoration—they constrain her choice (she selects and angles each fragment) and charge the final image (the alley "held points of moonlight like scattered seeds"). Micro-setting as setting: the coffee can of mirror shards, the rusted window box, the precise moonlight geometry all anchor the closure beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to honor loss and continuity after the roses are gone—is signaled early and tightens through the mirror-planting action, which forecloses nostalgia in favor of pragmatic reflection. The escalation is Accumulative: from noticing the last petal to standing five stories above the dark with her hands in the light. The cost is felt (the season is over, her parents are dead, she works alone) but the pressure is gentle; no live antagonist or high-friction choice tests commitment at the level required for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rosebush, gauge tooth, and mirrors: precision, inherited care, reflecting light into dark corners. The final image—"tending what remained"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to carry forward what's been lost) without moralizing. The "quivering hush" and "wistfully pragmatic" labels drift toward thematic echo, but the mirrors-as-seeds metaphor and the lockmaster's precision elevate specificity. Subtext operates cleanly in the silence, the rhythm of oars, the scattered reflections.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent and apt. The perceptual signature is distinct—Maren notices harbor light, soil, angles—and diction matches her careful, grieving attention. Rhythmic control is strong: "push, settle, push, settle" and the accumulative syntax in the mirror-planting beat support pressure without obscuring clarity. Minor slip: "wistfully pragmatic" and "protected and vulnerable in equal measure" read as narrator summary rather than character-particular thought, creating brief register drift in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with high information density ("The water held the moon the way a cupped palm holds something precious—loosely, knowing it would spill"). No loops or scaffold. Two frictions prevent higher scoring: (1) figurative language is dense in several beats ("quivering hush," "blade of reflected light," "tidal time," "canyon of brick and shadow") without full pattern-teaching, creating minor overwriting in the harbor description; (2) the phrase "protected and vulnerable in equal measure" in the penultimate paragraph is abstract summary rather than embodied perception. The closure image itself is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener premise and the mirror-planting closure are specific and non-obvious; the synthesis of lockmaster precision, inherited grief, and literal light-reflection feels earned in hindsight. The piece transforms the "tending what remains" frame through verifiable detail (bitting gauge tooth, mirror fragments, Mrs. Okafor's grandchildren). One friction: the conceptual infrastructure (light into dark, precision as care, gardens as whatever you tend) is articulated with slight thematic visibility rather than remaining fully implicit, nudging the piece toward prompt-response rather than singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choice to plant mirrors is the story's decisive action, signaled by her earlier counting and care. She appears in all major beats: noticing the petal, holding the gauge tooth, planting the mirrors, standing at closure. Her decision alters tactics (from passive witness to active light-scattering) and the closure depends on her agency. Early signal, middle development, and closure participation all present; causal pressure and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gauge tooth appears in two distinct beats: held up to moonlight (mid-story) and pressed back into her pocket (closure paragraph). Its specificity (lockmaster's precision) charges both her inheritance and her mirror-angling action. It does not constrain a choice directly but reweights the final image by linking her father's craft to her own. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance; setup and closure present, middle development light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "quivering hush" appears once as a phrase ("A quivering hush settled over the harbor") and is echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("The quivering hush held"). It marks the shift from motion to stillness, enabling Maren's planting work, and it charges the closure atmosphere. It shapes one key turn (the harbor's stillness allows the mirrors' effect to be legible) but does not constrain multiple choices. Setup, middle atmosphere, and closure presence; modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The trait "wistfully pragmatic" is named once by the narrator and dramatized throughout: Maren counts buds, accepts the season's end, yet plants mirrors in hope. The trait enables her closure action (pragmatic enough to work with mirrors, wistful enough to scatter light for neighbors) and appears at closure ("wistfully pragmatic" is repeated). Visible on-page tradeoff (acceptance of loss versus symbolic action) though the label itself is narrator summary rather than fully embodied choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Instill" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("She wanted to instill in this place what her parents had instilled in her") and governs the entire mirror-planting sequence. The action—instilling belief through precision—is the story's major turn and redefines options from passive grief to active tending. Early desire (implied through her parents' legacy), middle execution (the mirrors), and closure articulation all present. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" appears in the opening (the boats' pulse matches her breathing) and is explicitly invoked during the planting ("She worked with the rhythm of oars in water—push, settle, push, settle"). The method shapes her planting tactics and charges the closure by linking her solitary work to the harbor's communal pulse. Setup, middle use, and closure echo present; modest causal role in pacing the action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harbor and moonlight are vividly rendered and supply the resource (reflected light) that Maren redirects via mirrors. The setting constrains her action (she can only work at night when moonlight is strong) and the final image depends on the harbor's "shimmer" to validate her effort. Early signal, middle atmosphere, and closure charge all present; the moonlight's geometry is causally necessary to the mirror-planting outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the final petal drops"—is signaled in the opening sentence and governs the entire piece. The petal's fall triggers Maren's mirror-planting, and the bare rosebush constrains her choice (she cannot tend blooms, so she tends light). The ending's "by the time she finished" and the persistent moonlight track time across the action. Setup, middle pressure, and closure all depend on this temporal anchor; high causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire "to reflect light into dark corners" is dramatized early ("That was what she wanted") and enacted through the mirror-planting sequence, which scatters moonlight into the alley and neighbors' windows. The motivation is inherited (her father's locksmith precision, her mother's seeds) and tested by the rosebush's bareness. Setup, middle action, and closure image all center this desire; visible cost (solitary labor, acceptance of loss) and causal pressure elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone "protected vulnerability" is articulated mid-story ("the way vulnerability feels when you've built just enough shelter to survive it") and modulates coherently: Maren is sheltered by ritual and precision yet exposed by grief and solitude. The tone charges the closure paragraph ("protected and vulnerable in equal measure") and shapes her careful, solitary work. Setup implicit, middle articulation, and closure reprise present; tone supports pressure without static uniformity.</comment>
