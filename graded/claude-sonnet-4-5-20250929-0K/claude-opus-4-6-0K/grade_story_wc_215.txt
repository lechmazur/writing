<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's covenant with silence is rendered through concrete choices—seven years without speech, building the stained glass box, opening it for Elara—and her interior logic (guilt crystallized as preserved words) reads particular and embodied. The backstory (Elara's drowning, Maren's seven-second paralysis) anchors her renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: "tranquilly perceptive" appears as an authorial label rather than emerging from dramatized perception under pressure, costing ~0.2. The final choice (opening the box, letting silence be enough) feels earned by prior causality and forecloses speech with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors (who, where, when) land within the first two paragraphs; the ghost arrival provides the situational frame. The piece accumulates pressure through Maren's reflective interiority and the ghost's silent patience, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): opening the box reweights the covenant without breaking silence, and Elara's dissolution into light constitutes visible cost. The lens holds cleanly; the closure image (colored light, the box set on the hive ledge) reconfigures the opening's "weight" and "crystallizing" metaphors with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, dead hives, and the stained glass box function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure. The box's colored light "painted the scorched earth in brief, impossible beauty" and is placed "where the sun could find it," altering Maren's relationship to the oasis. Sensory detail (wax cathedrals, heat distortion, fractured light) filters through Maren's bias toward silence and preservation. The hive architecture recurs with purpose (standing among collapsed supers, ledge placement) rather than as postcard description, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to preserve or release the unspoken covenant with Elara. The ghost's appearance tightens pressure by making the covenant visible and testing Maren's belief that silence holds more meaning than speech. Agency: Maren's choice to open the box (decision) and to "let the silence be enough" (renunciation of speech) forecloses the path of verbal apology with felt cost—she remains silent, but the silence transforms. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening (ghost arrival → box opening) with visible cost (Elara dissolves, silence changes) scaled appropriately for this length. Escalation is driven by protagonist insight ("the ghosts were not trying to speak. They were trying to listen") under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken words as covenant, silence as presence rather than absence—emerges organically from the stained glass box, the ghost's mute eloquence, and Maren's final renunciation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "It was no longer the absence of speech. It was the presence of everything speech would have diminished." No overt moralizing; the transformation is imaged (colored light, Elara's dissolution) rather than stated. Quiet close charged by prior particulars (hives, river, seven-year silence). Minor risk: "Some promises exist only in the spaces between words" verges on thematic summary but remains anchored to the on-page action of holding the box and not speaking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices silence, weight, light through colored glass, the "tranquilly perceptive" filter. Diction ("covenant, tangled and binding," "mute eloquence," "astonished recognition") is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated for a literary register. No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately (compressed urgency when opening the box, lyric expansion in the final paragraphs). Minor density slip: "tangled because it bound them both to what had not been said, and untangling it would have destroyed its meaning" explains what the prior image already dramatized, costing ~0.2 for slight redundancy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarative "She had not spoken since" contrasts with longer reflective periods). Clarity remains strong through complex figurative language ("honey crystallizing," "cathedral color"). Minor loop: "the silence remained unbroken. But the silence had changed. It was no longer the absence of speech. It was the presence of everything speech would have diminished" repeats "silence" four times across three sentences in the penultimate paragraph, creating slight synonym churn (~−0.3). No other scaffolding or filter-verb stacks. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead bees, stained glass, visible ghosts, and unspoken covenant is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template apocalypse or ghost-story beats. The transformation of grief into communion through silence rather than speech inverts expected catharsis. Risk-taking (prolonged interiority, ghost arrival at midpoint, no dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity: the "weight of unsaid words" and "things left unspoken" are well-worn motifs; the piece transforms them through the stained glass box and the ghost's patient listening, but the underlying premise echoes many literary stories of regret and silence, costing ~0.4 for proximity to template emotional territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (astonished recluse) drives key turns: understanding the ghosts are listening, retrieving the box, opening it, and choosing to let silence be enough. Astonishment appears explicitly ("astonishment rise in her own chest") and implicitly (her recognition of the ghosts' purpose). Early signal (paragraph 1), middle choice (retrieving/opening box), closure linkage (holding the box, walking inside still silent). Visible cost: she remains a recluse, silence unbroken, but transformed. Specificity: her reclusiveness is tied to the covenant, not generic isolation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stained glass box is introduced early (paragraph 6), handled in two distinct beats (retrieval, opening), and its colored light charges the closure image (final paragraph: "set the box on the ledge...colored light followed her"). Causal pressure: the box embodies the preserved words; opening it enables communion without speech. Closure linkage: the box's placement and lingering light constitute the final reconfiguration. Irreplaceability: stained glass (church fragments, ruby/sapphire/gold) is thematically and visually specific; a generic container would not carry the sacred/cathedral resonance that mirrors the hives and transforms the wasteland.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is named and explained (paragraph 3, paragraph 13) and shapes Maren's stake: preserve or release the unspoken bond. It constrains her choice (she cannot speak without shattering it) and is thematically active (untangling would destroy meaning). Closure linkage: "still holding the covenant close" in the penultimate paragraph. However, the concept is largely told ("She understood through contextual clues what the tangled covenant...required") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The "tangled" quality—binding both sisters to what was not said—is asserted more than it complicates Maren's on-page choices. Functional but the tangle itself does not visibly narrow tactics or create friction within the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears as a narrative label (paragraph 4: "Maren, tranquilly perceptive in her ruined oasis, simply gazed...and understood") but is not demonstrated through on-page action under pressure. Her insight—ghosts are listening, not speaking—arrives as summary rather than a choice-laden discovery that costs her something or alters her tactics. The attribute colors her stance (calm amid global panic) but does not enable or constrain a specific beat with visible tradeoff. Meets two gates (setup via label, closure presence via her continued tranquility) but lacks middle development where the trait narrows options or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs across multiple beats: Maren gazes at Elara (paragraph 4, paragraph 12), Elara gazes at Maren with patience (paragraph 7), and the final "let the silence be enough" implicitly continues the gazing stance. The action is thematically specific (silent witnessing vs. speaking) and shapes the closure (communion happens through mutual gaze, not dialogue). However, the gaze is not irreplaceable; "watched," "looked," or "observed" could substitute with minor tonal cost. The action is essential to tone and theme but does not uniquely constrain mechanics or tactics in a way a more physical verb might.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is signaled (paragraph 9: "She understood through contextual clues what the tangled covenant between them required") and shapes Maren's realization that ghosts need acknowledgment, not speech. The method is present in the middle (her inference about the ghosts' purpose) and implicitly in the closure (she opens the box without instruction). However, the mechanics are summary-told rather than shown through specific on-page cues Maren interprets. The method is functional but its texture—what contextual clues, which details she reads—remains abstract, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis supplies the central image system (dead hives, wax cathedrals, hexagonal architecture) that recurs at closure ("set the box on the ledge of the nearest hive"). The scorched wasteland pressures Maren's isolation and mirrors her internal state ("nothing green survived"). The setting enables the stained glass box to throw cathedral color across the dead combs, transforming the oasis into something "holier than bees." Early signal (paragraph 1), middle use (Elara stands among collapsed supers), closure charge (hive ledge placement, colored light on scorched earth). Irreplaceability: beekeeping imagery (hexagonal, honey crystallizing, hive architecture) is thematically braided with the covenant and silence motifs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after ghosts become visible") is established in paragraph 4 and provides the inciting situation: global panic contrasts with Maren's understanding. The ghost arrival tightens Maren's stake (the covenant becomes testable). However, the timeframe itself does not impose urgency; the ghosts appear to wait indefinitely ("Only patience"). The piece uses the timeframe to frame the world state and Maren's insight but does not deploy a live clock that alters her tactics. The temporal anchor (eleven years since Elara's death, seven years of silence, ghost visibility now) shapes backstory more than forward pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to preserve the weight of unspoken words" is dramatized through her seven-year silence, building the box, and her covenant belief (paragraph 3). The motivation is tested when the ghost appears: she must choose whether preservation means continued silence or a new form of acknowledgment. Friction: her want (preserve silence) conflicts with potential cost (failing Elara again). Closure: she preserves silence but transforms its meaning, paying the cost of remaining wordless while accepting communion. The motivation is specific, constrains choices, and is visible in the final action (holding the box, walking inside still silent).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is coherent throughout: no dialogue, silent ghosts, unspoken covenant, the box that releases "no sound" yet conveys everything. Tone modulates purposefully (tranquil early, charged at the box opening, elegiac at closure) without breaking the mute frame. The final image ("colored light followed her") crystallizes the tone—eloquence achieved through light and silence rather than words. The tone is not static; it deepens from solitary preservation to shared communion, and the shift charges the closure. Irreplaceability: any spoken resolution would shatter the tone and thematic integrity.</comment>
