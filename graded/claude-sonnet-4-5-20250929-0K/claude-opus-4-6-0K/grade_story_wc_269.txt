<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and rooted in her witness role; the tapping ritual embodies her need to make data physical. Her discovery of the anomaly and recognition that "the paths didn't drown—they were pulled down" shows micro-choices under intellectual pressure. The final choice to leave the atlas page pinned is understated but forecloses nostalgia in favor of evidence, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: data assembly deepens through month seven until the anomaly reveals a previously invisible mechanism, reweighting the atlas page and Maren's witness role. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the paths become evidence; the sea "still assembling its case"), with conceptual cost legible in the final image of drifting consequence. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<comment>Station 11's pilings, the tide gauge, the steel desktop, and the atlas page function as micro-setting that constrains Maren's daily ritual and charges the final image when she feels the station "shudder faintly with the tide beneath her." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through professional priorities (calibrations, logs, instrument formats). The Coral Sea and Torres Strait geography ground the stakes without touristic catalog. Setting participates in closure when the moored station embodies drifting consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: why do paths disappear (human and hydraulic)? The anomaly discovery at month seven tightens knowledge and narrows her understanding from surface drowning to subsurface collapse, altering her framing of witness and evidence. Maren's agency is attention and assembly; the decision to leave the page pinned forecloses nostalgia with visible (if quiet) cost. One meaningful deepening via the "delayed revelation" reweights tactics and meaning without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the "periodically eternal" tides and the gap between halted cause and stored consequence. The atlas page shifts from nostalgia anchor to evidence without stated moral. The final image—"the sea, periodically eternal, was still assembling its case"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Maren's question about disappearance and witness, reweighting the opening without abstraction. Subtext operates through the tapping ritual (prayer disguised as habit) and the word "witness" following her "like a title she never sought."</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: diction matches Maren's scientific training filtered through grief and ritual ("periodically eternal, a phrase she had once written in a grant application and then couldn't stop thinking about"). POV distance remains stable; psychic certainty fits what she can know. The prose modulates appropriately between data assembly and embodied perception (chest-deep in bleaching coral; tapping rhythms on steel). No dialogue; interior texture stays consistent under pressure with no register drift into therapy-speak or over-articulation.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor voice and the atlas immediately. Information density is high (witness role, fossil fuel ban context, forty-year data assembly compressed economically). Minor template cadence appears in the middle section ("She checked the instruments, checked the logs, checked the calibrations") but serves percussive rhythm and does not obscure causality. The phrase "periodically eternal" recurs with added meaning at closure. Figurative language is sparse and integrated ("stitches numbers the way archaeologists stitch pottery"). One paraphrase slip ("The paths didn't drown. They were pulled down.") adds emphasis rather than looping redundantly.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of witness guilt, data assembly, and subsurface collapse as mechanism for path disappearance feels specific and non-obvious. The tapping ritual transforms percussive tradition into solitary prayer, avoiding token cultural detail. "Periodically eternal" as descriptor for tides that cycle faithfully yet arrive higher is fresh. The atlas page as evidence rather than nostalgia offers a non-sentimental angle on climate consequence. The piece commits fully to its premise (stored thermal memory, delayed revelation) without retreat into generic resilience or hope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren as bleaching witness is signaled early, drives the middle discovery (anomaly tied to reefs she watched bleach twenty years ago), and charges the closure when she recognizes herself as "moored...tethered to a wound she had watched open and still could not close." Her choices (data assembly, leaving the page pinned) trace directly to her witness role. The word "witness" recurs with reweighted cost at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The atlas page is handled in three beats: pinned above the desk (opening), consulted when the anomaly corresponds to vanished paths (middle discovery), and left pinned as evidence rather than nostalgia (closure). Its meaning shifts from personal anchor to forensic proof. Removal would break the story's logic connecting past observation to present revelation and the final decision.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>"Delayed revelation" structures the entire narrative: the anomaly appears in month seven of assembly work, revealing that bleaching twenty years ago caused subsurface collapse now. The concept shapes Maren's task (assembling fragmented records to infer the curve) and delivers the turn when she realizes paths were "pulled down" rather than drowned. It participates in closure when the sea is "still assembling its case," echoing Maren's method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Periodically eternal" describes the tides' faithful cycle arriving at higher marks, introduced early and returned at closure to frame the sea's patient assembly of consequence. It shapes Maren's perception of her work as both cyclic and shifted, constraining her understanding of witness. The phrase's recurrence at the end reweights the opening premise with undeniable pressure, though it remains primarily descriptive rather than enabling a visible tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>"Assemble" governs Maren's task (stitching fragmented data), her method (inferring the curve from shards), and the story's revelation logic (the anomaly emerges only through assembly). The verb reappears in the final line ("the sea...was still assembling its case"), linking her work to the ocean's patient accrual of evidence. Major turns trace directly to this action: month seven of assembly yields the discovery; assembly makes the paths' mechanism visible. Swapping for "analyze" or "compile" would lose the forensic and geological resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The tapping ritual is introduced early (marking tidal cycles, grounding abstract data), practiced on multiple surfaces (desktop, railings, tide gauge), and returns in the penultimate paragraph when Maren taps and feels the station shudder. It embodies her need to make numbers physical and her isolation ("colleagues thought it was a nervous habit. It was closer to prayer"). While it charges her stance, it does not enable or constrain a key tactical choice with visible cost, limiting it to two-gate integration (setup and closure reprise).</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Station 11 houses the data work, supplies the tide gauge and steel desktop for the tapping ritual, and participates in closure when Maren feels its pilings "shudder faintly with the tide beneath her," making her moored witness status literal. The setting pressures choices by isolating her with instruments and incomplete logs. The specific geography (Coral Sea, Torres Strait) grounds the paths' disappearance, though the station itself functions more as workspace than active constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The fossil fuel ban timeframe establishes the gap between halted cause and stored consequence, shaping the premise that "the ban removed the cause, but the oceans held memory." It anchors Maren's current age (forty-three, seventeen years after witnessing bleaching at twenty-six) and the anomaly window (2031–2034). The timeframe tightens the story's logic (delayed revelation depends on elapsed decades) and participates thematically in "periodically eternal," though it does not create a live ticking clock that alters moment-to-moment tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Maren's desire "to discover why some paths disappear—not the hydraulic explanation, which she already knew, but the human one" is dramatized in the opening and tested when the anomaly reveals both mechanisms at once (subsurface collapse, bureaucratic erasure from maps). Her question drives the data assembly and is answered at closure when the paths become evidence rather than nostalgia. The motivation is conflicted (witness guilt, the need to make abstract loss concrete) and forecloses sentimentality with visible cost in the final moored image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>"Drifting moored" tone is established early (the station measures "slow, patient ambition to climb"; tides are "periodically eternal") and coheres through turns without flattening. The tone modulates subtly: clinical during data work, embodied during the bleaching memory, charged at the anomaly discovery, and quietly resolute at closure when Maren feels herself "drifting in the same slow current of consequence, tethered to a wound." The oxymoron charges the final image by literalizing her simultaneous fixity and drift.</comment>
