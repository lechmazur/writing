<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation of forgotten names through sound—but her choices are largely maintenance rather than transformative decisions under pressure. The lullaby moment triggers observation and recognition, not a decision that alters her path. Internal contradiction is present (the cracked tube she won't repair as a philosophy) but doesn't drive competing impulses in action. The embodied sorrow "particular sorrow of someone who understands that beauty and loss are the same substance" reads slightly over-articulated for peak emotional experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Maren continues her work with explicit acknowledgment she will not save them all, forecloses hope of total preservation, and the final image of the lullaby echo searching for the next orchid charges that acceptance with cost. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the inventory-work frame and delivers through density and cadence shift at the terrace-lighting sequence. Orientation anchors (Maren, Opal Library, cloud terrace) land within the opening passage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lullaby activates all orchids, reweighting her solitary cataloging into a constellation of loss, then she returns to systematic work with fuller knowledge of scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting that constrains Maren's philosophy (imperfection as witness) and charges the closure when it produces the lullaby that lights the orchids. The Opal Library's vertical position above clouds, the terrace railing, and the glass orchids as both setting and stakes-object create a coherent spatial frame. Sensory detail is purposeful: "hollow crystal stems," "milky iridescence," "foxglove-purple" light. The wind chime's physical state (crack from lip to base) matters causally when it produces the melody despite no wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving name-sounds before they vanish—is signaled in paragraph three and tested when the orchids illuminate in response to Maren's own name sung in her mother's voice. The tightening occurs on-page: recognition that "she would not save them all" crystallizes from abstract work into embodied limit after witnessing the constellation. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she returns to row-by-row checking knowing it is insufficient. The Museum of Extinct Feelings visit is recounted rather than dramatized, weakening the backstory's pressure contribution by −0.3.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus inevitable loss emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked tube, dimming orchids, foxglove regret as "gorgeous and poisonous." The final image—lullaby echo still searching—reweights the opening's patient cataloging into a charged acceptance that witness matters even when rescue fails. "Foxglove regret" operates as embodied concept (beauty/poison) rather than abstract label. The line "beauty and loss are the same substance viewed from different angles" edges toward thesis statement but remains integrated through the orchid-lighting sequence that dramatizes the claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices resonance, luminance loss, reverent dust—caretaker's lexicon throughout. Psychic distance remains stable third-limited with controlled access to her interiority. The prose texture is lyric and consistent: "catalogued whispers," "pressed petals of languages no throat would ever shape again." Brief register lift at "the particular sorrow of someone who understands" feels slightly elevated but recovers. No dialogue present. Diction stays within an educated, solitary caretaker's range with occasional poetic compression that serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: "bottled silences, catalogued whispers, and the pressed petals of languages" does triple work (world, tone, stakes). Rhythm modulates effectively from systematic description to the terrace-lighting crescendo to quiet return. Two minor loops: "the way a mother's voice shaped... the way a lover's whisper carved" uses identical stems in adjacent clauses (−0.2). "Deserted marvels" list (Cathedral of Tides, Inverted Garden, Museum) front-loads world detail that doesn't pressure the present scene; strategic but dense (−0.1). No clarity breaks; propulsion remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of caretaker-as-archivist, sound-preservation (not text), and glass orchids as living indicators is specific and non-obvious. The cracked wind chime as philosophy-object and closure trigger is purposeful. Risk: lyric accumulation over causal plot at this length succeeds because the systematic frame teaches the pattern early. Potential proximity concern: the poetic catalog of impossible structures and the melancholy solitary custodian echo familiar SFF/fantasy lyric templates, but the sound-versus-text distinction and the foxglove-regret metaphor offer enough transformation to avoid derivative penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices are present but largely maintenance: she checks stems, shelves vials, lets the song finish, returns to work. The decision to never repair the cracked tube shapes her philosophy but is established rather than made on-page. Her return to systematic checking after the lullaby is a renunciation choice with cost (acceptance of insufficiency), meeting the threshold for one key turn. Early signal (paragraph one) +0.5, closure linkage (the return to work after constellation) +0.7, but mid-story she observes rather than decides, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube appears in three beats: hanging at the railing with Maren's reflection on why she keeps it cracked (beat 1), producing the lullaby melody (beat 2), falling silent after the orchids dim (beat 3). Its crack is causally specific—produces "a sound like a caught breath"—and the fissure is the origin point of the melody. It charges the closure by falling silent, bookending the sequence. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal properties (crack enables melody) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9. The "one tube was cracked" setup is efficient and reweighted by "The cracked tube fell silent."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Deserted marvels frame the premise and Maren's solitary role, but they function as backdrop rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The list (Cathedral of Tides, Inverted Garden, Museum of Extinct Feelings) is ornamental world-building; the Museum visit is recounted in backstory to explain her motivation rather than altering present choices. The concept underwrites theme but does not constrain or enable a beat. Present by paragraph two +0.4, thematic resonance +0.5, but no middle pressure or closure participation beyond mood. Swappable with "abandoned wonders" or similar (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gently systematic is embodied on-page: "moving row by row," "tapping each stem with a silver tuning fork," "returned to the next row, gently systematic as always." It contrasts with the emotional crescendo of the orchid lighting, creating a visible trade-off between method and total salvation. The trait constrains her tactics (she does not rush or skip rows) and is reaffirmed at closure when she resumes checking despite knowing she won't save them all. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (opening routine, return at end) +0.6, cost connection (systematic pace = incomplete rescue) +0.4, closure linkage +0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Light is the key transformation on-page: orchids "began to light from within," "Row after row illuminated," each casting its hue, then "dimmed slowly, reluctantly." This sequence is the story's emotional and visual peak, turning Maren's abstract cataloging into a constellation of loss that forces her acknowledgment of limits. The action is causally triggered (lullaby calls forth the stored names) and irreplaceable—no other verb captures the orchids' response. Early seed (orchids dim when names go flat) +0.5, two-beat involvement (initial glow, full constellation) +0.9, causal pressure (lighting proves scale of loss) +1.0, closure linkage (dimming precedes her return to work) +1.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>By the echo of a long-forgotten song: the lullaby's echo is the method that lights the orchids and delivers Maren's name in her mother's voice. It is signaled obliquely in the opening (glass orchids that "rang like bells") and appears explicitly at the halfway mark when the cracked tube produces the melody. The method is not mechanical instruction but poetic trigger, fitting the accumulative lens. Setup arrives late (midpoint, not first third) −0.3, but the echo's particularity (her own name, her mother's pronunciation) is irreplaceable +0.6, and it drives the key beat (constellation lighting) +0.9, with closure linkage (echo still searching at end) +0.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Opal Library above the clouds anchors the opening and frames Maren's isolation. The terrace with its railing and rows of orchids is the sole action space; the vertical setting (above clouds) contributes to mood but does not constrain tactics. The library's archive of vials is destination rather than obstacle. The setting is vivid and consistent but more postcard than pressure. Early signal +0.7, spatial coherence (terrace, railing, rows) +0.5, tone contribution (isolation, elevation) +0.4, but no middle choice altered by setting features and no closure constraint. The cloud sea is observed, not navigated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Across the museum of extinct feelings is a single past visit recounted in paragraph two to explain Maren's motivation (she sought the feeling of hearing a name for the last time). It does not structure the present scene's timeframe or create urgency. The phrase "across" suggests traversal, but the visit is summary. Present as backstory +0.3, motivation primer +0.5, but no setup in first third (arrives paragraph two as flashback), no development beat, no closure participation. Swappable with "during her visit to" or similar (−0.5). The present scene unfolds in one continuous morning with no time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To preserve the sound of forgotten names is Maren's singular, stated motivation (paragraph three) and drives all on-page action: checking resonance, shelving dimmed names, letting the lullaby play, returning to work despite limits. The motivation is tested when the lullaby contains her own name, creating friction between personal loss and professional duty, though she chooses witness over rescue implicitly. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (opening routine, lullaby recognition, return to work) +1.1, causal pressure (lights all orchids, proving scale) +0.9, closure linkage (she continues despite knowing she will fail) +1.0. Slightly tell-heavy in the exposition but dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Foxglove regret—gorgeous and poisonous—is named explicitly and embodied throughout: the beauty of the lighting orchids paired with "the particular sorrow," the cracked tube as intentional imperfection, the final return to work "with the particular sorrow of someone who understands." Tone is consistent, modulates from calm systematic work to the crescendo of light to quiet acceptance. The phrase "foxglove regret: gorgeous and poisonous, something you could hold but never safely swallow" makes the metaphor overt but earns it through the prior image. Early signal +0.7, coherence across turns +0.8, charges final image (dimming eyes, echo searching) +1.0, specificity (foxglove is exact, not generic melancholy) +0.6.</comment>
