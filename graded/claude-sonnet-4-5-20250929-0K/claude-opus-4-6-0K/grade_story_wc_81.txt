<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and layered—professional duty, personal quest, and embodied doubt about her grandmother's claim. Her micro-choices during the blackout (dimming the headlamp, tracing stamps by hand) reveal a shift from industrial efficiency to tactile attention. The final decision to withhold data from the Bureau and continue "slower now, more deliberate" demonstrates a credible internal turn with visible cost: she risks her contract and methodical workflow. Interior texture is specific ("tranquilly perceptive in ways her mother never appreciated"), though the grandmother's trembling hands veer slightly toward stock emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the blackout strips away machinery, forcing a shift from scanning speed to hand-tracing, which deepens the dominant stake (tracing honest origins). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren places the stamp back, smooths the page, and "began again—slower now, more deliberate, carrying the reclaimed stillness forward into the light like something precious and earned." The cost is legible—she has abandoned the Bureau's operating assumption and her own industrial pace—and the final image reweights her method with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening (blackout → hand-tracing → forty-seven stamps → withheld upload) coheres under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is purposeful: bioluminescent cables, pressure regulators, barnacled ceilings, and waterlogged shelves ground the reader in a tactile, high-pressure environment. The blackout forces Maren to rely on the lowest headlamp setting, which reveals faint impressions the bright scanning lamps washed out—setting constrains choice. The antique stamp (brass cylinder, rosewood handle) functions as micro-setting, recurring across beats and charging the final image when held against the "closest match yet." Sensory hierarchy (dim amber cone, groaning bones, humming regulators) reflects Maren's professional calm and selective attention. Spatial choreography (shelves, endpapers, pocket, indexing sheets) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through the blackout: Maren moves from industrial scanning to hand-documentation, a meaningful deepening that narrows her options and reweights her method. The alternative hypothesis (printing quarter integrated into the library, not in the collapsed eastern district) creates internal friction against the Bureau's assumption. The final withholding of data forecloses a path with visible cost: she risks her contract and defers systematic progress. Agency is embodied in the choice to "carry the reclaimed stillness forward into the light," an Earned Stasis charged by renunciation of speed. One reversal (enforced stillness → purposeful attention) is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the blackout's "enforced stillness" becomes "reclaimed, purposeful," and the final image—smoothing the page, moving "slower now, more deliberate"—offers a non-literal answer to the question of how honest knowledge is traced. "Reclaimed stillness" shifts from absence to agency without a stated moral. The recurring stamp impressions accumulate pressure and the ending reweights prior material: "It was not proof. Not yet. But it was an origin, traced honestly, in the dark." Subtext operates in gesture (placing the stamp back in her pocket) and image (dim headlamp, faint impressions). No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and aptly close; perceptual signature is selective and professional ("logical page indexer," "tranquilly perceptive"). Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon with controlled rhythm: "She had worked too long in the deep places to fear the dark" and "carrying the reclaimed stillness forward into the light like something precious and earned." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the hand-tracing beats, slightly withdrawn for exposition. One filter-verb cluster in the opening ("the bioluminescent cables… hummed") is voice-motivated. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what Maren can know. Final line's rhythm charges the closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening hooks with vivid specificity ("vaulted ceilings crusted with barnacles"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. "Tranquilly perceptive in ways her mother never appreciated" is a slight therapy-speak slip, costing −0.2. One paraphrase loop: "It was not proof. Not yet. But it was an origin" restates the closure idea within two sentences, costing −0.2. Figurative language is controlled ("carrying the reclaimed stillness forward into the light like something precious and earned"), though "like something precious and earned" edges toward abstraction. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no scaffolding or template cadence. Proofreading is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—tracing family origins in a sunken city during a blackout—synthesizes familiar recovery-quest and underwater-archive tropes through specific, grounded choices: the antique stamp, the alternative hypothesis, hand-tracing by dim light. The emotional turn (enforced stillness → reclaimed purposefulness) feels earned rather than convenient. "Reclaimed stillness" is a fresh inflection on productivity-versus-attention tensions. The closure image (placing the stamp back, smoothing the page, beginning again slower) transforms the setup without resorting to a twist. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. Slight deduction for "tranquilly perceptive," which reads as a prompt-label insertion rather than organic characterization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's role as logical page indexer frames her systematic approach and her shift during the blackout. Her choices—dimming the headlamp, hand-tracing forty-seven stamps, withholding data—create the key turn from industrial speed to tactile attention. The trait is embodied in micro-decisions (listening to the silence, testing the stamp against impressions) and her renunciation of the Bureau's operating assumption. Setup early (paragraph two), development across the blackout beats, payoff in the final withholding and the resumed work "slower now, more deliberate." Causal pressure is strong; cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in four beats: Maren reaches for it in the dark (paragraph five), holds it beside the impression (paragraph seven), uses it to test forty-seven stamps (paragraph ten), and places it back in her pocket at closure (paragraph eleven). It enables the alternative hypothesis (tracing her family's mark) and its "slight wear of a century's use" charges the final image. Setup early, development across middle beats, strong payoff. The stamp's unique properties (brass, rosewood, unrecognized publisher) matter; swapping it for a generic artifact would break the logic. Cost connection: withholding proof and resuming work slower.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is signaled midway ("the stillness she had resisted now felt reclaimed, purposeful") and shapes the final choice: Maren "carr[ies] the reclaimed stillness forward into the light like something precious and earned." It constrains her tactics—she moves through the shelves with "new purpose, headlamp dim, fingers reading"—and reweights her method from industrial speed to hand-tracing. Development is clear in the blackout beats; payoff is direct in the final line. Missing early setup (the concept is named only after the blackout begins) costs −0.3. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept charges the closure image but does not drive the inciting incident.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is labeled in paragraph four ("Maren, tranquilly perceptive in ways her mother never appreciated") but not dramatized until the blackout beats, where Maren notices "faint impressions… that the bright scanning lamps had washed out." The trait enables her hand-tracing and hypothesis formation, shaping one key turn. Late first appearance (second quarter) costs −0.3. Label-only mention without early embodied action costs −0.5. Development is functional; payoff is implied in her patience and attention. Swappable with "observant" or "methodical" with minor edits, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren readjusts her headlamp to "its lowest battery setting, a pale amber cone," which reveals the faint impressions the scanning lamps washed out. This action is the inciting turn: it redefines her options from waiting passively to hand-tracing stamps. Setup in paragraph seven, payoff in the subsequent beats (forty-seven stamps documented) and the final image (resumed work with dimmed, purposeful attention). Causal pressure is strong; the action is necessary and specific. Missing early signal (the headlamp first appears in paragraph seven, after the blackout) costs −0.4. Irreplaceability is high; removing the readjustment breaks the discovery logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is signaled in paragraph eight: "Maren allowed herself an alternative hypothesis: what if the printing quarter had been here, integrated into the library itself?" It shapes her tactics—she begins "to move through the shelves with new purpose"—and drives the middle beats (documenting forty-seven stamps). The method is specific and mechanics matter: testing the stamp against endpaper impressions, sketching by hand. Setup midway (paragraph eight), development across beats nine and ten, payoff in the withholding of data and the final resumed work. Causal pressure is strong; cost is visible (she defers the Bureau's system). Slight deduction for late first appearance (second quarter).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city supplies concrete resources (endpapers with stamp impressions, dim light that reveals faint marks) and imposes constraints (pressure regulators, the blackout that disables the electromagnetic array). The setting drives the inciting incident (blackout), shapes Maren's discovery (faint impressions visible only in reduced light), and charges the final image ("began again… carrying the reclaimed stillness forward into the light"). Setup in paragraph one, development across all beats, strong payoff. Spatial choreography (shelves, pressure-sealed chambers, indexing sheets) is coherent. Irreplaceability is high; the sunken library's decay and dim conditions are necessary for the plot. Cost connection: the setting's constraints force the shift from industrial scanning to hand-tracing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blackout frames the story: it arrives without warning, disables the indexing array, forces three hours of enforced stillness, and ends when "the bioluminescent cables flickered back to life." The timeframe tightens Maren's tactics—she can do "nothing but wait," then uses the downtime to hand-trace stamps. Setup early (paragraph one), development across the middle beats, payoff when the power returns and Maren withholds her findings. The clock is tracked ("three hours later") but does not create high urgency; Maren works methodically without time pressure. Causal role is moderate; the blackout enables the discovery but does not force a high-stakes deadline. Missing tight deadline costs −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is signaled in paragraph five: "To trace honest origins—that was the real reason Maren had taken this assignment." The motivation is dramatized in her choices: holding the stamp beside impressions, hand-documenting forty-seven stamps, withholding data from the Bureau. Friction between want (proof of her grandmother's claim) and cost (risking her contract, abandoning systematic progress) is visible. Setup early, development across beats, strong payoff in the final withholding and resumed work "slower now, more deliberate." The motivation shapes the alternative hypothesis and the closure choice. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" reads as quiet determination modulated by attention to texture. Tone is coherent: calm professionalism ("Maren did not panic"), reflective patience (the grandmother's trembling hands), and purposeful stillness (the blackout as reclaimed attention). Under pressure, the tone deepens rather than shifts—Maren's resolve becomes "more deliberate," and the final line charges the image with earned weight ("carrying the reclaimed stillness forward into the light like something precious and earned"). No tonal ruptures; the piece sustains a consistent register. Slight abstraction in "dappled" (the word does not appear on the page and must be inferred from the interplay of light and shadow, calm and urgency) costs −0.3.</comment>
