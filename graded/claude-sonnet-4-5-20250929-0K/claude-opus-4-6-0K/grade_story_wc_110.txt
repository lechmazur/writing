<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("she had learned to accept the difference"), and her final apology emerges from dramatized guilt rather than abstraction. Jonah's arc from eavesdropper to open witness is cleanly motivated by the doodle sequence. Minor slip: the "neither had said what they actually meant" meta-narration at the inciting incident briefly tips into authorial summary rather than letting contradiction breathe in scene. The ending choice feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (handing over the lens, ending silence).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 2 (Maren, forecourt, after rain). Causal lens holds: eavesdropping → doodles → final confrontation because Maren speaks and Jonah interprets the last ticket correctly. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): they stand together "after the long season when words had seemed impossible," and honesty "offered plainly" opens the door—cost is legible in the forfeited silence and mistrust shed. One meaningful tightening (Jonah steps out) narrows options and forces the apology. The seven-month backstory block (~18% of text) anchors in the present lens she holds and primes the apology, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forecourt's faceted pillars, wet stone, and chime-on-wind are signaled early and recur with tactical purpose (Maren uses a pillar to project light; Jonah hides behind a column). The lens as tool charges the final image: "his mother's light still passing through a thing that had failed and survived." Spatial choreography is clear (center, column, beside). The rain-glazed surfaces and resonant chord marry atmosphere to the transparency theme without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: thawing mistrust through honesty, signaled when Maren holds the lens and knows Jonah is present. One meaningful tightening: Jonah steps out, forcing Maren's apology and Jonah's reply. The doodles create prior escalation (each silence a test). Cost is visible—Maren admits fear, Jonah admits misreading silence—and the lens hand-off forecloses the guarded stance. No reversal count required under Causal lens; the tightening is sufficient and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (honesty as bidirectional door, transparency thawing mistrust) emerges through particulars: the cracked lens, cryptic doodles, eavesdropping silence, and the final shared apology. The final image—two people in "resonant hush" after "the long season when words had seemed impossible"—offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral. The doodles' "ambiguously clear" method and the mother's light "passing through a thing that had failed and survived" layer meaning without overt thesis. One slip: "discovering that honesty, offered plainly, was the only door that opened from both sides" is a touch thematic-summary, though it follows earned action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV with stable distance; Maren's interiority ("she had learned to accept the difference") and Jonah's ("he studied the doodles the way he once studied her face") are cleanly focalized within their respective beats. Perceptual signature: Maren's registrar precision, Jonah's archival grief. Voice remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext (Maren's "I thought honesty without invitation was just another intrusion"). Minor filter-verb density in the backstory block ("had blamed," "had said") is voice-motivated but clusters slightly; no penalty under Causal lens tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; information density is high (every line advances character, image, or pressure). The backstory block compresses seven months efficiently without looping. Minor overwriting in peak beat: "grief needed a target and love needed a witness and both of them were failing at both" is parallel-poetic but borders on abstraction during the inciting incident; the phrase "discovering that honesty, offered plainly, was the only door" in the final paragraph slightly tells theme. No loops, no template cadence, clean grammar. High density with one small register drift keeps this in the 8.0–8.5 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of registrar + broken projector + cryptic doodles + eavesdropping is specific and non-obvious. The "ambiguously clear" doodle method and the mother's light "passing through a thing that had failed and survived" feel earned in hindsight. The forecourt's crystal-chime setting and the lens as charged object avoid template choices. Slight Template proximity: the "honesty as door" closure image, while well-executed, echoes common reconciliation-arc phrasing. The synthesis is strong but not wholly unprecedented.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren (quiet night registrar) is present from line 1, her apology creates the key turn (she admits the stress fracture), and her hand-off of the lens shapes the closure image. Early signal, two distinct beats (holding lens, speaking apology), causal pressure (her choice to speak breaks the silence), closure linkage. Her occupation frames her precision but does not constrain the core choice; the registrar detail is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens appears in line 1 (Maren holds it), paragraph 4 (memorial concert crack), paragraph 7 (she turns it to project light), paragraph 9 (Jonah sees "his mother's light still passing through"), and final beat (she places it in his palm). Early signal, three distinct beats, causal pressure (its breaking caused the rift; its survival and use charge reconciliation), closure linkage (hand-off and "warm from her hand"), high irreplaceability (the exact lens carries the mother's image and the failure/survival theme), cost connection (handing it over is the final vulnerability).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Core concept (freed by honesty) shapes stakes: Maren's silence was fear of intrusion, Jonah's eavesdropping sought apology, and the doodles were honest invitations. Jonah's line "This one freed me" explicitly names the concept, and the final apology/reply sequence demonstrates it. The concept drives the dominant arc and alters tactics (Maren speaks, Jonah listens). Minor on-the-nose moment: "freed me" states the theme, slightly reducing subtext. Two beats (doodle revelation, apology exchange), causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attribute (ambiguously clear) is named once in the doodle description ("Each image ambiguously clear, meaning something precise that could also mean something else") and demonstrated in the ticket imagery (two figures "either drowning or drinking"). It enables Maren's strategy and constrains Jonah's interpretation until the final ticket "freed" him. Present by paragraph 5 (late first third), one middle beat (doodle method), closure participation (the clarity/ambiguity tension resolves when they speak plainly). Functional but the attribute itself is more method-descriptor than independent constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Action (eavesdrop) is present by paragraph 3 ("He had come to eavesdrop, as he had done three times before"), drives Jonah's arc (he came "to listen" for apology), and his stepping out creates the turn that forces Maren's speech. Early signal, two beats (eavesdropping, stepping out), causal pressure (his presence known triggers her apology), closure linkage (he finally hears what he sought). The action is swappable with minor edits (he could have knocked or waited openly), capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Method (cryptic doodles on concert tickets) is introduced paragraph 5, detailed in paragraphs 6 and 8 (he kept every one, studied them, the latest "freed" him), and directly shapes the reconciliation: Maren chose ambiguity to avoid accusation, Jonah interpreted them as invitations. Early-ish signal (~30%), two distinct beats (method description, Jonah's interpretation), causal pressure (the method's indirection enabled communication when words failed), closure linkage (the final ticket prompts his arrival). High irreplaceability (the drawings' ambiguous clarity ties to the attribute and theme).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting (crystal whispering forecourt after rain) opens line 1, recurs in paragraphs 3, 7, 9, 10 (chimes, faceted pillars, wet stone, "the forecourt whispered its single, sustained chord"). The pillars enable Maren's lens projection, the acoustics carry whispers (shaping Jonah's eavesdropping), and the "resonant hush" charges the final image. Early signal, three beats (arrival, lens projection, closing chord), causal contribution (the space's properties enable the confrontation), closure linkage. Specificity high (crystal, chime, rain-glazed). One friction: the setting is more atmospheric than constraining (they could reconcile elsewhere with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe (after words become unnecessary) is stated paragraph 4 ("They had not spoken directly in seven months, not since the night the projector broke") and paragraph 5 ("After that evening, words between them became unnecessary"). The seven-month silence creates pressure, and the ending resolves it ("after the long season when words had seemed impossible"). Present early, one beat (backstory compression), closure linkage. Friction: the timeframe is more thematic marker than live constraint; no ticking clock shapes tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation (to thaw mistrust with transparency) is Maren's throughout: she holds the lens publicly (paragraph 2), chose doodles to avoid intrusion (paragraph 5), and speaks her apology (paragraph 9). Jonah's parallel drive is to hear her honesty. The motivation is dramatized in three beats (lens-holding, doodles, apology), faces friction (Maren's fear of intrusion, Jonah's misreading), and lands at closure with visible cost (ending silence, handing over the lens). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone (resonant hush) is set line 1 ("held its breath," "half-sound, half-silence") and modulates: quiet arrival, compressed grief in backstory, rising tension when Jonah steps out, softening apology/reply, and the final "resonant hush" that names and embodies the tone. The tone is coherent through turns, charges the final image ("the forecourt whispered its single, sustained chord"), and the prose rhythm (long, layered sentences; sparse dialogue) maintains it under pressure. Early signal, consistent through all beats, closure linkage, high irreplaceability (the tone is the story's signature).</comment>
