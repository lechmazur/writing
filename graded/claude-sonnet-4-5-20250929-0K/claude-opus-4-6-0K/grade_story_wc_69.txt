<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation is clear and embodied through her teaching method, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—she observes and guides without facing a visible dilemma or cost on the page. The choir members are sketched with economy (the brothers' nine-year silence, the stuttering teenager), yet they function more as backdrop than agents; no single singer's micro-choice under pressure shapes the arc. The piece leans heavily on reflection about the vanishing art and the physics of tension, which is purposeful but keeps character stakes at arm's length. The final action (opening the next score) reads as endurance rather than a decisive shift with foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the rosette metaphor, the choir's slow unlearning, and the final image of the falling leaf; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the resumption of work reweights the ephemeral stakes. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. Cost is conceptual—acceptance of erasure—but the final beat ("opened her folder, and turned to the next score") feels more like continuation than a reweighted decision with visible sacrifice. The narrative deepens but does not narrow options or change knowledge on the page, which limits the felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The velvet library, autumn light turning curtains to embers, and the soundhole rosette are vivid and purposeful. The rosette constrains Marguerite's framing argument and charges the final image of patience; the library's accidental acoustics and book-absorbed reflections anchor the choir's method. Minor constraint on choice: the library's endowment requirement motivates the group's presence but does not alter tactics within the scene. Sensory detail (amber light, distant stamping) supports atmosphere without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving an ephemeral art through collective listening—is signaled early and held. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marguerite reveals the rosette and declares the form's vanishing, tightening the thematic pressure. However, no on-page reversal or choice by a protagonist forecloses a live option; the choir sings, the hymn ends, and Marguerite opens the next score. The piece is coherent and purposeful under an Accumulative lens, but the lack of a visible trade-off or narrowed path keeps escalation in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rosette, the acoustics, and the choir's slow unlearning: beauty requires patience, vanishing is not failure, listening is architecture. Subtext operates in the brothers' glance, the physics of vocal tension, and the falling leaf's unhurried spiral. The final image (the leaf "falling was not the same as being lost") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One deduction: the phrase "expectantly resigned" and "subtract a little more noise from the world" risk restating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, with a distinct perceptual signature: "autumn like a breath held too long," "silence became something you could almost tune," "traveled stillness." Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the contemplative register. Free indirect style is clean ("Marguerite's life motivation…" reads as narrator summary, acceptable in this mode). Minor penalty: the phrase "the thing that had pulled her from conservatory podiums" is slightly generic filter language. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful ("This is what a vanishing art looks like…"); subtext operates through gesture (the brothers' eye contact).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high (each line advances character, world, or theme). Minor loop: "long enough to become uncomfortable, then long enough to become ordinary, then long enough to become something else entirely" recycles "long enough" without varied syntax. The phrase "expectantly resigned" appears twice in identical phrasing, once as trait description and once as final state, creating a conceptual loop. Figurative language ("embers," "delta," "mortar") is coherent and controlled. No clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of vanishing choral tradition, the rosette as artifact, and the physics of vocal tension feels specific and non-obvious. The choir's composition (immigration judge, stuttering teenager, estranged brothers) particularizes the roster beyond stock ensemble. Risk: the piece commits to a quiet, lyric mode without dramatic reversal, which is bold at this length. One deduction: the framing (autumn, library trustees, endowment requirement) and the central metaphor (singing = vanishing craft) echo familiar "endangered beauty" templates; transformation comes through the specific method and objects rather than the premise itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite frames the rehearsal, introduces the rosette, and conducts the hymn; she opens the next score at closure. She appears in setup, middle (rosette argument), and ending (resumption). Her choice to continue teaching "by subtracting noise" shapes the choir's arc across months. However, no single on-page decision by her narrows options or incurs visible cost within this scene; she observes and guides without a dilemma. Two beats (rosette explanation, conducting), closure presence, but passive agency limits causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rosette appears in three beats: placed on the lectern, held up to explain vanishing art, traced with thumb after the hymn. It primes Marguerite's argument, reappears at closure ("placed the rosette back on the lectern"), and its carved patience mirrors the choir's work. Specificity (linden wood, Vosges, interlocking petals) makes it irreplaceable. Minor cap: it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics on the page; its function is primarily thematic and atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vanishing arts shapes the entire premise: Marguerite's motivation, the rosette's function, the choir's acceptance of ephemerality. The concept is signaled in the first paragraph ("autumn like a breath held too long"), argued explicitly mid-scene ("one fewer hand… until the knowing lives nowhere"), and reinforced at closure (the leaf falling). It defines the stakes (preserving ephemeral beauty) and the narrative's acceptance of erasure. Cost is conceptual—acknowledgment that the work will not be preserved—visible in the choir's return to the next score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is introduced mid-first-page ("that single expectantly resigned quality"), constrained audition choices (Marguerite selected for willingness), and returns verbatim in the final paragraph ("expectantly resigned to the difficulty"). It shapes the choir's stance and their acceptance of slow work. The trait enables the collective endurance that defines the arc. Minor deduction: the phrase is label-only in its first appearance and repeated identically at closure, which feels more like thematic echo than a visible trade-off or constrained action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Denote" appears in the first paragraph ("notation so spare it seemed to denote absence more than sound") as a descriptor of Marguerite's scores. It primes the subtractive method and the theme of vanishing, but it does not recur or drive a turn. The word is specific and apt, yet it could be replaced with "signify" or "mark" without altering the arc. Lyric resonance (sparse notation → sparse knowing) is present but passive; no beat depends on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method ("by subtracting noise") is signaled early ("she taught by subtracting noise… removed tension from the jaw, grudge from the breath"), demonstrated in the long silence that opens rehearsal, and enacted when the choir sings the Georgian hymn ("you cannot hold contempt in your body and produce a clear tone"). It shapes the middle beat (the hymn as proof) and the closure resumption ("ready to subtract a little more noise from the world"). The mechanics are specific (jaw, breath, diaphragm) and irreplaceable. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The velvet library frames the entire scene: accidental acoustics, book-absorbed reflections, autumn light, and the endowment requirement that motivates the choir's presence. The setting appears in setup (first paragraph), middle (windows, wing chairs, distant librarian), and closure (maple leaf past the window). It constrains the group's existence (trustees will seal it) and provides the acoustic conditions for the method. Minor gap: the library does not alter a tactic within this rehearsal; its pressure is historical (the threat of closure) rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Across these months of unlearning hatred" anchors the timeframe and the choir's arc. It signals duration (Tuesdays at four, "each Tuesday," "these months") and the process of releasing contempt. The phrase appears mid-scene and is referenced at closure ("ready to subtract a little more noise"). However, time does not tighten decisions on the page; no clock pressures this single rehearsal. The element is present and thematically integrated but does not alter tactics or narrow options within the dramatized window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation ("to braid diverse voices into harmony") is stated explicitly mid-scene ("Marguerite's life motivation… was to braid diverse voices into harmony") and enacted in the Georgian polyphonic hymn ("three independent melodic lines that braided around one another like rivers"). It shapes her audition choices (willingness over training) and the choir's composition. The desire is dramatized through the hymn and the brothers' first eye contact in nine years. Minor penalty: the phrase "life motivation" reads as exposition rather than embodied friction; no on-page moment shows Marguerite sacrificing a competing want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears mid-first-page ("a traveled stillness that felt as though the room itself had been on a journey and returned wiser") and is evoked at closure ("The silence after the last chord was proof that someone still did"). The tone is contemplative, unhurried, and consistent through the long opening silence, the hymn, and the final resumption. It modulates subtly: the initial discomfort yields to acceptance, then to charged patience. The tone charges the final image (the falling leaf "understood that falling was not the same as being lost") with quiet inevitability.</comment>
