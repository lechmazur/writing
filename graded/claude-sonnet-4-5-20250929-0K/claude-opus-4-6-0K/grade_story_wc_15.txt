<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her physical relationship to the work (scars, calloused hands) grounds interiority in embodied detail. The "orchid solace" moment and final whisper show internal experience, but the protagonist lacks meaningful contradiction—her dedication never wavers or costs her a visible internal struggle on the page. The final choice to leave after hanging the tapestry reads more as task completion than a foreclosure with felt ambivalence. Minor deduction for the straightforward emotional arc without complicating friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tapestry hung, the whispered acknowledgment, and the water rising behind her crystallize the project's completion with visible cost (she must leave as the tide returns). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The three-year backstory compresses causality but primes the final act; the rising water tightens the window and forces exit. One meaningful deepening (innermost chamber reached, tapestry completed) with cost legible in the timed retreat. Slight deduction: the turn feels inevitable rather than pressed by a live complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The red canyon walls, tide-carved chambers, and mineral scent anchor the labyrinth vividly. The illustration plate pressed into the wall and the iron hooks left by ancients provide tactile, constraining detail. The rising tide functions as both clock and spatial pressure, forcing Maren's exit and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Enters high-7 band because the setting directly shapes the final choice (leave or drown) and the ending image (water singing against stone).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete and preserve the map so others can enter the labyrinth safely. The tide's return provides a clear tightening—finish and hang the tapestry above the waterline before the water arrives. Maren's agency is visible (she sews, hangs, exits), and the cost is the need to leave immediately. Slight deduction: no live complication tests her commitment; the escalation is environmental (water rising) rather than a choice that forecloses another path. The resolution earns its Charged Poise under the accumulative lens but lacks a second-order friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transforming ruin into reverence emerges through concrete action: tracing grooves, sewing the map, hanging it above the waterline. The orchid/grief-into-hope imagery recurs purposefully without over-signaling. The final image—water singing "like a lullaby that had finally remembered its words"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question. "Hauntingly optimistic" stitches charge the act with subtext. Minor deduction: "broken precedents" as curse feels slightly expository; the concept could be more deeply inhabited in a choice rather than summarized early.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with lyric register ("red walls glistened like wounds freshly opened," "singing against the stone like a lullaby"). Psychic distance is stable; focalization remains with Maren throughout. The diction leans elevated ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") but stays consistent and voice-motivated. Slight deduction: "the phrase had become a kind of curse" and "that was the only motivation that had ever made sense to her" slip toward summary-telling where dramatization would sharpen. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line) and functional. Overall voice is strong but occasionally over-explains rather than trusts image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and purposeful ("mineral scent of retreating water," "grooves worn into sandstone by hundreds of dreaming feet"). Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum. Minor scaffold detected: "Her truest work lived here" followed by clause restatement, and "She had spent three years tracing…until the labyrinth revealed its grammar" summarizes rather than showing discovery. "Orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic" appear as inserted labels rather than emerging from scene pressure. The phrase "beauty persisting in absolute darkness" over-explains the orchid image. Density is generally high, but a few beats lean expository. No loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sleepwalking erosion patterns as unconscious cartography offers a fresh angle on labyrinth-mapping. The wharf weaver threading physical and metaphorical paths shows thematic coherence. The illustration plate fitting "as though the stone had been waiting for it" verges on convenient symbolism but stops short of forcing the effect. Slight deduction: the council-condemnation backstory and "broken precedents" phrase feel familiar (forbidden knowledge, lone visionary) without full transformation. The emotional arc—dedicated artisan completes sacred work—follows a recognizable template. Strong particulars (tide timing, silk tapestry, iron hooks) lift it within the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choice to enter the labyrinth, sew the map, hang it above the waterline, and exit as the tide returns drives every major beat. Her occupation as wharf weaver integrates causally (she weaves the silk map). The character appears in setup, middle sewing action, and closure whisper/exit. Essential across all three gates with visible cost (she must leave as water rises).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The illustration plate appears in the satchel (cutting her hip, shaping a scar), is pressed into the wall depression in the innermost chamber, and she touches it a final time before leaving. It provides a thematic anchor (girl reaching into darkness) and fits the wall "as though the stone had been waiting for it." Present in setup and payoff; middle use is brief but functional. Lacks causal pressure—it does not constrain or enable a tactical choice—but the lyric reprise and physical specificity (crescent scar) lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is named early as the town's curse for entering the sealed labyrinth, framing the risk Maren accepts. It does not return or evolve; the concept remains thematic backdrop rather than shaping an on-page choice or complication. Present in setup, absent in middle and closure. Functional but replaceable—any prohibition label would serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears once as a descriptor of Maren's stitches, tied to her faith that someone will follow the map. It does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost; it labels an attitude rather than dramatizing a tradeoff. The attribute is consistent with her perseverance but remains ornamental. Present in the middle third, absent from setup and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sewing the silk map is the story's central action: Maren drives her needle through panels, stitching the labyrinth's true path so others can walk it safely. The act occupies the climactic beat, integrates her wharf-weaver identity, and directly produces the artifact she hangs above the waterline. She finishes "the last stitch as the first trickle of salt water crept across the chamber floor," wedding action to the ticking clock. Setup (she carries needle and thread), development (she sews), and payoff (tapestry hung, exit required). Removing sewing would collapse the plot. High 8s for indispensability and causal density.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overlapping sleepwalking paths provide the method by which Maren discovers the labyrinth's grammar: she traces grooves worn by dreaming feet over three years. This shapes her map's accuracy and legitimizes her claim that "the sleepwalkers had always known the way." Present in setup (backstory of discovery) and payoff (whispering into stone with their dreaming feet). The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter—without it, her map would lack authority. Slight deduction: the three-year process is summarized rather than shown constraining a present choice. Still, it drives two beats and is causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth carved into red canyon walls is the story's sole location and pressure vessel. Its tidal flooding provides the clock (she must finish and leave before drowning). The innermost chamber holds ancient carvings and the depression that receives the illustration plate. The iron hooks left by ancients enable her to hang the tapestry above the waterline. The grooves worn by sleepwalkers supply her map's data. Setup, development (she moves through chambers), and payoff (rising water forces exit) are all present. The setting constrains every major choice and charges the final image. Essential across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the tide pools emptied" opens the story and sets the tactical window: Maren enters when the labyrinth is dry and safe. The tide's return during the final beat creates urgency—she finishes the last stitch "as the first trickle of salt water crept across the chamber floor" and must gather her tools and follow her map back. The tidal clock tightens the ending and makes her exit costly (she cannot linger). Present in setup, shapes the middle window implicitly, and drives the closure beat. The timeframe is dramatized and consequential, not vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated directly in Maren's interiority as "the only motivation that had ever made sense to her." The desire is dramatized through her three-year tracing project, her entry into the condemned labyrinth, and her act of sewing and preserving the map so others can follow. The motivation drives setup (why she enters), development (sewing the tapestry), and payoff (hanging it for future pilgrims). Slight deduction: the phrase is告诉-told rather than fully inhabited in a moment of friction between competing wants. Still, the cost (risking "broken bones" and leaving as the tide rises) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is named once in the innermost chamber: "a tenderness so fragile it ached, beauty persisting in absolute darkness." The tone colors the piece—reverent, patient, melancholic hope—and modulates subtly (red walls "like wounds freshly opened" early, water "singing…like a lullaby" at the end). The orchid imagery recurs (carved petals "curling inward like grief folding into hope") and ties to the hauntingly optimistic stitches. Present in setup (implicit in her dedication), development (named and visualized), and payoff (lullaby image). The tone is coherent and charges the final image, but the label "orchid solace" itself appears only once. Solid mid-to-high 6s for thematic resonance without mechanical repetition.</comment>
