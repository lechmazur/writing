<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nadia's motivation to uncover truth is consistent and her psychometric descent is embodied through visceral sensory detail ("smell of magnolia and sweat, the static hum of a transistor radio"). However, the eleven-year backstory and the negotiation with Thomas feel more summarized than inhabited—his "arranging beach debris" communication method appears without prior setup, and we don't see Nadia struggle with contradictory impulses during the parley itself. The final vision where Ruth "smiles" across decades edges toward convenient emotional resolution rather than earned cost, though the choice to file and display the materials does foreclose secrecy with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the diary's recursive visions and culminates in the physical descent and negotiation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Nadia archives the microfilm and displays the diary, fulfilling her mission with visible cost (the visions dissolve, the intimacy ends). Orientation is swift (zeppelin, archivist, Saharan coast by the second sentence). The accumulative pattern—decrypt, descend into vision, descend physically, parley, archive—lands cleanly, though the parley itself compresses hours into summary rather than dramatizing Thomas's resistance and Nadia's persuasion beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin library, obsidian lagoon, and Thomas's debris-message system anchor the world with striking specificity. The lagoon's "volcanic glass" appearance and the tin "half-buried in salt crust" ground the climactic discovery. However, the "arranging beach debris as messages" mechanic is introduced cold at the lagoon without prior setup in world rules or Nadia's knowledge, and the hours-long parley occurs in spatial stasis—we don't see Thomas move shells or Nadia respond to individual configurations. The final image of dunes erasing footprints charges closure effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover Ruth's hidden evidence and honor the erased voice. The diary's retrocognitive trap raises cost (each use "leaves her shaking"), and the descent by cable-basket is a concrete risk. Thomas's beach-debris parley introduces a meaningful gatekeeper obstacle that tests Nadia's institutional claim. However, the negotiation's outcome feels inevitable—Thomas studies her and slides the tin across—without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The cost at closure is more thematic (intimacy with Ruth ends) than tactical, which fits the Accumulative lens but mutes agency slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—recovery of erased voices and the ethics of institutional versus personal guardianship—emerges organically from the diary, Thomas's six-decade vigil, and Nadia's floating archive. The obsidian lagoon and the final image of erased footprints recur with reweighted meaning: what is hidden, what is preserved, what dissolves. The piece resists overt moralizing; Ruth's smile "across the corridor of decades" is a quiet, non-literal answer to whether recovery is possible. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the ending trusts image over assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Nadia's archival lexicon ("foxed ink," "psychometric anchor," "microfilm"). Diction is elevated and consistent—"searing," "luminous, furious, precise"—matching the solemn tone. Dr. Yusuf's dialogue ("retrocognitively trapped") and Thomas's wordless debris-communication feel purposeful rather than clunky. However, the phrase "solemn and burning" appears twice (opening and closing) in near-identical phrasing, and the parley summary shifts into distant third without dramatizing Thomas's speech patterns or Nadia's real-time adjustments. The final paragraph's "freight of recovered memory" edges toward abstract metaphor but stays anchored in the zeppelin's northward turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("time split," "total immersion," "the vision released her only when her hand slipped off the page"), and the opening image of the zeppelin as "a thought refusing to land" establishes voice. However, several lines loop: "solemn by necessity" (opening) echoes "solemn and burning" (close); "the diary is a psychometric anchor" is told by Dr. Yusuf after Nadia's experience already showed it. The parley's "hours, conducted partly in speech and partly in his preferred language of arranged debris" summarizes rather than dramatizes the exchange. No major grammar errors, but "purposeful" appears three times in quick succession across paragraphs describing Ruth's voice and Nadia's persuasion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise—floating library above a coast, retrocognitive diary, silent negotiation via beach debris—synthesizes archival thriller, psychometry, and historical recovery in a fresh configuration. The obsidian lagoon and Thomas's six-decade guardianship avoid the tired "dusty archive" or "surprise descendent" templates. However, the psychometric trap resolves conveniently (Ruth smiles, visions end) without lingering cost, and the parley's debris-language, while striking, arrives unearned and could have been any symbolic system. The zeppelin's mobility as a defense against raids is a smart institutional detail that avoids the usual "secret basement" trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nadia decrypts the diary (one beat), persuades the captain to anchor (brief mention), descends alone (one beat), and parleys with Thomas (one beat). Her choices drive all three gates (setup, middle, closure), and the final act of filing and displaying the materials is hers. However, the parley itself is summarized rather than shown as contested decision points, and the convenient resolution (Thomas slides the tin) mutes the cost of her persuasion.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in Ruth's encrypted coordinates (setup), is discovered exactly as described (middle), and houses the tin plus Thomas (closure). Its "volcanic glass" darkness and salt-crust concealment are specific and irreplaceable. However, it functions primarily as a container/location rather than an active constraint—Nadia finds it without navigation difficulty, and its properties don't alter her tactics during the parley. The final image of "coastline that glittered like crushed obsidian" recharges it effectively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The encrypted diary drives the entire causal chain: Nadia decrypts it (one beat), the cipher breaks open Ruth's voice (setup), the diary's psychometric trap forces repeated descents (middle pressure), and the coordinates lead to the lagoon (closure participation). The specific substitution-pattern decryption and the diary's transformation from cipher to vision-anchor to final relic are irreplaceable. Removing this element collapses all stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap is named by Dr. Yusuf, dramatized through Nadia's visceral immersion ("smell of magnolia and sweat," "weight of Ruth's terror"), and constrains her by forcing repeated descents that leave her "shaking and radiant with grief." The trap's resolution—Ruth's smile, visions ending—occurs on the page. However, the cost is more emotional intimacy lost than a tactical trade-off, and the convenient dissolution (no lingering haunting or incomplete pull) softens the constraint's teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The parley with Thomas is the climactic gate: he demands to know Nadia's intentions, she describes the floating library, he studies her and releases the tin. It occurs at closure and is causally necessary. However, the action itself is summarized ("Their negotiation lasted hours") rather than dramatized in contested beats, and Thomas's criteria for trust are told rather than tested through specific exchanges. The beach-debris mechanic, while striking, doesn't show us Nadia decoding and responding to individual messages.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Beach debris messages appear only at the lagoon (no earlier signal), and the mechanic is described but not shown in action—we see the result ("WHO SENT YOU") but not Nadia reading subsequent configurations or Thomas rearranging them during the parley. The method is specific and memorable but could be replaced (spoken questions, written notes) without major structural change. It charges the scene's strangeness but doesn't constrain Nadia's tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is introduced immediately, provides the institutional credibility Nadia offers Thomas ("a ship that never landed"), and frames the opening and closing images. It supplies the cable-basket descent tool and the final vault. However, the library itself doesn't pressure Nadia's choices during the core beats—she works alone, the captain's agreement is brief, and the archive's mobility is told advantage rather than a dramatized constraint that alters her approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters were found" anchors the opening, and Nadia's eleven-year tenure establishes context. The parley "lasted hours" and the diary work occurs across nights, but time doesn't tighten decisions—no urgency about the captain's patience, the zeppelin's route, or Thomas's willingness to wait. The progression (decrypt → descend → parley → archive) is sequential but not time-pressured. The element is present but does not function as a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nadia's drive to "uncover truth in tension" is stated and embodied: she has spent eleven years cataloging the erased, recognizes Ruth's name instantly, and returns to the diary "each night" despite the psychometric cost. The friction between intimacy with Ruth's voice and the physical/emotional toll is present ("shaking and radiant with grief"). At closure, she chooses public archive over private possession. However, the parley doesn't dramatize internal conflict—her persuasion of Thomas is summarized, not tested through competing impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is consistently elevated and elegiac: "thought refusing to land," "luminous, furious, precise," "solemn and burning." The prose modulates under pressure—visceral immersion during visions, quieter description at the lagoon, measured summary during the parley. The final image ("watching the dunes erase their footprints below") sustains the reflective register and charges closure with the theme of erasure and recovery. However, "solemn" recurs without variation, and the parley's hours-long summary flattens the scene's potential intensity.</comment>
