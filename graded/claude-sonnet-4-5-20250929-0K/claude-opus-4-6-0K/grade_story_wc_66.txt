<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is established through concrete details—eleven years of copyist work, hand "so steady that conductors mistook her manuscripts for typeset"—and her motivation (grandmother's folktales, memory as rebellion) is embodied rather than told. The final action (leaning toward the microphone, opening her mouth) feels earned by prior setup, though the story remains largely interior and reflective without on-page resistance or contradiction that would test her resolve. Minor issue: the phrase "secretly luminous" verges on label-speak, though it's later grounded in the amber-lit alcove moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear temporal anchor ("eleven years") and spatial grounding emerges by the ember alcove paragraph (~25% in). Closure is Charged Poise: the final image ("old world stirred, stretched, and began to breathe") reconfigures the story famine premise with undeniable pressure, and the cost is conceptual (risk of discovery, letters as "contraband more dangerous than any weapon"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the letters prove her method works, tightening the stakes before the final broadcast.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly anchored (basalt quarry, mist, signal-fire backstory) and the micro-setting (stone ledge, wool-wrapped microphone, amber dial glow) constrains Maren's ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (mist "pressed," "thickened," chill "crept through the mist like a living thing"). The alcove charges the final image when the mist thins "just enough to let the signal climb," linking environment to stakes. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve narrative against state suppression. The story deepens when letters arrive (proof of efficacy raises the risk), and the final broadcast choice narrows options—she commits to "a woman who remembered fire in a world that had outlawed burning," escalating both subject matter and danger. Agency is present (she builds the transmitter, selects gaps in scores, plants lyrics), and the cost is legible (letters as contraband, the physical ritual of returning "every third Thursday"). One meaningful tightening is evident; no reversals required under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—stories as survival, memory as resistance—emerges organically from concrete images: dust, embers, fragments, the girl who swallowed a thunderstorm. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the old world "stirred, stretched, and began to breathe" without moralizing. Subtext operates in the phrase "teaching dust to tell stories" and the letters' trembling handwriting. Minor slip: "the quieter the telling, the deeper it burrowed" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains tied to Maren's method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "narrative itself was rationed," "conjecture," "thistled calm." Psychic distance is stable; perceptual signature is selective (copyist's precision, musical knowledge, ember metaphors). Diction remains literary but character-consistent; no head-hopping. The phrase "a small ember refusing to cool" and "secretly luminous" use purposeful repetition to anchor motifs. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (short final sentences: "The frequency hummed. The mist thinned..."). No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "Within a decade, an entire generation grew up believing..."). Rhythm varies (mix of long, syntactically complex sentences and short declaratives at closure). Minor artifact: "secretly luminous, a woman who carried light where no one thought to look" is near-paraphrase within one sentence. Template stem appears twice in adjacent beats ("She thought of it as..." / "She leaned toward..."), but does not constitute a run. Opening and closing lines are strong. One filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("mistook," "remembered," "remembered") but does not dull immediacy given past-tense reflection mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Premise—hiding story fragments in approved orchestral music—is fresh and specific to Maren's occupation. The "story famine" conceit and the method (lyrics threaded into instrumental texture) feel inevitable rather than imposed. Risk: the piece commits fully to a quiet, ritual structure without conventional antagonist. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on this exact premise (copyist skill, musical gaps, signal broadcast). The "teaching dust to tell stories" metaphor is original enough to anchor the theme, though "luminous" as descriptor verges on stock.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's occupation (copyist) enables the method (knows scores "measure by measure," finds "gaps in architecture"). Her diligence is signaled early and her choices—building the transmitter, selecting lyrics, returning every third Thursday—drive the narrative. Present in setup, middle (letter response), and closure (tonight's broadcast choice). The trait shapes tactics but does not face a high-cost on-page test that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dial glow appears in at least three beats: initial settling ("dial glow was the only star"), waiting for frequency to steady ("amber light to warm"), and the final moment ("amber light caught the edge of her jaw"). It charges the closure image (luminosity externalized). The object is irreplaceable (shortwave transmitter is the story's engine) and tied to cost (risk of detection). Strong causal presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast is the story's engine: shapes stakes (risk of sedition), tactics (hiding lyrics in approved music), and the ending (tonight's new broadcast). Introduced early ("pirate broadcast never announced itself"), developed through the method explanation, and actualized at closure when Maren begins. The concept could not be swapped without collapsing the plot. Causal pressure and closure participation are both strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is introduced early as a descriptor tied to memory. It recurs in the final image when "the amber light caught the edge of her jaw, and for a moment she was as luminous on the outside as she had always been within." The reprise reweights the trait visually, but it remains largely metaphorical rather than constraining an on-page choice with visible cost. Lyric resonance is present; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears once in a physical action ("pull her coat around her shoulders to cloak herself against the chill"). The word choice carries metaphorical weight (hiding, secrecy), but the action itself is incidental—easily swappable with "wrap" or "draw." No return, no cost tied to this exact action, and it does not drive a turn. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method (elusive song lyrics threaded into instrumental texture) is explained in detail mid-story, shapes Maren's weekly ritual, and is actualized at closure ("Tonight she would plant the story of a woman who remembered fire"). Signaled early ("her method was precise"), demonstrated through examples (fox, frozen river, thunderstorm), and essential to both the pirate-broadcast premise and the ending. Could not be replaced without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ember alcove is established early (cut into basalt, signal-fire backstory) and anchors every broadcast scene. The mist and alcove mouth frame the ritual; tonight the mist "thinned just enough to let the signal climb," linking setting to stakes. The alcove enables the action (houses transmitter, hides her) and charges the closure when environment cooperates. Strong spatial specificity and closure participation, though the setting does not impose a visible obstacle Maren must overcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is the premise and historical frame. The timeframe is detailed (novels pulped first, then theaters, then oral tellers; "within a decade" a generation grew up) and tightens urgency (letters arriving, tonight's new broadcast of a woman who remembered fire). The famine shapes all choices and is conceptually present at closure, but the story does not use a live clock or immediate deadline that narrows Maren's window on this particular night.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("to teach dust to tell stories") is introduced early via the grandmother's folktales and Maren's memory. It drives the transmitter-building, the lyric method, and tonight's broadcast. The phrase itself appears mid-story as Maren's conscious framing, and the final image enacts it ("an old world stirred, stretched, and began to breathe"). Desire is dramatized through ritual and risk (contraband letters), though internal conflict between want and fear is muted—she never wavers on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is named once as a descriptor for her voice's refusal to shout. The tone throughout is measured, patient, and quiet even under existential stakes—consistent with the premise that "the quieter the telling, the deeper it burrowed." The final paragraph modulates subtly (short declaratives, "The frequency hummed. The mist thinned...") to charge the ending without breaking the calm. Tone supports closure and feels integral, though the single explicit mention limits full integration.</comment>
