<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal life is concrete and specific—her perception of the wood as frozen harmonics, her symphonic organization of experience. The final weeping without sound is well-embodied. However, the piece leans heavily on reflection (nearly 40%) with minimal dramatized micro-choices under pressure; the protagonist operates in sustained observation mode until the single strum action. Internal contradiction is absent; Maren's conviction never wavers or complicates her pursuit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clear. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the grove, the sculpture discovery, the porcelain integration, then a cadence shift at the strum that reweights the silence motif. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the pulse crosses the grove, the hedgehog pauses, Maren weeps; options are reconfigured (she will carve more, the symphony begins) with felt cost (eleven years of isolation, the weight of grief made visible). Cost is legible in "wept without sound" and "willingness to feel what the broken world felt." One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is texturally rich—pale trunks, spiral grain, silvered sculpture—and constrains Maren's method (she must read cracks, carve resonance chambers). The porcelain insulator's crazed glaze and the stress-crack intervals are specific, irreplaceable details that drive the final instrument design. The hedgehog's uncurling and the shiver of leaves charge the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Maren's sculptural attention, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the carving process and the sculpture discovery, then tightens at the strum when the vibration crosses the grove for the first time in eleven years. The hedgehog's pause and the siskin's head-tilt externalize the shift, and Maren's decision to "carve more instruments" forecloses solitary mourning in favor of symphonic effort. Cost is felt (the eleven-year silence, the weeping) but the escalation is mild; one turn is present, fitting the Accumulative lens, but no reversal or deepening complication tests Maren's commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as feeling traveling through you to emerge changed—arises from the stress-crack translation and the final pulse that connects "every living thing in the grove." The closing insight ("silence was the first movement") reweights the Quiet as rest rather than enemy, a non-literal answer earned by Maren's sustained effort. The porcelain insulator and sculpture cracks form a tight motif that charges the ending without overt statement. Subtext is strong in "intensely quiet, the way a whisper can be more urgent than a shout." One minor slip: "empathy in motion" is articulated on the page ("letting that feeling travel through you and emerge changed") in near-prompt language, though it is grounded in the crack-reading action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric—"timber held melody the way amber held light," "symphonically minded," "the air refused to carry their meaning." POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: Maren notices intervals in cracks, feels vibrations in her palms, organizes life into movements. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven, with no register drift. The prose modulates under pressure—short declarative beats at the strum, then the reflective coda. Minor filter-verb presence ("she swore," "she felt," "she recognized") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is varied and purposeful; information density is high. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Sentence structures shift to support pacing—longer, layered syntax during reflection, shorter beats at the strum. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. One minor scaffold slip: "She understood then what empathy in motion meant" is a thesis sentence that slightly externalizes insight rather than trusting the dramatization. Figurative language is dense but coherent ("frozen harmonics," "crazed with age," "silvered to the color of rain"), with no mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—reading stress cracks in wood as musical intervals—is specific and fresh. The combination of tree-song sculptor, porcelain insulator, and planetary silence feels organic rather than checklist-driven. Emotional truth (grief made visible, the willingness to feel) grounds the concept. The turn from solitary mourning to symphonic beginning is earned in hindsight by the crack translation and the grove's response. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. The "intensely quiet" paradox and the equipoise of silence-as-rest offer a non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all key beats: analyzing the sculpture cracks, carving the cradle, placing the insulator, strumming the ridge. Her decision to "carve more instruments" at closure redefines her path from isolated mourning to communal effort. Present early, developed through carving action, and causal at the ending. High irreplaceability—her specific skills and perception are indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator is found in paragraph four, integrated into the cradle design, and sits at the node where vibration converges at the strum. Its crazed glaze is specific and irreplaceable; the vibration "traveled its crazed glaze" to produce the pulse. Present in three beats (discovery, housing, strum) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is tied to its use (the eleven-year effort culminates in this instrument).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is named on the page and defined—"letting that feeling travel through you and emerge changed"—then enacted through the crack-reading and the pulse that crosses the grove. It shapes Maren's method (translating grief into intervals) and the closure image (the shared measure). Present early as subtext, developed through the sculpture discovery, and articulated at closure. Somewhat swappable (could be "translation" or "resonance") and the label-only articulation lowers specificity, but the concept does constrain her approach and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is introduced early ("every element of her life arranged itself into movements, crescendos, rests") and colors Maren's perception throughout. It enables her to recognize intervals in the cracks and to frame silence as a rest. Present in two beats (opening reflection, crack analysis) but functions more as perceptual lens than constraint with visible cost. No clear on-page tradeoff tied to this trait; it enriches voice but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The strum is the climactic action: "let her thumb strum across the thinnest carved ridge of alder." It triggers the vibration, the pulse, the hedgehog's pause, the siskin's head-tilt, and Maren's weeping—all closure effects. Signaled through the carving prep, executed on the page, and indispensable. Removing this exact action would collapse the ending. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stress-crack analysis is introduced in paragraph six ("analyzing them the way a cartographer reads contour lines"), drives the interval discovery ("Each crack described a tension…intervals. Fifths, thirds, a resolving fourth"), and shapes the cradle design that houses the insulator. Present in two beats (discovery, design transfer) with causal pressure. The method is specific and irreplaceable—without crack-reading, the intervals and the final instrument do not exist. Minor deduction for late signal (past 40% mark).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove frames every scene, supplies the wood (spiral grain, resonance chambers), and responds at closure (leaves shiver, siskin tilts head). The grove's silence and the rooted alder that braces the instrument are essential. Present early, developed through carving action, and charged at the ending. Micro-setting (the grove as living participant) alters tactics and pressure. High integration, though the grove functions more as stage and material than as dynamic obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hedgehog's uncurling provides the permission cue—"the world waking, agreeing to try again"—and sets the moment for the strum. It appears only at closure and does not constrain prior choices or tighten pressure earlier. Lyric reprise pattern: the timeframe reweights the closure image (the world's readiness) but does not drive escalation. Late arrival and single-beat use limit score; the element charges the final image but is swappable (any dawn cue could function similarly).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire to create music in a silent world is signaled in paragraph two ("She was a tree-song sculptor…the silence of the world had not discouraged her"), dramatized through eleven years of carving, tested at the strum, and affirmed in the closing resolve to "carve more instruments." Friction is present—"no one could hear the result"—and cost is visible (isolation, sustained effort, weeping). The motivation drives all beats and forecloses solitary grief at closure. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is taught early ("not loud…intensely quiet, the way a whisper can be more urgent than a shout"), sustained through the noiseless carving and Maren's soundless weeping, and charges the closure image—the pulse is "not about sound" but about "the willingness to feel." Tone modulates with pressure (reflective, then concentrated, then elegiac) and coheres across all beats. The paradox (quiet as urgency) is integrated into voice, action, and theme. High irreplaceability—the tone is indispensable to the story's logic and final effect.</comment>
