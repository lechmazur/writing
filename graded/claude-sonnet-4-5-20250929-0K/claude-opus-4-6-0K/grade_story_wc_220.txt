<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is embodied through her past as a body-finder and her "intuitively descriptive" reading of death; her shift to decoding cylinders shows agency under pressure. The revelation that the voice belongs to her mother earns the final stillness without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears in her retirement from reading the dead yet compulsion to decode the cylinders, and the hand-to-throat gesture when hearing about leaves is specific. Minor slip: the council's pressure to work faster is mentioned but never dramatized as a choice-point that costs her something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Maren, Groovetown scrapyard, post-war wasteland). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—cylinder after cylinder accumulates density until the final recording reweights all prior finds as a mother's breadcrumb trail. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): "translating all that distance into something so close it fit inside her fist" and the decision to rewind and listen again reconfigures the entire search as personal reunion with felt cost (years spent finding strangers' dead, now confronting her own). One tightening deepens: finding supply caches → finding the voice's identity → finding her mother. Cost is conceptual and emotional but legible on the page in the final stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard is built from specifics—car doors, satellite dishes, refrigerator towers—that ground survival logic. The phonograph cylinder as micro-setting object constrains the entire search: grooves dictate the method, wax preserves both recordings and the daughter's leaf, and the hand-cranked spindle from bicycle parts shows resource scarcity shaping tool use. The final beat charges when the cylinder mechanism (stylus riding groove to silence) becomes the delivery system for her mother's voice. Wasteland cracks and settlement hum frame without crowding the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode survival caches to keep Groovetown alive, braided with unspoken search for her daughter Sol. Escalation under Accumulative lens: hissing → coordinates → warnings → confession cylinder that names Soledad. The protagonist's agency drives each decoding choice; her refusal to be rushed by the council costs time but preserves her method. Final turn—recognizing her mother's voice—forecloses the professional distance she maintained and reopens grief, a visible emotional cost. One micro-critique: the council's pressure to work faster is told, not dramatized as a scene that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme: closeness and distance, collapsed through labor and loss. The leaf pressed "during the last October before the war, when leaves still turned colors" seeds color-as-memory; wax preserves both leaf and voice across the cracked wasteland. The cylinder voice loves "the world enough to leave instructions for surviving its end," and Maren's years finding bodies for strangers become the apprenticeship that lets her decode her mother's riddles. The ending offers a non-literal answer: distance becomes a path when loss is read as instruction. "The cracks in the earth held their secrets a little less tightly" is image, not moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren with distinct perceptual signature: "intuitively descriptive," reading "a death from the angle of a collarbone." Diction is controlled and lyric without slipping into omniscience—"tinted revelations slowly, the truth coming through like light through stained glass" fits a character who decodes physical scenes. Psychic distance tightens at the confession cylinder: "Maren's hand went to the leaf at her throat." No dialogue, so subtext lives in gesture and silence. Rhythmic control modulates from hissing accumulation to the final stillness. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high—"bloodhound's name was Maren, and she had spent eleven years finding bodies" front-loads role, duration, and specialty. Figurative language is pattern-consistent: grooves/reading/translation/distance/closeness. Minor loop: "wild hush" appears twice verbatim (opening metaphor, near-final beat) without reweighting between uses; the phrase charges the ending but the second use reads decorative. One template stem: "She had retired… She had carved… She played…" in early exposition. No paraphrase loops or muddy metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and charge the leaf/voice/wax motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The phonograph-as-archaeological-message-system is a specific, non-obvious synthesis; the wax-leaf and wax-cylinder doubling feels earned rather than forced. The retrospective recognition (searcher finding bodies becomes searcher found by her mother's voice) transforms the retirement frame. Risk: the story trusts a quiet, lyric ending and a coincidence (the woman on the cylinders is Maren's mother) that retrospectively re-codes all prior clues as personal rather than professional. The twist hinges on "Soledad" matching "Sol," which is signaled but still leans on naming luck. Groovetown's phonograph-cylinder economy and the post-war scrapyard specificity lift the piece above template post-apocalypse.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's retirement from body-finding is setup and motive; her skill ("intuitively descriptive") enables cylinder decoding in the middle; her recognition of her mother's voice is the closure beat. Her choice to rewind and listen again—rather than rush to find the final cache—alters tactics (professional urgency pauses for personal grief). Present across all three gates; drives two major beats; irreplaceable (the story's logic depends on her forensic-reading skill translating to riddle-decoding). Visible cost: years finding strangers' dead, now facing her own loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The autumn leaf appears in setup (Maren wears it, Sol pressed it "during the last October before the war"), reappears when Maren hears the cylinder confession ("Maren's hand went to the leaf at her throat"), and charges closure when the recorded voice describes pressing autumn leaves in wax. Three beats; the leaf's wax preservation parallels the wax cylinders and crystallizes the theme (preserving color/memory against erasure). Irreplaceable: removing it would sever the daughter-link and the color-motif. Specific cost: touching it "whenever the silence grew too loud" embodies grief as physical reflex.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" is named once ("tinted revelations slowly, the truth coming through like light through stained glass") in the middle section and governs the method: each cylinder offers partial, metaphor-coded clues rather than direct instructions. The concept shapes Maren's decoding labor—she must interpret rather than transcribe—and the final revelation (mother's voice) arrives tinted by metaphor until the name "Soledad" clarifies. Present in setup (hissing underneath voice), middle (riddles), and ending (confession cylinder). Constrains tactics (slow, interpretive work vs. council's demand for speed) and charges the closure image (distance becomes closeness through riddle-solving). Scores high for thematic resonance but mid-high for causal pressure since the concept describes method more than it creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is signaled early ("could narrate a death from the angle of a collarbone") and enables the protagonist's key move: translating forensic scene-reading skill to phonograph-riddle decoding. The trait constrains her (she cannot ignore the riddles' layered meanings, must sit for hours) and enables her (she finds caches others would miss). Present in setup, powers the middle beats (decoding supply locations, warnings), and makes closure possible (recognizing the voice's cadence as maternal). Cost: "it had eaten her alive" when applied to bodies; applying it to cylinders reopens grief. Irreplaceable: removing this trait breaks the logic of her transition from body-finder to riddle-solver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Solving riddles is the protagonist's repeated action across the middle: "Where the iron horse drank its last water, thirty paces east of the cracked smile" → seed grain cache; poisoned aquifer warning; radiation zone map. The action is present in setup (first cylinder hissing), drives middle beats (finding supplies, saving scavengers), and connects to closure (final riddle leads to letters for Soledad). The riddle structure constrains Maren's method (slow interpretation vs. council pressure) and the final riddle reweights all prior ones as breadcrumbs. Minor swappability: the action could be "decoding," "translating," or "interpreting" without breaking structure, though "riddle" fits the metaphor-layered recordings better than alternatives.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The phonograph-cylinder method is introduced early (crude stylus, tin funnel, hand-cranked spindle from bicycle parts), powers every middle beat (playing cylinders to decode coordinates, warnings, confession), and is active in the closure image ("the stylus riding the groove to its end, the cylinder spinning into silence"). The grooves' spiral structure and wax medium mirror the preserved leaf and give the story its title motif. Mechanics matter: hand-cranking signals labor and scarcity; the needle/funnel rig shows improvisation under constraint. Irreplaceable: swapping to written notes or digital files would lose the wax-preservation doubling and the tactile, repetitive labor that charges Maren's discovery. Cost: hours of replay and transcription.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Groovetown scrapyard is anchored early (car doors, satellite dishes, refrigerator towers, phonograph cylinders excavated from a museum) and supplies the material constraint: no intact phonograph machine, forcing Maren to build her own. The cracked wasteland provides the spatial logic for buried caches and the fissures that structure the post-war geography. The settlement's survival depends on Maren's finds (seed grain, antibiotics, water tablets), raising external stakes. The setting appears in setup, middle (scavenging parties, council pressure), and ending ("the settlement hummed its quiet industry"). Minor cap: the cracks and scrapyard frame the action but do not alter Maren's final choice at closure; the ending turns inward to the cylinder and leaf rather than outward to the wasteland.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" anchors the timeframe in setup and explains the scrapyard economy, cracked earth, and lost technology. The post-war condition creates scarcity (no intact machines, dangerous aquifers, radiation zones) that raises stakes for Maren's cache discoveries. The frame is present throughout—council needs supplies for "the coming winter," scavengers navigate poisoned zones—and the contrast with "the last October before the war, when leaves still turned colors" charges the leaf motif. The timeframe does not tighten as a live clock (no countdown, no accelerating pressure from seasonal deadline), but it structures the world's logic and Maren's grief. Removing the war-frame would collapse the scrapyard setting and the cylinder-preservation premise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"To translate distance into closeness" is the story's engine: Maren spent years traveling to find bodies for strangers; her mother "buried supplies along every road between herself and her child, hoping that distance could become a path rather than an absence." The motive is seeded early (Maren touches the leaf when silence grows loud, signaling unresolved grief), drives the middle (decoding riddles turns abstract coordinates into locations, "transforming abstract clues into precise locations"), and lands explicitly at closure: "translating all that distance into something so close it fit inside her fist." The desire conflicts with the cost—decoding cylinders forces Maren to relive loss—and the final choice (rewind and listen again) accepts that cost. Irreplaceable: the entire riddle-decoding structure enacts the motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is named twice: opening metaphor ("a wild hush that filled her shelter like weather") and near-ending ("The wild hush of the wasteland pressed against the shelter walls"). The tone governs the prose throughout—silence as active pressure, not absence. Quiet moments (Maren sitting for hours, turning phrases over) carry urgency through scarcity and unspoken grief. The tone modulates: hissing accumulation in the middle, stillness at closure when Maren stops moving and the cylinder spins into silence. The final image holds the hush without deflating it: "She rewound the cylinder and listened to her mother's voice again." The tone charges the ending by making silence the medium through which distance collapses.</comment>
