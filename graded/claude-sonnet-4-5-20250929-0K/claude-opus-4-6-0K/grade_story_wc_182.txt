<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sable's agency is established through her research methodology and her negotiation with the Custodial Silence, but her internal conflict remains abstract. The story tells us she "had long ago stopped expecting straight paths" without dramatizing what that costs her in the present. Maren's grief at seeing the lessons is embodied ("wept... from the strange grief"), but his earlier motivation lacks friction or visible hesitation when asking for help. The decision to help him arrives without on-page deliberation or competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates through researching gaps → botanical diary as map → Floor 7,744 → negotiation with Custodial Silence → discovery. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the unlearned lessons become "an unheard symphony—always performing, always present" with the conceptual cost that humanity has refused wisdom repeatedly. However, the final image's cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; Sable "returns to her translations" without visible foreclosure of a path or stance shift rooted in her present choices. The "melody she could almost, almost hear" gestures toward charged poise but does not crystallize options or reweight her situation with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thornspire's eleven-thousand-floor catalog, carved granite corridors, and Floor 7,744's circular room supply vivid spatial anchors. The botanical diary's pressed flowers function as altitude markers, making the object constrain navigation. The "central shaft" where Sable speaks to the Custodial Silence provides concrete staging for the negotiation beat. The micro-setting (the diary as map) charges a middle choice and the final library room frames the closure image, meeting the 9+ test's environment constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding the Library of Unlearned Lessons to rescue Maren's century from repetition. One meaningful tightening occurs when gaps converge on Floor 7,744 and Sable must negotiate with the Custodial Silence; her argument that "hiding them forever defeated their purpose" narrows options. The negotiation creates pressure, but the Silence's relenting feels convenient rather than costly—no visible price is paid by Sable for access. Maren's descent with the volumes implies future stakes but does not foreclose a present path for Sable with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the unlearned lessons motif: "Compassion over conquest. Listening before speaking." The botanical diary's dual function (navigation map and temporal ward) integrates concept with action. The "unheard symphony" metaphor in the final paragraph offers a resonant image but edges toward thematic statement ("The rescue was never about force. It was about frequency"). The insight that lessons are "like an unheard symphony—always performing, always present" arrives more through assertion than through Sable's embodied realization, though the image itself is evocative and non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV Sable maintains a distinct perceptual signature: "practiced patience of someone who had long ago stopped expecting straight paths," "researching gaps—absences in the catalog where entries should have been." Diction remains controlled with purposeful elevation ("proto-Enochian modified with chlorophyll notation," "acoustic fossils embedded in Thornspire's deepest stones"). Maren's brief dialogue ("People are dying in my time... From repetition") carries goal-driven subtext and advances plot. The final beat's voice modulates appropriately: "the labyrinth humming faintly around her—a melody she could almost, almost hear."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "Each plant specimen corresponded to a phoneme. Each page was a sentence made of petals." Line-level clarity holds across the piece. One notable overwriting cluster appears in the closure section: "strange grief of recognizing how simple the lessons were" followed immediately by "at least the music will be playing" and then "The unlearned lessons were like an unheard symphony." This stacks three figurative or explanatory moves in quick succession, diluting propulsion. The metaphor shift from "music" to "symphony" to "frequency" to "melody" within the final two paragraphs creates minor register drift without clear pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The mountain-as-bookstore premise and "Library of Unlearned Lessons" offer fresh specificity. The botanical diary as altitude-keyed map synthesizes botanical notation with temporal mechanics in a non-obvious way. However, the core emotional arc—helper aids time traveler to retrieve wisdom humanity ignored—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction. The Custodial Silence negotiation and "researching gaps" method provide ingenuity in execution. Risk-taking in the lyric closure image ("melody she could almost, almost hear") heightens thematic resonance but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable's profession as arcane linguist enables her to decode the proto-Enochian diary, reconstruct the language for the Custodial Silence negotiation, and recognize seventeen references to Floor 7,744. Present in setup (first paragraph), drives the middle research sequence (gap analysis, diary cross-referencing), and participates in closure (she helps wrap volumes and returns to translations). Her choices—researching gaps, negotiating—create key turns. The diary decoding and negotiation are causally active beats shaped by her expertise with visible tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in beat one (Maren's arrival), middle beat (Sable decodes it as altitude-keyed map), and closure (volumes wrapped in diary pages as temporal wards). Handled across three beats: Sable "cross-referencing" it, using pressed flowers as directional cipher, then repurposing pages as protective material. The object's dual function (map and ward) demonstrates specificity and causal pressure—Sable's navigation depends on it. Closure linkage is present but functional rather than reweighted; the diary enables the ending rather than charging it with new meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rescue mission" is named explicitly ("a rescue mission—though not the kind fought with rope and flame. This was a rescue of memory itself") and shapes Maren's stakes. It drives his goal (find lessons to save his century) and Sable's agreement to help. Present in setup and provides the mission structure, but the concept does not constrain tactics on the page—Sable's research and negotiation would function identically if framed as "quest" or "retrieval." The final image invokes rescue thematically ("Will they listen this time?") but does not reweight the concept with visible cost tied to rescue's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is signaled ("Sable was carefully resourceful") and demonstrated through her gap-research method rather than brute-force searching. The trait enables the middle beat: she chooses indirection (researching absences) over the impossible task of searching eleven thousand floors. One on-page action with implicit cost (weeks of cross-referencing). However, the label arrives late (after the inciting incident) and the trait could be swapped for "methodical" or "strategic" without altering story logic. The cost (weeks spent) is told rather than dramatically felt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Renegotiation with the Custodial Silence is the major turn that grants access to Floor 7,744. Present in middle beat (Sable speaks in reconstructed language, argues that hiding lessons defeats their purpose) and directly enables closure (floor opens, library revealed). The action's mechanics matter: she must use "a language older than writing" and construct an argument. Specificity is high—removing "renegotiate" and replacing with generic "ask" or "unlock" would break the story's established rule (Custodial Silence as gatekeeper). The held-breath relenting adds pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled early (middle of first third: "she began by researching gaps—absences in the catalog"), shapes the middle sequence (cross-referencing indexes, finding negative space, converging on Floor 7,744), and enables closure (without the gap method, Sable could not locate the hidden floor). The method's mechanics are dramatized: "Every collection... cast a shadow of references... A hidden collection would leave a negative shape, like a missing tooth the tongue keeps finding." Two beats: gap analysis and convergence on Floor 7,744. Causal pressure is high—the method redefines search tactics from impossible breadth to focused absence-tracking.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Thornspire is established in the opening line, described across multiple beats (granite corridors, eleven thousand floors, central shaft, Floor 7,744's circular room), and provides spatial staging for all action. The labyrinth structure pressures choices: Sable cannot brute-force search, must use the catalog and negotiation. The mountain's Custodial Silence agreement supplies a constraint that Sable must navigate. Micro-setting (central shaft for negotiation, Floor 7,744's room for discovery) alters tactics. Closure participation is strong: "the labyrinth humming faintly around her" charges the final image with environmental presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled ("after the time traveler arrived... on a Tuesday") and Maren's urgency ("People are dying in my time") implies stakes. However, the timeline does not tighten on-page decisions—Sable's research takes "weeks" without pressure from a deadline or consequences for delay. The time traveler's presence frames the inciting incident but does not function as a live clock that alters moves. Closure acknowledges temporal mechanics (diary pages as wards "against temporal decay") but the timeframe itself remains atmospheric rather than tactically constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to find the Library of Unlearned Lessons is stated by Maren ("I need to find the Library... I can bring them back") and dramatized through Sable's agreement and sustained research effort. Present in setup and drives all middle beats (gap research, diary decoding, negotiation). Friction appears briefly when Sable must argue with the Custodial Silence, balancing the library's purpose against its hiddenness. However, Sable's personal stake in helping remains underexplored—no visible cost or competing desire complicates her choice to assist. Closure shows Maren's grief and doubt ("Will they listen this time?") but the motivation's final charge is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears explicitly in the final paragraph ("The unlearned lessons were like an unheard symphony—always performing, always present") and is echoed in the closing line ("a melody she could almost, almost hear"). The tone of patient, reverent accumulation—"practiced patience," "moved through the labyrinth," "held breath lasting hours"—remains coherent across beats and modulates subtly at closure (from search to discovery to listening). The final image charges tone by shifting from visual discovery to auditory resonance. However, the metaphor is stated rather than wholly embodied, trending toward thematic declaration in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
