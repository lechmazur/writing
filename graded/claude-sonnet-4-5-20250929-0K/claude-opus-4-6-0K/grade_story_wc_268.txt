<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is strong: her physical presence ("diminutive titan"), her perceptual priorities (noticing the scepter height, the missing jokes), and her final choice to accept collapse all flow from consistent interiority. The motivation is embodied through her measured pace and tactile engagement with texts. Minor deduction: the brother Sorath exists only as absence; the pretender's banishment and the court's disbelief are told rather than dramatized, reducing friction. The final renunciation—accepting graceful collapse—earns its cost through prior particulars and forecloses the path of denial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred and held: Maren's search → rune assembly → threshold choice. The closure is Charged Poise: she steps out "carrying the truth like a lantern into a house built of shadows," options crystallized (use the rune, fracture the court) with cost undeniable ("each falling piece placed down softly, each broken thing acknowledged"). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rune materializes and she grasps the systemic stakes. No causality breaks; time pooling in the library is taught and sustains the ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library is micro-setting as constraint and resource: shelves "beyond geometry," time pooling in eddies, constellations marking passage, the iron gall ink pellet as waning moon all pressure her search and charge the final threshold crossing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust older than language"). The temple's spatial metaphor—pause between constellations—recurs to frame the step back into time at closure. Gate satisfied: environment shapes choice (the library's timelessness enables the search) and charges the final image (threshold as boundary).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: unmask the pretender. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: the search tightens as the ink pellet wanes, the rune's assembly forces recognition of systemic cost ("sunder the architecture of deception"), and Maren's threshold choice crystallizes between truth and stability. The cost is legible on the page: "the collapse, when it came, would be graceful." No false reversals; the complication (court fracture) arises organically from the rune's nature. Agency is decision with visible foreclosure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: truth as both revelation and demolition, encoded in the rune's drift (refuses fixed form), the library's suspended time (truth outside urgency), and Maren's smallness (moving through wreckage without crushing). The final image—lantern into a house of shadows—offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: closing the book "gently," walking with "unhurried grace." The piece resists binaries (truth is necessary and destructive) and trusts the reader to hold ambiguity. Ink stains as fingerprint of vocation charge her renunciation of ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited; psychic distance contracts slightly at closure ("she was small enough"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices wrongness in "small things," measures progress by the pellet's wane, values "regally unpretentious" as highest compliment. Diction elevates purposefully ("pause the cosmos had forgotten to exhale") without leaving her scholarly idiom. No dialogue on the page. Elision of the search's literal duration is taught early (time pools) and paid off at closure (step back into time). The prose reflects her unhurried, precise mind under sustained pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but controlled and voice-motivated ("iron gall ink that had oxidized to the color of old blood"). Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: "Time did not pass here so much as pool" is echoed by "time was meaningless here, measured only across...constellations." The metaphor suite (pause, drift, wane, threshold) recurs without muddle. Information density is strong; nearly every sentence advances knowledge or pressure. No filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines frame the arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-timeless-repository with political impostor plot is specific and non-obvious; the rune scattered across texts by truthseekers anticipates modern pretenders freshly. The image of the diminutive titan and the waning ink pellet as progress marker avoid generic quest furniture. Risk-taking in the elliptical time structure (constellations as clock) heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Minor deduction: the "pretender to the throne" premise is familiar fantasy infrastructure; transformation through the drift motif and graceful-collapse tone rescues it from template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren present throughout; her choices create the key turn (assembling the rune, grasping systemic cost, choosing to proceed). The "diminutive titan" attribute shapes her final image: "small enough to move through the wreckage without crushing." Early signal, middle development (search sustained by her endurance), closure participation (threshold choice). High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in two beats: transcribing fragments nightly and "shrank slowly, like a tiny dark moon waning" as progress measure. It constrains her timeline (resource depletion) and charges the middle pressure. Missing closure participation: the pellet does not return at the threshold moment. Swappable with another consumable resource (candle, hourglass) without major edits. Early signal, middle development present; closure linkage absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rune of drift is core: it shapes the entire search (scattered fragments), defines the cost (will "sunder the architecture of deception"), and charges the final choice ("drifted on the page, patient"). Its property—refusing fixed form—embodies the theme. Early signal, middle development (assembly across volumes), closure participation (the decision to carry it out). High causal pressure and specificity; story logic fails without this exact element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is signaled early (plain linen robes, no crown, ink-stained fingers) and resurfaces in her choice of graceful collapse over spectacle. It enables her to value truth over court performance and informs the tone of the ending. Not swappable; her anti-ornamental stance shapes the final image. Early signal and closure linkage present; middle development less distinct. One credible beat (renunciation of ornament frames threshold choice).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sunder" is the action the rune will perform: strip illusion and collapse the court's architecture. It drives the central tension (Maren grasps the cost, chooses to proceed) and defines the ending's stakes. The word recurs twice in a key paragraph, crystallizing the trade-off. Early signal (implicit in "unmask"), middle recognition (the rune's dual nature revealed), closure participation (she carries the sundering truth out). High causal pressure; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method—cryptic messages in library books—is signaled early ("scattered deliberately across hundreds of volumes") and structures the search. It matters mechanically: she must find, transcribe, and assemble fragments. The method shapes the middle (moving shelf to shelf, finding "faint notations") and pays off when "the rune materialized." Early signal, middle development across multiple beats, closure participation (assembly triggers the decision). High irreplaceability and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ancient temple library shapes every beat: its timeless suspension enables the search, its "shelves beyond geometry" supply the fragments, the shattered dome's constellations mark passage, and the threshold's crossing charges the closure image. It constrains (dust, fragility) and resources (the scattered texts). Early signal, sustained middle development, closure participation (stepping out of the pause). Story logic and final image would fail without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across the pause of shifting constellations"—is signaled early and recurs ("what might have been years or moments," "final night"). It shapes the ellipsis (unmeasured duration justified by the library's nature) and charges the ending (step back into time). The ink pellet's wane provides a secondary clock. Early signal, middle development (constellations "motionless in their slow rotation"), closure participation (pause → time). Moderate causal pressure; could be simplified without breaking logic, but the poetic specificity elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—unmask the pretender—is dramatized in the opening confrontation memory, drives the search, and resurfaces at closure when she weighs the court's fracture against truth. Friction between truth and stability creates the final tension. Early signal, middle development (sustained by remembered wrongness), closure participation (choice to carry the truth out with cost acknowledged). High causal pressure and cost connection; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tone of graceful collapse is coherent throughout: "unhurried grace," time pooling rather than passing, the ink pellet waning gently, and the final image of placing "each falling piece...softly." It modulates with pressure (library's stillness → threshold tension) and charges the closure ("she was small enough to move through the wreckage without crushing"). Early signal, middle development in pacing and diction, closure participation (collapse made graceful by her smallness). The tone is indispensable to the final effect.</comment>
