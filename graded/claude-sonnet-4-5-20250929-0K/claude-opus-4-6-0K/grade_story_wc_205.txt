<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction—revolutionary-turned-scholar, politically defunct but intellectually obsessed—is embodied through concrete choices: covering mirrors, writing in verse, refusing to uncover her reflection. The renunciation at the end (letting her reflection wait, choosing ancient faces over her own) feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong: "Each covering felt like a small funeral." Minor slip: the Academic Council dismissal reads slightly expository rather than dramatized through a specific memory that shaped a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's refusal to uncover the mirror and her acceptance of her "defunct" status foreclose the path of external validation with felt cost ("proof that creation persists, even when its creators do not"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—layered histories, projections, verse-writing build density that reweights her solitary work. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm projections show mourning, crystallizing her recognition of shared longing across species and validating her method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid constrains Maren's choices throughout: its natural volutes validate her thesis, its chambers isolate her, storm-thickened time-currents force the mirror-covering ritual, and the shard's projection depends on the asteroid's tunnels matching the ancient corridors. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when it "holds its light" as proof. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "amber light drifting through space like luminous rivers," "mineral deposits tracing golden arabesques." The setting is not postcard but active material that enables her archaeological work and encodes the civilization's decline in stone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the pre-human civilization existed—is signaled early and tightens when the storm forces Maren to enact her ritual, then deepens when the projections reveal mourning, validating her interpretive method with visible emotional cost (she writes verses the Council will never read). Agency is renunciation and endurance: she accepts her "defunct" status and chooses patient attention over external validation, foreclosing the path of recognition. One small friction: the Academic Council's dismissal is told rather than shown complicating a present choice, slightly reducing the pressure's on-page manifestation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—creation persists beyond creators—emerges organically from particulars: the shard's light, the verses, the covered mirrors, the asteroid's abandoned flourishes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image ("gilding everything they touched with the amber of what had been") that reweights Maren's work without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: not uncovering the mirror, touching the cloth, letting ancient faces matter more than her own. The civilization's mourning gesture and Maren's elegy-writing create thematic resonance through embodied parallel rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("baroque," "volutes," "iambic pentameter") matches Maren's scholarly, poetic sensibility without register drift. Psychic distance is stable; POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference: "what might have been its face"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices architectural curves, temporal strata, textual shapes. One minor slip: "the thing she had always been reaching for" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstract summary rather than remaining concrete, though it recovers quickly with the image of creation persisting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "broadcast manifestos in iambic pentameter" conveys both action and character trait). Rhythm modulates well: longer, layered sentences in description compress to shorter beats during the storm. Minor loop: "She had seen enough faces tonight—ancient, inhuman, beautiful—to know that the universe had been populated with longing" slightly paraphrases the mourning recognition two paragraphs earlier. One figurative density concern: the opening paragraph stacks metaphors ("luminous rivers," "golden arabesques," "translucent stratum") without full integration, though the effect supports the baroque setting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—failed revolutionary as solitary archaeologist, visible time as narrative material, baroque asteroid as evidence—feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "lone scholar against establishment" trope through the poetic method (writing in verse to capture alien civilization), the mirror-covering ritual (practical and symbolic), and the emotional stakes (creation persisting beyond creators). Risk-taking in the speculative frame (time-light, pre-human baroque builders) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The emotional truth—solitary work as revolution—feels earned rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's defunct-revolutionary status frames her motivations (manifestos → elegies), drives her rejection of external validation, and shapes the final choice (letting her reflection wait). The attribute appears in the opening, constrains her present isolation, and charges the ending by redefining what "revolution" means (patient attention vs. strikes). Cost is visible: political irrelevance, solitude, unread verses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crystal shard is handled in three beats: kept under cloth on the workbench, placed in its cradle during the storm, and cooling after projections fade. Its impossible geometry validates Maren's thesis, its projections provide the story's emotional center (the mourning figure), and it "holds its light" in the final paragraph, charging closure. Removing it would collapse the plot and thematic proof.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is signaled early, motivates Maren's solitary work, and sets the stakes (Academic Council dismissal, pareidolia accusation). It does not create an on-page turn but it reweights the ending: her acceptance that "the verses held their shape" even if unread by the Council. The concept is more backdrop than active pressure, as no new challenge from the dispute arises during the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's poetic inclination constrains her method (writing in verse because prose feels inadequate), differentiates her from typical archaeologists, and shapes the final image (verses that hold their shape). It appears in beat one (iambic pentameter manifestos), governs her interpretive practice in beat two (journal filled with stanzas), and charges closure. The cost is implicit: her work is less legible to the Council because of its form.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Devise a method" is referenced as three years of prior work and enacted on-page when she places the shard in its cradle and watches projections during the storm. The action enables the recognition of mourning, which validates her approach, but the devising itself is mostly backstory. It shapes one key turn (the projections) but does not drive multiple beats or create a visible tradeoff during the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Covering mirrors is signaled early (old Ceres habit, scientific purpose), enacted methodically as the storm builds (each covering "felt like a small funeral"), prevents interference with projections, and returns in the ending when Maren touches the cloth and chooses not to remove it. The method constrains her ritual, enables the clean projection that reveals mourning, and charges the final renunciation. Two beats plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid supplies the natural volutes that support Maren's thesis, the deep chambers that isolate her, the tunnels that match the projections' corridors, and the "gilded rock tumbling through the dark" that anchors the final image. Its formations are causally active: the asteroid's architecture is both evidence and inhabited workspace. Removing it would require total reconception; the setting is the argument.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visible time-currents (amber light as chronological strata) enable Maren's work, create the electromagnetic storms that necessitate mirror-covering, thicken outside the viewport to signal the storm's arrival, and "wash over her chamber" in the ending, gilding everything with "the amber of what had been." The timeframe is not a countdown clock but a persistent environmental condition that shapes method, pressure, and the closing image. It appears in setup, middle storm sequence, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to reimagine an entire civilization from a shard drives every on-page choice: keeping the shard, devising the projection method, covering mirrors, writing in verse, and refusing to uncover her reflection at the end. It is dramatized through her journal-writing during projections and friction with the Council's dismissal. The cost is on the page: solitude, irrelevance, unread work. The final line ("proof that creation persists") crystallizes the motivation's fulfillment with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Burnished sorrow suffuses the prose from the opening ("abandoned them here, in the dark") through the mirror-covering ritual ("Each covering felt like a small funeral") to the ending ("gilding everything they touched with the amber of what had been"). Tone modulates under pressure—elegiac throughout but with intensification during the projections ("she recognized mourning")—and charges the final image without breaking into sentimentality or declaration. The tone is the story's emotional architecture.</comment>
