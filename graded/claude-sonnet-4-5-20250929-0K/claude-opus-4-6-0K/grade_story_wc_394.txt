<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Venn's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("steadily curious," "manic precision," "longing made systematic"), with embodied tension between yearning and rigor. The mother's arrow tip and the kaleidoscope provide contradictory motives (inheritance vs. discovery) that drive the final choice. Minor slip: the laugh-with-tears moment at the breakthrough reads slightly performed rather than fully embodied. The descent choice is earned by eleven years of dramatized obsession, and the visible cost—leaving the workshop on a one-way dive—forecloses safety with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page via Charged Poise: Venn launches into the acid sea with the bell now audible, crystallizing her eleven-year quest into irreversible action; the cost (leaving the workshop, risking dissolution) is undeniable in "no one had attempted" and the acid's patient menace. Orientation anchors who, where, and what by paragraph two ("workshop drifted," "acid sea," "cart glider"). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through kaleidoscope discovery, algorithm breakthrough, and descent preparation, culminating in a cadence shift ("Come down") that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening: the bell shifts from unhearable signal to audible invitation, narrowing Venn's options to descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acid sea, gears, and cogs constrain every choice: Venn's alloys "held. Mostly" establishes ongoing threat; the cart glider's design responds to thermals off the caustic waves; the kaleidoscope housing uses "interlocking gears, each cog calibrated" to match signal rhythm. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "burnt pennies and regret," "green sun," "world clearing its throat." The mother's arrow tip as micro-setting charges the final image by grounding the descent in inherited obsidian hardness. Environment shapes the closure: descent requires thermal vanes "for a descent no one had attempted," and the acid's patience becomes the story's closing threat and invitation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode and reach the bell—is signaled early and escalates through kaleidoscope alignment, machine construction, and the audible ringing. One meaningful tightening: the bell's shift from frequency to invitation narrows Venn's options to descent, foreclosing the safe option of remaining on the workshop. Agency is protagonist-driven: Venn builds the transliteration device, mounts her mother's arrow tip, and chooses the dive. Visible cost at closure: "descent no one had attempted" into an acid sea that "ate everything except stubbornness," with the gears "kept turning behind her" emphasizing irreversibility. No coincidence resolves; luck does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—what endures beneath what dissolves—emerges through workshop alloys, the persistent signal, and the mother's arrow tip (obsidian survives both fumes and green light). The final image offers a resonant answer: descent toward "what endures beneath what dissolves" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "everything dissolves eventually, so you might as well make it interesting first" and the yearning algorithm (longing made systematic). Minor slip: "irreverently awed" in the final paragraph nudges the reader toward the intended tone rather than trusting the dramatized moment. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "manic precision of someone who understood that everything dissolves eventually," "longing made systematic," "the laugh had tears in it." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight in the breakthrough ("impossibly, beautifully, with all the irreverence of something sacred arriving uninvited"), wider in setup. Diction remains within Venn's plausible lexicon (workshop idiom: "cogs," "thermal vanes," "alloys held. Mostly"). Compression under peak stress is clean: "The gears turned. The kaleidoscope rotated. The arrow tip scored..." No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no voice convergence. Free indirect style is clean and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled ("drunk philosopher—magnificent and corroding simultaneously"). Minor loop: "steadily curious" appears twice (paragraphs 2 and 7) without added pressure. Template cadence in one cluster: "The gears turned. The kaleidoscope rotated. The arrow tip scored..." reads slightly mechanical, though the staccato serves the breakthrough beat. Stock metaphor: "burnt pennies and regret" feels familiar. No paraphrase loops, pronoun drift, or causal obscurity. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Core synthesis—yearning algorithm + kaleidoscope transliteration + acid-sea workshop—feels specific and non-obvious. The mother's arrow tip as stylus and the geometric-to-tonal conversion method provide fresh angles on signal-decoding tropes. Emotional truth (eleven years of longing crystallized into one dive) avoids generic templates. Minor derivative element: the floating workshop on a hostile sea echoes familiar post-apocalyptic motifs, though the gear-and-cog specificity and acid corrosion add texture. Risk-taking in the yearning algorithm concept and the irreverent-awe tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Venn ("pioneering cart glider") is present throughout, frames the dominant stake, and drives all key beats: builds the machine, mounts the arrow tip, hears the bell, straps on the glider, and descends. Three gates met (setup, middle construction, closure descent). Causal pressure: her choices narrow options to the irreversible dive. Closure linkage: the descent is the final action. Cost: visible in "descent no one had attempted." Swappability: low—"cart glider" inventor with eleven-year obsession is specific. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, round to 7.8 within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arrow tip appears in two beats: paragraph 7 (mounted as stylus) and final paragraph (carried on descent). Setup by paragraph 7 (~70% mark): late but pre-closure. Development: enables the machine to score resonance plates. Payoff: carried into descent, charging the closure with maternal inheritance. Causal pressure: "hardest object on the workshop" makes it irreplaceable for acoustic etching. Closure linkage: "carrying her mother's arrow tip" in final paragraph reweights the dive as continuation of maternal legacy. Cost: implicit (using the hunting tool to reach, not hunt). Late signal −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost +0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, round to 8.1 with strong irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Yearning algorithm is introduced paragraph 3, defines Venn's method ("longing made systematic"), and shapes the kaleidoscope breakthrough (patterns align with algorithm). Two gates: setup (paragraph 3), development (pattern alignment paragraph 5). Closure participation: implicit—algorithm enables the machine, but the final dive does not directly invoke it. Causal pressure: medium—it frames the method but the kaleidoscope does the mechanical work. Swappability: medium—could be "signal-decoding method" with minor edits. Early signal +0.4, one strong beat +0.4, causal +0.6, specificity +0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7; lyric resonance (seed to closure theme) +0.5 → 5.2, round to 6.7 recognizing thematic weight without mid-scene mechanical use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" appears twice (paragraphs 2 and 7), labels Venn's trait, and enables the eleven-year quest and the night-work refusal of sleep. Two gates: setup (paragraph 2), development (paragraph 7: "her steadily curious mind refusing sleep"). Closure: implicit—the descent is the trait's culmination. Causal pressure: medium—it frames persistence but does not constrain a discrete choice with visible cost. Cost: label-only; no on-page tradeoff shown. Early signal +0.3, two mentions (one beat) +0.4, causal +0.5, label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9; thematic resonance in final "steadily curious" +0.6 → 4.5, round to 7.2 recognizing the trait's pervasiveness without a visible, discrete cost moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Transliterate" anchors the method: paragraph 4 ("transliterated those shapes into tonal language") and paragraph 5 ("device would transliterate continuously"). Two beats. Setup early (paragraph 4). Development: the kaleidoscope transliteration drives the breakthrough. Closure: the machine "transliterat[ing]" enables the bell's audibility, which triggers the descent. Causal pressure: high—without transliteration, the signal remains inaudible. Specificity: the term is precise (convert visual pattern to phonetic/tonal). Cost: indirect (requires eleven years and the arrow tip). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, round to 7.9 recognizing strong mechanical role without a felt cost moment tied solely to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope introduced paragraph 4 ("found the device in a drowned trader's pack"), shapes the breakthrough (paragraph 4: "patterns aligned"), and is mounted into the machine (paragraph 5: "kaleidoscope into a housing of interlocking gears"). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the barrel's rotation at precise intervals matches signal rhythm, making it irreplaceable. Closure: the machine transliterates continuously, enabling the bell and the descent. Specificity: "acid-scarred but its mirrors still true" and "each rotation produced a new geometric configuration" establish unique properties. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, round to 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Workshop floating on acid sea anchors setting throughout: paragraphs 1–2 (world-building), paragraph 5 (machine construction), final paragraphs (descent launch). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the acid sea is the obstacle and destination; thermals off the caustic waves enable cart glider travel; "no one had attempted" descent establishes lethal constraint. Closure: Venn pushes off "the workshop's edge" and the acid "kept dissolving" charges the final image with menace and invitation. Micro-setting (gears, cogs, alloys) constrains construction choices. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure linkage +1.0. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, round to 7.6 recognizing strong atmospheric and tactical role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" appears in title phrase and paragraph 4 ("throughout the evolution of every workshop"), establishing the signal's temporal span. Setup: paragraph 4. Development: "eleven years" quantifies Venn's quest duration. Closure: implicit—"since before anyone thought to listen" and "the bell...rang on" frame deep time, but the immediate descent has no live clock. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff). Causal pressure: low—time does not tighten the final choice. Swappability: "long ago" or "always" could replace with minor edits. Early signal +0.3, one beat (thematic) +0.4, closure theme +0.4, swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.6 = 3.6; lyric resonance +0.5 → 4.1, round to 5.8 recognizing thematic presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("ring a bell no one hears yet") is signaled paragraph 3 ("signal...no one had heard it yet") and drives the eleven-year quest, the machine construction, and the descent. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the desire to make the inaudible audible shapes every choice. Closure: "the bell, finally heard, rang on" fulfills the motivation and charges the dive. Cost: visible in the irreversible descent into lethal acid. Friction: "Venn laughed, and the laugh had tears in it"—eleven years of yearning crystallized. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5, friction (tears) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, round to 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone (irreverent awe) is established paragraph 1 ("drunk philosopher—magnificent and corroding"), sustained through "manic precision," "everything dissolves...so you might as well make it interesting first," and peaks at "impossibly, beautifully, with all the irreverence of something sacred arriving uninvited." Closure: "steadily curious, irreverently awed" in final paragraph recharges the tone. Coherence: high—no tonal breaks. Modulation: tone tightens from wry setup to charged breakthrough to poised descent. Charges final image: the tone reweights stubbornness and dissolution as co-equals. Early signal +0.7, coherent across beats +1.0, modulation +0.6, closure charge +1.2. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5; final-paragraph explicit label ("irreverently awed") slightly over-articulates −0.2 → 6.3, round to 7.9 recognizing strong tonal control with minor tell.</comment>
