<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is richly embodied—"stoically sensitive about these losses, which is to say she felt them like burns but never flinched"—and the inkwell ritual conveys longing without label. Her final choice to write back to the builder is earned by the accumulated particulars of her work and isolation. Minor: colleagues are told rather than shown applying pressure, and the opening's "wrong side" framing borders on overstated setup, but these don't touch the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments of devotion accumulate across eleven notes until Maren's reply closes the circuit with legible cost (her answering a forty-year silence, sealing herself into the structure's decay). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. The wading sequence tightens spatially and emotionally toward the final note, and her act of writing back crystallizes her transformation from measurer to witness. Cost is visible: she sits wet to her shoulders, the drawbridge won't lower until morning, and she has committed herself to the pavilion's fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is tactile and specific: "ribcage of something that had once breathed music," algae-green roof, cracking concrete patches. The lake's cold climb up her thighs and the column resisting her fingers ground the action. The inkwell's brass-and-leather presence charges the final beat. The drawbridge rising and village sealing itself create spatial pressure that constrains her return, shaping the closure image of her sitting wet on the bank.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming "the archaeologist of abandoned dreams"—is signaled early and deepens through the sequence of found notes. The final note ("She never came to dance. But the music I imagined for her holds up the roof") escalates emotional pressure and narrows Maren's options to silence or reply. Her choice to write back forecloses her former stance as passive surveyor with visible cost: isolation, immersion, and the pavilion's continued erosion. One meaningful tightening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Love made legible by decay" emerges from concrete particulars: the builder's notes hidden in cracks, Maren's inkwell ritual, the structure sinking. The final image—two strangers' words "pressed together like palms in prayer, and the absence between them blazed quietly"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how we witness loss. No thematic statement intrudes; the ending reweights prior material (interlaced absence, the surveyor's composure) without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with Maren's perceptual signature: "light that seemed to smolder rather than shine," "concrete patches...splitting open like envelopes." Diction remains elevated but consistent ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence"). The prose modulates with pressure—short, tactile sentences during the wresting action, longer reflection at closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high ("She uncapped the inkwell, drew out her own pen, and on the back of the builder's note she wrote a single line"). The opening's "wrong side" and "nature of her work" carry minor scaffold weight, and "stoically sensitive...which is to say" over-explains slightly. The closure paragraph uses "absence" and "blazed" to strong effect without muddle. Sentence openings vary; no loops or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of surveyor-as-archaeologist, love letters hidden in foundation repairs, and the drowned dancehall feels specific and non-obvious. The builder's devotion to an absent dancer and Maren's reply across forty years avoid stock grief templates. The inkwell ritual and waders ground the premise in verifiable detail. Minor: the "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" phrase borders on abstract declaration, but the surrounding particulars transform it into lived desire rather than prompt echo.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's occupation as shore surveyor frames her access to the pavilion and her evolving stance. Her choice to wade out after the drawbridge rises and to write the reply note are key turns. The role is present early, shapes middle action (measuring erosion, discovering notes), and directly enables the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inkwell appears early as ritual ("filled it fresh each morning"), returns as a presence during the wading ("pressed against her hip like a heartbeat"), and is used on the page to write the reply. Three beats. The "warm in her hand from the heat of her body" adds charged specificity at closure, but the inkwell's unique properties (brass-and-leather, grandmother's estate) don't constrain tactics—any pen would suffice for the physical act of writing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is defined on the page ("the way the builder's presence was woven through gaps, visible only where things fell apart"), drives Maren's motivation ("This was what she wanted to become"), and structures the plot via the eleven hidden notes. The concept shapes her final choice: she answers absence with presence, sealing her note into the crack. The closure image ("absence between them blazed quietly") makes the concept indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is defined concretely ("felt them like burns but never flinched") and manifests in Maren's composure versus her ritual with the inkwell. It enables her endurance through three seasons of loss-measurement and constrains her expression (colleagues mistake her for indifferent). The trait is present in the closure choice—she writes a single restrained line rather than an effusive response—showing the cost of her stance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears at the story's peak physical and emotional beat: "She had to wrest the final note from a crack...worked her fingers into the gap until the fragment broke free with a sound like a small bone snapping." The verb's force and the "small bone snapping" simile make the action irreplaceable. The note she wrests contains the builder's climactic confession, triggering her reply. Swapping "wrest" for "extract" or "pull" would blunt the visceral cost and urgency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Placing notes in foundation repairs is discovered in autumn (setup), structures the middle sequence (eleven notes found across three seasons), and enables the closure action: Maren writes her reply and seals it "with waterproof putty she had brought for exactly this purpose." The method's mechanics matter—wax-sealed cavities preserve paper, concrete cracks allow access—and the putty detail shows premeditation. Two beats minimum; causal linkage to closure is tight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion pressures every choice: its erosion frames Maren's work, its cracks yield the notes, and its northeast column "most threatened by the season's erosion" forces tonight's urgency. The water's cold climb and submerged floor create physical resistance. The structure "groaning softly" and "sinking another imperceptible fraction" charge the final image. Removing the pavilion's specificity (drowned dancehall, visible columns, algae roof) would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drawbridge rising at half past seven traps Maren outside the village and establishes that she "would not lower until morning," shaping the closure image of her sitting wet on the bank. The timeframe creates isolation pressure and frames the night's window for action. However, elapsed time within the wading sequence is not tracked, and the "after" element is more spatial (outside the village) than temporal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire "to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is dramatized through Maren's ritual with the inkwell, her documentation of erosion, and her accumulation of the builder's notes. It is explicitly stated midpoint ("This was what she wanted to become"), then tested: she must choose between continuing to measure loss or answering it. Her reply note enacts the transformation with visible cost (immersion, isolation, sealing herself into the structure's fate). Friction between want (witness) and method (surveyor detachment) drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is embodied throughout: "light that seemed to smolder rather than shine," "water dimmed behind her," "absence...blazed quietly, a fire that needed no witness." Tone modulates from the muted opening (lanterns winking out, village sealing) to tactile urgency (wresting, water lapping at ribs) to the charged stillness of the closure. The oxymoron holds coherently and charges the final image without becoming static.</comment>
