<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Samara's frugality and observational acuity are consistently embodied through concrete choices (reed stylus, mended robes, patient waiting). Her final decision to accept the covenant is earned by the tile's decryption work and her established temperament of careful devotion. The internal progression from empirical skepticism to recognition of encoded faith feels motivated, though the moment of acceptance could carry more contradictory impulse or visible cost to reach higher bands. Minor: the characterization leans heavily on telling ("frugal by necessity and temperament") in the opening, but subsequent beats dramatize it well.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, holding through closure. Orientation anchors (Samara, palace antechamber, between-regimes window) arrive cleanly in paragraph one. The piece accumulates density through the tile's decryption, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Samara becomes the "second signatory" with conceptual cost legible in the covenant's two-millennia wait. The escalation reads as a pattern break—moving from observation to acceptance—that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length. Cost is felt in the phrase "some offers do not come twice," though a more concrete forfeiture on the page would sharpen it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The palace setting constrains choice: the between-regimes silence enables Samara's undisturbed study, and the tile's physical presence (cool glaze, kneeling position) charges the final tactile moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (amber light, nightjar call, dusky harmony) without tourist-catalog excess. The micro-setting (tile, antechamber floor) functions as the workspace that enables the decryption. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting's liminal state (open halls, absent authority) mirrors the thematic covenant with the unknown, though this operates more as atmospheric support than a hard constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decoding the tile and understanding its devotional intent, signaled early. The tightening occurs when Samara realizes the numerals encode a forgotten constellation, then deepens when she recognizes the covenant gesture and accepts her role as second signatory. Agency is clear: her choice to whisper the coordinates and place her hand on the tile forecloses the path of empirical distance with felt cost ("frugal enough to know that some offers do not come twice"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, building density through each interpretive layer. One visible micro-turn (mathematical → sacred → personal covenant) narrows options and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (devotion to pattern, covenant with the unknown) emerges organically from the tile's decryption and Samara's empirical temperament without meta-commentary. The final image—hand on tile, whispered coordinates—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of faith and precision co-existing. "Empirically ironic: the most rational object in the palace turned out to be the most sacred" encodes the theme through action and discovery rather than assertion. The clasped-hands constellation and two-millennia wait charge the ending with conceptual cost. Subtext operates cleanly in the contrast between frugality and the immeasurable offering. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with psychic distance modulating purposefully (closer during decryption, pulling back for contextual framing). Perceptual signature is consistent: Samara notices what "lavish men overlooked," filters setting through her astronomer's precision, and her diction blends technical clarity with lyric cadence ("thread-maps of a decade's careful poverty," "dusky harmony"). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm shifts with emotional intensity (shorter, declarative beats at the covenant moment). Filter verbs ("she thought," "she understood") are voice-motivated and unobtrusive. Narrative certainty matches Samara's expertise; her inferences read as grounded observation. One brief register lift ("empirically ironic") fits the academic POV without jarring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance discovery, setting, or interiority. Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing lines. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("thread-maps," "seal a path across the sky"). Minor slips: "She was frugal by necessity and temperament" opens with summary telling; "It was, she thought, empirically ironic" slightly over-explains a strong insight. A few filter-verb clusters ("she realized," "she understood," "she had finally been able") in the middle third dull immediacy without harming closure. Sentence openings vary well. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Spatial and temporal sequencing is clear. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient devotion encrypted in a magic square, discovered by a frugal astronomer during a power vacuum, feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of a mathematical object into a two-millennia covenant is earned through concrete detail (cuneiform coordinates, clasped-hands constellation). The premise avoids template plotting, though the "scholar decodes ancient mystery" frame is familiar; the piece elevates it through Samara's frugality shaping her interpretive lens and the resonant image of signing a millennial-old document. Emotional specificity (quiet certainty, careful poverty) grounds the closure. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk-taking in the lyric, almost liturgical final beat heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Samara (frugal astronomer) is present from paragraph one and drives all major beats: her careful observation identifies the tile's significance, her decryption work (spreading schematics, translating numerals to celestial geometry) creates the turn, and her final choice to accept the covenant and whisper the coordinates constitutes the closure action. Her frugality is not merely label but a demonstrated trait shaping her methods (reed stylus, patient waiting, mended robes) and her interpretive stance ("frugal with belief as much as with coin"). The character's decisions alter tactics and meaning across three beats (discovery, decryption, acceptance) with visible cost in the final forfeiture of empirical distance. Setup early, developed through middle work, and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears in paragraph two, is handled physically (Samara kneels beside it, places her hand on it), and returns with reweighted meaning across four beats: dismissed as decorative, recognized as devotional, decoded as stellar coordinates, and finally accepted as a covenant document. Its teal-and-ocher glaze, cool smoothness, and sixteen-cell structure constrain the decryption method and charge the tactile closure moment. Removing the tile would collapse the story's logic entirely. The object is causally indispensable, irreplaceable, and carries the conceptual cost of the two-millennia wait. Setup early, developed across middle beats, and decisive at closure with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion (core concept) is stated explicitly in paragraph four ("Someone had encrypted devotion into arithmetic, hiding a prayer inside a proof") and shapes Samara's interpretive arc: the tile is not merely mathematical but devotional, requiring decryption that changes her stance from empirical skepticism to covenant acceptance. The concept drives two beats (recognition of the hidden prayer, acceptance of the covenant) and contributes to the closure's thematic charge. However, much of its work is thematic resonance rather than on-page choice constraint; the concept is more discovered and reflected upon than used to narrow tactical options under pressure. Setup in first third, developed in middle, present at closure but somewhat abstract in its operational pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" (attribute) is named once in paragraph four ("It was, she thought, empirically ironic: the most rational object in the palace turned out to be the most sacred") and encapsulates the story's central tension between precision and faith. The trait colors Samara's perspective and the thematic question but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost; it functions more as thematic shorthand than a decision-shaping attribute. The irony is illustrated through the tile's dual nature rather than through a choice Samara must make because of this trait. Present in middle third, thematically resonant, but operationally passive. Swappable with "paradoxically faithful" or similar without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Uncloak" (action) is stated explicitly ("Now she worked to uncloak the rest") and drives the middle sequence: Samara spreads schematics, translates numerals into celestial geometry, and reveals the forgotten constellation. This decryption work creates the key turn from observation to understanding and enables the covenant acceptance at closure. The action is causally necessary—without it, the tile remains decorative and the covenant inaccessible. However, "uncloak" could be replaced with "decode" or "decipher" without major loss; the verb itself is less indispensable than the decryption process it names. Setup early, developed through middle beats, essential to closure logic but moderately specific as phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" (method) appears in paragraph five: Samara uses "sheets of pressed reed paper covered in star charts, coordinate grids, and angular measurements" to translate the tile's numbers into celestial geometry. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—she maps values onto the heavens, revealing the clasped-hands constellation. The process enables the discovery turn. However, the method's specifics (why schematics versus direct observation or mental calculation) are not deeply constraining; the piece could function with "careful calculation" with minor edits. Present in middle third, functional in one key beat, contributes to closure but moderately replaceable in exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace (reimagined, between regimes) is established in paragraph one and provides essential conditions: the open, silent halls enable Samara's undisturbed study; the throne room antechamber holds the tile; the liminal political state (last governor fled, next not arrived) creates the freedom for her work. The setting's three reimaginings and the ziggurat's enduring "bones" mirror the tile's ancient persistence. The hanging gardens and high windows supply sensory atmosphere that charges the dusky-harmony closure. The setting constraints are meaningful but indirect—absence of authority rather than active pressure. Setup early, present across beats, contributes to closure atmosphere, but the palace could be replaced with another transitional site with moderate edits. High functional integration, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Between regimes" (timeframe) is signaled in paragraph one and enables the plot: "between regimes—the last governor fled, the next not yet arrived—the halls stood open to dust and starlight, and Samara finally had the silence she needed." This transitional window creates the opportunity for undisturbed study and mirrors the thematic liminality (between known and unknown, day and dark). The timeframe tightens the stakes implicitly—Samara must work now, during this freedom. However, the time pressure is not sharply dramatized; no ticking clock or imminent regime arrival forces faster moves. Present at setup, functional in enabling the plot, contributes to thematic resonance, but the urgency is more atmospheric than tactical. Moderately essential, could be replaced with "during a festival" or similar quiet window with some loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to seal a covenant with the unknown is dramatized through Samara's progression: she decodes the tile, recognizes the covenant gesture, understands the creator's desire for agreement with the universe's patterns, and chooses to become the second signatory by whispering coordinates and placing her hand on the tile. The motivation is conflicted—Samara has been "frugal with belief," trusting only instruments, yet here accepts "confirmation of a different kind" with the cost of abandoning pure empiricism. The desire drives the closure action and forecloses the path of detached observation. Setup in first third (her need for silence, her careful poverty), developed through decryption, and decisive at closure with visible cost in her acceptance and the line "some offers do not come twice." High causal integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" (tone) is named explicitly in paragraph seven ("The dusky harmony of the hour settled into her chest—the world balanced between day and dark") and coheres across the piece: the between-regimes liminality, the amber light and nightjar call, the quiet certainty of the ending. Tone modulates purposefully, shifting from frugal precision in early paragraphs to lyric reverence in the closure ("indifferent and precise," "quiet certainty"). The tone charges the final image, supporting the covenant's solemnity without melodrama. However, "dusky harmony" as exact phrasing is somewhat ornamental; the tonal effect could be achieved with "twilight calm" or similar. Present across beats, modulates with pressure, contributes to closure atmosphere, but the specific phrase is moderately replaceable. High coherence, moderate phrasal irreplaceability.</comment>
