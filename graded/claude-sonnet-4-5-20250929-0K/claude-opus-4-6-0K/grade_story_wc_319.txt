<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's embodied transformation—spine curved, fingers blackened, nostrils flaring—grounds her feral state in concrete physical detail. Her interior contradiction (dimensional homesickness as "a second heartbeat" versus her choice to remain) operates simultaneously throughout, particularly in the pendant scene where she "interiorizes" the object before renouncing its promise. The final choice to leave the pendant visible and "wait" is earned by the accumulation of her守护 practice and dimensional longing, foreclosing escape with visible cost. Minor deduction: the epiphany about "sitting itself was a kind of home" edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization, though it remains anchored in the concrete pendant-pressing gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: the piece layers sensory density (mist, frost, frozen garden) and philosophical weight until the pendant discovery forces a crystallization. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who: guardian; where: frozen garden; when: indeterminate but signaled as mythic time). The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she places the pendant on the fountain and chooses to wait, foreclosing escape with the felt cost of continued dimensional homesickness made explicit in "the homesickness did not vanish. It became a room she could furnish." One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendant's coordinates shift her understanding from "guarding without locks" to "sitting itself was a kind of home." Cost is legible and the lens remains stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden constrains every choice: the sealed fountain becomes the pendant's resting place, the mist's gradient teaches her "interiorizing exteriors," and the topiary/statuary create a permeable perimeter she embodies. Micro-setting excels—her body (spine, fingers, nostrils) functions as setting, and the pendant against her sternum becomes a spatial-conceptual anchor. The final image charges when the pendant hangs "like a second moon in the gray air," reconfiguring the garden as a zone of patient choice rather than mere imprisonment. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: cold, mist-texture, and scent dominate over visual clarity, matching her feral transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remain and guard versus escape home) is signaled early and tightens when the pendant offers coordinates "adjacent" to her dimension. The pendant discovery forces one meaningful deepening: she recognizes she can leave, presses it to her sternum (a micro-choice that interiorizes the option), then renounces it by placing it visibly for the next cultist—a trade-off with visible cost (continued homesickness, continued waiting). Agency is renunciation with on-page cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: waiting as "primary technology" becomes the practiced stance that allows her to sit with uncertainty rather than flee. No secondary antagonist required; the pendant and dimensional homesickness supply sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—making friends with uncertainty—emerges from the concrete practice of waiting, interiorizing the garden's fog, and the pendant's charged placement. The final image (pendant as "second moon") offers a non-literal answer: uncertainty becomes furnishable space rather than solved problem. "The sitting itself was a kind of home" skirts articulation but is earned by the prior embodied sequence (finding, holding, pressing, placing). Subtext operates in the pendant's "symbols that made her teeth ache with recognition"—cultists are "always wrong about the syllables but occasionally right about the doors"—implying her own displacement may have involved such errors. No thematic Echo; the piece resists moralizing and allows the homesickness to persist as "a room she could furnish" without resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "scents that carried information the way books once did," "light had boundaries that you could touch," and "interiorizing exteriors" create a consistent alien-exile lens. Psychic distance stays close-third throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated: "liminal smear," "patient erosion of everything that is not waiting," "foggy lucidity" all cohere as the guardian's particular way of parsing her exile. Minor density concern: some figurative clusters ("question mark," "feral the way a theorem is feral") feel slightly overwritten in paragraph one, though they serve voice and do not obscure clarity. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do double duty (e.g., "She had learned to survive this by interiorizing exteriors" advances both method and mindset). Rhythm modulates well—long, layered sentences in reflective beats, shorter ones at the pendant discovery. Two minor issues: "dimensionally homesick in a way that lived beneath her ribs like a second heartbeat" and "the homesickness did not vanish. It became a room she could furnish" feel like adjacent restatements of the same idea with slight synonym drift. Template-cadence check: "She waited" / "Waiting was her primary technology" / "She waited, and the waiting was enough" forms a purposeful frame rather than a loop, so no penalty. No major scaffold or clarity breaks; propulsion remains steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of feral-guardian + dimensional exile + light-as-geometry offers a fresh angle on the "exile chooses duty" template. The specificity—light with three boundaries, waiting as erosion, interiorizing exteriors as survival method—transforms the premise beyond stock fantasy-guardian tropes. The pendant's role (cultist artifact that she declines and displays rather than destroys or uses) subverts expected conflict. Risk: the heavily lyric, reflection-dense mode with minimal external action could alienate readers expecting plot momentum, but the piece commits fully and the closure image (pendant as second moon) feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous lines detected; the "feral the way a theorem is feral" metaphor is original and voice-specific.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: established paragraph one. Development: her waiting practice shapes her response to the pendant. Payoff: she chooses to place the pendant visibly and continue waiting—a decision that redefines her guardianship from passive duty to active renunciation. Beat involvement: at least three (intro as feral, pendant discovery/pressing, pendant placement). Causal pressure: her choice to "let the next cultist come and find it" is enabled by her prior interiorizing practice and forecloses escape with visible cost (continued homesickness). Irreplaceable: the story hinges on her specific feral-but-theorem-like agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced mid-story ("Today something new rested in the frost"). Development: she examines it, recognizes coordinates, presses it to her sternum (interiorizing it), then renounces its use. Payoff: placed on the frozen fountain arc "like a second moon," charging the final image. Beat involvement: discovery, examination/pressing, placement (three beats). Causal pressure: the pendant forces the guardian to choose between escape and duty, and her placement of it for the next cultist crystallizes her Earned Stasis. Closure linkage strong. Slight deduction for late first appearance (after first third), but transformation and closure participation are undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "boundaries of light" introduced early ("light had boundaries that you could touch"). Development: her dimensional homesickness centers on "geometries this world's light could not render" and "light had boundaries...walls of luminance." Payoff: the pendant offers coordinates to "somewhere the light might have three boundaries instead of this world's formless two," and she declines. Causal pressure: the wrong angles/soft boundaries motivate her homesickness, and the pendant's promise hinges on restoring proper light-geometry. Closure linkage: the final image ("soft, negotiable edge where light became something else entirely") reweights the concept. Solid integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "dimensionally homesick in a way that lived beneath her ribs like a second heartbeat" early. Development: the ache for "geometries this world's light could not render" explains her feral transformation and interiorizing practice. Payoff: "The homesickness did not vanish. It became a room she could furnish." Causal pressure: homesickness is the dominant emotional cost that makes her pendant-refusal meaningful; without it, waiting is mere duty rather than sacrifice. Visible tradeoff: she accepts continued dimensional exile with its persistent ache. Beat involvement: intro, pendant examination, closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "She waited" (paragraph break after garden description). Development: "Waiting was her primary technology, her deepest craft...the patient erosion of everything that is not waiting." Payoff: "She waited, and the waiting was enough." Causal pressure: waiting defines her guardianship method, shapes her response to the pendant (sitting with uncertainty rather than acting impulsively), and structures the closure as Earned Stasis. Beat involvement: at least four (intro wait, technology description, pendant deliberation, final wait). Irreplaceable: swapping "wait" for "guard" or "watch" would lose the piece's central paradox (active patience as technology). Closure charge is total.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "She had learned to survive this by interiorizing exteriors—taking the garden's fog into her lungs, the cold into her marrow, the silence into the space between her thoughts." Development: when she finds the pendant, she "pressed the pendant against her sternum, feeling its cold become her cold, interiorizing this exterior too." Payoff: the method allows her to integrate the pendant's promise without acting on it, then externalize it again by placement. Causal pressure: interiorizing is her survival technology and enables the closure choice. Beat involvement: two explicit (survival description, pendant-pressing). Slight deduction: the method is more described than shown constraining earlier choices, but it clearly shapes the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: frozen garden detailed in paragraph two. Development: "the fountain's arc of water had become a glass bridge to nowhere" supplies the final resting place for the pendant; the sealed library doors and topiary establish the perimeter she embodies. Payoff: "She placed the pendant on the fountain's frozen arc, where it hung like a second moon in the gray air." Causal pressure: the frozen, mist-blurred environment teaches her to blur self/world boundaries, and the fountain's glass arc becomes the charged platform for her renunciation. Spatial choreography clean. Micro-setting (her body as perimeter) also functions. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "Time here moved through the veil of sleep, that liminal smear where minutes taste like hours and hours dissolve into the moisture on your tongue." Development: the indeterminate timeframe ("three seasons or three centuries") establishes mythic patience rather than urgency. Payoff: time remains untracked at closure, supporting the "waiting is enough" Earned Stasis. Lyric reprise: time as liminal/dreamlike returns in "foggy lucidity." Swappability concern: removing specific temporal markers would not significantly alter tactics or closure. The vague time supports theme but does not constrain choices the way a ticking clock would. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: not explicitly stated early, but the guardian's practice of "patient erosion" and "interiorizing exteriors" implies a stance toward ambiguity. Development: the pendant forces her to "sit with the pendant's promise and the library's need and the mist's refusal to clarify." Payoff: "to make friends with uncertainty was not to resolve it...the sitting itself was a kind of home." Friction: the articulation of the motivation is more told than shown until the pendant scene dramatizes it. Causal pressure: her choice to leave the pendant visible for the next cultist enacts the motivation. Closure linkage strong. Deduction for articulation edging toward label-speak, though grounded in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: "foggy lucidity" appears in the final paragraph, but the tone is established early through mist imagery, liminal time, and the blurred self/world boundary. Development: tone modulates from reflective density (long paragraphs on dimensional homesickness) to concrete urgency (pendant discovery) back to reflective closure. Payoff: "She waited, and the waiting was enough" within "the foggy lucidity of a mind that had stopped demanding answers from the mist." Coherence strong; the oxymoron (foggy + lucidity) captures the simultaneous clarity and ambiguity of her final stance. Tone charges the final image by sustaining the mist/clarity paradox through the ending beat.</comment>
