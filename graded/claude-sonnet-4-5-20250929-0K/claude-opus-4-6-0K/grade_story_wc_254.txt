<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is established early and her "aesthetically driven" nature shapes the inciting choice to enter the atrium. Interior texture is vivid ("the humming in her bones go quiet like a colonnade buried in snow"), and embodied emotion appears in the weeping scene. However, her arc lacks meaningful internal contradiction or struggle—she enters, works, succeeds, weeps—without visible cost or a path foreclosed by her choice, reading more as fulfillment than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear early (frozen lake, cobalt atrium, post-ban timeframe). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Maren crosses the threshold, engages the quartz hum, paraphrases silence, and the atrium deepens in response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (boundary dissolved, threshold crossed), but cost remains abstract—"relief of a boundary dissolved" is stated, not dramatized through a specific forfeiture or changed option. The final line asserts wholeness rather than showing what Maren sacrificed or can no longer retrieve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and humming quartz colonnade are rendered with sensory specificity and constrain Maren's approach (she must cross the frozen lake at dusk, press her palm to the pillar). The "lantern-moth hush" and refracted light create a coherent atmosphere. The quartz hum recurs across beats and charges the final image when "the colonnade sang louder," fulfilling the micro-setting-as-constraint test for high-7 eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to paraphrase the sacred silence and prove boundaries are thresholds—is signaled early and sustained. Maren's entry and act of speaking constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, no live option is foreclosed and no visible price paid: she weeps from relief, the world remains whole, and the elders' warning goes untested on the page. Escalation is minimal; the atrium's response (singing louder, hush deepening) is cooperative, not resistant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries as thresholds, the ethics of paraphrase, silence honored by naming—emerges organically from the quartz pillars, the ban, and Maren's gift. The final image offers a resonant answer: "the world was no less whole for having been spoken." No overt moralizing. The piece resists binaries and invites reflection. However, "tremor of certainty" and "lantern-moth hush" risk becoming decorative rather than earning their conceptual weight through visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and distinct: "cobalt atrium rose… like a cathedral made of twilight," "hummed the way grief hums in the body after the crying stops." POV remains stable third-limited. Diction stays elevated but consistent with the narrator's poetic register. Some filter verbs appear ("felt the resonance travel," "felt the humming") but remain voice-motivated. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (cloud-shadow metaphor, ice/water memory) are taught early and sustained through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences carry vivid images. Information density is high in the opening third. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: "the boundary between… the boundary between… the boundary between" in one passage restates the dissolving-boundaries concept without added pressure. "Tremor of certainty" is elaborated with near-synonyms ("seismic, involuntary, the body's deep recognition") that risk synonym churn. The closure paragraph stacks metaphors (ice remembers water, walls hold sky, stone speaks) in rapid succession, bordering on density overload without clear propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of poet-as-translator, forbidden art, and the physical space (humming quartz, cobalt walls) is specific and non-generic. The "cloud-shadow poet" framing and "paraphrase as holy work" offer a fresh angle. However, the arc—artist defies ban, performs act, experiences catharsis—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction or unexpected cost. The final assertion ("the world was no less whole") feels convenient rather than earned through on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren (cloud-shadow poet) drives the decision to enter the atrium and perform the paraphrase act. She appears in all three gates: setup (crossing the lake), development (engaging the pillars), and payoff (speaking the silence). Her poet identity constrains the method (paraphrase) and charges the final act. However, her choices are uncontested—no friction tests her commitment—and the cost of her action is stated rather than dramatized, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade appears in setup (entrance description), development (Maren presses her palm, feels resonance), and payoff (the colonnade sings louder at the end). It constrains her approach (she must engage it to access the atrium's deeper hum) and reappears with reweighted meaning when it "sang louder" in response to her paraphrase. Specific properties (rose-white, vibrating below hearing) matter. Strong integration across all three gates and closure linkage justify mid-7 placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" is named and elaborated mid-story ("seismic, involuntary, the body's deep recognition") but does not shape tactics or constrain choices. It is felt by Maren but does not alter her course or reveal a cost. The concept functions more as thematic claim than causal force, appearing once in the middle third without payoff at closure. Functional mention but no causal leverage places it in the replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is established early ("she could not resist a thing that called to her sense of beauty, even when beauty wore the face of danger") and enables the inciting choice to enter the atrium. It constrains her path—beauty overrides prudence—and appears in setup and middle. However, the trait does not produce visible friction or tradeoff at closure; her aesthetic compulsion is rewarded without cost. Present in two gates with mild causal weight, eligible for low-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" is the protagonist's core gift, defined early ("render the unspeakable into words… close enough to make the listener weep"), and the climactic act is her paraphrasing the silence. It appears in setup (her banned work), middle (she "began to work through dissolving boundaries"), and payoff ("She opened her mouth and paraphrased the silence"). The act drives the final turn. However, swapping "translate" or "render" would not break the logic, and the mechanics remain abstract, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" is named explicitly mid-story ("she began to work through dissolving boundaries") and shapes the method of her act. It appears in middle and payoff (the boundary between silence and words is dissolved at the end). However, the mechanics are abstract—how one dissolves a boundary is not dramatized with specific steps or tools—and the method could be replaced with "transcending" or "crossing" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by the frozen lake anchors all three gates: Maren crosses the lake to reach it (setup), engages its interior space and quartz pillars (middle), and the atrium "filled with that lantern-moth hush deepened into something luminous" at closure. The setting constrains approach (she must cross the ice), supplies the quartz resource, and the atrium's response charges the final image. Specific properties (cobalt walls refract light, stone floor between pillars) matter. Strong integration and closure participation justify mid-7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" frames the inciting moment and permits Maren's entry, appearing in setup. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—there is no urgency, no competing deadline, no consequence for delay. The three-year wait is mentioned but does not pressure the present action. The element enables the story but does not escalate it, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is stated as Maren's motivation early and drives her choice to enter the atrium. It appears in setup and payoff (she crosses the threshold and dissolves the boundary at the end). However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized—no on-page moment shows her weighing the elders' warning against her desire, and the act encounters no friction. Present in two gates with mild causal weight, eligible for low-6 band but capped by lack of visible conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" is introduced early as the atrium's atmosphere, recurs in the middle ("that lantern-moth hush—that particular quality of stillness"), and deepens at closure ("the lantern-moth hush deepened into something luminous"). Tone is coherent and modulates with the stakes (from quiet entry to charged culmination). The specific image constrains perception and charges the final beat. Strong reprise and closure linkage place it in the mid-6 band; slight abstraction (the metaphor is vivid but its causal role is atmospheric rather than tactical) prevents higher placement.</comment>
