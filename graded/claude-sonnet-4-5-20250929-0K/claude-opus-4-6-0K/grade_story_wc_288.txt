<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior evolution from exile to independence is scaffolded clearly through micro-choices (reorganizing the library, building rope bridges, calibrating the sundial). Her contradictory impulses—survivor versus cartographer, keeper versus explorer—operate simultaneously in the middle beats. The final stance crystallization ("She was alone. She was not lonely.") feels earned by the prior layering of selves, but the embodied cost remains abstract: we see her documenting and mapping but never glimpse a specific price paid or path foreclosed on the page. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic self-awareness ("translate isolation into independence") that flattens urgency at peaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint: memories surface and dissolve, the sundial captures them, and Maren's stance deepens through density increase rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren accepts solitude with visible ritual work (catching fragments in brass each morning) and the final image reweights her eleven-year exile as chosen independence. Cost is implied in "brittle awakenings, one after another, each leaving less behind" and the ongoing threat of dissolution, though a sharper on-page sacrifice would elevate the band. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal library constrains Maren's movements (shelves surface and submerge, rope bridges built to navigate currents) and the stone circle's hum at solstice functions as a recurring environmental pressure that unlocks memories. The brass sundial's atomically reflective surface is handled multiple times (angled toward light, carried to the circle, used to trace sketches) and charges the final routine. Spatial choreography remains clear across the floating structure. The setting reads purposeful rather than decorative, though the clouds-above framework stays atmospheric without pressing a tactical choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's struggle to preserve dissolving reincarnation memories and redefine her solitude—is signaled early and tightens through her ritual documentation with the sundial. One meaningful deepening occurs: the shift from understanding her position as "exile" to "independence," with visible micro-costs (rope bridges built, tidal patterns mapped, sundial calibrated). The final image crystallizes her stance with undeniable pressure ("another brittle awakening...caught it in brass before it disappeared"), though the escalation remains textural rather than decisional. No antagonist or external opposition tests her resolve on the page, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—solitude versus loneliness, memory as archive, coexistence with layered selves—emerges through concrete action (sundial work, rope-building, mapping tides) rather than declaration. The brass sundial and stone circle hum function as motifs that constrain choice and accumulate pressure. The final image ("in the company of everything she had ever been") reweights the opening exile without stating a moral, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Minor slip: "translate isolation into independence" reads slightly thesis-like in the middle beats, though it's anchored in on-page actions. The thematic question lands cleanly under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maren notices tidal rhythms, basalt textures, the exact pitch of extinct calls. Diction matches her role (keeper, cartographer) without register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter beats during memory dissolution, longer accumulative structures during mapping work. One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening ("had lived," "had been") dulls immediacy slightly, but the prose breathes naturally under stress and the voice remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character stance, memory work, or environmental detail without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph structure creates visual cadence. Two artifacts lower the score slightly: "The memory was sharp enough to cut" and "brittle awakenings" repeat the brittleness metaphor across adjacent beats without added pressure (paraphrase-loop, −0.2), and the phrase "The sundial became her archive" reads as summary-tell when the prior beat already shows the action (−0.2). No template cadence or register drift at closure. Overall propulsion remains strong with minor scaffold present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal library premise and reincarnation-memory framework combine freshly, grounded in specific sensory detail (stone circle hum, atomically reflective brass, great auk's eye). The turn from exile to independence feels earned rather than imposed. However, the emotional arc—solitary figure learns to embrace solitude through archival work—echoes a familiar template (curator-as-survivor), and the specific lived detail that would transform it (What does Maren lose by choosing this archive? What caller does she ignore?) remains off the page. The synthesis is coherent and particular but does not take a bold structural or moral risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "contemporary of extinct species" memory frames the opening inciting beat and returns in the final paragraph ("everything she had ever been"), creating a purposeful seed-to-reprise structure. However, this past self does not make on-page decisions; Maren-as-keeper makes all present choices. The memory supplies emotional pressure (loss, theft) but does not constrain a present tactic with cost. Two beats (memory unlock, sketching extinct creatures) plus closure presence allow mid-band placement, but the character remains observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the restricted tide pool, angled toward dawn light to capture memories, and carried to the stone circle each morning for the final ritual. Its atomically reflective surface enables Maren's archival work (sketching from frozen images) and charges the ending image ("caught it in brass before it disappeared"). Early signal, functional middle use, and closure linkage meet all three gates. The sundial's unique properties (reflection that captures rather than merely mirrors) constrain her method, pushing it into the 7+ band. It stops short of indispensability because the story logic could survive with a similar recording device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" is named in the title position and dramatized on the page: memories surface and dissolve by noon, forcing Maren to document them each morning. The concept shapes her tactics (dawn rituals with the sundial, notebook sketches) and charges the final image ("another brittle awakening...caught it in brass"). It constrains her choices with visible cost (fragments threaten to vanish unless captured). Early signal, middle development, and closure participation meet all three gates, and the specificity of "brittle" (ice on warm water, crumbling details) makes the concept difficult to swap. Scores in the solid 6+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "atomically reflective" trait is labeled in one beat ("polished to a precision") and enables the sundial's function (capturing memory images rather than simply reflecting light). This attribute allows Maren to trace sketches and freeze moments. However, the trait is described rather than tested with visible tradeoff or cost—does the precision require specific angles, rare light, or physical toll? The mechanics remain abstract. Present in middle and closure but without on-page friction, it trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Coexist" appears explicitly in the final third ("learned to coexist with every version of herself") and is dramatized through Maren's acceptance of layered identities (woman with auks, silent keeper, cartographer). This internal stance shift drives the thematic resolution and charges the ending image. However, the action itself—coexisting—is largely reflective rather than a concrete choice that narrows options or imposes cost in a prior beat. Closure participation and thematic resonance allow solid mid-band placement, but late first appearance and low causal pressure cap the score near 6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stone circle hum is introduced early ("twelve basalt monoliths...older than the building itself"), triggers the inciting beat (unlocking reincarnation memory at solstice), and recurs in Maren's morning ritual ("carried it to the stone circle and waited for the hum"). The hum's mechanics—vibration below hearing that loosens memories—shape her tactics (timing rituals to peak atmospheric tides). Present in setup, middle, and closure image ("The stone circle hummed on"), and the method's specificity (frequency, solstice peak) makes it difficult to swap. Strong integration across all three gates pushes it toward the upper 6-band or low 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal library constrains Maren's movement (shelves rise and fall, rope bridges built to navigate currents) and supplies the restricted tide pool where she finds the sundial. Its floating-above-clouds isolation frames the dominant stake (exile versus independence). Maren maps tidal patterns to predict surfacing sections, a tactical choice that alters her agency. Present in setup, middle (rope-building, mapping), and closure image (shelves shifting, clouds churning), and the setting's unique logic (tidal rhythms, atmospheric currents) is irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage elevate it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the reincarnation memory" is signaled in the opening line ("After the reincarnation memory, everything changed") and structures the story's present action (eleven years alone, then memory breakthrough, then weeks of documentation). However, the time pressure remains abstract: memories dissolve "by noon" and "each morning" Maren repeats the ritual, but no urgent countdown or tracked decay alters a specific tactic or forecloses a path on the page. Setup and closure participation meet two gates, and the timeframe reweights her past versus present, but without a live clock that tightens decisions, it trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is dramatized through concrete choices: reorganizing the library, building rope bridges, calibrating the sundial, mapping tidal patterns. The desire is signaled by the midpoint and drives the final stance shift. Friction between exile (pressed "like deep water") and chosen solitude (cartographer, territory-knower) creates internal conflict. The motivation shapes at least two beats (reorganization, final ritual) and charges the closure image. Cost is visible in the ongoing brittle awakenings and the work required to preserve fragments. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure allows entry into the 7+ band.</comment>
