<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly rooted in devotion to order and reverence for meaning, embodied in her meticulous catalog work. Her internal state is consistently particular—"precision was a form of prayer"—and the nine-day climb plus the final descent demonstrate physical commitment with cost. The piece avoids therapy-speak and maintains embodied emotion (burning fingers, vapor breath). Minor limitation: the protagonist's interior contradictions are muted; her devotion is unwavering without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through the frozen library's sensory pressure, the sampler's methodical work, and the resonant match that reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—the matched vow proves meaning can survive forgetting, and Elara's descent with proof forecloses doubt with felt cost (the nine-day climb, the labor, the solitary burden). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chime cuts through silence, shifting from abstract search to tangible proof. The cost is visible: her journey, her isolation, and the fact that she "did not need to" know whose vow it was—acceptance of incomplete knowledge is itself a price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "quartz hush," "crystallized parchment," "vaulted ceiling lost in frost," and the ladder's rungs that burn her fingers. Spatial choreography is coherent (central lectern, eastern wall, high shelf). The environment constrains choice—shelves going opaque create urgency, the altitude and cold embody the stakes, and the nine-day climb frames the expedition's cost. The frequency sampler functions as tool-as-setting, and the final matched page's translucence charges the closure image. Sensory selection reflects urgency: vision dominates during the search, then touch (burning fingers) at the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove one promise survived the Dissolution. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through repeated failures ("shelf after shelf returned silence") until the sampler chimes—a clear tightening that narrows options to one viable match. Agency is embodied in Elara's methodical search and the physical climb to retrieve the page. The cost is legible: nine days ascending, solitary labor, and the acceptance that she will never know whose vow it was. One meaningful deepening occurs when the corona flares and steadies, reweighting the abstract quest into tangible proof. Coincidence does not resolve; the match is earned by her systematic method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—meaning's survival beyond forgetting—emerges from concrete action (the frequency match, the translucent page) rather than assertion. The magic lantern slide's corona "flared, then steadied, then softened into something warm" offers a non-literal answer: promises endure through resonance, not recognition. Subtext operates in "gently, meticulously, luminously intact"—the adverbs mirror Elara's character, making form and content inseparable. The story resists moralizing; the ending reweights the premise without stating a lesson. The luminous vow concept integrates fully with theme, and the piece invites reflection on what "real" means when divorced from known authorship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent—"quartz hush," "frequency sampler," "thermal trace"—and matches the archival setting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the climb and search, pulling back slightly for the descent. The prose has distinct texture: "She cataloged. She cross-referenced." Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer lyric passages). Free indirect style is clean. Minor limitation: the register occasionally drifts into slightly generic lyric mode ("as though the building itself remembered a sun it had outlived") that, while beautiful, edges toward ornamental in one or two moments. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual and emotional breath. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is controlled: "thread of vapor that hung in the air like punctuation," "bell struck underwater." No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Grammar and punctuation are clean. Minor deduction: a few phrases approach stock lyricism without full transformation ("thinning atmosphere," "thermal trace before cooling into nothing"), and "the fact of its existence" in paragraph four reads slightly generic. Overwriting is minimal and does not touch closure. No artifacts obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—frozen library of vows measured by frequency—is specific and non-obvious. The Dissolution (promises unbinding from meaning) transforms familiar "magic fading" tropes through the particular mechanic of vibrational signatures. Elara's motivation (reverence, not heroism) avoids stock archivist tropes. The resolution is earned: the matched frequency validates the method introduced early. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat. Minor limitation: the "quiet catastrophe" frame and "edge of oblivion" phrasing echo other speculative fictions; the transformation is solid but not radical. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara, orderly records chief, is introduced in paragraph two and her role shapes every beat: her meticulous nature drives the methodical search, her archival expertise enables the frequency-matching plan, and her choice to climb and descend bookends the story with physical cost. Her decision to use the sampler and to retrieve the matched page are key turns. The attribute "gently meticulous" is not ornamental—it defines her tactics and earns the closure's resonance. Present in setup, middle (search), and payoff (descent with proof). Causal pressure is high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in paragraph five (setup), is slotted into the sampler in paragraph seven (middle action), and its corona flares in the penultimate paragraph (payoff). It is handled on the page in multiple beats: lifted from the bone case, inserted into the aperture, held beside the crystal page. The slide's luminous vow property is unique and irreplaceable—without it, the frequency match cannot be validated. The corona's warmth charges the closure image. Strong causal and closure linkage; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luminous vows are introduced in paragraph six and defined as "promises that had generated their own radiance at the moment of utterance, binding light to language." The concept shapes stakes: if such a vow can be measured, it might anchor remaining records. The matched vow's overlapping frequencies and the corona's flare demonstrate the concept on the page. It appears in setup (definition), middle (search logic), and payoff (the matched page's translucence and warmth). Causal pressure is solid; the concept enables the plot's resolution. Slightly more thematic than tactical, but it alters options and validates the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is introduced in paragraph four and immediately tied to Elara's work: "She cataloged. She cross-referenced." The trait constrains her approach—she does not rush or guess; she samples systematically. It enables the successful match by ensuring thoroughness. The attribute reappears in the final image: "gently, meticulously, luminously intact" mirrors her process, making the trait inseparable from the thematic closure. Cost is visible: patience under pressure, the risk that methodical work may yield nothing. Present in setup, middle (search method), and payoff (final echo). High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Measure" is the core action: Elara uses the frequency sampler to measure vibrational signatures of vows (paragraph seven). The action drives the middle sequence (hours of sampling, repeated failures) and produces the story's major turn (the chime, the match). The resolution depends on this action—without measuring, no proof. Setup in paragraph six (the sampler "could measure"), development across the search, payoff when the page is matched and held beside the slide. The action is irreplaceable; swapping "measure" for another verb would require rewriting the entire mechanic. Causal pressure and closure linkage are both very strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is introduced in paragraph six ("by sampling frequencies across the library's crystallized shelves") and enacted in paragraph seven ("the copper rings spun. Data accumulated"). The method shapes attempts: Elara reads spectral lines, moves shelf by shelf, interprets patterns. It is not merely an endpoint—the method's mechanics matter and are shown on the page. Setup (explanation of the sampler), middle (the search process), payoff (the chime that signals a match). The method is specific and tied to the world's rules (frequency as a measure of promise). Strong causal role; would require significant rewrite to replace.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen library above the clouds is introduced in the opening line and anchors every beat. It supplies the resource (crystallized vows) and the constraint (shelves going opaque, the altitude and cold). Elara must climb a frozen ladder with burning fingers to retrieve the matched page—a micro-setting moment that alters tactics and imposes physical cost. The library's "quartz hush" and luminous surfaces charge the atmosphere and the closure image. Setup (paragraph one), development (spatial navigation, the eastern wall), payoff (the descent through clouds). The setting is irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" appears in paragraph five as a temporal constraint: Elara works "in that narrow, merciless window when what was once believed still left a thermal trace before cooling into nothing." The timeframe creates urgency (shelves are going opaque), but the piece does not track a ticking clock beat by beat. Time is implied (nine days ascending, "hours passed" during the search, the descent) but not dramatized as immediate pressure during the search itself. Setup (the Dissolution's ongoing erasure), middle (hours of sampling), payoff (implicit closure of the window with the successful match). Functional but not fully exploited; a live countdown would have sharpened tactics further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated in paragraph four and dramatized through Elara's choices: she climbs for nine days, works methodically through repeated failure, and descends with proof. The motivation is non-heroic and particular—"She did not wish to save the world"—which avoids stock altruism. Friction is present: the cost is solitude, physical hardship, and the acceptance that she will never know whose vow she has preserved. Setup (paragraph four), middle (the search as enactment), payoff (carrying proof). The desire shapes every action and is tested by the stakes. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is introduced in paragraph two as "a presence of stillness so dense it pressed against the eardrums like deep water." The tone is consistent through turns: lyric, precise, cold, luminous. It modulates with pressure—the opening is contemplative, the search middle tightens with repeated failures, and the closure softens when the corona warms. The final image ("gently, meticulously, luminously intact") extends the established tone into thematic resolution. The tone charges the ending by holding reverence and precision in balance. Setup (paragraph two), maintained through middle, payoff (tone echoed in final cadence). Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
