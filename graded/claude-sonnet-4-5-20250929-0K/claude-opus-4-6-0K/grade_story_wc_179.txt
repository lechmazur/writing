<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—"jaw locked, fists white"—and the cellular-memory mechanism grounds the transformation in physical particulars rather than abstract epiphany. The woman (scheming pacifist) remains more archetype than individual; her motives and contradictions are asserted ("schemed her way to peace") but never tested under pressure. The final choice—releasing resentment—feels earned by the vision sequence, though the work occurs mostly in passive reception rather than active struggle. Minor: "cracked open" in "some deeper architecture" edges toward abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (cemetery → sanctuary → graveside return). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: Accumulative/Textural in the vision sequence (cellular memory layering meaning) and Situational at closure (Maren's stance crystallizes around the broken pin as rest rather than betrayal). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final exhale reweights eleven years of resentment with visible emotional cost. The woman's disappearance "the moment her work was done" ensures Maren's agency at the ending. One meaningful deepening (vision sequence) and one tightening (final image) satisfy the length. Cost is legible: "released eleven years in a single, soundless exhale."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary constrains communication ("heard the words...behind her sternum") and charges the final image (the "soundless exhale" at the graveside). Sensory hierarchy is purposeful: vibration/wave negation establishes the void, then the music box as physical pulse ("each note a pulse in Maren's fingertips") supplies the body-as-setting. The broken pin recurs with reweighted meaning (betrayal → rest). Spatial choreography is clean across the three reality layers. Minor: the "pale stone" and "gray linen" remain underdeveloped; more texture on the sanctuary walls or the woman's hands would deepen the micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: releasing resentment to complete the emotional melody. The vision sequence tightens by revealing what Maren's body already knows, narrowing her defensive stance. The woman's "convince...through what your body already knows" frames the pressure method early. Agency appears in the final beat: Maren picks up the music box, turns the crank, and reinterprets the gap—"a rest in the music"—with visible cost (the exhale that closes eleven years). The woman guides but does not resolve; Maren's reinterpretation is hers. One clear escalation (cellular memory vision) and one tightening (gap-as-rest) satisfy the Hybrid lens at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—resentment as incomplete song, cellular memory holding what the mind walls away—emerges through the music box, the broken pin, and the body's pulse. The final image (gap as "rest in the music") reweights the central question without moralizing. "Shifting grace" integrates as tectonic release ("not the grace of saints...but...tectonic plates finally releasing pressure"). Subtext operates in the woman's "scheming pacifist" geometry and Maren's eleven-year loop. Minor: "the silence where you stopped listening" edges toward direct thesis statement, though it remains image-adjacent. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the graveside exhale does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds to Maren's interior; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong in the opening ("jaw locked, fists white") and sensory translation ("words traveling through Maren's cells like memory traveling through muscle"). The woman's dialogue carries subtext and pursues a goal (convince without argument). Distance modulates purposefully from tight (cellular memory) to observational (woman's departure). Two slips lower the score: "schemed her way to peace...orchestrated this meeting the way a general orchestrates withdrawal" drifts into narrator commentary outside Maren's lexicon, and "scheming pacifists go" anthropomorphizes a category rather than staying character-bound. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high in the cellular-memory sequence. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) Mixed metaphor: "chest cracked open...in some deeper architecture" conflates fracture with structure. (2) Stock phrasing: "silence implies the absence of something that could exist" reads as philosophical boilerplate. (3) Overwriting in the opening: "sound had never been born, where vibration died before it could become wave, where even the concept of noise was foreign as color to stone" stacks three clauses restating the same negation without added pressure. Combined penalty: −1.5 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap. The closure beat ("released eleven years in a single, soundless exhale") is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary and cellular-memory mechanism offer a fresh angle on grief and forgiveness. The music box with broken pin as resentment metaphor is familiar but transformed through the body's physical recall and the gap-as-rest reinterpretation. The woman as "scheming pacifist" adds specificity, though her archetype (mystical guide) is recognizable. Risk-taking in the sensory translation ("words...behind her sternum, resonating in tissue and bone") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows the cellular-memory logic through to closure. No derivative template; the synthesis feels earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scheming pacifist (woman) appears early, frames the method ("convince...through what your body already knows"), and enables the vision sequence (middle beat). Her disappearance "the moment her work was done" signals purposeful withdrawal that forces Maren's agency at closure. Two gates (setup, development); closure participation is indirect (her absence ensures Maren's solo choice). Causal pressure: she constrains the method (cellular memory, not argument) and narrows Maren's defensive stance. Swappability: a generic guide could replace her with minor edits; the "scheming pacifist" geometry adds flavor but does not drive irreplaceable tactics. Band: functional across two beats with modest causal work but no direct closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Music box with broken pin appears in four beats: initial presentation, child-Maren flashback (pin whole), mother's deathbed attempt to fix it, and Maren's final turn of the crank. Early signal (first third), development (middle visions), and payoff (final reinterpretation of the gap as rest). Causal pressure: the broken pin embodies resentment's incompleteness and the gap-as-rest realization forecloses the eleven-year loop. Closure linkage: "for the first time the gap did not feel like betrayal. It felt like a rest in the music." Specificity: the broken pin's unique property (the missing note) drives the metaphor and cannot be swapped. Visible cost: Maren's exhale releases eleven years. High irreplaceability and strong closure charge justify the upper 8-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named and elaborated ("not the grace of saints or dancers but the grace of tectonic plates finally releasing pressure") in the closure sequence, reweighting the dominant stake. Setup: implicit in the sanctuary's mechanics (reality shifts, soundlessness). Development: the vision sequence exemplifies the shift. Payoff: the phrase anchors the moment Maren's "chest cracked open...in some deeper architecture." Causal pressure: modest; the grace metaphor enriches theme but does not constrain tactics. Lyric resonance: the tectonic image recharges the cellular-memory particulars. Cost connection: the release is tied to the grace. Band: shapes one key turn (the crack/release) and charges the ending without driving middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reappears when needed" is asserted in the woman's self-description and her departure ("dissolved the moment her work was done, already drifting toward the next person"). Setup: mid-story (woman's line). No development beat where the trait constrains a choice or creates a visible tradeoff. Payoff: her disappearance illustrates the pattern but does not alter Maren's final options (she was already passive recipient). Label-only: the trait is told, not demonstrated with cost. Swappability: a generic mystical guide who appears and vanishes could function identically. Band: functional but ornamental; the attribute does not impose a felt constraint or shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "convince" is signaled early ("I'm here to convince you") and frames the woman's method (cellular memory, not argument). Development: the vision sequence is the convincing mechanism. Payoff: Maren's gap-as-rest reinterpretation completes the persuasion. Causal pressure: the woman's refusal to argue narrows the method and forces embodied discovery. Closure linkage: Maren's final choice (turning the crank, releasing resentment) traces directly to the convincing work. Specificity: "convince through what your body already knows" is tied to the cellular-memory premise and not easily swappable. Cost: Maren's eleven-year exhale. Band: essential across setup, middle, and ending with clear causal work and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" is named and its mechanics explained ("the lullaby stored not in neurons but in the fibers of her being"). Setup: mid-story (woman's explanation). Development: the vision sequence demonstrates the method (pulse in fingertips, wrists, throat). Payoff: the woman's line "Every note she ever played for you is written in your body" reweights the memory and charges Maren's reinterpretation. Causal pressure: the method enables the vision and narrows Maren's defensive stance. Swappability: moderate; another embodied-memory mechanism (muscle memory, scent) could function similarly with edits. Cost: implied in the "cracked open" moment. Band: shapes the middle turn and contributes to closure but lacks unique irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary appears in the title beat, constrains communication ("heard the words...behind her sternum"), enables the vision sequence (reality shifts within the chamber), and charges the final image (the "soundless exhale" at graveside bookends the sanctuary's negation). Setup: immediate. Development: soundlessness forces non-verbal perception and the music box's physical pulse. Payoff: the graveside exhale mirrors and inverts the sanctuary's void. Causal pressure: the setting's constraint (no auditory communication) shapes the woman's method and Maren's sensory discovery. Specificity: "a place where sound had never been born" is tied to the cellular-memory and gap-as-rest logic. Cost: the sanctuary's isolation forces Maren's inward turn. Band: essential across all three gates with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is demonstrated in three transitions: cemetery → sanctuary, sanctuary → child-Maren vision, vision → deathbed vision, sanctuary → graveside. Setup: immediate (Maren "arrived without choosing to"). Development: the shifts enable the cellular-memory sequence. Payoff: the return to graveside closes the frame. Causal pressure: modest; the shifts are mechanisms for vision delivery but do not constrain Maren's choices or create a live clock. Cost: implied in the disorientation ("she tried to scream. Nothing"). Swappability: moderate; a dream or trance state could substitute. Band: functional across two beats (setup, payoff) with one middle involvement but no urgency or tactical constraint from the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach resentment to release" is the woman's stated goal ("I'm here to convince you") and Maren's implicit need (the eleven-year sentence). Setup: early (opening bitterness, woman's frame). Development: the vision sequence enacts the teaching. Payoff: Maren's gap-as-rest reinterpretation and final exhale complete the release. Causal pressure: the teaching method (cellular memory) narrows Maren's defensive stance and forces embodied discovery. Cost: eleven years released, a path foreclosed. Friction: the teaching is passive (Maren receives visions) rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; Maren does not resist or negotiate. Band: drives two beats and shapes closure with legible cost, though agency is more receptive than active.</comment>
