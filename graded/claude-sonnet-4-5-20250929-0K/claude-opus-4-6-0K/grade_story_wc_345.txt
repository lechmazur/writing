<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's characterization operates almost entirely in retrospect and through reported actions rather than dramatized choices; the colony members' trust is stated to dissolve like sugar but the specific micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure are absent. Pascal's weeping and Tuva's "brambled hope" metaphor gesture toward complexity, but interiority remains largely abstract and declarative rather than embodied. The piece tells us Maren orchestrates collective effort without showing her ghost-self making a single on-page decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost: "WELL DONE" arrives as declaration rather than decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing, and no visible price is paid or stance crystallized in the final image—Pascal weeps and the bell rings, but these are reactions to validation, not a choice or renunciation that forecloses a path. The narrative follows an accumulative/textural lens through the chalk-message structure, but the ending delivers emotional satisfaction without the requisite felt or conceptual cost that would constitute closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are delayed past 120 words with no clear payoff at closure, triggering the Orientation Test penalty; additionally, the "three years prior" crash and memorial timeline remain vague, making causality hazy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lavender sky, sideways-growing trees, and floating arches provide vivid, purposeful anchors filtered through the settlers' survival priorities; the copper bell's patina and the not-quite-butterflies constrain watering tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across the settlement and arches remains coherent throughout. Minor slip: the deserted sidewalk setting for chalk messages is repeated without evolving detail, and the scale of the colony remains abstract (no population count, housing type, or daily routine texture).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—colony survival through Maren's guidance—is signaled early but escalation is thin: the seedling-move and irrigation-redirect are told in summary, not dramatized as pressure-raising choices with visible tradeoffs. The first harvest arrives as reward rather than culmination of a tightening choice that narrows options or imposes cost. No on-page reversal or complication forces the colonists to choose between competing goods; trust in Maren's messages grows linearly without friction or agency-testing refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The brambled-hope metaphor and the fruit-ripening throughline create coherent thematic texture without overt statement, and the "WELL DONE" moment refrains from moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by leaving Maren's mechanism unexplained and her continued presence ambiguous. However, the ending skews sentimental—ringing the bell and weeping offer validation rather than a non-literal answer that reweights the cost of collective dependence on a ghost's unseen labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("a tightness like fruit not yet ripe") and perceptual specificity ("not quite butterflies, not quite light"). Distance control is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: Tuva's "brambled hope" phrase and Pascal's "voice cracking like dry wood" feel writerly rather than character-particular, and the collective "they" occasionally asserts certainty about Maren's motivation ("she was still tending them") without clear POV grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is controlled, but several beats carry paraphrase loops: "After strangers become family—after shared hunger and shared grief forge bonds" restates the same idea without added pressure; "The strange thing was how completely they trusted her. Not immediately, not without doubt, but the messages proved strangely trustworthy" cycles through synonym variants of trust. Template cadence in the middle section ("She was asking…" / "She was orchestrating…") flattens momentum. The "Maren was growing something" standalone paragraph is scaffold that the next beat immediately explicates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The altruistic-ghost-as-infrastructure premise offers a fresh angle on colony-survival narratives, and the chalk-message mechanic is concrete and specific. The transformation is incomplete: the emotional arc (doubt → trust → harvest) follows a familiar template, and the piece does not explore the moral calculus of dependence on invisible, uncompensated labor or the colonists' agency deficit. The lavender-sky details feel decorative rather than organically woven into character choice or world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren (altruistic ghost) is present in setup (memorial, first message), middle (multiple messages guiding tactics), and ending (WELL DONE); however, she never makes an on-page decision—her choices are reported or implied, and the narrative withholds any dramatized moment where her ghost-self weighs conflicting impulses or pays a cost. The element shapes multiple beats (arch collapse prevention, irrigation, butterfly garden) but remains ornamental to agency: the colonists act; Maren advises. Late-first-appearance waiver does not apply since she is introduced early. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) without meaningful middle development caps the score near mid-band; lack of visible choice or cost on Maren's part prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The copper bell appears twice with distinct function: once when Tuva finds it in wreckage and learns its use (middle beat), and again in the final image when she rings it to summon the pollinators. The bell's vibration requirement is specific and causal (draws pollinators necessary for orchard survival), and its reappearance at closure charges the ending. However, the bell does not constrain a difficult choice or impose visible cost; it enables success without friction. Strong setup, middle use, and closure reprise meet three gates, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The nebula/respite label appears in setup as backstory explanation but does not shape on-page stakes, tactics, or any choice. It functions as setting flavor rather than a concept that narrows options or alters behavior. The "respite" theme echoes in the harvest resolution, but the conceptual link is ornamental—removing the nebula reference would not break story logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is introduced in setup ("the messages proved strangely trustworthy") and drives the colony's choice to follow Maren's instructions across multiple beats (seedlings, irrigation, butterfly garden). The trait enables action but does not constrain it—no on-page moment dramatizes a colonist wrestling with doubt or paying a cost for trust. The attribute is functional and shapes one key turn (acceptance of the messages after the arch collapses), meeting two-gate minimum, but lacks visible tradeoff or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reexamine" (farming practices, cultivation methods) is signaled early in the middle section ("asking them to reexamine the way they'd been farming") and drives the shift from survival to purposeful cultivation, which culminates in the first harvest. The action is causal across beats (butterfly garden, copper bell use) and participates in closure (harvest as fruit of reexamination). However, the reexamination itself is told in summary rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost or friction; no single beat shows a colonist abandoning a prior method with felt consequence. Three-gate presence with moderate causal pressure but weak cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Chalk messages on deserted sidewalks at dawn are introduced in setup (first message about the eastern arch), recur across multiple beats (irrigation, root rot, Pascal's daughter, blueprints), and are present in the closure image (WELL DONE chalked on the great arch). The method is specific, irreplaceable (the handwriting is Maren's; the timing and location are consistent), and shapes tactics (colonists act on the messages before problems materialize). The mechanic drives at least three distinct beats and contributes to the ending's charge. Minor friction: the "deserted" and "dawn" details are stated but not leveraged to create tension or constraint (why deserted? who could see? no conflict arises from the method itself).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches is present in setup (vivid description), middle (eastern arch collapse, children mapping arches), and ending (great central arch frames the final message). The arches supply one causal beat (collapse threat drives seedling move) and the cathedral-like arch charges the final image spatially. However, the orchard and floating-arch mechanics do not constrain tactics beyond the single collapse event—gravity-as-suggestion and sideways-growing trees are decorative rather than obstacles or resources that shape choices. The setting enables the survival story but could be swapped for another exotic-planet premise without breaking core logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is introduced early as context (crash three years prior, shared grief forging bonds) and used to justify trust in Maren's messages. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no countdown, no escalating deadline, no on-page moment where elapsed time alters tactics. The "three years" anchor is vague and does not track across beats; the "first harvest" arrives without temporal pressure. The element is present and thematically functional but replaceable; it does not constrain action or participate meaningfully in closure beyond mood-setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orchestrating collective effort (Maren's motivation) is stated explicitly in the middle section ("She was orchestrating collective effort") and demonstrated across multiple beats: Pascal manages irrigation, Tuva tends the garden, children map arches. The motivation shapes at least two beats and is present in the ending (the collective harvest as payoff). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through Maren's on-page choices or friction—no moment shows her weighing individual versus collective good, or paying a cost to impose coordination. The element is functional and causal but lacks visible internal conflict or tradeoff that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Brambled hope is introduced explicitly via Tuva's metaphor ("reaching into a thornbush because you can see the fruit") and modulates across beats: grief and loss are acknowledged ("the scratches were real"), trust grows cautiously, and the ending rewards persistence. Tone is coherent and supports the accumulative lens. However, the tone remains largely static—hope dominates from the middle onward without meaningful pressure or tonal darkening that would test the brambled metaphor. The final image (bell ringing, spiral of light) tips toward unalloyed uplift, diminishing the thorn/cost side of the metaphor at the moment it should charge most.</comment>
