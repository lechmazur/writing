<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—"stagnant water, breeding doubt" and the trembling hands signal contradictory impulses. Her motivation to reignite the rebellion is shown through micro-choices (pulling deck plates, returning barefoot to the stones). However, the final paragraph's pivot to future action ("Tomorrow she would bring them here") undercuts on-page agency; the closure is a promise rather than a dramatized choice with immediate cost, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (repair bay, Maren, eleven-month lull). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the hum's rising intensity reweight the dominant stake (rekindling purpose). Closure is Charged Poise—Maren's exhaled breath and lowered glasses crystallize her stance with the hum carrying it "like a promise she finally believed she could keep." Cost is felt (her trembling certainty, the lonely vigil) and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening via the stone-circle hum suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is vividly particular: jammed roof panels, frozen hydraulic lifts, basalt pillars with glyphs. Spatial choreography is clean (barefoot on concrete, standing at the circle's edge, raising glasses to the open roof). The stones and the "wound of sky" constrain Maren's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her stargazer's attention. The environment shapes her choice to return and guides the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite the rebellion) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the textural hum and Maren's embodied trembling, building to the exhaled breath that carries her promise outward. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum becomes "thunderous serenity" and she decides to bring others. Cost is felt in her isolation and the weight of the lull; the final image narrows options by committing her to action. No antagonist is required under Accumulative lens, and the single tightening fits this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: "struggle was not linear, that stillness was not surrender, that a lull was just the universe drawing breath." The Argument (binary stars) and the ancient stones offer non-literal answers to Maren's central question without moralizing. The opera glasses and stone circle function as earned motifs that reweight prior material at closure. The final image—breath carried "like a promise"—resonates with the dominant question without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "discover meaning in the mess" borders on prompt language but is anchored in the hum's physicality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (the opera glasses' intimacy, "honest" twilight, the hum as a sound "that heard you"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated. One brief filter slip: "she felt the familiar thunder roll" could be tightened to direct perception. Narrative stance modulates naturally with the rising hum. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is consistent and the final image remains in Maren's embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Rhythm varies purposefully ("Not ended—stalled, which was worse"). Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively. Minor loop: "thunderous serenity" and "the paradox this place offered freely. Power without violence. Stillness that shook" restate the same idea across adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.2). No figurative muddle; metaphors (ribcage, wound of sky) are clear and coherent. Propulsion is strong through the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of ancient stone circle beneath a spaceport repair bay and a stargazer using opera glasses is specific and non-obvious. The rebellion-in-lull premise is familiar but transformed through the sensory hum and the resonance metaphor rather than firepower. Maren's plan to use the stones instead of speeches offers a fresh angle on leadership. The emotional truth of doubt and renewal feels particular. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, no antagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight template echo in "discover meaning in the mess" but overall synthesis feels earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, her barefoot state signaled early and reprised in the closure beat. Her choice to return to the stones, remove the deck plates, and raise the opera glasses drives the middle beats. The final decision to bring others tomorrow is stated rather than dramatized, reducing closure causal force. Two beats (arrival at stones, opera-glass stargazing) plus closure presence, but agency in the ending is promise rather than immediate action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear in two beats: stargazing introduction and the Argument observation near the end. Their grandmother's provenance adds specificity. However, they do not constrain a choice or shape the ending image—Maren lowers them before the final exhale. Functional in establishing her ritual but ultimately swappable with any viewing tool. Mid-range for presence and reweighting without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rebellion lull is the dominant stake, shaping the entire premise and Maren's motivation. It appears in paragraph two, drives her need to act, and the closure directly addresses it via the promise to reignite. The concept generates the story's pressure: "stalled, which was worse" frames the conflict. Tactics (using the stones, not speeches) arise directly from this concept. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is shown in "the way she did everything: shoulders back, chin high, hands trembling just slightly." This embodied detail appears once in the middle, shaping her ritual's tone. However, the trait does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible cost. It enriches characterization but remains replaceable—confidence alone would serve the same narrative function. Mid-band for purposeful presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reignite" frames the entire narrative goal, appears in the title-level intention ("She needed to reignite it"), and the closure directly fulfills it: "She would reignite them the way the stones had reignited her: not with fire, but with resonance." The metaphor drives Maren's tactics and the final image. Two beats plus closure presence. Could score higher if the reignition occurred on the page rather than as future promise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stone circle's hum is introduced early (paragraph six), recurs as "subsonic vibration" and "thunderous serenity," and directly enables Maren's plan: "let the hum speak in a language older than defeat." The mechanics matter—glyphs pulse, the hum rises through her spine, it becomes the means of renewal. Present in three beats (arrival, intensification, closure plan) and shapes the resolution method. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The repair bay is established in paragraph one, detailed across multiple beats (concrete floor, hydraulic lifts, retractable roof), and the space's history (engineers building around the stones) directly enables the plot. The open roof allows stargazing; the service pit houses the circle. The setting pressures Maren's choices and supplies the ritual's stage. Spatial choreography is clear and the bay's abandonment mirrors the rebellion's lull. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"The margin of daylight" is signaled in paragraph four, defined as "that brief corridor between the last of the sun and the first of the stars." It frames Maren's ritual timing and the transition to starlight drives the closure: "The last amber light vanished. The stars took the sky completely." The timeframe shapes the atmosphere and the ending image, though it does not tighten decisions with urgency. Two beats plus closure presence with thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly ("discover meaning in the mess") and dramatized through Maren's actions: returning to the stones, tracing patterns, reading stars against glyphs. It drives her plan to bring others and the closure commitment. The desire faces friction in her trembling and the rebellion's doubt. Present across three beats (initial need, ritual, closure promise) with cost visible in her isolation and the weight of leadership.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is stated in paragraph eight and embodied throughout: the subsonic hum that "lives more in bone than air," the "power without violence," the "stillness that shook." Tone remains coherent through Maren's calm ritual and modulates with the hum's deepening. The oxymoron charges the final image where breath is carried "like a promise" through serene exhalation with thunderous implication. Present and purposeful across the entire arc.</comment>
