<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's interior life is concrete and filtered through her profession—seeing patterns in death prepares her to read the aurora. Her final choice to encode light rather than genomes or symphonies emerges from thirty years of making the dead luminous, a motivated compression of her life's work. The piece avoids therapy-speak and grounds emotion in embodied perception (watching for hours, breathing slow). Minor limitation: we see one extended contemplative action rather than contradictory impulses colliding under pressure, but the renunciation of other archive options and the acceptance of uncertainty carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Lira's act of capturing the aurora reweights her mortician practice—she now prepares the world itself for passage, encoding its "last coherent expression" with the same reverence she gave individual faces. The cost is undeniable: she accepts that no one may ever find the chip, yet completes the ritual. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding throughout: the piece layers her profession, the dying planet, and the light into a single final image where she "watched, lucidly, gratefully, as the world prepared its own still face." Orientation is swift (grotto, Lira, tools by ~80 words). One tightening deepens when she chooses the aurora over all other data, narrowing her task and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is not postcard décor: its translucent walls channel the aurora into Lira's workspace, the "radiant hush" reflects the profession's threshold silence, and the open mouth frames her final gaze. The ice wall becomes a functional interface where she presses the chip. Sensory detail (green/violet pulse, frost singing with color, no wind/birdsong) is filtered through a mortician's attention to stillness and light. The grotto constrains the final choice—she must be here, at altitude, to capture magnetic patterns—and charges the closure image when she sits "in the radiant hush" watching the world's passage. Minor gap: the case and its contents are vividly inventoried but only the chip is used on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture one last spark before planetary death—is signaled immediately and drives all action. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: Lira spends weeks considering symphonies and genomes, then narrows to the aurora, then watches for hours to discern its patterns, layering frequency/rhythm/geometry into the chip. One meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses "the only thing she truly understood," foreclosing other archives and accepting the aurora's story over humanity's. The cost is visible: she tucks the chip away knowing "it did not matter" if anyone finds it, completing the ritual without guaranteed outcome. Agency is renunciation—she lets go of comprehensive records and bets everything on beauty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wholly from particulars: beautician mortician becomes beautician for a dying world, and "the threshold between beauty and death" recurs as the planet's own passage. The aurora is not symbol-for-hire but the magnetic field's literal last song, which Lira encodes as she once infused skin with phosphorescent oils. The final image—"the world prepared its own still face for the passage ahead"—offers a non-literal answer to what it means to honor endings, reweighting her entire career without stating a moral. No thematic echo or sermon. The piece resists tidy resolution: she does not know if the work will matter, yet completes it with "lucid" devotion. Minor mark: "sacred" and "reverence" nudge toward abstraction, but the surrounding concreteness holds them in check.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Lira's professional gaze: she reads "subtle rhythms in things that seemed formless" and translates light through mortician's syntax (cheekbones, still face). Diction stays selective and controlled—"lucidly watchful," "radiant hush," "mineral coffin"—without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the hours of watching, pulling back slightly for the final paragraph's summation. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear but feel voice-motivated, reflecting a contemplative rather than crisis-driven tempo. One friction: "no sound reached this altitude—no wind, no birdsong, no machinery" reads slightly list-like, a momentary loss of rhythm in an otherwise cadenced piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and carries high information density: "hollowed geode of ancient ice and mineral veins," "phosphorescent oils," "molecular level" all do double duty grounding world and profession. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual breathing room. The opening and closing sentences frame the threshold motif without repetition. Minor loop detected: "She had done what she had always done" in the penultimate paragraph slightly echoes the opening's career summary, and "the boundary between presence and absence was sacred" / "threshold between beauty and death" feel near-synonymous. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. One small opacity: "riding the threshold of stillness where perception sharpened to a blade" mixes metaphors (riding, blade) without full coherence, but does not obscure the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—beautician mortician preparing a planet for atmospheric death—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "last one on Earth" trope through occupational idiom (phosphorescent oils, reconstructing cheekbones) and the inversion that the dead one is the world. The aurora as magnetic-field swan song rather than generic pretty sky is scientifically grounded and freshly rendered. Risk-taking is present but controlled: the piece commits fully to a contemplative, action-light design and trusts the reader to find urgency in encoding light patterns. The final image—"the world prepared its own still face"—feels inevitable in hindsight, earned by every prior particular. No proximity echoes, no hedging. Entering the highest band because the premise, execution, and closure cohere as a singular artistic stance with zero safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's choices create all key turns: she selects the tools (early), chooses the aurora over other archives (middle tightening), watches for hours to discern patterns (active perception), infuses the chip (climax), and tucks it away accepting uncertainty (closure stance). Present in setup (case opened, profession established), development (choice to encode aurora), and payoff (final acceptance). Three distinct beats shaped by her agency. Cost is visible: she forgoes comprehensive data and completes the work without guarantee of discovery.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears in setup (nested in black velvet, "last empty one in existence"), is handled and activated mid-story (pressed to ice wall, receptor mode), and reappears in closure (tucked close to heart, "alive in its tiny mineral coffin"). Its data-crystal capacity is specific and irreplaceable—no other medium encodes molecular patterns. It constrains the choice: Lira must decide what to record, and the chip's size ("no larger than a tooth") charges the final image of vast light compressed into mineral. Three beats, closure linkage strong, visible cost (other archives foregone).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Threshold of stillness" is named early ("worked the threshold between beauty and death") and enacted on the page when Lira sits "riding the threshold of stillness where perception sharpened to a blade." It shapes her method—stillness allows pattern recognition—and charges the closure when she watches "lucidly, gratefully" as the world prepares its passage. Two beats (opening frame, sustained watchfulness). The concept reweights her career but does not force a stark choice between motion and stillness; it's more thematic accent than tactical constraint. Mid-band for clear presence and lyric resonance without hard causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is introduced by name late (~midpoint: "lucidly watchful, her eyes tracking") but the trait is enacted from the opening: she works "with practiced hands," knows to look for "subtle rhythms," and watches "for hours, her breathing slow, her mind perfectly still." It enables the core action—discerning aurora patterns requires sustained, clear attention—and reappears in closure ("watched, lucidly, gratefully"). The trait constrains method: frantic or distracted watching would fail. Cost is implied (hours of motionless focus). Two beats, closure participation clear. Capped slightly for late explicit naming, but functional depth is strong.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Infuse" drives the climax: "Lira began to infuse the emerald chip with what she saw, translating the light patterns through the receptor into crystalline data, layering frequency, rhythm, and geometry." It echoes her mortician practice ("infused their skin with phosphorescent oils") and defines the story's central action—encoding the aurora. The verb appears in both past career summary and present climactic act, creating thematic coherence. Swappable only with radical edits; "record" or "capture" lack the embodied, mortician-specific texture. Two beats (past/present), closure participation (the chip holds the infused light). Strong causal and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is seeded early ("finding patterns in static, reading the subtle rhythms in things that seemed formless"), demonstrated in career retrospect (reading "stories through creases"), and enacted on the page during the hours of watching: "a repeating pulse in the green band, a rhythm like a heartbeat...a spiral structure in the violet." The method shapes her attempt—she must watch patiently to discern the aurora's coherence—and pays off when she successfully encodes those patterns. Three beats (setup, career example, climactic use). The method is irreplaceable: brute recording without pattern-reading would miss the "last coherent expression."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto provides essential infrastructure: it hangs "beneath curtains of aurora," allowing direct access to the magnetic light Lira must encode. The translucent ice walls channel the light into the workspace, and the "radiant hush" (no wind, no sound) mirrors the mortician's threshold silence. The grotto's open mouth frames the final gaze. It constrains the plan—Lira must be at altitude to capture atmospheric patterns—and charges the ending when she sits within it watching. Three beats (arrival/setup, working space during encoding, closure frame). Mid-high band: the setting is purposeful and atmospheric but does not force a tactical choice (she faces no environmental obstacle).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is dramatized immediately: "She had come here to capture one last spark before oblivion." The motivation is tested when she considers symphonies, genomes, and maps—three live alternatives—then chooses the aurora, narrowing her goal with visible cost (other records foregone). The desire recurs implicitly in every action (watching, encoding, accepting uncertainty). Friction between want (to preserve something) and cost (no guarantee of discovery) is on the page in the final beats when she tucks the chip away knowing "it did not matter" if anyone finds it. Three beats, closure linkage strong, cost explicit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is introduced early ("a radiant hush filled the space") and maintained throughout: "no sound reached this altitude," the frost crystals "sing with color" silently, and Lira's watching is soundless. The tone modulates under pressure—calm inventory (opening), patient observation (middle), quiet acceptance (closure)—without breaking into noise or panic. It charges the final image: "Lira sat in the radiant hush and watched, lucidly, gratefully." The tone is indispensable to closure; any shift to urgency or fear would collapse the mortician's professional devotion. Three beats, closure integration total, cost implied (stillness is chosen over action).</comment>
