<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and distinctive—her view of obsession as devotion, her precise working method. The motivation to follow the map is consistent and embodied through her careful charting even at the moment of entry. The final beat ("she had earned the right to face them") shows a micro-choice rooted in character logic. Minor deduction: the trembling hands paired with certain mind feels slightly stock; internal contradiction could be sharpened.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Elara completes the map, enters the archive, and picks up her mother's letter at midnight—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her eleven-year journey with felt cost (confronting an unspoken truth). The causal lens holds from punch discovery through keyhole logic to threshold crossing. One meaningful tightening: the punch opens the lock, then the door, narrowing options until she must read. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two). Cost is legible in the final image: she has traded certainty for whatever the letter contains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting—Kessler Station's starlit vault, fog, iron ribs—is vivid and filtered through Elara's mapper's eye. The cracks forming arrows constrain her path and drive the middle beat; the keyhole door charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (platform, gate, stairs, door, archive room). The archive's physical specificity (filing cabinets, glass cases) grounds the conceptual payload without ornament. The setting shapes choice and final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: follow the mapped route to its terminus. One meaningful tightening: the keyhole match forces Elara to cross from evidence to conviction. Agency is decision-based (she inserts the punched paper) with visible cost (facing the mother's letter she's avoided). The escalation is causal—each discovery (punch, cracks, lock, door) narrows options until only entry remains. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken truths and the labor of charting the invisible—emerges from specifics (eleven years, meticulous ink washes, the archive of silences). The final image offers a resonant answer: she earns access through method, not luck. Deduction: "the person you were and the person you might become" and "the hour turned" veer toward overt thematic declaration. The mother's letter setup is strong, but the closure beat doesn't fully transform prior particulars; it arrives as the expected payoff rather than a reweighted insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara sees arrows in cracks, reads intention in geography. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("obsession was just what the unimaginative called devotion"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the punch examination, pulled back for the cathedral image). No head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal. The prose rhythm tightens as she descends, then breathes at the archive threshold. One minor slip: "trembling points" and "trembling hands" echo without payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high. Clarity and momentum are strong. Minor deductions: "the hinge between the person you were and the person you might become" is a paraphrase loop of the prior clause. "Slow, painstaking, analytically artistic labor" stacks modifiers without fresh specificity. The opening's figurative density ("cathedral-like," "altar of some forgotten departure") is rich but approaches overwriting in a single beat. No loops obscure causality; artifacts remain outside closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The phantom punch as map-making tool is a fresh synthesis; the keyhole shape linking tool to threshold is specific and earned. The route-mapper protagonist pursuing invisible passages offers a non-obvious angle. Deduction: the "fortress of unspoken truths" as a literal archive of burned letters feels familiar (the secret library trope). The mother's letter as climactic revelation is emotionally honest but structurally predictable. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, which lifts the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as meticulous route mapper drives every beat: she charts fragments, follows cracks, marks progress, and completes the map before reading the letter. Her precision enables the keyhole discovery and her devotion compels the dare. The final line ("the slow, painstaking, analytically artistic labor of following a path until it opened") ties closure to this identity. Setup early, developed through all middle beats, and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch appears in three beats: discovery and examination (paragraph three), opening the padlock (paragraph six), and inserting the punched slip as key (paragraph eight). Its keyhole shape is the causal hinge that narrows to the final door. It shapes two major turns (lock and door) and is indispensable to closure. High irreplaceability: no generic key would carry the accumulated map fragments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unraveling mysteries shapes stakes (she traces punch clues to Kessler) and tactics (overlaying fragments, following arrows). It frames her eleven-year project and the deepest mystery claim in paragraph three. Present in closure: the archive reveals "every silence heavy enough to shape a life." Middle development is implicit (the decoding work) rather than dramatized. Functional but closer to framing than beat-by-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is concretely shown: maps "measured to the millimeter, yet rendered in ink washes and watercolor gradients." This duality enables her to see both precision (arrows in cracks) and inevitability (the impossible made real). It shapes her method and self-concept ("obsession was just what the unimaginative called devotion"). The trait is present early, colors perception throughout, and is invoked at closure ("analytically artistic labor"). Cost: the trade between measurement and intuition is implicit but not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Dare" is the pivot: "Elara understood then what she was being asked. Not to solve, not to document, but to dare." This reframes the eleven-year project and drives the final action (inserting the paper, opening the door, picking up the letter). The dare is the threshold between evidence and conviction. Setup and closure are strong; it defines the climactic choice. Minor cap: the dare itself is articulated rather than enacted through a visceral cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracks forming arrows are signaled midpoint ("the cracks were wrong…They formed arrows"), constrain her path ("She followed them"), and demonstrate intention she can read. They drive the tunnel discovery. Mechanics matter: she marks progress on her chart as she follows them. Not present in closure image. Two gates (middle constraint, method-as-clue), but swappable with other map/sign methods. Functional and specific, but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The starlit vault in mist is vividly rendered and provides atmosphere. It signals the sacred/liminal tone early ("cathedral-like") and returns in the final line ("through stone and mist and starlight"). The setting does not constrain a middle choice; Elara's path is determined by the arrows and punch, not the vault itself. Lyric reprise reweights mood but does not alter tactics. Present in setup and closure, minimal middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"The hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is signaled in paragraph two, contextualized by the mother's words, and paid off in the final line: "Midnight struck…The hour turned. Elara read." The timeframe tightens decision (she arrives at the appointed moment) and the turn coincides with her choice. It shapes one key turn (threshold crossing at the stroke) and charges closure. Not a live countdown across beats, but purposeful and integrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to find the fortress of unspoken truths is stated early ("deepest unraveling of mysteries"), drives the eleven-year mapping project, and is realized on the page when she enters the archive. Conflict: she seeks truth but her hands tremble when her mother's letter appears—desire meets cost. The fortress is both literal (she finds it) and symbolic (threshold to personal reckoning). Setup, middle pursuit, and closure participation are all strong. Minor deduction: the motivation is told more than dramatized in micro-choices until the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is embodied throughout: "her hand steady even as her breath came shallow," "hands trembled, but her mind was certain," "trembling points" in the starlight. The tone modulates under pressure (confident analysis of cracks, hesitation at the lock, resolve at the map completion) and charges the final image (certainty to read despite trembling). Coherent and purposeful. Minor deduction: the trembling/certain pairing is articulated rather than shown through contradictory actions in a single beat.</comment>
