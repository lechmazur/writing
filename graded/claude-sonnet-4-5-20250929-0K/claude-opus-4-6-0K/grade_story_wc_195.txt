<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Edric's interior is vivid and voice-particular ("factually mystical...proven theorem no one had bothered to write down"), but his motivation remains abstract until late. The withdrawal premise seeds early, yet the decisive shift—unsnapping the gorget—feels gesturally complete without prior micro-choices showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final pledge to possibility carries conceptual weight but lacks embodied cost that forecloses a concrete alternative path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (greenhouse, knight, endless night) land by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the diagrams, whispered geometry, fruit ripening/unripening, then the gorget drop reweights his withdrawal into openness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to Charged Poise)—the final image of reaching for fruit crystallizes his new stance with palpable conceptual cost (renouncing knighthood's closure). One meaningful deepening is present, though the cost proof is primarily conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is rendered with striking specificity: copper channels, luminous solutions, pomegranate-mercury hybrids, mossy flagstones. The alchemical orchard constrains Edric's attention and provides the program artifact that triggers the turn. The endless night returns in the closure beat ("darkness behind darkness, each one a different unlived timeline"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding what he's been running from—is signaled early. The program's diagrams narrow his options by offering a path the knightly order forgot, and the greenhouse's reality-shift deepens pressure. The gorget removal forecloses his identity as knight with felt cost, though the escalation is more conceptual than tactical; no live tradeoff between competing goods forces the choice. One meaningful tightening is present under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: forgotten patterns, withdrawn silence becoming "fertile dark," fruit as unlived timelines. The final image (reaching for fruit "warm as a living hand") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of retreat versus engagement. No thematic echo or moralizing; the gorget's fall and the geometry's language settle into the body without stating a thesis. Minor: the "shape of possibility" phrase risks abstraction but remains anchored in the orchard's branching architecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "factually mystical," "shivering bliss," "the thrill of a world confessing a secret." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the greenhouse, opening to cosmic scale at the fruit's pulse). Diction remains within an elevated register consistent with a contemplative knight. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression ("syllables generated by angles") is taught early and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per sentence. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Minor issues: "shivering bliss" and "trembling possibility" echo each other across beats without added pressure; "the vast trembling structure of what could be" stacks modifiers in a peak moment. Figurative density is high but coherent, reading as voice-motivated rather than overwriting. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—withdrawn knight, marionette-program geometry, alchemical orchard—feels specific and non-obvious. The "forgotten patterns as instructions for strings between things" transforms the marionette trope through lived detail and world logic. Risk: the high figurative register and accumulative structure heighten stakes without gimmickry. The ending's shift from silence-as-retreat to silence-as-fertile-dark is earned in hindsight. Transformation test passes; plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edric's withdrawal frames the premise; his decision to trace the pattern, whisper the geometry, and unsnap the gorget drives the final turn. Three distinct beats with causal pressure, though the middle choices (tracing, whispering) are compressed and his agency reads more receptive than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The program appears early on the stone bench, is handled when Edric traces the first pattern (triggering the air's texture change), and its diagrams "blazed briefly in his mind, then settled into his bones" at closure. Three beats with escalating function; the program enables the geometry and charges the final reconfiguration. Swappability is low—its marionette-theater context seeds the "strings between things" metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The murmured allegiance is dramatized on the page: Edric whispers "words that came to him...from the geometry itself," pledging "to possibility as though it were a sovereign." It shapes the greenhouse's shudder and the fruit's ripening/unripening, altering the reality he perceives. Present in setup and payoff with causal pressure, though the middle beats (tracing, whispering) blur together and the oath's specific cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is established in the opening paragraph and constrains Edric's perception throughout: the orchard "should not have been alive," the geometry is "a proven theorem no one had bothered to write down." It enables the reality-shift and the fruit's simultaneous states. The trait is voice-integrated and recurs across beats, though the on-page cost is oblique—more a world rule than a choice-limiting attribute for Edric himself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unsnapping the gorget is the decisive physical act that releases "the last physical remnant of the knight he had been" and cracks open his withdrawal. It appears late (final third) but the closure hinges on it; the gesture forecloses his knightly identity with visible cost. Two beats (the unsnap, then reaching for fruit), strong causal linkage. Late arrival and limited middle development lower the score, but irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forgotten patterns are signaled early (diagrams in the program, recognized from ceremonial armor), shape the middle turn (Edric traces one, air changes texture, he whispers the geometry), and charge the closure ("settled into his bones like a language he had always spoken"). Three beats with causal pressure; the method is specific and irreplaceable. Minor: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—"instructions...for the strings between things"—rather than a visible constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is introduced in the opening line, anchors every beat (copper channels, spiral trees, pomegranate-mercury hybrids, stone bench, mossy flagstones), and supplies the program that triggers the turn. The endless night deepens at closure, revealing "layers—darkness behind darkness, each one a different unlived timeline." The setting constrains Edric's attention and provides the fruit he reaches for. Essential across beats and ending; irreplaceability is very high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" appears once in the closing third when the greenhouse shudders and the fruit ripens/unripens simultaneously. The timeframe is present at closure and charges the final image (endless night revealing unlived timelines), but it does not tighten decisions or tactics in the middle beats. One-gate participation (payoff); limited middle development and no urgency pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" is articulated late ("his task was not to choose one but to capture the shape entire") but seeds early in Edric's withdrawal "to understand what they had been running from." It drives the final reach for fruit and shapes the closure image. Two beats (implicit in withdrawal premise, explicit at climax) with felt cost (renouncing knighthood). Middle friction between want and cost is present but understated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" is named early ("something in Edric's chest tightened with a feeling he could only describe as shivering bliss") and modulates through the greenhouse's shudder, the fruit's pulse, and the final breath where "his silence was not retreat" but "fertile dark." Tone coheres under pressure and charges the final image. Strong closure linkage; the tonal shift from withdrawal to openness is legible and purposeful.</comment>
