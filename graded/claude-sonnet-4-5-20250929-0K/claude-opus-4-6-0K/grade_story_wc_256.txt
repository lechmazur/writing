<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior journey is concrete and embodied through her hands on the bells and lens, with her evolving understanding of preservation versus connection forming a credible arc. The motivation shift from taxidermy to resonance is earned through the grid collapse memory and the seven descents. However, the epiphany language trends slightly abstract in places ("texture of connection...woven cloth where every thread was a different voice"), approaching but not quite crossing into label-speak. The final stance crystallization is grounded in action—striking the bell, holding the lens—with visible cost in her departure from institutional practice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered images (carbide lamp, bells, lens, recordings) toward a pattern-break realization in Vault Nineteen where the lens effect enables sympathetic resonance. Orientation anchors (Laboratory of Lost Sounds, three days post-stabilization, prism-song bell ringer) land within the first two paragraphs. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's understanding shifts from preservation-as-taxidermy to connection-as-texture, with conceptual cost legible in her rejection of institutional method ("not to be saved but to be touched"). The lens holds; one meaningful deepening occurs when the lens bends sound to reveal hidden harmonics, which then enables the vault-nineteen resonance that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds functions as more than backdrop: the vault architecture constrains her descent, the copper canisters and formats (wax cylinders, wire coils) supply the texture that her lens activates, and Vault Nineteen's inaccessible media becomes the site where her method proves itself. The carbide lens as micro-setting charges the final image by bending sound propagation. Sensory detail is filtered through professional attention (F-sharp crystal "no larger than a thimble," "golden shadows...not light exactly but the visual impression sound leaves") and the amber geometry, steel table, and vault depth create spatial specificity without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether lost sounds can truly connect across time without playback—is signaled early through the grid-collapse memory and "taxidermy" realization. Pressure tightens through the artificial pilgrimage's deepening, then escalates in Vault Nineteen when the lens technique produces sympathetic resonance in unplayable media. The reversal is her discovery that connection does not require mechanical retrieval but "sacred attention." Cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons institutional practice ("Director Losh called, with polite skepticism") and the laboratory's preservation mission for a method her colleagues cannot replicate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the lens bending overtones, the cylinders whispering in sympathy, the shift from cataloguing to listening. The central question—does connection require a listener or only willingness to resonate—is answered non-literally by the final image where "nothing was lost at all" because attention itself becomes preservation. The artificial/authentic paradox (a constructed pilgrimage that uncovers genuine connection) threads through without moralizing. The grandfather's seventeen underground years, the woman singing into Edison's foil, and Maren's pulse create the "woven cloth" texture without symbol-shopping, and the piece resists tidy resolution by leaving institutional rejection as open cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and distant-intimate, with lexicon consistent to a trained specialist ("spectral frequencies," "sympathetic resonance," "overtones split"). The perceptual signature is aural and tactile (heat-scarred glass, crystal stem, "golden shadows" as sonic afterimage) and the prose modulates from reflective opening to charged immediacy in Vault Nineteen ("She closed her eyes. She felt it then"). Occasional elevated diction ("authentic in what it uncovered," "the oldest message humans ever sent") stays within voice but trends abstract under peak pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance image, understanding, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, from long contemplative sentences ("It had belonged to her grandfather...") to shorter beats at closure ("The walls remembered. The air remembered."). Minor template cadence in the final paragraph: three sentences open with "She [verb]" or parallel structure, creating slight drumbeat. Stock phrasing surfaces once ("warm and diffuse," "trembling moment") but does not obscure the closure image. No loops or pronoun confusion; the piece reads aloud cleanly with figurative language (golden shadows, woven cloth) serving rather than obscuring sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—using a heat-warped miner's lens to reveal hidden harmonics in archival sound, literalizing "artificial pilgrimage" as institutional dissent—feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the quest/discovery template by embedding the journey inside a single building and making the discovery method (lens-bent sound) integral to the thematic insight (connection as texture, not retrieval). The occupational frame (prism-song bell ringer) and invented formats (copper canisters, magnetic wire) ground freshness in plausible detail. Risk-taking is moderate: the sympathetic-resonance climax could lean fabulist but stays tethered to her established skill.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as prism-song bell ringer shapes every key choice: she strikes the F-sharp crystal in Vault Nineteen (beat one), discovers the lens effect through prior experimentation (beat two), and uses the technique to trigger sympathetic resonance at closure (beat three). Her professional training enables the method, and her rejection of institutional cataloguing creates the dominant conflict. The decision to continue the artificial pilgrimage despite Director Losh's skepticism is hers, with visible cost in professional isolation. Setup occurs in paragraph two; middle development through the seven descents; payoff in the final vault.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carbide lamp lens appears in paragraph one (talisman from seventeen underground years), is discovered as a sound-bending tool in paragraph five ("curved glass bent the sound's propagation"), is used deliberately in Vault Nineteen (beat one: "positioned...on a steel table"), and charges the final image ("Maren held the lens steady"). Its heat-scarred surface and grandfather's history layer meaning; its acoustic properties enable the closure resonance. Removing it would break the method and sever the thematic link between underground echoes and archival connection. Three distinct functional beats plus closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage frames Maren's descent through storage levels and names her method: "questioning assumptions she had carried for years." It shapes stakes (can a constructed journey yield authentic discovery?) and her tactics (moving vault-to-vault with bells and lens rather than digital retrieval). The concept appears by paragraph four, constrains her seven-descent process, and is resolved thematically at closure when the artificial origin proves irrelevant to the authentic resonance achieved. However, the pilgrimage itself remains largely told; we see only one vault on the page. Two gates clearly met (setup, closure linkage), middle development is implied rather than dramatized across multiple vaults.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is enacted twice: first as the lens effect ("not a distortion but a revelation, a kindness done to the sound itself"), then as the final wave ("a single powerfully gentle wave"). The attribute constrains method—she cannot force the hidden harmonics, only coax them—and the paradox (power through gentleness) mirrors the thematic shift from mechanical retrieval to sympathetic resonance. The phrase appears in paragraph five and returns in the final paragraph, bracketing the vault-nineteen climax. The cost is implicit: this method requires patience and cannot scale to institutional needs. Solid setup, demonstration, and payoff; would need to visibly alter a tactical choice mid-scene to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Propel" governs the piece: the lens effect "propelling" sound (paragraph five), her questions "propelling her deeper" (paragraph four), and the closing resonance "propelling outward through the vaults." It names her method of descent, the acoustic mechanism, and the final transmission. Each usage escalates: internal drive → technical discovery → climactic broadcast. The action is irreplaceable; substituting "send" or "carry" would lose the momentum metaphor that links pilgrimage movement to sound propagation. Three beats, with the final beat charging closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is named explicitly ("by questioning assumptions she had carried for years") and demonstrated on the page through two pivotal questions: "Was a lost sound truly lost if no living ear recognized it? Did connection require a listener, or only the willingness to resonate?" These questions drive her vault-to-vault method and are answered by the sympathetic-resonance discovery. The means shapes her rejection of cataloguing and enables the lens experimentation. Setup in paragraph four, active in the descent logic, resolved at closure when the questions' implications materialize. Would benefit from one additional on-page moment where a specific assumption is tested and discarded mid-scene to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds supplies the archive that failed during the blackout (motivating the quest), the vault architecture that structures her descent, and the specific media (wax cylinders, wire coils, foil sheets) that her lens activates in Vault Nineteen. The setting is not backdrop: its formats constrain her choices (unplayable recordings demand a non-mechanical solution), and the vaulted ceiling in the opening and Vault Nineteen's steel table provide spatial anchors. Removing this exact setting would eliminate the occupational frame, the descent structure, and the closure mechanism. Four functional beats: opening framing, grid-collapse memory, seven-descent journey, and vault-nineteen climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the power grid stabilizes" appears in the opening line and motivates the entire premise: the eleven-week blackout taught Maren that digital archives are fragile, prompting her to seek a non-electrical method. The stabilization allows her colleagues to resume work, heightening her isolation when she pursues the artificial pilgrimage instead. However, the timeframe does not tighten choices on the page; the three-day gap and seven descents create loose chronology without urgent pressure. Setup is strong, thematic linkage is clear, but the element does not constrain tactics in the vault-nineteen beat. Two gates (setup, thematic shape) but no middle escalation or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to "discover the texture of connection" is demonstrated through Maren's rejection of cataloguing, her lens experiments, and the vault-nineteen moment where she "felt...the texture of connection...like woven cloth." The motivation is conflicted: she risks professional isolation (Director Losh's skepticism) and abandons institutional validation to pursue an unproven method. Cost is conceptual but legible—her method cannot preserve sounds in the laboratory's terms. The motivation appears by paragraph three, drives the seven descents, and is fulfilled at closure when texture materializes as sympathetic resonance. Would need one additional on-page friction (a moment where connection feels impossible, forcing a micro-choice) to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears three times with escalating function: the carbide lamp throws "amber geometry" (paragraph one), the lens scatters "golden shadows...not light exactly but the visual impression sound leaves" (paragraph seven), and they "deepened, warm and diffuse" in the final image. The tone is consistent—reverent, contemplative, luminous—and modulates under pressure without breaking; the golden-shadow image charges the closure by visualizing the sonic connection. The phrase is irreplaceable; substituting "warm light" or "glow" would lose the synesthetic link between sound and illumination. Three beats, purposeful recurrence, and direct participation in the ending.</comment>
