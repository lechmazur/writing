<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied ("sculpt space for reflection—to shape the raw stone of loss"), with contradictory impulses present (skepticism vs. belief, grief vs. practicality). Her micro-choices—kneeling, pressing her palm, transcribing—reveal character under pressure. The grandmother Solveig is vivid through notebooks and recorded tenderness, though she remains off-page. Minor deduction: the epiphany ("empathy made deliberate") edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization, though it's largely earned by the transcription work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (tower, Maren, Solveig's death, whale migration) land clearly within the first ~15% of text. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren completes transcription, recognizes the archive's purpose, and closes the notebook with "the strange double-pulse of her own memory and Solveig's overlapping"—a crystallized moment where options and meaning are reconfigured. The cost is conceptual and felt: she must accept empathy as method, not magic, and carry forward her grandmother's deliberate attention. Pressure accumulates through whale migration, symbol decoding, and the unfolding archive, tightening Maren's stance from skeptic to inheritor. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower is vivid (spiral staircase, arched windows, tessellated tiles, open roof) and filters through Maren's perceptions (salt, percussion of waves, October wind). The magic square tile is handled twice (palm press early, palm press at end) and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. Whale migration supplies atmospheric pressure and a live clock. Minor cap: while environment is richly described, the tower does not visibly constrain a tactical choice—Maren could transcribe anywhere—so the 9-band gate (constraint or charge) is only partially met via the tile's symbolic weight at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren seeks to "sculpt space for reflection" and process her grandmother's legacy. One meaningful tightening: as she decodes the notebooks, the archive's true purpose (tenderness preservation) narrows her options from mere sorting to deliberate inheritance, foreclosing casual dismissal. The whale migration serves as timeframe pressure. Agency is present in her choice to transcribe (not merely copy) and to accept the archive's method. Cost is conceptual and felt: she relinquishes skepticism and adopts her grandmother's deliberate empathy. No explicit antagonist, but internal conflict (belief vs. skepticism) drives pressure. Entering 8.8+ would require a more visible forfeiture on the page; here the cost is legible but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as deliberate, encoded kindness outlasting forgetting—emerges through the archive's contents (neighbor's grief, child's laughter, Solveig's loneliness) rather than assertion. The magic square tile, whale migration, and "unheard symphony" image cohere as recurring motifs that reweight at closure: "the symphony played on, unheard and everywhere, and Maren listened." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer (attention as archive) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (palm on tile) and silence (the whales' "brief, silent bells"). Minor issue: the line "empathy made deliberate" and "a device for slowing down enough to hear" verge on thematic echo, though they arise organically from Maren's realization rather than pure assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, close psychic distance maintained throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: Maren's mathematical lens (combinatorial curiosities, cipher key, substitutions) colors her observations. Diction is controlled and distinct ("sculpt space for reflection," "the strange double-pulse"). No dialogue present; interior voice is consistent and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("she felt something," "she understood now") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, though they remain voice-plausible. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("the symphony played on, unheard and everywhere") fits the accumulative design and charges closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (whale migration, tile mechanics, archive revelation all serve multiple jobs). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("tides," "raw stone of loss," "unheard symphony"). Minor deductions: the phrase "sympathetic skeptic who loved the believer too much to argue" is mildly summary-adjacent, and "entangled memories" is repeated across paragraphs without adding new pressure. A few participial openers ("pressing," "watching") cluster in reflective passages. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Proofreading is clean. The final line ("the symphony played on, unheard and everywhere, and Maren listened") is strong and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of math-as-empathy-key and archive-of-tenderness is specific and non-obvious; the magic square cipher transforms a familiar skeptic-vs-believer frame into a story about deliberate attention. Maren's voice (mathematician processing grief) feels particular. Whale migration as timeframe and the tower setting are well-chosen anchors. Minor issue: the "sympathetic skeptic" and "forgotten patterns" phrasing edges toward prompt-like language, and the grandmother's archive of vulnerability risks sentimental terrain, though the piece avoids overt sentimentality through concrete examples (miscarriage, laughter, loneliness). The emotional truth—grief as patient translation—feels earned and memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (sympathetic skeptic) is present throughout and shapes two key turns: her decision to transcribe (not merely copy) the notebooks, and her acceptance of the archive's empathy-as-method at closure. Setup is immediate; middle beat (decoding cipher) involves her skepticism yielding to discovery; payoff (final palm press, "I did not believe in magic. But…") completes the arc. Causal pressure is moderate; her choices enable rather than constrain. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing skepticism) but visible in the final stance. Specificity: her mathematician lens (combinatorial, cipher key) is irreplaceable. Three gates met; causal involvement in two beats; closure linkage strong. Minor cap: swappability is low but not zero—a historian or linguist could perform similar work with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Magic square tile appears in three beats: Maren kneels and presses palm early, she recalls Solveig's warning and her own deliberate stepping, and she presses palm again at closure ("the strange double-pulse"). Setup is early; middle beat involves memory; payoff charges the final image. It functions as cipher key (enabling transcription) and symbolic anchor (heart-tile, entangled memories). Causal role: without the tile's number grid, the decoding would lack mechanism. Cost connection: the tile embodies Solveig's method and Maren's inheritance. Specificity is high; irreplaceability strong. Three gates met; beat involvement ×2+; closure linkage present. Slight cap: the tile is more symbolic than tactically constraining—Maren could theoretically decode elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Entangled memories (the concept) is introduced early ("memories that belonged to more than one person, that braided across generations") and reappears at closure ("the strange double-pulse of her own memory and Solveig's overlapping"). Setup present; middle development weak (Maren intellectualizes it but does not act on it); payoff present as thematic reconfiguration. It shapes stakes (understanding Solveig's archive) but does not constrain tactics—Maren's decoding work would proceed identically without the entangled-memory framing. Cost is conceptual (accepting empathy-as-archive) but not tied uniquely to this concept. Two gates met (setup, payoff); one lyric reprise. Swappability is moderate; "shared memory" or "inherited attention" would function similarly. Band: 5.5–6.3 for lyric resonance without mid-scene causal use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" appears once as descriptor of Solveig's archive method ("something more courageously kind"). Setup is delayed (appears mid-story); development unclear; payoff present as thematic claim. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—Maren's transcription and acceptance would occur without this label. The trait is told rather than shown through a specific tradeoff. Cost is absent on this element. One gate met (payoff as theme). Ornamental use; label-only; swappability high ("quietly generous," "deliberately tender"). Late first appearance (−0.4); no causal pressure (−0.8); summary-only (−0.4). Band: 3.0 base + minimal theme resonance at end → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transcription (the action) drives the central pressure: Maren begins by intending to sort, shifts to transcribe (not copy), decodes the cipher, and discovers the archive's purpose—all causally linked. Setup is early (notebooks spread on pedestal); middle beat (decoding symbols, "translate") is the turning point; payoff ("She transcribed until the last whale passed") completes the arc and charges closure. Three gates met; beat involvement ×3+; causal pressure high (narrows options from sorting to inheritance); closure linkage strong (final paragraph references transcription work). Cost connection: the hours of labor and acceptance of Solveig's method are visible. Specificity: "transcribe" vs. "copy" is crucial and irreplaceable. Irreplaceability very high; removing transcription breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns" (the method) is introduced early (Solveig's symbols, magic square cipher) and shapes the middle beat (decoding via "combinatorial substitutions rotating through the square's symmetries"). Setup present; development strong (Maren applies the method); payoff present (patterns unlock the archive). Causal role: the cipher mechanism enables discovery. Cost is time and intellectual labor (visible). Specificity: the magic square's rotational symmetry is particular and irreplaceable. Three gates met; beat involvement ×2; closure linkage moderate (method completes but does not charge final image). Minor cap: the method is mechanical rather than pressuring—once Maren applies it, success is assured without tradeoff. Band: solid integration across beats but limited agency constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stargazer's open tower (the setting) is vivid and present throughout: spiral staircase, arched windows, tessellated floor, open roof. Setup is immediate; middle beat involves tile and pedestal; payoff charges the final image ("stars emerged through the tower's open roof"). The tower supplies the magic square tile (causal), frames the whale migration (timeframe), and anchors Maren's ritual of inheritance. Three gates met; beat involvement ×3+; closure linkage strong (tower as witness to "the symphony played on"). Cost connection: the tower embodies Solveig's lifelong observation and Maren's acceptance. Specificity high; irreplaceability strong (the tower's open design and isolation matter). Minor cap: the tower does not visibly constrain a choice—Maren could decode elsewhere—so it functions more as charged atmosphere than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Whale migration (the timeframe) is signaled early ("the whales are moving," "whale migration had begun again"), recurs in the middle ("whales moved south in their ancient corridor"), and completes at closure ("the last whale passed the horizon"). Setup present; development weak (migration is parallel, not interactive); payoff present (temporal marker). It supplies atmospheric pressure and a live clock (hours pass as Maren transcribes). Cost connection: the migration's completion signals the end of Maren's transcription labor. Three gates met; beat involvement ×3; closure linkage moderate. Specificity: seasonal migration is thematically resonant but mechanically generic—any seasonal event could function similarly. Band: purposeful early–final reprise with moderate causal role but limited constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("to sculpt space for reflection") is introduced early ("Maren had come not to grieve, exactly, but to sculpt space for reflection") and drives the arc: Maren sorts, then transcribes, then accepts the archive's method as her inheritance. Setup immediate; middle beat (transcription as reflection-in-action) develops it; payoff present (final paragraph reframes reflection as listening). Desire is dramatized through choices (kneeling, decoding, hours of transcription). Friction is mild: Maren's skepticism and grief complicate but do not block her goal. Three gates met; beat involvement ×2+; closure linkage strong. Cost is conceptual (time, acceptance). Specificity: "sculpt space" is vivid and particular. Minor cap: the motivation is relatively frictionless—Maren's wants and costs align without sharp tradeoff, so the dramatized conflict is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone ("unheard symphony") is coherent and sustained: "the whole scene felt like an unheard symphony—enormous movements composing something just beyond the threshold of perception"; "the symphony played on, unheard and everywhere, and Maren listened." Setup is early; development consistent (whales' exhalations "like brief, silent bells"); payoff charges the final image. The tone modulates from grief-adjacent stillness to accumulative resonance, supporting pressure without static mood. Three gates met; beat involvement ×3; closure linkage strong (final line is tone's culmination). Specificity high; irreplaceability strong (the "unheard" quality defines Maren's stance and Solveig's archive). Cost connection: the tone embodies the effort of attention and the acceptance of unheard labor. Tone is purpose-driven and integral; removing it would collapse thematic coherence.</comment>
