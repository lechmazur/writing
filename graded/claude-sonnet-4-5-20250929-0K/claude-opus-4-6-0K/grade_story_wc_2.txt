<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior logic is consistent and grounded: her tinkerer's mindset drives her decision to follow the breadcrumb trail, and the shift from meticulous planning to improvisation is earned through accumulating mystery. Her embodied reactions ("ash on her fingers," handling the compass rose) anchor abstraction. The final choice to descend feels motivated by her established need to understand broken mechanisms. Minor: the epiphany about "befriending uncertainty" skirts label-speak but remains tied to her hands-on work, so no major deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—coincidences accumulate into pattern, forcing Maren to choose investigation over dismissal. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (workshop, waterfall, profession). Closure is Charged Poise: Maren assembles the mechanism, the needle points deeper, and she commits to descend without a map—options crystallize, the cost (abandoning her meticulous method) is felt, and the final image reweights her relationship to broken things. One meaningful deepening when she realizes the clocks form a single system. The compass-rose discovery and assembly sequence create causally linked beats under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall provides mist for rust-reading (functional constraint), white noise for concentration, and spatial grounding; the greenhouse's ash and swirling leaves create discovery conditions and atmosphere. The workshop bench becomes the site where Maren synthesizes clues. The compass needle pointing down charges the final image and drives her next move. Micro-setting (ash in planter, mist, leaves) constrains discovery and the ending choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to follow the mysterious trail versus remain in safe routine. Escalation occurs when Maren shifts from passive reception of clocks to active assembly, improvising without schematic—this choice narrows her options (she's committed to the mystery) and the cost is visible (she abandons her "careful planning" and "meticulous life"). The compass pointing deeper is a tightening that forecloses retreat. Agency is clear: her hands-on work and final decision to descend.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: restoration versus transformation, certainty versus improvisation, the patience of broken things. The final image—"some broken things do not want to be restored to what they were. They want to be rebuilt into what they were always meant to become"—is borderline thematic statement but lands as earned insight tied to her tactile assembly work and the compass's new function. The needle pointing down and her descent without a map provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to approach the unknown. Subtext operates in the fire-damaged clocks and hidden compass as vessels of concealed history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maren's professional lens ("carbon signature," "bearing size," "escapements"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads objects as storytellers. Diction stays within her technical yet lyrical register ("quiet violence," "patient thunder"). No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax when assembling, broader reflection in the greenhouse). Minor: "uncertainly certain" in one line risks cute phrasing but doesn't break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops, high information density, and clear propulsion. Sentence rhythms vary naturally; figurative language ("time's quiet violence," "waterfall's patient thunder") is purposeful and voice-motivated, not overwritten. The assembly sequence is concise and concrete. Opening line ("broken things spoke honestly") anchors voice and stakes; closing line ("followed the needle into the dark") recharges the journey motif with cost. No scaffold, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—clocks as breadcrumbs to a hidden naval secret—synthesizes mystery and craft in a specific way. The tinkerer's perspective and subterranean setting feel particular, not generic. The transformation test passes: swapping Maren for a generic detective or the compass for a generic artifact would flatten the story. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative design and the final turn to improvisation are competent but not bold. The ending's conceptual move (rebuild versus restore) is earned but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's profession drives her observation (rust patterns, carbon signatures, bearing sizes), her decision to follow the trail, and her improvised assembly without schematic. Present in setup, middle choices (follow vs. ignore; assemble vs. report), and the ending descent. Causal across three beats with visible cost (abandoning meticulous planning).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The compass rose appears mid-story in the greenhouse, is handled and examined ("turned it in her hands"), becomes the central pivot in the assembly sequence, and its needle pointing down drives the final choice to descend. Three distinct beats: discovery, assembly, and closure decision. High irreplaceability: its naval provenance and precision mechanics matter. Cost tied to it: committing to the mystery forecloses safety.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" is literalized (papers burned in the greenhouse, compass hidden under ash) and metaphorical (uncovering hidden history). It shapes discovery stakes and tactics (Maren must brush ash aside). Present in setup (ash in mantel clock chart) and middle (greenhouse discovery). The concept charges the final image: descending toward what Calloway hid "beneath the academy." Two gates clear; closure linkage is oblique but present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" appears once as a descriptor ("uncertainly certain of what she held") and is dramatized through her choice to improvise without a plan. The trait enables the final descent (she acts despite unknowns) with visible cost (no map, no schematic). Setup and payoff present; middle development is thinner. Swappability moderate: a near-synonym like "hesitantly sure" would reduce precision but not break the story.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Improvisation defines the climax: Maren assembles the mechanism "without a schematic, letting her hands think, letting intuition replace rigid certainty." This action is the major turn—she abandons her meticulous method and the assembly succeeds, pointing her deeper. Present in setup (stated choice to improvise), middle (hands-on assembly), and closure (following the needle). High causal weight; removing it would collapse the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse discovery occurs mid-story: "through the swirling leaves" Maren spots the compass rose. The method (visual search amid ash and wind-stirred leaves) matters—the leaves create movement that draws her eye. Present in setup (chart leading upward) and middle (the discovery beat). Payoff is indirect: the compass she finds there drives the ending. Two gates; causal role in one major beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The waterfall provides mist for rust-reading (professional constraint), white noise for concentration, and becomes the site of assembly and final decision. Present in setup, middle workspace, and closure scene. It pressures choices (her method depends on it) and the final line references it ("waterfall's patient thunder"). Three beats; causal and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is the inciting recognition that drives Maren's choice to follow the trail. The timeframe (accumulation of clues over recent deliveries, then a single day of discovery and assembly) tightens decisions: she must act on the pattern now. Present in setup (the framing line) and implicitly governs pacing. The time pressure is moderate—she could delay, but chooses not to. Two gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to "befriend uncertainty in planning" is dramatized through her shift from meticulous cataloging to improvisational assembly. The motivation is conflicted: her training demands a plan, but standing in the greenhouse she "chose to improvise." This friction drives the climax and closure. Present in setup (her meticulous nature), middle (the choice moment), and ending (descending without a map). Cost is visible: she abandons safety for discovery.</comment>
