<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular throughout, with her professional lens shaping perception ("read their ceilings the way other people read faces"). Her choice to mail the letters and promise the silence represents a motivated act of engagement tied to her established trait of noticing what's hidden, and the action forecloses a path (she could have left them concealed). Minor slip: the ghost's desire ("to be noticed, to engage") edges toward stock generalization rather than character-specific contradiction. The final stance—carrying the burden lighter than it had any right to be—feels earned by the pressure sequence and avoids therapy-speak.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of observing hidden pressures (dust, cracks, displaced tile) that accumulates toward the closure discovery; the fluorescent buzz dying marks a tightening that narrows Maren's attention and opens the ghost encounter. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mainspring barrel, cracked and empty, reweights the premise of "cracks in the façade" and the cost is felt in the image of burdens set down. Orientation anchors (Maren, ticket office, present day) arrive cleanly by the third paragraph. One persistent constraint—Maren's gift/curse of seeing ghosts—shapes her tactics and the final image of looking up.</comment>

<comment>The ticket office setting is vivid and purposeful: dust patterns guide Maren's discovery, the displaced ceiling tile serves as the hiding place, and the counter becomes a stage for the climactic retrieval. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, its "fine cracks...radiating from the hub where decades of stored tension had slowly split the brass" both describing the object and constraining Maren's understanding of pressure held too long. The fluorescent buzz and its death anchor the ghost encounter spatially and aurally. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional and personal priorities (dust as sediment, shafts as cathedral naves).</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: to discover what the ceiling hides, signaled early in Maren's habit of "looking up" and "searching for what was hidden behind the surface." The ghost's appearance creates a meaningful tightening by directing Maren's gaze to the displaced tile, narrowing options from general search to specific retrieval. The choice to mail the letters forecloses the path of leaving them hidden, with the cost legible in her promise to "the silence." The escalation is driven by Maren's observation (the shimmer, the pressure in her chest) rather than external antagonism, fitting the Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the ghost's cooperation feels convenient rather than hard-won, though the pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<comment>Theme—pressure held too long without release, invisible until the surface gives—emerges organically from the mainspring barrel's cracks, the mother's unmailed letters, and Maren's own near-death. The final image ("mostly air, mostly time, mostly the weight of not being seen") reweights the opening's "heavy and weightless at once" without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: Maren promises to mail the letters "to whatever family might remain," acknowledging uncertainty. The mainspring barrel's click and the ghost-fingers brushing hers provide a non-literal answer to the thematic question. Subtext operates cleanly in the juxtaposition of circus spectacle (sequined leotard, golden years) against hidden desperation.</comment>

<comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren; distance tightens appropriately during the ghost encounter without head-hopping. Voice is distinct and consistent: "shafts were her cathedral naves," "dust never lied," "the nature of old burdens finally set down." Perceptual signature is strong—Maren reads dust, ceilings, and pressure changes as a professional reads faces. Free indirect style is clean ("She did not flinch. She had learned long ago..."). Minor register slip: "retroactive omniscience" in the backstory compression ("the gift, or the curse, had started...") leans slightly expository, though it anchors quickly in present perception. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with strong sentence variety and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high: "pressure changes, faint discolorations in the air that carried the same weight as old grief carried in the chest—heavy and weightless at once" does triple work (defining ghosts, linking to Maren's emotional register, seeding the ending motif). Minor loop: "cracks" recurs (mainspring barrel, letters pressed through paper, façade) without always adding new pressure; the pattern is purposeful but edges toward self-consciousness. One filter-verb stack in the backstory ("had started...had learned") acceptable for compression. The closing paragraph's "mostly air, mostly time, mostly the weight" risks rhythm overbalance but stays voice-motivated and charges the image.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of elevator technician, ghost-seer, and horologist's artifact is specific and non-obvious; the mainspring barrel serves as both thematic vehicle and plot device without feeling ornamental. The transformation of "cracks in the façade" from circus-world glitter to personal desperation is earned through the unmailed letters and the photograph. Minor deduction: the ghost-as-guide setup (appearing, directing gaze upward, disappearing after the key clicks) follows a familiar helper-spirit template; the piece executes it well but does not transform the trope. The dust-reading method and the forty-second death origin story add fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) is present from the opening, drives the middle discovery (reading the ghost's cue, climbing onto the counter), and shapes the closure (mailing the letters, carrying the barrel). Her dual skill set enables the plot: observation identifies the displaced tile, ghost-sight provides the direction. The choice to engage—placing the key in the barrel, promising to mail the letters—alters the story's outcome and forecloses the path of leaving the cache hidden. Cost is legible: she takes on the burden of releasing another's grief. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓; two beats (ghost encounter, letter retrieval), causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mainspring barrel appears early (shelf behind carnival tickets), is handled twice (Maren turns it, examining cracks; she sets the key into it and feels the ghost-fingers), and returns at closure ("rode in her pocket, cracked and empty and lighter than it had any right to be"). Its specific property—cracks from stored tension—directly mirrors the theme and the mother's situation. The click when the key engages provides the ghost's release, making the object causally active at the ending. Setup ✓, Development (examination and metaphor) ✓, Payoff (key insertion, carried in pocket) ✓; irreplaceable mechanics (arbor hook, barrel façade) and charged reprise elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Cracks in the façade" shapes stakes and tactics on the page: the mainspring barrel's hairline fractures guide Maren's understanding of hidden pressure, the letters' pen-cracked paper reveals the mother's desperation, and Maren recognizes "that kind of damage" as her own. The concept is not merely thematic echo; it alters Maren's perception and motivates her choice to release what the façade concealed. Setup (mainspring cracks examined early) ✓, Development (letters "cracked through the paper in places") ✓, Payoff (final image of burdens set down, façade broken) ✓; causal pressure and closure linkage present, though the metaphor occasionally risks over-articulation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Skillfully observant" is dramatized rather than labeled: Maren analyzes dust accumulation patterns ("thickest along the window ledge but curiously thin in a rectangle"), notices the displaced ceiling tile, and reads the mainspring barrel's cracks as "decades of stored tension." The trait enables two key beats (dust analysis, tile discovery) and shapes the closure choice (she promises to mail the letters because she has seen what was hidden). Setup (established in opening: "she read their ceilings the way other people read faces") ✓, Development (dust and tile observations) ✓, Payoff (understanding the barrel and letters) ✓. Minor deduction: no visible tradeoff or cost tied directly to hyper-observation; the trait is purely enabling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Engage" appears explicitly ("ghosts only wanted what the living wanted: to be noticed, to engage") and implicitly in Maren's choice to interact with the ghost, retrieve the letters, and promise to mail them. The action is present in two beats (ghost encounter, letter retrieval) and shapes the ending (engagement fulfilled by mailing the letters). Setup (established as ghost-world rule) ✓, Development (Maren does not flinch, follows the ghost's cue) ✓, Payoff (promise to release the hidden material) ✓. However, the action could be replaced with "help," "witness," or "release" with minor edits; the exact verb does not uniquely define the turn, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is signaled early ("she always did, began analyzing dust...the way a geologist reads sediment") and matters causally: the thin rectangle on the counter suggests recent removal, priming Maren to look for hidden objects. The method shapes one key beat (noticing the pattern that points toward concealment) but does not recur or constrain later choices; once the ghost appears, dust analysis is abandoned. Setup ✓, Development (one beat: noticing the rectangle) ✓, Payoff (absent; the ending does not return to dust) ✗. Functional but underused; swappable with "reading surfaces" or "noticing disturbances" without major structural change.</comment>

<comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies the key, the shelf with the mainspring barrel, the counter Maren climbs, and the ceiling tile hiding the letters—four micro-resources that affect outcome. The setting's specificity (sun-cracked plywood, dead bulbs, fluorescent tube, dust layers) grounds the ghost encounter spatially and tonally. Setup ✓ (office described immediately), Development (counter and ceiling tile enable retrieval) ✓, Payoff (office as the site of discovery and promise) ✓. The setting constrains choice (Maren must physically climb to reach the tile) and charges the tone (decayed spectacle mirrors the hidden grief). Deduction: the office does not pressure Maren's choice to mail the letters; it functions more as container than antagonist.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" serves as the timeframe marker that opens the ghost encounter and tightens the scene: the buzz's death creates silence, the room changes, and the ghost appears. The moment is dramatized on the page ("Then the fluorescent buzz died off. In the silence, the room changed") and alters Maren's perception and tactics. Setup (fluorescent described as "electrical drone she had learned to measure silence against") ✓, Development (buzz dies, enabling ghost visibility) ✓, Payoff (the encounter and retrieval follow directly) ✓. The timeframe is causal rather than ornamental, though it does not create ongoing pressure (no ticking clock after the buzz dies).</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is dramatized in Maren's opening habit ("eleven years...looking up. Shafts were her cathedral naves...she read their ceilings...searching for what was hidden behind the surface") and drives the plot: she follows the ghost's upward gaze, pushes the tile aside, and retrieves the hidden box. The motivation is conflicted implicitly (the gift/curse framing) and shapes two beats (initial search orientation, tile discovery) plus the closure (she will release what was hidden). Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓; causal pressure and closure linkage present. Minor deduction: the motivation is curiosity-driven rather than friction-laden; no visible cost to discovering (no danger, no trade-off), capping just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Weightless burden" is established early ("heavy and weightless at once") and modulates through the piece: the ghost's presence ("pressure behind her sternum"), the letters' weight (pen cracked through paper), and the ending image ("cracked and empty and lighter than it had any right to be...mostly air, mostly time"). The tone is coherent across turns, supporting the accumulative pressure without flattening into single-note melancholy. Setup (opening description of ghosts) ✓, Development (pressure and weight imagery recur) ✓, Payoff (final line: "lighter than it had any right to be") ✓. The tone charges the final image by reweighting the opening's paradox, making the conceptual cost legible.</comment>
