<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular ("investigated by observing gaps"), and her choice to wear the boutonniere and return to her vigil carries visible cost through isolation. The character shows embodied contradictions—maintaining a lighthouse for ships that don't come while accepting "eccentric" without resistance. Minor slip: the stranger's gesture is more observed than dramatized through Maren's micro-choices until the final act, limiting internal conflict visibility in the middle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the piece accumulates through borrowed memories, the boutonniere as physical anchor, and Maren's method of reading gaps, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she accepts her role as keeper of borrowed memories with visible cost (ongoing isolation, the boutonniere "like a small, dry heart"). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure reweights her vigil from eccentric to memorial with conceptual cost legible in "ongoing" duration and the final image of light reaching for ships that may never come.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal dock constrains the narrative frame (where the stranger appeared, where Maren investigates), and the mist functions as both atmospheric pressure and metaphor that charges the closure ("the mist carried the light outward"). The boutonniere as micro-object (Edelweiss from the Alps, preservation across distance) drives investigation and becomes the physical token she wears. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "mist pressed close, softly persistent, the way grief occupies a house after a funeral."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: decode the stranger's gesture and understand her own role. The tightening occurs when Maren shifts from observation to embodiment—pinning the boutonniere and returning to light the lamp, a choice that forecloses the possibility of abandoning her post. Cost is visible: she accepts ongoing isolation as memorial keeper. The piece earns its quiet escalation through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories and vicarious witness emerges entirely through concrete action: the boutonniere, the date that predates her tenure, her decade of vigil for strangers. The final image—"borrowed memories and the gorgeous, unanswerable gaps between people who almost, but never quite, meet"—is earned by prior particulars and reweights her isolation as a form of connection. The cloud journal entry "Fog type: memorial. Duration: ongoing" transforms observation into elegy without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Maren reads weather, mechanical failure, and loneliness by "the outline of what was absent." Diction remains character-specific ("the way the dock accepted barnacles—without enthusiasm, without resistance") and modulates under pressure without breaking voice. POV distance is stable; the piece sustains close third with no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in phrases like "the fog finished him" and "the mist held" serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("the sea owed someone a return," "borrowed memories of passage"). Rhythm varies: longer lyric sentences during reflection, shorter declaratives at closure ("The light turned. The mist held."). Minor issue: "pressed close, softly persistent" and "softly persistent" recur within three paragraphs, a template echo that slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper, borrowed memories, and the stranger's deposit is specific and non-obvious; the piece transforms the familiar vigil premise through the idea of memorial by proxy. The final reconfiguration—Maren as keeper of others' experiences—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present in the quiet, elliptical structure and the reliance on accumulation over causal turn, executed with coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive two key beats: investigating the boutonniere and deciding to pin it to her coat and return to the tower. Her method (observing gaps) is demonstrated on the page and shapes her understanding. The final act—lighting the lamp with the boutonniere in her lapel—directly expresses her acceptance of the keeper role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The boutonniere appears in three distinct beats: discovery (with card and date), investigation on the dock (turned over in her fingers, analyzed for origin), and closure (pinned to her coat, described as "a small, dry heart"). It charges the final image and its preservation across distance supplies irreplaceable specificity. Removal would collapse the investigation's anchor and the physical token of borrowed memory.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape Maren's understanding of her role and the stranger's gesture; the concept is dramatized through her reflection on "carrying experiences that belong to strangers" and her decision to accept the boutonniere as a deposit. It constrains her final choice (to continue the vigil as memorial keeper) but operates more as thematic lens than tactical pressure in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is applied to the mist and to Maren's method, signaling her approach. It enables her investigation by observing gaps rather than interrogating directly, and the phrase recurs at closure ("softly persistent, reaching for ships"). The trait is enacted rather than merely labeled, though its cost is implied more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Investigation anchors the middle act: Maren comes to the dock "to investigate" and her method (observing gaps) is demonstrated. The action is signaled early and shapes one key turn (understanding the gesture as deposit). However, the investigation itself is more contemplative than physically enacted, and the resolution arises from reflection rather than discovered evidence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is signaled early, demonstrated in her reading of weather and loneliness, and applied on the dock ("she looked for the gap the stranger had left"). The method enables her to decode the gesture as borrowed memory and deposit. It shapes two beats and is irreplaceable to her character logic, though the mechanics remain abstract rather than procedural.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal dock is the site of the stranger's appearance, Maren's investigation, and the visual anchor for the lighthouse beam at closure. Its iridescent planks and isolation pressure her choices; it "floated in a white nowhere" during the peak contemplation. The dock's visibility from the tower and under the beam makes it essential to the story's spatial logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named and described in the opening ("that narrow corridor between civil dark and true dark") and establishes atmosphere. Maren returns "at this same hour" to investigate. The timeframe creates tonal coherence but does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics; the investigation could occur at another hour without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to decode the stranger's gesture drives the investigation and is dramatized through her arrival at the dock and analysis of the boutonniere. Friction is present: the message is "not for her, and yet it had been left where only she would find it." The resolution (understanding it as deposit, not message) shapes her final choice to accept the keeper role, with visible cost in ongoing isolation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout and charges every image: "the only witnessed thing in all that isolation," the mist as occupying presence, the light reaching for ships that may never come. Tone modulates from observation (opening) to contemplation (dock scene) to acceptance (closure) without breaking the atmosphere. The final line—"gorgeous, unanswerable gaps between people who almost, but never quite, meet"—is the distilled expression of the tone and indispensable to closure.</comment>
