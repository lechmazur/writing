<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through physical cost ("knuckles swell," "molar loosen"). The covenant's price grounds his choices in contradictory impulses—sacrificing his body to restore his daughter's voice. Minor slip: Lenka remains off-page until the ending, making her silence more told than dramatized in interiority. The final choice feels earned by the established covenant logic and visible bodily cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (who, where, when). The tethering act drives the closure: chip to spring → music box plays → Lenka speaks, with visible cost (years drained, joints swelling). Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change with felt cost legible in "his back bent further under the weight of the bargain." One meaningful tightening through the covenant's price narrows options and forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it amplifies truth hidden in objects, making the tethering possible. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("sound lived as a physical thing—pooling in corners, dripping"). The chamber's throb during the tethering charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear (underground, spiral stairs, upstairs bedroom).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: reclaim Lenka's stolen voice. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias places the chip directly on the mainspring, narrowing options (he must pay the covenant's price now). The cost is legible on-page: swollen knuckles, loosened molar, years drained. Agency is decision with visible bodily sacrifice. Pressure coheres under the causal lens and the price forecloses the path of delaying or half-measures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the balance between restoration and decay, the price of healing what isn't visibly broken. The chip/covenant motif constrains choice and charges the closure without being stated as a moral. "The invisible distance between a note and its meaning" returns at the end as tinkersong that resonates with stolen things. Final image offers a non-literal answer (the rust waits) that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV stable in close third; perceptual signature is consistent (sound as physical texture, metallurgical terms). Diction matches the focalizer's expertise ("comb pristine," "covenant of rust"). Distance modulates purposefully during the tethering sequence, compressing diction under pressure. No head-hopping. Lenka's single note and word are filtered through Elias's perception, maintaining focalization. Psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory momentum. Information density is high—most lines serve multiple jobs. Minor artifact: "the kind that follows a held breath finally released" leans slightly purple in a high-pressure beat, though it doesn't obscure the closure image. No loops or paraphrase cycles detected. Figurative language mostly stays coherent, with one mixed vehicle ("sound lived as a physical thing—pooling, dripping, shimmering like heat") blending liquid and thermal metaphors without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The covenant of rust offers a fresh angle on healing and cost: mending what isn't torn and paying entropy's price with the body. The premise transforms the music-box-repairman trope through specific metallurgical logic and embodied sacrifice. Emotional specificity (daughter's silence after solstice, father's physical decay) avoids generic templates. One minor proximity concern: "light stolen by midnight" echoes fairy-tale diction, though it's integrated into the story's logic. Bold risk in making the climax quiet (a note, a name) rather than spectacular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias drives the key turn: he decides to tether the chip to the mainspring, accepting the covenant's cost. His choice alters tactics (direct binding vs. adjustment) and shapes the closure (his bent back, Lenka's voice). Present in setup, middle choice, and ending consequence. High causal pressure and irreplaceability—the story would fail without his decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chip appears in setup (sewn into glove lining), middle development (placed on mainspring), and closure (tethering complete, covenant paid). Three distinct beats with escalating causal pressure. Specific properties matter: it binds Elias to the covenant, resists decay, demands equilibrium. Cost tied directly to its use (years drained, joints swelling). High irreplaceability—removing it breaks the story's core mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The covenant shapes stakes from the start: Elias's silver hair, aching joints, wilting near lies establish the price. It constrains the tethering choice (he knows the cost) and narrows tactics (he must pay now). Closure hinges on covenant logic: "rust, for once, waited." Present in setup, drives middle action, charges ending. Strong causal pressure, though slightly more thematic than tactical in some beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Wilting near dishonesty is mentioned in setup ("posture buckled, skin grayed, fingers trembled") but never constrains an on-page choice. No scene tests this trait with visible cost. It characterizes Elias but remains ornamental—could be removed without affecting plot or closure. Label-only attribute without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tethering the chip to the mainspring is the story's hinge: Elias "began to tether...binding stone to steel in a union that should have been impossible." This action triggers the covenant's price (knuckles swell, molar loosens, years drain) and causes the music box to play the tinkersong that frees Lenka's voice. Present in setup as a method ("adjust something imperceptible"), executed mid-story, pays off at closure. High causal necessity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mending what isn't torn is signaled early ("mechanically flawless...nothing to repair. Which meant everything needed mending") and shapes the attempt: Elias doesn't fix broken parts, he adjusts the imperceptible. The method's mechanics matter at closure—tethering the chip is the ultimate act of mending the invisible. Present in setup, drives middle tactic, essential to ending logic. Strong causal role and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber enables the tethering: "designed for this: to amplify the truth hidden inside objects." It supplies the necessary resource (amplification throb) and constrains action (Elias must work underground). Spatial details anchor the closure (he hears Lenka "through the stone floors"). Present in setup, enables middle action, charges ending through sensory reprise ("settled into silence"). Strong integration though slightly more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"In the balance" appears as a loose frame ("the longest midnight," "blue-dark hours before dawn") but doesn't tighten decisions on the page. No live countdown pressures tactics. Time is evoked thematically (six months of silence, solstice night) but remains untracked during the tethering sequence. Present in setup and implied at closure ("the rust, for once, waited"), moderate thematic charge, but weak tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to reclaim the stolen light is stated early ("plain and desperate") and dramatized through the tethering choice with visible friction: Elias pays bodily cost (years, joints, teeth) to restore Lenka's voice. The desire conflicts with self-preservation, creating authentic tension. Present in setup, drives middle sacrifice, fulfilled at closure (Lenka speaks). Strong causal necessity and embodied cost tied to the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tinkersong wonder is coherent through turns: lyric diction ("resonance chamber hummed like a heart"), metaphysical compression ("sound lived as a physical thing"), and the climactic "tinkersong wonder that spiraled through the resonance chamber like dawn breaking underground." Tone modulates under pressure (sentence rhythm tightens during tethering) and charges the final image ("the rust, for once, waited"). Strong tonal consistency, though wonder occasionally tips toward ornament in non-pressure beats.</comment>
