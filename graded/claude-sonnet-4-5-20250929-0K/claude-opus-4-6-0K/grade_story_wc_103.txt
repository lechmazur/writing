<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently embodied through her professional lens as a maze designer, with contradictory impulses—compulsion versus self-preservation—acting simultaneously in scene. Her choice to press the halo fragment and set down the camera demonstrates visible cost (foreclosing documentation) earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for the eleven-year span reducing micro-choice granularity in the present frame; most pivotal choices occur in reflection rather than contested real-time beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece teaches its pattern early (fading photographs, root rearrangement) and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara recognizes the garden is dissolving temporal boundaries, and she sets down her camera with visible cost (abandoning documentation/proof). The hyperbolic geometry reweights prior material, the halo fragment crystallizes the garden's scar-tissue logic, and the final image ("time that had no edges, only roots") reprices the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors are present by ~100 words (Elara, living bridge garden, eleven-year span). One meaningful deepening occurs when the halo fragment restores the photograph and reveals her future self, tightening the temporal loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choice throughout—root rearrangement, hyperbolic folding, ravine depth—and charges the final image when Elara walks "deeper into a time that had no edges, only roots." Sensory detail is filtered through professional priorities (ficus, rubber tree, hedge maze comparisons) and the halo fragment functions as micro-setting, pulsing at a frequency she "heard in her sternum." Minor deduction: the mist-thick ravines and "cathedral arch" trend slightly toward postcard grandeur in the middle passages.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the garden's temporal consumption) is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful deepening: the halo fragment restores color to the photograph and reveals her future self, forcing Elara to choose between documentation and immersion. The final act (pressing fragment, setting down camera) forecloses the path of external proof with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights options. Minor deduction: the eleven-year span compresses much escalation into summary rather than on-page tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—temporal dissolution, scar tissue around astronomical trauma, the maze designer trapped in a maze—without explicit statement. The halo fragment and fading photographs recur with shifted meaning, and the final image ("time that had no edges, only roots") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (can she discover time's texture) by collapsing distinction between past/present/future. The garden-as-labyrinth inversion is earned through prior causality, and the line "she had designed labyrinths... to trap others... Now the garden had designed one to trap her, and she was grateful" delivers thematic payoff without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and professional (hedge maze comparisons, hyperbolic geometry, "gauze-white shapes"). Diction remains controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("fibrous, knotted, alive as root"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") appear but are voice-motivated and legible. Minor deduction: one filter-verb stack in the middle section ("She should have stopped... she came more often, driven by...") slightly dulls immediacy, and the phrase "quaking reverie" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or temporal logic. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final paragraph accelerates via stacked short clauses ("Perhaps it had. Perhaps she had."). Minor deductions accumulate: one paraphrase loop ("The garden was feeding her its past while draining her present" / "consuming her photographs... trying to disintegrate the boundary") and slight overwriting in the hyperbolic-geometry passage ("saddle-curved surfaces nested inside its canopy, warping distance") where figurative density risks obscuring the causal claim. The opening's "swallowed something deeper. It swallowed memory" is effective anaphora, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze designer, hyperbolic geometry, fading photographs, and astronomical halo fragment is specific and non-obvious; removal of any element would break the logic. The garden-as-temporal-labyrinth inversion is earned through prior particulars (hedge mazes across four continents, roots rearranging overnight). Risk-taking in the hyperbolic-geometry framing and retrocognitive trapping elevates stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "halo fragment" as astronomical remnant arrives late and its origin (ring structure around "something vast") remains abstract; slightly more grounding in earlier beats would strengthen inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession shapes observation (hedge maze comparisons, spatial puzzle recognition) and her decision to press the halo fragment and set down the camera are key turns tied to her identity as designer. Present across all three gates; drives at least two beats (photograph restoration, final immersion) and contributes causally to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears at setup (nested in oldest bridge), enables the photograph-restoration beat, and is pressed against the bridge in the closure, pulsing once before cooling. Handled in three distinct beats with evolving meaning (discovery → tool → integration). Its astronomical origin and "scar tissue" logic are specific and irreplaceable; minor deduction for late first appearance (~60% mark).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fading photographs frame the entire narrative, alter tactics (Elara visits more often, seeks understanding), and the moment when the halo fragment restores color—revealing her future self—is the story's pivotal turn. The final act (setting down the camera) directly engages the concept with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives causal pressure and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trapping is dramatized on the page ("she woke knowing the exact weight of rain... in 1953") and constrains Elara's perception, enabling her to "feel the grain of historical moments." It shapes middle choices and contributes to closure theme. One visible cost: her present is drained. Minor deduction: the trait is more thematic accent than tactical constraint in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Disintegration is core to the fading-photograph mechanism and thematic logic ("trying to disintegrate the boundary between her moments"). Present in setup and closure participation (boundary collapse), but the action itself is passive/environmental rather than protagonist-driven. Functional and irreplaceable, but does not create a major turn through Elara's agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled at ~40% ("through hyperbolic geometry, she realized, the garden was folding") and its mechanics matter—saddle curves, distance warping, pleating—shaping Elara's understanding and the climactic unfolding ("hyperbolic space unfurled around her"). Present in middle and closure; constrains perception and charges the final image. Minor deduction for late explicit naming.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden pressures every choice: root rearrangement, ravine depth, hyperbolic folding, and the cathedral arch where the halo fragment is found. It supplies the temporal consumption mechanism, alters Elara's tactics (repeated visits, professional analysis), and is indispensable to the closure image ("bridges grew on, patient and impossible"). Present across all three gates with high causal integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to "discover the texture of time" is dramatized through repeated visits, photograph analysis, and the journal entry ("the exact weight of rain... Tuesdays heavier than Wednesdays"). Friction emerges between this want and the cost (her present erased). The motivation drives the halo-fragment choice and the final immersion. Present in setup, middle, and closure with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quaking reverie is invoked explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("the quaking reverie that overtook her was not fear but recognition") and the tone modulates from analytical early passages to lyric compression at closure ("time that had no edges, only roots"). Coherent throughout and charges the final image. Minor deduction: the explicit naming of the tone in a late beat edges toward self-commentary rather than full embodiment.</comment>
