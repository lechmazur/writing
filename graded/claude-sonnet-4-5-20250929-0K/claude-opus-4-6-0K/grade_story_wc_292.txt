<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and character-particular throughout ("nervously confident hands, the kind of confidence that comes from years of handling fragile documents while knowing that this particular document could undo you"). Her motivation—to honor Astrid—drives the cipher-work and final decision to appeal with visible cost (reversing family shame, carrying evidence forward). The embodied emotion at peak beats (trembling hand, pressing palm flat) and micro-choices (photographing pages, placing the copper nail as bookmark) anchor her agency. Minor slip: the grandmother remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses complicate Maren's stance during the decoding beat, though the closure choice itself is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beats (Maren Solvig, map librarian, rescue boat to Varre Island weather station). The piece operates under a Causal lens: shifted jet stream → station silenced → Maren's arrival → discovery of journals → decoding → decision to file appeal. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Maren will reverse Astrid's exile by filing appeal, rewriting the family map; the cost is legible on-page ("the name," carrying the nail, the weight of reversing eighty years). One meaningful tightening (cipher revelation narrows her options to public action). The ellipsis from decoding to dawn departure is motivated and changes knowledge without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The weather station's sensory detail is vivid and selective: "pale fungi," radomes dripping condensation, air tasting of ozone and wet paper, cracked porthole misting sea spray. The setting constrains Maren's search (lower lab, supply closet plastic) and the abandoned crew effects charge the isolation. The copper nail as micro-object constrains her final choice (bookmark in the oldest journal), and the jet stream's rewriting of weather patterns mirrors the family-map revision at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves; no tourist-catalog drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Maren seeks evidence to reverse her grandmother's exile. One meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded journals reveal Astrid's resistance work, narrowing Maren's options to filing the appeal or suppressing the truth. The decision to photograph, seal, and carry the journals forward is protagonist-driven with visible cost: she will reopen family shame and government scrutiny. The jet stream shift functions as atmospheric pressure rather than direct obstacle; the core escalation is internal (dread loosening as courage is confirmed). No coincidence resolves the conflict; Maren's agency at closure earns the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—hidden loyalty and reversible exile—emerges organically from the journals' coded stanzas and Maren's question "Were you brave?" The final image (reading courage aloud while the jet stream howls its new song) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. The copper nail shifts from grave-impulse to bookmark/marker, charging the closure without symbolic convenience (it was present from the funeral beat). Subtext operates in silence and gesture (prying the nail, pressing palm flat, the question asked aloud to an empty station). The piece resists tidy resolution; Astrid's exile reversal remains procedural and future-tense, the cost carried rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance tightens during peak beats (decoding, asking the question). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "spongey dread," "water-warped and swollen," "nervously confident hands"—each phrase is character-specific and texturally distinct. The prose reflects Maren's map-librarian precision (coordinates, dates, names; "bathymetric poetry"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The final beat's compression ("while the jet stream howled its new and unfamiliar song") maintains voice consistency under emotional pressure. Minor note: one stock phrase appears ("the kind of confidence that comes from..."), but the surrounding texture is strong enough that it does not materially harm voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; information density is high throughout (every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot). Rhythm varies naturally: short declaratives during action ("She set down the pencil"), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. The opening and closing images are charged and purposeful. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence runs, no figurative muddle in peak beats. Grammar and usage are clean; pronoun references unambiguous. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. The piece passes the read-aloud ear test with natural propulsion and no sluggish stretches. Standout line: "The map of her family had just been redrawn."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather-station isolation, coded journals, and reversible exile is specific and non-obvious; the jet stream's rewriting of weather patterns as structural mirror for family-map revision feels earned rather than imposed. The decoding method (capitalized letters → coordinates) is fresh and plausible within the WWII-resistance frame. Minor friction: the station's evacuation and Maren's solo arrival follow a familiar discovery-quest template; the piece transforms it through lived detail (map librarian's handling of fragile documents, copper nail impulse) but does not fully escape the prompt's scaffolding. No close echoes of famous lines; emotional specificity (asking "Were you brave?" aloud) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its premise without bold structural deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's choices create key turns: she decodes the journals, asks the question aloud, photographs the pages, places the nail as bookmark, and commits to filing the appeal. Her idealism is implicit in the decision to reverse the exile despite procedural difficulty. Present across setup (arrival with satchel), middle (decoding work), and payoff (final choice to file appeal). Two distinct beats of agency (decoding, final decision) with closure linkage. Causal pressure is strong; the choice alters tactics (carrying evidence to Bergen, then archives). Visible cost: reopening family shame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three beats: funeral impulse (setup), holding it during decoding (middle), and placing it in the journal spine as bookmark (payoff). It shifts from unexamined impulse to answer-carrier to grave-marker for truth. Present across all three gates; the closure reprise reweights its meaning (question → answer). Two distinct beats of handling with closure linkage. Minor friction: the nail's placement as bookmark is symbolic more than causally constraining; it does not narrow options or enable tactics, though it charges the final image. Cost connection is conceptual (marking the truth) rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reversible exile is the story's engine: Astrid's exile was reversible via appeal with new evidence; Maren's discovery of the journals provides that evidence; her final decision to file the appeal enacts the concept on-page. The phrase "reversible exile" appears twice, charged as "strange and sacred, like a prayer spoken backward to undo a curse." Present in setup (family history), middle (realization that evidence exists), and payoff (commitment to file appeal). Causal pressure is undeniable: the concept narrows Maren's options to file or suppress. Visible cost: carrying the name, reopening scrutiny. Irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this exact mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Nervously confident hands" appears once in the opening decoding beat, describing Maren's approach to the journals. The trait is embodied (white knuckles around satchel strap, trembling hand, pressing palm flat) but not labeled again. The nervous confidence enables her to open the fragile documents while knowing they could undo her—an on-page tradeoff. Present in setup and implicit in middle (trembling during decoding) but not explicitly reprised at closure. One beat of visible constraint with modest cost. Functional but not irreplaceable; other traits could produce similar handling without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The question "Were you brave?" is asked aloud in the humming station; the journals answer yes; the closure turns on Maren "reading her grandmother's courage out loud, one coded stanza at a time." Present in middle (the question) and payoff (reading aloud). The action shifts Maren's stance from private doubt to public commitment. Causal: asking the question crystallizes her decision to file the appeal. Two beats with closure linkage. Visible cost: voicing the question makes the answer undeniable. Not easily swappable; the act of questioning and answering structures the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The coded stanzas are the story's fulcrum: Maren recognizes the cipher (Astrid used it in personal letters), decodes capitalized letters into coordinates/dates/names, and discovers the resistance network. The mechanics matter: "bathymetric poetry," the journals' survival despite the Karmsund's wreck. Present in setup (water-warped journals beside porthole), middle (decoding with pencil), and payoff (photographing every page, sealing them). Three beats with strong causal pressure: the method provides the evidence Maren needs. Irreplaceable; no other discovery mechanism would preserve the historical specificity. Visible cost: the journals' fragility and the eighty-year wait charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The weather station supplies isolation (evacuated crew, no one to read the data), resources (supply closet plastic for sealing journals), and atmospheric pressure (radomes dripping, ozone taste, groaning under gusts). The cracked porthole misting sea spray enables the journals' discovery in the lower lab. Present in setup (arrival, station description), middle (search and decoding in lab), and payoff (station groans as Maren reads aloud). Two beats where setting alters tactics (finding journals, sealing them). Causal pressure is moderate; the station enables discovery but does not constrain choices as sharply as the journals themselves. Closure linkage via the groaning station and howling jet stream.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The jet stream shift occurs eleven days before Maren's arrival; the station went silent three days after that. The timeframe brackets the story (past shift → present discovery → dawn departure). Time does not tighten decisions on-page; Maren works through the journals without a live clock. Present in setup (temporal anchor) and payoff (rescue boat returns at dawn) but does not constrain middle choices. Functional as atmosphere (the shifted jet stream rewrites weather patterns, mirroring the family-map revision) but replaceable with minor edits. No visible cost tied to the timeframe itself; Maren's work pace is untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's desire to honor Astrid is dramatized throughout: arriving because "her grandmother's name was in the station's logs, and nobody else remembered why that mattered"; carrying the copper nail since the funeral; decoding the journals; asking "Were you brave?" aloud; committing to file the appeal. The motivation is conflicted (nervously confident, spongey dread loosening) and drives all key choices. Present in setup (arrival, family history), middle (decoding, question), and payoff (commitment to appeal, carrying the name). Three beats with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Visible cost: reopening exile scrutiny, carrying the weight of reversing eighty years. Irreplaceable; the story's emotional and plot logic depends on this exact motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is named once ("the spongey dread that had followed her onto the island finally began to loosen its grip") and implied earlier (white knuckles, nervously confident, pulse loud in ears, trembling hand). The tone is coherent through turns: dread during arrival and opening, loosening as the journals answer her question, replaced by sacred resolve at closure. Modulates with pressure appropriately. Present in setup (implicit in body language), middle (trembling, pulse), and payoff (loosening into something she could carry). Two beats with closure linkage. The tone charges the final image (dread softening while the jet stream howls) but does not constrain a choice. Swappable with similar emotional descriptors without breaking logic.</comment>
