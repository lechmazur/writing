<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is embodied through her careful physical movements and her reading of dust patterns—a character-particular way of seeing. Her mission to magnify kindnesses is shown through concrete choices (separating the button onto acid-free tissue, copying the penciled line) rather than declared. The backstory about Mrs. Aguilar and the librarian anchors her present stance without flattening momentum. One micro slip: "She did this through accumulated dust patterns" tells method rather than showing discovery in scene, but the cost of her broken heart made useful appears consistently on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through the button discovery, the penciled note, and the imagined history of Mr. Alderman, culminating in Miriam's preserving act and the final image of dust motes as histories settling into patience. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she will continue this work, having demonstrated its cost and purpose. Orientation anchors (file room, post-transparency law, Miriam's role) land by ~10% of text. The cost—her daily heartbreak transformed into utility—is visible throughout and charged in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The file room's smell of "paper slowly becoming earth" and steel shelving create a specific tactile world. Micro-setting operates effectively: the dust patterns themselves become a diagnostic tool that constrains Miriam's method and charges the final image ("Each mote a tiny history"). The acid-free tissue and the folder's physical state (rounded edges vs. uniform gray coat) are handled as tools that shape her archival choices. One minor note: the Euclid branch librarian and Mrs. Aguilar anchor backstory but don't pressure the present scene directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ensuring small kindnesses survive in the records—is signaled early and tightens through the button discovery. The penciled line about Mr. Alderman nearly illegible creates escalation: Miriam must preserve it before it fades. Her choice to transcribe the line and inventory the button with care forecloses passivity and demonstrates visible cost (her broken heart, daily exposure to compressed lives). Under Accumulative lens, the deepening operates through density increase and cadence shift in the final image, reweighting the opening premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Miriam's mission and the contrast between the state's skeletal records and the off-page kindnesses that saved her. The button and penciled note are specific particulars, not symbolic tokens. The final image—dust motes as histories settling into patience—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how love persists in bureaucratic archives. No thematic echo or moralizing; the piece trusts the reader to infer meaning from Miriam's on-page choices and the closing metaphor that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Miriam reads dust like sediment, notices what archivists notice. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("a garbage bag of clothes and a GED," "the careful posture of someone who had learned"). The single brief reflection about her own file anchors in the present via the transparency law and tilts her current mission. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close when she imagines the veteran and boy, pulling back for the final image. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and information-dense: sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "After the emancipation of the county records last spring..." anchors time, law, and consequence in one beat). Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive (paper becoming earth, dust as sediment, histories compressed into pages). Minor loop: "the small kindnesses were visible" in paragraph echoes "magnify small kindnesses" from earlier without adding pressure. The final image recharges the opening's paper-to-earth metaphor with the dust-as-history extension. No template cadence or paraphrase runs that obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—an archivist reading foster-care histories through dust patterns—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of tropes (bureaucratic coldness vs. human kindness) is grounded in concrete detail: the button, the penciled note, the act of transcription. The piece avoids both the sentimental foster-care story and the cynical state-critique story by synthesizing them through Miriam's tactile, embodied method. Risk: the accumulative structure and quiet ending could flatten in less skilled hands, but here the cost and closure land cleanly. Derivative check passes: no close echo of template plots or famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam as broken-hearted archivist drives the setup (her mission stated early), middle choices (separating the button, transcribing the note), and closure (returning the button, pulling the next folder). Her specific brand of broken heart—made useful rather than paralyzing—constrains tactics and charges the final image. The trait is embodied in action across all three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The infantryman's button appears in setup (tucked in the file), middle (examined, imagined in the veteran's hand), and closure (returned to its place with inventory). It drives the key reversal: discovery prompts Miriam to preserve the penciled note. Its specificity (brass, eagle, letter I, patina) matters and the object's meaning reweights between discovery and return. Removing it would break the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unknown histories as core concept frames the opening stakes (adults requesting files, Miriam's own missing kindnesses) and shapes middle tactics (reading dust, imagining Mr. Alderman). It appears in the closure image ("Each mote a tiny history") with conceptual reweighting. The concept is more than thematic echo—it alters Miriam's method and charges the final reconfiguration. Strong integration, though slightly more abstract than character or object elements.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tactfully hopeful as attribute is stated once ("tactfully hopeful attention") and demonstrated in Miriam's careful preservation work. It constrains her choices—she does not editorialize, only ensures kindnesses are visible—but the label itself does not return or create visible friction. The trait is present and functional but could be swapped for "gentle" or "reverent" without major structural impact. Mid-band: shapes one key stance without recurring pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unfurl drives the discovery beat: separating compressed pages causes the button to drop. The action is specific (not just "opening" but "unfurl") and its mechanics matter—decades of weight had fused the documents. Removing this exact action would require restructuring the discovery. It appears in setup and middle but does not reappear at closure; strong causal work in two beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reading through accumulated dust patterns is signaled early ("reading the physical record the way a geologist reads sediment") and its mechanics shape middle choices: soft edges vs. uniform gray coat, anomalies where someone returned. The method constrains what Miriam can know and charges her interpretive work. It does not appear in the closure action itself but primes the final dust-mote image. Two-gate integration (setup, middle); lyric reprise in the ending metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The foster care file room pressures Miriam's choices throughout: the smell, the steel shelving, the folders' physical states all shape her method. The basement windows and settling dust supply the final image that reweights the premise. Micro-setting (the folder, the acid-free tissue) alters tactics in the middle beat. Strong spatial coherence; removing the setting would collapse both method and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After the emancipation (transparency law, last spring) frames the story's causality: it creates the flood of requests and makes Miriam's work possible. The timeframe tightens the dominant stake (adults waiting for files) and anchors backstory (her own file read "on the first day the law took effect"). It does not create a live ticking clock in the present scene, so pressure is contextual rather than urgent. Setup and middle presence; moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>To magnify small kindnesses is stated as Miriam's mission early and dramatized through her choices: inventorying the button, transcribing the fading note, imagining Mr. Alderman. The motivation is conflicted—it costs her daily heartbreak—and drives the final action (returning the button, pulling the next folder). The friction between her want (preserve kindnesses) and cost (broken heart made useful) is visible on the page. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Examined unknown as tone is coherent: the prose is attentive, archaeological, gently elegiac without sentimentality. Diction ("sediment," "compressed," "dust as tiny history") modulates with the discovery and preservation beats. The tone charges the final image—patient histories settling—and resists both cynicism and syrup. It does not shift dramatically under pressure but maintains a steady, purposeful register that supports the Accumulative lens and thematic resonance.</comment>
