<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivations are established early (preserving old time systems, understanding texture of time) and remain consistent. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional obligation and deeper obsession, though it's more stated than dramatized in pressured choice. The final stance—sitting with objects in a state beyond measurement—feels earned by prior material, but the trajectory is largely reflective rather than propelled by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is present but often filtered through abstract philosophical frames ("time move through her body like breath") rather than concrete physical stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—meaning accrues through layered reflection, object handling, and the garage-sale encoding method, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Maren accepts irresolution and sits with unquantifiable time. Orientation is swift (emerald silo, Maren's role, post-Accord world by ~10% mark). The closure—"texture of time… was porous, filled with gaps where meaning leaked through"—lands as a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (renouncing resolution, accepting gaps). One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to keep the urn fragment and stop the clock, reweighting her professional translation work into personal presence. Causality is soft but legible under the accumulative lens; the piece teaches its pattern and pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vivid and recurs across beats (workshop walls, final paragraph's oxidation metaphor), though it functions more as atmospheric anchor than hard constraint on choice. The garage sale, river district, and county records supply textures but do not pressure tactics. The cremation urn fragment and stopped clock become micro-setting that charges the final image—Maren sitting with them at dusk, their surfaces catching light—meeting the 9+ gate criterion for object-as-setting. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("oxidized to a deep green," "curved shard of fired clay"), filtered through Maren's philosophical lens rather than a tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the texture of time, signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when Maren shifts from professional translation to personal recovery project (embedding Eliade story in listings, keeping the fragment), narrowing her options from mere preservation to active meaning-making. The decision to stop the clock and sit with the fragment forecloses the path of continued measurement, carrying conceptual cost—she exits the jurisdiction of old and new numbers. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient at this length, but the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no external pressure tests her stance, and coincidence (finding the capsule at a garage sale) seeds rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—time's unquantifiable texture and the gaps where meaning leaks through—emerges organically from the capsule's broken meaning, the Numerics Accord rupture, and Maren's encoding project. The urn fragment and stopped clock become a charged constellation that resists both old and new systems, embodying the theme without stating it. The final image ("porous, filled with gaps where meaning leaked through, where the dead spoke in listing descriptions") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No moralizing or thematic echo in the ending; the piece trusts image and implication. Subtext operates in the choice to preserve via garage-sale descriptions—a quiet, oblique method that mirrors the theme's emphasis on indirection and residue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's consciousness throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and lyric, with a philosophical, textural idiom ("time move through her body like breath, like blood, like the slow oxidation"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching Maren's professional background and meditative temperament. Psychic distance modulates gently—closer in the silo workshop, slightly wider in the research beats—without rupture. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices weight, warmth, light on surfaces, temporal metaphors. No dialogue on the page; voice coherence is strong under pressure, though the elevated register is constant and does not degrade under stress (no stress scene tests register flexibility).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varies purposefully; sentence openings show variety. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or thematic material. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language is dense but coherent within the established voice. Clarity is maintained despite philosophical abstraction. Minor scaffold appears in the research paragraph ("She began researching… tracing it through county records…") which could be tighter, and the phrase "suddenly timeless" in the required-attribute slot reads label-like rather than earned through image. Propulsion is steady but gentle, fitting the accumulative mode; momentum does not sag despite extended reflection because each beat reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—time-capsule recovery after a numerics shift, garage-sale encoding as preservation, borrowed-time timekeeper as protagonist—feels fresh and specific, not a template premise. The emotional arc (professional duty → personal meaning-making → acceptance of irresolution) avoids stock beats. The method of embedding messages in item descriptions is inventive and organically tied to Maren's profession and the story's concern with meaning severed from context. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, no antagonist, quiet ending) is purposeful and coherent. Transformation test: plot and arc would not work unchanged with different details; the Numerics Accord, the Eliade family, and the encoding method are integral. No famous-line echoes or generic placeholders.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren (borrowed-time timekeeper) is present throughout and frames the premise. Her professional role seeds the capsule discovery and encoding method. One key choice: deciding to keep the fragment and stop the clock, shifting from translation to presence. The role enables her research and listing platform but does not constrain a later tactic under pressure. Present in closure (sitting in the silo, carrying "unquantifiable sensation") but more as observer than agent in the final image. Setup early, development middle, closure participation indirect. Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears in three beats: discovery in capsule, placement on workbench beside stopped clock (middle), and the final sitting scene where Maren holds it and feels its weight. It seeds the Eliade research, anchors the "dismantled twice" realization, and charges the closure image as one half of the "suddenly timeless" pair. Specificity high (curved shard, partial name, fired clay texture). Enables the thematic turn and participates in closure. All three gates; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule (core concept) is discovered early, drives the middle research and encoding beats, and its broken meaning ("severed from context") becomes the story's thematic spine. It does not reappear physically in the closure scene but the capsule's conceptual residue—time's porosity, gaps where meaning leaks—shapes the final image and Maren's stance. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate (it seeds action but does not constrain tactics); closure participation thematic rather than physical; irreplaceability high within the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is applied to the fragment and clock in one mid-story sentence: "Together, the fragment and the clock became suddenly timeless—objects that had escaped the jurisdiction of both old numbers and new." The phrase labels a state rather than constraining a choice. It does not reappear or alter tactics. Setup delayed (mid-story), no development beat, closure participation only via the objects it describes. One gate clearly met; label-only use; no visible cost tied to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rediscover" (action) frames the entire arc: Maren wants to rediscover the capsule's meaning after it was unearthed and forgotten. The research, encoding project, and final acceptance all trace to this goal. Present in closure as ongoing process ("rediscover that meaning" → sitting with unquantifiable sensation). All three gates; beat involvement across arc; causal pressure moderate (enables rather than constrains); closure linkage strong; the action could be rephrased (e.g., "recover," "restore") without major structural loss, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage-sale item descriptions is signaled early ("For years, she had maintained an online storefront"), executed in one detailed beat (mantel clock, pocket watch, sundial listings encoding Eliade materials), and mentioned in closure ("the dead spoke in listing descriptions"). Mechanics are explained; the method matters as both professional and thematic vehicle (indirection, gaps). All three gates; one strong development beat; closure linkage present but glancing; method is specific but could be swapped for another archival encoding (e.g., library metadata) with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo appears in the opening line, recurs as Maren's workshop location across beats (curved walls, workbench, locking the door at day's end), and closes the arc ("she locked the silo and walked home"). The oxidation metaphor ("slow oxidation that had turned the silo green") ties to the theme of time's texture. It does not pressure a choice but charges the final image as the container of Maren's transformation. All three gates; lyric reprise; closure linkage via atmosphere and metaphor rather than constraint; irreplaceability moderate (any distinctive workshop would serve, though the "emerald" and "oxidation" details are voice-specific).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers change meaning" (Global Numerics Accord, three years prior) is introduced early, drives the premise (Maren's job, capsule's illegible retrieval date), and recurs in closure ("skies counted in numbers she had helped invent"). It tightens Maren's professional stakes and makes the capsule's damage legible. All three gates; causal pressure high (the Accord is the inciting rupture); closure linkage strong (the final line reweights her relationship to new numerals); irreplaceability high within this concept. Not a live ticking clock that alters scene tactics, but the background condition that makes all choices meaningful.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated early ("her true motivation ran deeper than professional obligation") and recurs across beats: sitting with objects for hours, the encoding project as meaning-preservation, and the closure line where she has "learned" time's porous texture. One choice clearly traces to it: keeping the fragment and stopping the clock to exit measurement. Desire is more told than dramatized in conflicted choice; friction between professional duty and personal obsession is present but not tested under external pressure. All three gates; causal involvement moderate; closure linkage strong; cost is conceptual (renouncing resolution) rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early ("The anticipated mysteries never resolved themselves entirely, and she preferred it that way") and sustained through the accumulative, meditative mode. The piece modulates gently—wider for exposition, closer for object handling—without rupture. Tone charges the final image by affirming irresolution and gaps as the destination rather than failure. Coherent through all beats; one deliberate cadence shift at closure (the long final sentence that opens into porousness). Not a single static mood; the acceptance at the end reweights the earlier anticipation, creating mild tension between seeking and letting-go.</comment>
