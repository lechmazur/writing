<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cora's interiority is concrete and vivid—cataloguing the warmth in the vinyl seat, the chemical smell—and her motivation from grief to resumption is grounded in the hitchhiker's one-line provocation and the glass flake's personal image. The "dynamically observant" trait is embodied through her bridge-reading skill and micro-cataloguing, though the final decision to drive toward the coordinates feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn. Internal contradiction is present (calcified "never" vs. aching desire) but the choice at closure carries minimal visible cost on the page; she simply turns the key.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: Cora, truck, pullout, post-vanishing. The drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure accumulates through sensory catalogue and the glass flake's layered message until the final decision crystallizes her stance. Closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: she turns the key and pulls onto the road, options reconfigured from "never" to possibility. Cost is felt (facing sixteen years of loss) but remains largely emotional and retrospective rather than a visible forfeiture in the ending beat itself, keeping this shy of the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mountain pullout supplies immediate constraint (shaking hands force the stop) and the dashboard becomes a charged micro-setting where the glass flake is studied against failing light. The fiddle case behind the seat hums with engine vibration in the final image, a tactile detail that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: Cora notices wind, crowd mood, cable tension per her trade, and the collodion's chemical signature registers as "ether and silver." All setting choices press or enable the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resuming music after loss—is signaled early and tightens when the glass flake reveals Cora on an unknown bridge with coordinates. The one meaningful turn is Cora's decision to accept the "pixelated amnesty" and drive toward Tennessee; her agency is clear. Cost is present (confronting "never," the ashes of sixteen years) but remains largely internal and retrospective. No visible forfeiture or trade-off occurs on the page at closure; she simply starts the engine, so escalation stops short of the high 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—reconstruction from fragments, earned resumption—emerges organically through the collodion metaphor: "pixelated amnesty…broken into shards you had to assemble yourself." The final image (fiddle case humming, bridge waiting) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "Never is just a photograph that hasn't finished developing" reframes the premise without becoming a thesis statement. Subtext operates in Cora's luminous disbelief and the scaffold-hidden secret. One slip: "to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" verges on thematic echo, though it remains tied to scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "indifferent to the impossible thing," "calcified inside her like lime in a pipe," "a kind of pixelated amnesty." Perceptual signature is sharp and trade-specific (bridge-song fiddler's micro-tensions, wind, crowd mood). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One small slip: "the kind sheathed in white plastic that snaps and flutters" momentarily shifts into explanatory aside, but recovers quickly and the diction remains Cora's throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most lines do double duty. "A wet-plate collodion glass flake" anchors period detail and plot in one beat. Minor loop: "catalogued" x3 in quick succession feels template-like, though the parallelism serves voice. "Pixelated amnesty…fragment by fragment" expands the metaphor across two sentences without fresh pressure—a small synonym churn. No figurative muddle in peak beats; propulsion is strong. These issues are non-closure and modest, so deduction remains under −0.4 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The collodion flake/pixelated-amnesty frame is a fresh synthesis: early-photography fragility meets emotional recovery. The hitchhiker's vanishing and coordinates avoid stock "magical helper" by grounding in concrete sensory aftermath (warmth, ether smell, scratched GPS). Risk-taking (literal disappearance, scaffold-map, bridge-song profession) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "bridge waiting to be played" resolution leans toward the warm side of inevitability, reducing final surprise. Transformation of magical-realism trope is successful but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cora's choice to catalogue, study the glass, recount the hitchhiker's words, and finally turn the key drives the single major turn from grief-stasis to motion. The trait of dynamic observation enables every beat. Present throughout; drives closure decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass flake appears immediately post-vanishing, is studied against light (beat 2), reveals coordinates (beat 3), and blazes into clarity at sunset (beat 4), set on the dashboard as she turns the key (closure). Its properties—collodion fragility, ghostly image, scratched coordinates—are irreplaceable and causally active. Removing it collapses plot and ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" is named on the page and frames the resolution metaphor: forgiveness "broken into shards you had to assemble yourself, each piece granting partial release." It shapes Cora's interpretation of the glass flake and coordinates, altering her stance from "never" to willingness. Present by midpoint, returns at closure, but remains more thematic resonance than on-page tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Dynamically observant" is embodied immediately: Cora catalogues warmth, smell, the glass image, reads wind and micro-tensions per her bridge trade. The trait enables her to decode the scaffold-map message and notice the fiddle case hum. It constrains nothing (no cost from hyper-observation) but enables the entire causal chain and charges the final perception.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Recount" appears explicitly: "She began to recount every word the hitchhiker had spoken." This action triggers the memory of "Never is just a photograph…" and primes her acceptance of the coordinates. It's a pivotal interior turn that shifts her from shock to interpretation. The specific verb is signaled and drives mid-story escalation; swapping it for "remember" would weaken the deliberate, cataloguing texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scaffold-wrap method is described: "a secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters, readable only when the wind pulled the sheeting aside at exactly the right angle." Its mechanics (wind, tear, coordinates) matter to Cora's interpretation and point her to Tennessee. Present by midpoint, shapes her goal, but not tested on the page—she hasn't yet encountered the actual bridge. Setup and development present; payoff deferred off-page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain scenic pullout forces the stop (shaking hands), provides the pause for study, and frames the layered revelation against the Blue Ridge backdrop. It enables every beat and appears in the final action ("pulled back onto the mountain road"). Spatial constraint is light but present; removing it would require a different catalyst and lose the altitude/perspective metaphor that charges "unfolded below" and the descent toward resumption.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the vanishing—anchors every beat and drives urgency subtly: failing light forces her to study the glass "against the sunset," sky turns "the color of a struck match," and darkness approaches as she decides. The clock isn't loud but it tightens her window for interpretation and charges the final image. Present throughout, shapes closure timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"—is dramatized through Cora's grief (cabin fire, lost recordings, calcified refusal) and tested by the coordinates that demand resumption. It drives her final choice to turn the key. Friction between wanting to stay safe ("never again") and the "ancient and aching" pull is present but resolved with minimal on-page resistance; she accepts the call fairly smoothly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone—"luminous disbelief"—is established in the opening (impossible vanishing, Cora doesn't scream but catalogues) and returns explicitly in the climax: "alive with a luminous disbelief…someone witnessing their own resurrection and not quite trusting it." The tone modulates from shock to studied calm to aching readiness, coherent across turns, and charges the final image of the humming fiddle case. Named on the page, embodied in perception, integral to closure.</comment>
