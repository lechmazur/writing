<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior world is specific and embodied—"the burden of continuing work...like a stone sewn into her chest"—and her sensitively perceptive nature shapes concrete choices (reading the echo patterns, deciding to follow deeper, packing the diaries). The mother's legacy creates genuine internal contradiction: Maren is both drawn to and wary of the obsession that consumed Eloise. The final choice to walk deeper into the corridor carries visible cost (accepting potential isolation and obsession) and feels earned by the prior pressure. Minor deduction for the phrase "sensitively perceptive in ways that made the world unbearable sometimes," which edges toward diagnostic labeling, though it's quickly grounded in concrete perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first two paragraphs (Maren, abandoned university east wing, post-climate-shift present). The piece operates under a Causal lens with Accumulative inflections: Maren's investigation reveals her mother's diaries, which reveal the neural-pattern discovery, which crystallizes the legacy burden and drives the final choice. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren's decision to walk deeper reconfigures her relationship to the work with felt cost (potential obsession, isolation) visible in "following the sound of whatever the walls were dreaming." The causality holds; each beat motivates the next through discovery and mounting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, fireplace, lecture hall, and tuning rod create vivid spatial anchors filtered through Maren's professional lens. The environment constrains action (machete required, fireplace preserves partial diaries) and the acoustics function as both setting and investigative tool. The wall's "cool and faintly trembling" texture in the penultimate beat charges the final image. Deduction for the climate-shift backdrop remaining somewhat generic—"flooding seasons," "temperature swings," "domed settlements"—functional but not deeply particular to this locale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to carry forward her mother's controversial discovery or walk away—is established early through the legacy framing and tightens decisively when Maren finds the diaries and film strip. The fireplace discovery reverses her understanding: walls don't just remember, they process. The final choice to walk deeper forecloses the path of sealing the building back beneath ivy, with visible cost (accepting the same isolation/obsession that consumed her mother). Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length and well-executed here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the acoustics-as-neural-patterns concept and the legacy-burden particulars rather than statement. The question "what walls dream about" reweights from poetic metaphor to literal discovery to existential burden without moralizing. The final image—"following the sound of whatever the walls were dreaming"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that the proof of sentience deepens rather than resolves the question of meaning. Subtext operates in Maren's ambivalence (stone sewn into chest, fear mixed with compulsion) and the half-burned diaries' fragmentary revelations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and closely aligned with Maren's professional and emotional lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: she reads spaces acoustically, feels "the weight of spaces, the emotional residue of rooms." Diction stays character-appropriate (cartographer's vocabulary, poetic precision) with purposeful modulation under pressure—short, compressed syntax when she finds the diaries. The phrase "sensitively perceptive in ways that made the world unbearable sometimes" slightly over-explains what the prior paragraphs already show, but recovery is quick. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer explorative sentences early giving way to shorter, charged beats at closure. Information density is high—nearly every line advances discovery, setting, or character. Minor deduction for a brief paraphrase loop: "she felt her mother here, not as a ghost but as an echo, the kind she'd spent her life mapping" restates the metaphor just established. The figurative language (stone sewn into chest, walls dreaming, echo as memory) remains consistent and voice-motivated without overwriting the peak beats. One template stem appears ("She tapped...She closed...She followed...She packed...She stood") but brevity and momentum keep it from dragging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The corridor-echo-cartography premise is specific and unusual, grounded in plausible acoustic science extrapolated one step (neural-pattern resonance). The mother-disappeared-here frame could be stock, but the discipline itself—mapping acoustic signatures as structural memory—transforms it. The final choice avoids the tidy middle: Maren accepts risk rather than resolving ambiguity. The waveform-as-neurons twist feels earned in hindsight by the early framing of acoustics as revelatory. Risk-taking is present but measured; the piece commits fully to its premise without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as corridor echo cartographer drives every beat: she uses the tuning rod to map the space, interprets the resonance, follows it deeper, recognizes the waveform patterns in the film strip, and makes the final choice to continue mapping. The profession is not ornamental; it defines her lens, her mother's legacy, and the stakes. Present early, shapes multiple beats, and is causally active in the closure decision. The discipline's obscurity and dismissal by others sharpens the isolation cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears late (fourth paragraph from the end) but transforms prior material: it visually confirms Eloise's theory (neural branching patterns) and crystallizes Maren's choice. It is handled ("warped by heat but intact," "held up to the pale light") and packed into the bag, marking the decision to carry the discovery forward. Two touches (discovery, packing) with reweighted meaning at closure. Late arrival and lack of earlier setup cap the score despite strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is the dominant stake, established early ("carried her mother's legacy like a stone sewn into her chest") and tested throughout. It shapes Maren's tactics (searching this specific building, her ambivalence toward the work) and the final choice: to accept the burden or seal it away. The burden is not merely thematic; it narrows options on the page—continue and risk obsession, or walk away. Present in setup, development, and closure with visible cost. The "burden of legacy...demanded choice" meta-statement slightly over-explains what the action already shows, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is described directly in one passage ("she felt the weight of spaces, the emotional residue of rooms") and shown through her reading of acoustic signatures and her empathic connection to her mother's desperation. It enables her work (interpreting echoes) and costs her (makes "the world unbearable sometimes"). However, the trait is mostly told rather than dramatized in a discrete choice with visible tradeoff. Functional but not irreplaceable; a similar character could interpret the space through professional training alone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glimpse of the film negative strip (seeing the waveform photographs as neural branching) is the story's pivot: it moves Maren from investigation to decision by confirming her mother's discovery. The action is specific—holding the strip to light, recognizing the dendritic patterns—and irreplaceable; no other action delivers the proof. It enables the final choice to continue the work. Present in development and shaping closure. Deduction for late appearance (no earlier foreshadowing) and single-beat focus; broader beat involvement would elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries found in the fireplace are signaled early (the corridor "smelled of char"), discovered at the lecture hall's fireplace, and supply the key information (Eloise's obsession, her fear, the neural-oscillation theory). The method is specific (fire preserved some pages, ash obscured others) and the partial legibility creates discovery friction. The diaries drive two beats (finding, reading) and directly enable the closure choice. The mechanics matter: incomplete text forces interpretation, and the film strip is tucked inside. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the story (opening image, implied return at closure when Maren could "seal this building back beneath its ivy") and supplies the inciting obstacle (machete required). The ivy functions as threshold and symbol of abandonment. However, once Maren is inside, the passage does not constrain tactics or return with charged meaning. Two touches (entry, implicit refusal to seal) with thematic weight but limited causal pressure in the middle. Lyric resonance is present but the element does not alter micro-choices between entry and exit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The post-climate-shift timeframe is established early ("after the climate shifts," "flooding seasons began") and justifies the building's abandonment and Maren's mother's disappearance timing ("sixteen years ago, just before the first catastrophic climate shift"). It provides context but does not tighten decisions in real time; no countdown or urgency tied to the climate condition itself. The timeframe is functional setup without development pressure. Present and consistent, but does not shape tactics or the closure moment beyond backstory logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to discover what walls dream about" is dramatized through her use of the tuning rod, her interpretation of the "resonance...just below grief," and her pursuit of the echo deeper into the building. The motivation is conflicted: she continues her mother's work despite knowing it consumed Eloise. Friction between want (to prove the theory) and cost (isolation, obsession) is visible in her hesitation and the final choice to walk deeper despite the risk. Present early, tested in the middle (finding the proof), and drives closure. Deduction for one phrase where the motivation is told rather than shown ("she believed, revealed something about the structures themselves").</comment>
