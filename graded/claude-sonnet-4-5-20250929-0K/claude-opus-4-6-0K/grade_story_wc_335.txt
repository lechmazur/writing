<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is well-motivated and embodied; her combative tenderness, her daily tea-leaf ritual, and her decision to mentor Fen emerge from clear interiority. Fen's fury and his backward walk are visceral. Minor slip: the daughter's backstory functions efficiently but the emotional progression from grief to mentorship could be more contradictory—Maren moves smoothly into teaching mode without visible internal friction in the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Fen sits, picks up a pen, and begins "writing forward"—a crystallized moment that reconfigures his stance with felt cost (accepting exile's lesson rather than hollow return). The tea-leaf geometry and the backward-walking motif accumulate and reweight at the ending. One tightening suffices at this length; cost is legible in Fen's shift from demand to acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library, the fractured mirrors, the cracked teacup, and the swing outside all constrain or charge choices. The afternoon shadow shard (daughter's silhouette) anchors Maren's motivation and the ending's emotional weight. Spatial choreography is clear. Minor: the playground swing, while atmospheric, does not directly alter a tactical choice—it's more resonance than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Fen's desire for reversal; Maren's mentorship provides the opposing wisdom. One meaningful tightening: Fen's shift from fury to sitting and annotating his shard. The tea-leaf gap ("the part of you that has to choose") narrows options with visible cost. Agency is clear: Fen's choice to pick up the pen forecloses hollow return. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; the final act reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geometry of tea leaves, the backward walk, and the mirrors—exile as transformation rather than erasure. The final image (writing forward) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. "You have to go back fuller than you left" is stated but earns its place through the prior particulars (shadow, swing, empty cup). Subtext operates in Maren's "combative tenderness" and the swing's drift. No thematic echo at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable and apt. Perceptual signature is Maren's: she annotates, reads geometry, holds combative tenderness. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("Those aren't different things"). Fen's voice is distinct—short, furious, child-direct. Minor: a few sentences approach elevated diction ("the geometry of tea leaves told her everything the Council's proclamations did not") but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor artifact cluster: "too loud, too deliberate" and "furious, his exile mark still fresh" lean toward template pairings, and "the combative tenderness that made people feel both challenged and held" briefly summarizes rather than shows. No loops or major muddle. Propulsion is clean through the tea-leaf beat and the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archive and tea-leaf geometry offer a fresh synthesis; the backward walk when nervous is specific and purposeful. The emotional truth—exile as a path to fullness—avoids generic templates. Minor: the forgotten library and the wise mentor guiding a child through grief echo familiar frames, though the tea-leaf mechanics and the annotation ritual add specificity. Transformation test passes: remove these particulars and the arc loses its anchor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as shard-mirror archivist is signaled early, drives her decision to mentor Fen, and shapes the tea-leaf reading and the annotation beat. She appears in all three gates and her archival practice enables the closure choice. Specific cost: she uses her daughter's failure to guide Fen toward success.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass appears mid-story as Maren's daughter's silhouette and charges Maren's motivation ("I became the archivist because I failed her"). It recurs as emotional weight at closure but does not constrain a tactical choice. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile is the dominant stake: Fen demands reversal, Maren explains the geometry of return, the tea leaves show "the shape of return," and the gap in the leaves defines the cost. It shapes tactics (annotation, tea-reading) and the closure choice (Fen writes forward to "go back fuller"). All three gates; high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Walking backwards when nervous is signaled when Fen retreats, Maren recognizes it ("You do that too. My daughter used to walk backwards"), and it ties to the closure metaphor ("As long as it takes you to stop walking backwards"). Setup and payoff clear; middle beat is observational. Cost is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Annotation is Maren's defining practice: she annotates the water-rationing woman's shard in the opening, invites Fen to "annotate your shard together," and the final image is Fen picking up a pen and writing. It drives the mentor relationship, the tea-leaf reading, and the closure act. All three gates; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled early ("the geometry of tea leaves told her everything"), used mid-story to predict Fen's arrival ("a sharp, small shape. A child"), and enacted on-page when Maren and Fen study the leaves together to find "the shape of return" and "the gap." It shapes the reversal method and the final choice. All three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library provides the mirrors, the cracked teacup, the ledger, and the unbroken window framing the swing. It anchors Maren's identity and supplies the tools (pen, paper, tea) for the annotation ritual. Setup and development strong; closure participation is ambient rather than decisive. The library enables but does not transform the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" appears twice: mid-story as Maren and Fen watch it, and at closure ("The swing outside drifted to stillness"). It charges atmosphere and marks Fen's shift but does not tighten a decision. Lyric reprise reweights the stake with visible cost; setup and payoff present; middle beat is observational.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to "mentor resilience quietly" is declared ("I mentor resilience quietly now because shouting didn't save anyone") and dramatized when she teaches Fen the annotation ritual and the tea-leaf reading. Setup, development, and payoff present. Minor: "quietly" is asserted more than shown—Maren's teaching is direct and verbal rather than silent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is named once ("the combative tenderness that made people feel both challenged and held") and enacted in dialogue: "Those aren't different things," "As long as it takes you to stop walking backwards," and the final warmth ("like light finding its way through a shard"). Tone modulates purposefully and charges the ending. Minor reliance on summary for the label itself.</comment>
