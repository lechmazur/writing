<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistently specific and embodied—the moment she presses against the warm mirror and her reflection "pressed back with a hand that had too many fingers" roots her fear in concrete sensation. Her motivation to confront the luminance rather than flee is earned through the resuscitation backstory and Sorrel's guidance. Internal conflict operates through contradictory impulses: revulsion braided with fascination when confronting the glow. The final renunciation—walking out "uncursed, unafraid, carrying nothing back"—feels earned by the mirror confrontation, though the ease of resolution slightly undercuts the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with lyric accent. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Maren's final glance into the shard shows "only darkness—ordinary, beautiful, uncorrupted darkness," reweighting the luminance curse with visible cost (she is now "unphotographable perhaps" but free). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Maren, funhouse, post-resuscitation). The because/therefore chain from hospital curse → advisor's guidance → funhouse confrontation → paradox confession → mirror cascade → liberation holds without breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when the reflection unbosoms and the mirrors crack in sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The funhouse setting constrains choice—warped mirrors are necessary for the paradox trap to work, and the "warm, almost wet" glass texture charges the confrontation moment. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance, corridor of mirrors, final shard. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("sickening glow," mercury-like luminance pooling). The moth clasp on Sorrel's cloak subtly mirrors the funhouse's stolen-light motif. The carnival frame provides apt atmosphere without excess; the final image of "just paint and plywood" grounds the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: remove the parasitic luminance curse. Agency is clear—Maren chooses to enter, speak the paradox, and hold her gaze despite revulsion. One meaningful tightening: the reflection's unbosoming narrows her path to completion (she must "not look away"). The cost is legible: she remains "unphotographable perhaps" even after the curse lifts, a residual scar. Escalation follows a causal chain, though the reflection's capitulation arrives smoothly without additional resistance. Coincidence does not resolve; Maren's agency drives the outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: fear's parasitic dependence on its host, the price of survival, and the power of full attention. The mirror/reflection motif shifts meaning across beats—first as corruption, then as crucible, finally as proof of freedom. "Fear's weakness is that it needs us more than we need it" risks explicit statement but is earned by the prior unbosoming and justified as Maren's realization rather than authorial intrusion. The final image—darkness that "flinched" no more—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Sorrel's refusal to follow and the moth clasp's dimming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maren notices texture ("warm, almost wet"), registers contradictory attraction/repulsion, and processes via the advisor's conceptual vocabulary ("lingering luminance," "paradox"). Diction stays within her register—educated, trauma-shaped—without unmotivated elevation. Minor issues: "bile and wonder, revulsion braided with fascination" risks slight overwriting at a peak beat, and Sorrel's dialogue could carry more subtext. Filter verbs ("noticed," "could not stop staring") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Figurative language is concentrated: "appetite" for light, moth "swallowing its own wings," luminance "pooling like mercury"—all coherent and specific. Minor artifacts cluster: "revulsion braided with fascination" and "bile and wonder" stack near-synonyms in one peak beat, risking −0.3. "Photographically cursed, the hospital staff joked" tells efficiently. The dream-dictionary entries are vivid but border on exposition; they compress effectively. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Proofreading is clean. The final line's repetition of "just" works rhythmically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—using a funhouse (deception's temple) to trap fear through paradox—is specific and non-obvious. The photographic corruption and post-resuscitation luminance offer fresh angles on haunting/trauma. Emotional truth in the contradictory pull ("magnetic… repulsive") avoids generic templates. The dream dictionary's paradoxical notes and Sorrel's whispering advisor archetype risk familiarity but are executed with enough specificity (moth clasp, opera cloak, margin-defying handwriting) to feel particular. Transformation test: the arc depends on these exact details. Minor proximity concern: "advisor at hospital bedside" and "funhouse as psychological crucible" are recognizable frames, elevated by the luminance conceit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sorrel (whispering advisor) appears early, provides the dream dictionary and method, and speaks at two beats (hospital, funhouse entrance). Her refusal to enter the funhouse ("too afraid to follow") and the moth clasp's dimming at the end participate in closure, reweighting her role from guide to witness. However, her choices do not create key turns—Maren's agency drives all pivotal moves. Sorrel enables but does not decide.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp appears in three beats: hospital introduction ("caught every stray photon"), funhouse entrance ("glinting"), and ending ("now dull"). Its moth-swallowing-wings shape echoes the luminance appetite, and its dimming at closure signals the parasitic light's defeat. However, the clasp is observed rather than handled or used to alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric symbol more than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lingering luminance shapes stakes from the opening (the curse Maren must remove), tactics (she uses paradox to force its confession), and closure (its evaporation proves freedom). The concept is present in every major beat: hospital corruption, dream dictionary notes, funhouse glow, unbosoming, mirror cascade, final darkness. Removing it would collapse the story's logic entirely. The luminance's throbbing heartbeat and mercury-like pooling give it physical presence that constrains Maren's choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Photographically cursed" is introduced early and drives the inciting problem—Maren's images are corrupted, isolating her and signaling the parasitic attachment. It constrains her initial state and provides the advisor's entry point. At closure, she remains "unphotographable perhaps," a residual cost. However, the trait does not enable or constrain a pivotal mid-story action with immediate tradeoff; its role is primarily setup and scar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unbosom" is the method's fulcrum: Maren quotes the dream dictionary to coax the reflection into confession, the reflection "unbosoms" its fears ("afraid of being named, afraid of stillness"), and that revelation triggers the mirror cascade. The action redefines options—fear's weakness is exposed, enabling Maren's final stance. Major turns trace directly to this verb; it could not be swapped without losing the paradox mechanics and thematic resonance (confession as vulnerability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dream dictionary is introduced early (hospital), its paradoxical notes ("The reflection is the original. You are the copy it despises") are quoted to demonstrate the method, and Maren uses its language at the climax ("You are the light that proves darkness exists"). The mechanics matter: paradox is "the only tongue it cannot mimic," and that constraint drives her tactic. The dictionary shapes at least two beats and participates in closure, though the notes risk slight exposition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse is signaled in the opening line and provides essential pressure: only warped mirrors (deception's infrastructure) can trap fear by forcing its reflection to distort and confess. The setting's spatial layout (entrance, corridor, mirrors) choreographs the confrontation. At closure, the funhouse's transformation to "just paint and plywood" reweights Maren's perception and confirms the luminance's defeat. Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" anchors the timeline early and frames the curse's origin ("three days after they pulled her back from clinical death"). The timeframe tightens the advisor's intervention and Maren's urgency to act before the luminance spreads further. However, no live clock pressures tactics during the funhouse scene itself; elapsed time is not tracked or weaponized. The frame is clear and functional but not dynamically constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation—to trick fear into revealing its weakness—is dramatized through Maren's choice to enter the funhouse, her use of paradox, and her refusal to look away despite revulsion. Internal conflict operates: she is "repulsed" yet "magnetic[ally]" drawn. The friction between her want (freedom from the curse) and the cost (enduring the unbosoming's "bile and wonder") charges the peak beat. The final realization ("Fear's weakness is that it needs us more than we need it") grows from prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" operates coherently across beats: the luminance is "sickening" yet Maren "could not stop staring"; the reflection's confession tastes like "bile and wonder, revulsion braided with fascination." Tone modulates with pressure—curiosity at entry, magnetic dread during the unbosoming, exhausted relief at closure ("smiled, and nothing in the glass flinched"). The duality charges the final image: ordinary darkness becomes "beautiful" after toxic light. Tone avoids static dread and supports the thematic payoff.</comment>
