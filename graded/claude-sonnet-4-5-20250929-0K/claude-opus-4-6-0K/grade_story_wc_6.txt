<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistently embodied—her firefighting experience filters every perception, from "gracefully alert to suffering" rooted in scarred attention to the paramedic/grafting parallel. The coin and tree planting are micro-choices that reveal her stance toward her father's destruction without forgiveness or erasure. Internal contradiction appears in "unyielding compassion…not philosophy…scar tissue itself," showing simultaneous weight of harm and refusal to let harm dominate. The final choice to hum and recognize the scar's song earns the stance crystallization, though the father's offstage dying and the retrospective framing keep some emotional cost at one remove.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Maren at lagoon edge, black sand, turnout coat, within opening lines. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers volcanic sand, coin, grafted tree, and scar-singing motif toward a resonant reconfiguration where "scars can sing" moves from metaphor to embodied proof. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the hum, the scar's different resonance, and the tree holding ground with the coin swinging reweight all prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt—she refuses forgiveness but accepts the simultaneous weight—and the image of the coin "singing in the wind" charges the ending. No causal escalation is required under this lens; the pattern coheres and the final cadence shift lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, kelp-drift, and dunes anchor spatially and sensorially throughout. The lagoon's "silence without judgment" motivates the pilgrimage after the Tuesday diagnosis. Maren's body—kneeling, sifting sand, wiping grit—grounds reflection in tactile action. The sapling and coin are handled objects that constrain the planting ritual. The final image depends on hawthorn bark and wind to give the coin its "song," making setting integral to closure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) charges the ending, meeting the 9+ threshold for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving scars can sing—literally, not metaphorically—surfaces early and drives the lagoon pilgrimage and tree-grafting ritual. Pressure accumulates via the terminal diagnosis (Tuesday), the choice to plant foreign sand with native ground, and the coin as inheritance token. The hum and scar vibration at closure constitute an on-page test of the stake with visible cost: she acknowledges simultaneous destruction and building without erasure. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (diagnosis news → ritual → embodied proof) is sufficient. No reversal is required; the tightening from general stake to specific physical act narrows and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—harm coexists with beauty; scars carry their own resonance—emerges through grafted tree (wild/cultivar fusion), mixed sands (foreign/native), and the coin's worn smooth face, not through assertion. "Unyielding compassion" is defined concretely: "not erasure of harm, but refusal to let harm be the only story." The final scar-hum offers a non-literal, resonant answer via embodied proof rather than moral summary. Avoids thematic echo by grounding insight in physical vibration and the tree "holding its ground." The piece earns wisdom through tactile particulars and accepts ambiguity (she doesn't forgive) without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization through Maren's firefighter/paramedic lens: "first whisper of smoke," "cambium," "wax seals," "graft" vocabulary all filter perception through her training. Diction is elevated but consistent—"singing" scar tissue, "kelp-drift peace"—and the syntax modulates from catalog (opener) to shorter beats at closure. No head-hopping. The phrase "alphabet she couldn't read but recognized" risks slight register drift, but recovers via embodied action (touching scar, humming). Perceptual signature is stable and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence lengths shift from long lyric openers to clipped action ("She stood and wiped…"). Information density is high: every image (coin, graft, kelp) does double or triple duty. Minor loop: "unyielding compassion" is defined twice in consecutive paragraphs with slight paraphrase, costing ~−0.2. The phrase "scar tissue…singing" recurs productively as motif anchor, not loop. No figurative muddle in peak beats. "Slow migration of clouds" bookends cleanly. Propulsion is steady; no scaffolding or filter-verb stacks. Closure image is vivid andconomical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter-firefighter frame risks cliché but is transformed through the non-redemptive stance: she chooses the work not as penance but from "scar tissue itself." The literal-singing-scars premise is fresh and committed; the vibration test at closure follows through. Grafting as metaphor for healing is familiar but gains specificity via cambium/wax-seal detail and the volcanic-sand mixing ritual. The coin on red thread as inheritance token and the obsidian lagoon as unjudging witness feel particular to this voice. Risk-taking in thematic ambiguity (no forgiveness, simultaneous weight) heightens without obscuring. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph two. Development: her training filters every perception (grafting, paramedic care, tuning to smoke), though no mid-scene tactical decision emerges. Payoff: the final scar-hum test is enabled by her firefighter embodiment and the coin ritual. Causal pressure: her identity as firefighter shapes the lagoon pilgrimage and the proof-stake, narrowing options. The role is irreplaceable—swap to another profession and the scar/smoke metaphor collapses. Two gates solid, third (middle choice) is thematic filtering rather than a distinct beat; eligible for mid-6s. Specificity and closure linkage lift within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: jar from Lanzarote introduced paragraph one. Development: she presses the black sand into soil around the sapling's roots, mixing foreign/native earth in a distinct beat. Payoff: the planted tree with mixed sand anchors the closure image as the coin swings. Causal pressure: the sand enacts the "mixing edges to heal" logic and ties father's destruction site to new growth. Three gates met; two beats (jar introduction, planting). Specificity high (volcanic grit, Lanzarote origin), closure participation clear. Cost connection: the sand carries the origin-wound into the healing gesture. Strong integration across setup, action, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "unyielding compassion" named and defined early (paragraphs two and three). Development: the concept governs her stance—no forgiveness, but refusal to let harm dominate—shaping the tree-planting choice. Payoff: the final paragraph restates "what has been burned can still carry music" as embodied proof. The concept shapes tactics (the ritual) and reweights at closure. However, it leans toward thematic claim rather than on-page constraint that narrows options under stress. Two-and-a-half gates; lyric reprise with cost. Mid-band: not merely ornamental, but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "gracefully alert to suffering" appears paragraph two. Development: the trait filters attention—"tuned to first whisper of smoke"—and enables the paramedic/grafting parallel, though no single mid-scene choice hinges on it. Payoff: "gracefully alert enough to listen" in the final paragraph ties the trait to the scar-singing proof. The attribute colors perception throughout but does not visibly constrain or enable a discrete action with tradeoff. Two gates (setup, closure); lyric reprise reweights the stake. Eligible for low-6s on resonance and specificity, though causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: grafting introduced paragraph four with backstory anchor (winter certification). Development: the sapling is a graft—wild rootstock fused with cultivar—planted in the lagoon beat, enacting the "convincing two edges to accept each other" logic. Payoff: the grafted tree "held its ground" in the final image, with the coin on its bark. Causal pressure: the graft is the physical proof of healing-through-fusion and irreplaceable (no generic planting would carry the same stakes). Three gates met; two beats (introduction, planting); closure linkage strong. Specificity and cost (wild/cultivar, volcanic soil) elevate within high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: coin introduced paragraph four with origin story (father's gift, drilled, strung on red thread). Development: Maren loops it around the sapling's neck during planting. Payoff: "the coin on red thread caught the light and spun" and "swinging against hawthorn bark, singing in the wind" in the closure beats. The coin enacts inheritance without forgiveness and charges the final image. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate (the coin is the father's token but any token could serve). Specificity (peseta, drilled, red thread, twenty-two years) and closure participation lift score. Irreplaceable within the inheritance logic; two beats plus charged ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: obsidian lagoon beneath dunes, mirrored clouds, anchored in opening lines. Development: the lagoon's "silence without judgment" motivates the pilgrimage; its margin is the planting site; kelp-drift provides the sync-breathing beat. Payoff: "rising over the obsidian water" and "kelp-drift peace" frame the closure. The lagoon enables the ritual (unjudging space) and charges the ending image with its reflective, hidden nature (shifts each winter/spring). Three gates; causal pressure strong (no generic coast would carry the same secrecy/revelation logic). Specificity (obsidian, unmapped, dune-revealed) and multiple beats elevate into high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "slow migration of clouds" in opening line and closing paragraph. Development: no mid-scene use; clouds do not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Payoff: "The clouds kept migrating" bookends the piece as atmospheric closure. The timeframe provides lyric coherence but does not function as a live clock. One gate (setup/payoff as reprise); ornamental use without causal pressure. Swappable with any durational marker. Scores low-4s on lyric resonance alone; no tactical constraint or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to prove that scars can sing—not metaphorically…but literally" stated paragraph three. Development: the desire drives the lagoon trip, the tree planting, and the coin ritual. Payoff: the hum and scar vibration test the desire on the page, and "proving what she had always known" closes the loop. The motivation is dramatized through choices (driving to the coast, planting, humming) with visible cost (facing father's death, mixing harm and beauty). Three gates; causal pressure strong; the want/proof structure is irreplaceable. Friction between want (proof) and cost (acknowledging simultaneous weight) present. High-7s on full integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "kelp-drift peace" introduced paragraph five. Development: the tone modulates from elegiac catalog (opener) to action (planting) to meditative proof (closure), reflecting pressure shifts. Payoff: "kelp-drift peace of the lagoon" anchors the final scar-song image. The tone is coherent and purpose-driven, breathing with the narrative arc. Two-and-a-half gates (setup, modulation, closure reprise); the tone charges the ending without being indispensable to plot. Swappable with another contemplative register. Mid-6s on atmospheric resonance and closure participation.</comment>
