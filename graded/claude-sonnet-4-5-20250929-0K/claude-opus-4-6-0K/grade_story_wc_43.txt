<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("Hesitation, she believed, was cruelty wearing the mask of politeness"), and her choice to track down Phuong materializes as embodied ministry. Felix's micro-choices—pressing the shards together, whispering "There she is"—carry contradictory impulses (grief and gratitude acting simultaneously). The final renunciation (releasing Lien's memory) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, and Phuong's steady hands signal her own stakes. Minor slip: Maren's role as observer in the closure beat reduces her agency slightly, though her song remains active.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (hospice, Maren, Room 12) land cleanly by ~10% of text. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + charged final image): Felix's breath, the unified record, and Maren's sustained song reweight prior material with undeniable emotional cost—the cost is Felix's death and the group's shared witness, legible in "the stillness was no longer pulsing." The lens holds: density increases through layered sensory detail (smell, texture, light) and cadence shifts at the ending. One meaningful deepening occurs when Phuong arrives and the shards join, narrowing Felix's remaining options to acceptance and release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The alpine light functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image ("the light stayed anyway"). The vinyl shard is handled in two distinct beats (Felix holding it alone, then pressing it with Phuong's crescent) and its grooves, scent, and label constrain his final gesture. Spatial choreography (corridor, Room 12, bedside stool, window) remains coherent. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maren's professional filter (morphine drips as metronomes) and Felix's olfactory anchor ("dust and static"). The "radiant haven above the clouds" modulates from postcard to pressure vessel by the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: executing a meaningful goodbye for Felix before death. The tightening occurs when Phuong arrives and the record shards join, narrowing Felix's remaining time and forcing the final stance. Maren's agency (tracking down Phuong, singing) drives the turn; Felix's embodied response (trembling fingers, closed eyes, smile) materializes the cost. The price is legible: Felix's organs shutting down, the incomplete record, and the room's transition from "pulsing stillness" to static quiet. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as sensory and relational density increases toward the ending image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the scent of hope as "what had already been loved, rising one last time," articulated in the penultimate paragraph but earned by prior images (jasmine, grooves, price stickers). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—stillness no longer pulsing, light staying—without stating a moral. The vinyl shards function as a charged motif that reweights loss and reunion at closure. Subtext operates in Phuong's red eyes and steady hands, Felix's whispered recognition, and Maren's method (hymning coffee, rain, dog's head) that prepares the reader for the mundane as sacred. Minor risk: the penultimate paragraph's abstract phrasing ("fragrance of what had already been loved") borders on theme statement, but the final image rescues it with concrete sensory closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Maren; distance is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is character-specific: morphine drips as metronomes, light "like something holy," decisiveness framed as anti-cruelty. Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon (ministry, hymning, luminous) with purposeful elevation that fits her role. Dialogue is minimal but natural ("I brought someone. And something."); Felix's whisper ("There she is") carries goal and subtext. Minor slip: "pulsing stillness" recurs as a narrative phrase rather than Maren's perception in one instance, creating brief distance wobble. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "morphine drips ticked like metronomes" conveys setting, tone, and Maren's professional filter). No paraphrase loops or template runs. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("grief feel luminous," "fragrance of what had already been loved"). Minor overwriting in the penultimate paragraph: "complete in its intention to reunify what time and loss had scattered" stacks abstract terms and slightly dilutes momentum. The closure beat ("the stillness was no longer pulsing, and the light stayed anyway") is clean and propulsive. Grammar and pronoun references are clear; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (hospice music therapist reunites broken record shards for dying jazz DJ) offers a fresh synthesis of familiar material (deathbed reconciliation, object as memory). Maren's method—"hymning the mundane"—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the therapeutic role through concrete detail (coffee, rain, dog's head). The vinyl shards function as a non-literal puzzle that earns emotional closure without sentimentality. Risk: the elevated diction ("pulsing stillness," "luminous grief") and the alpine hospice float near aspirational template language. The ending's transformation (stillness no longer pulsing) feels inevitable in hindsight, rooted in prior sensory particulars. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren frames the opening expectation, makes the choice to track down Phuong (off-page but causally signaled), and executes the reunion and song on the page. Her singing shapes two distinct beats (introducing Phuong, sustaining the final moment) and charges the closure image. The trait "decisively kind" enables her agency and constrains hesitation. Cost is visible: she witnesses Felix's death and carries the ministry's emotional weight. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable in this exact form.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vinyl shard is handled in three beats: Felix holding it alone (with scent memory), the reunion when Phuong's crescent joins it, and the final image where it rests on Felix's chest. Its grooves, label, and incomplete state constrain the reunion's emotional charge and enable the central turn. Specificity (Coltrane, "A Love Supreme," triangular + crescent shape) makes it irreplaceable. Closure linkage is direct: "The broken record lay whole enough on his chest" in the ending beat. Cost is tied to the object's incompleteness and the effort to reunify it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scent of hope is seeded early (Felix's memory of the record shop: "jasmine perfume," "dust and static") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph as "the fragrance of what had already been loved." It shapes Felix's motive to hold the vinyl shard and inhale its scent, constraining his attachment. The concept reweights the ending by reframing hope as retrospective rather than prospective. Moderate causal pressure; lyric reprise elevates it into the mid-6s. Not indispensable—removal would weaken thematic resonance but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is labeled in the opening third ("Hesitation, she believed, was cruelty wearing the mask of politeness") and demonstrated when Maren knocks twice, opens the door, tracks down Phuong, and sustains the song through Felix's death. The trait constrains her tactics (no hesitation at thresholds) and enables the reunion beat. Cost is visible: she absorbs the emotional weight of witnessing death. Present in two beats (door entry, final song) and shapes closure participation. Solid integration but not fully indispensable—a different trait could motivate similar action with edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reunify" drives the central turn: Maren tracks down Phuong, Phuong brings the second shard, and the shards are pressed together on Felix's chest. This action enables the closure beat and Felix's final words ("There she is"). Causally irreplaceable: without reunification, the record remains fragmented and the emotional payoff collapses. Present in setup (Maren's week of tracking), development (Phuong's arrival), and payoff (shards joined, Felix's response, final image). High causal pressure and closure linkage; removal would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is signaled early in exposition ("she had learned...the dying did not want lullabies") and demonstrated in two beats: the list of mundane subjects (coffee, rain, dog's head) and Maren's final song (click of needle, yellow sticker, fingertips brushing). The method shapes Maren's tactics and charges the closure by grounding the transcendent in the ordinary. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the emotional effect but is partially swappable with other therapeutic approaches. Present in setup, middle explanation, and payoff; contributes to thematic resonance and ending tone.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" is anchored in the opening paragraph and reprised in the closure beat ("the clouds below the haven burned gold"). The alpine light pressures the tone (perpetual, gilding, luminous) and charges the final image ("the light stayed anyway"). Moderate setting integration: the hospice's elevation and light modulate emotional texture but do not constrain physical choices or tactics. The micro-setting (Room 12, bedside table, window) does more causal work. Present in setup and payoff; lyric reprise reweights meaning. Not indispensable—a different setting could support similar emotional stakes with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" frames the opening and signals Felix's three-day prognosis. Time tightens decisions: Maren acts immediately, Phuong arrives "this morning," and the final beat narrates Felix's last breath. The timeframe constrains Maren's tactics (no room for delay) and pressures the urgency of the reunion. Present in setup (diagnosis, prognosis), middle (Phuong's arrival timing), and payoff (breath stopping). Moderate causal pressure; time is tracked but not a live ticking clock that alters multiple moves. Solid integration but partially replaceable—urgency could arise from other constraints.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is stated in the closure beat ("a farewell executed not perfectly—because nothing involving death is perfect—but flawlessly") and dramatized through Maren's week of effort, the reunion choreography, and her sustained song. The motive shapes two key beats (tracking Phuong, singing at the end) and charges the final image with friction between perfection and completion. Cost is visible: the effort, the incomplete record, and Felix's death. The meta-commentary in the ending slightly over-articulates the motive, but the dramatization across beats earns the statement. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("the whole world pulsed with a stillness") and modulates through the story: present in Felix's room ("the room filled with the pulsing stillness"), then decisively shifted in the closure beat ("the stillness was no longer pulsing, and the light stayed anyway"). The tone constrains perception (morphine drips as metronomes, breath as rhythm) and charges the final image by marking Felix's death through tonal shift. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; the transformation from pulsing to static stillness is the story's emotional hinge. High specificity and irreplaceability; removal would flatten the ending's charge.</comment>
