<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout—her quartz-eye observations, her pragmatic philosophy ("Contracts are deciduous things"), and her embodied actions (unslung bag, tying the ribbon) all cohere. The relationship with Fen drives meaningful pressure and Maren's choice to share Elsi's ribbon represents a credible micro-choice that tilts present stakes. Internal contradiction operates subtly (caring for "wrong places" despite personal cost, including estrangement), and the final persistence feels earned by prior causality with visible opportunity cost (she remains alone, trespassing, socially isolated). Minor limitation: Fen's arc from enforcer to ally compresses slightly, though her young-professional conflict (duty vs. structural truth) reads plausibly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Maren persists in her work, Fen files the claim, and the cost is legible (Maren's continued isolation, Fen's choice to defy her employer, the orchard's precarious interdependence with the ruin). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texturing: the tuning-fork demonstration motivates Fen's decision, and the ribbon/blossoms pattern charges the final image. Orientation anchors (cathedral orchard, post-contract-breach, Maren tending trees) arrive by ~10% and remain stable. The because/therefore chain is clean: contract void → eviction attempt → structural revelation → Fen's claim → mutual persistence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the demonstration crystallizes the collapse risk and narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vertical orchard setting is vividly particular (roots clutching rafters, branches in the nave, scaffolding access) and directly constrains choice: Maren must climb to tend, the trees literally hold the roof, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional lens (quartz-eye focus, fracture lines, tuning-fork resonance) and the blossoms cascading answer the fork's tone, creating purposeful atmosphere. The micro-setting of the canvas bag and its forgotten contents functions as intimate geography that charges the closure. The cathedral's bones answer the fork, making environment an active participant in the revelation that shifts Fen's stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Maren's right to persist vs. institutional eviction) is signaled early and tightens when Fen arrives with legal authority. The tuning-fork demonstration provides a meaningful reversal: declared trespass → revealed structural necessity, which narrows options and raises cost (Compact loses asset, Fen risks career, Maren remains precarious). Agency is shared but coherent: Maren's demonstration is active choice, Fen's filing decision forecloses the easy path with felt professional cost. The escalation is clean under the Causal lens—because Maren demonstrates interdependence, therefore Fen can file the claim—and the final persistence image charges prior stakes. One small limitation: the Compact's fury is anticipated but not dramatized, leaving some cost deferred.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the deciduous-contract metaphor, the vertical orchard's "wrong place" persistence, and the generational handoff (Elsi's absence vs. Fen's arrival). The ribbon and blossoms recur with shifted meaning: first loss, then bridge, finally soft closure. Subtext operates richly in Maren's dialogue indirection ("You're trespassing" / "I'm persisting") and the tuning fork's non-literal answer to the thematic question (what endures when contracts fall?). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—persistence through structural interdependence and accidental mentorship—without moralizing. The final image (blossoms "soft as shed contracts, and the cathedral held") reprices the opening premise with conceptual and emotional cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds Maren's perceptual signature throughout: professional idiom (fracture lines, calibration weights, tuning forks), embodied action (knees protesting, quartz-eye clicking), and a distinct diction that mixes pragmatism with lyric compression ("Contracts are deciduous things"). Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext (Fen's clipped enforcement language vs. Maren's patient redirection), and age/class distinctions read cleanly. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the ribbon moment, slightly wider for the closing image—and narrative certainty matches Maren's knowledge throughout. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Minor note: "endearingly feisty, this one" reads slightly authorial, a hairline slip in distance, but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion and high information density (most lines do multiple jobs: setting, character, stakes). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected; sentence openings and structures vary. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (deciduous contracts, blossoms as closure, the orchard/cathedral marriage) without overwriting. One mild texture issue: "the impossible green persistence of it" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstract summary when concrete image would sharpen, and "accidental wisdom" arrives as slight label-speak in the final paragraph. Proofreading is clean; grammar and pronoun references are unambiguous throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes mentor-story, structural-dependence mystery, and generational handoff through the vertical orchard—a fresh, non-obvious frame. The deciduous-contract metaphor transforms a familiar trope (artist vs. institution) with specific occupational detail (mender of crystalline fractures) that reads both authentic and memorable. The tuning-fork demonstration is an earned, character-specific turn rather than a convenience. Transformation test: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars (quartz eye, scaffolding orchard, harmonic proof). Risk-taking (vertical orchard, indirect closure via dual persistence) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the daughter-ribbon backstory, while integrated, follows a recognizable mentor-regret template; the piece elevates it through specificity but does not fully escape the pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's identity as quartz-eye mender drives key turns: her professional lens reads the fracture (setup), she uses the tuning fork to demonstrate structural dependence (middle causal beat), and her final choice to persist in mending "what others couldn't see was broken" directly shapes closure. The prosthetic is handled on the page ("clicking softly," "pressed her quartz eye against a branch") with visible cost (she alone can see the fractures, isolating her work). Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ribbon is pulled from the forgotten bag (setup with anchored backstory), tied around the split branch as a visible bridge to Elsi (middle beat with Fen watching), and implicitly present in "the ribbon bright against the bark" as Maren climbs back up (closure echo). It reweights meaning from private loss to public demonstration of care and generational bridge. Handles span three beats with evolving use, but closure participation is glancing rather than causally active—it's visible but does not decisively alter the final image's options. Strong lyric reprise but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "deciduous" metaphor appears in Maren's dialogue ("Contracts are deciduous things"), shapes her philosophical stance against the Compact's legal claim, and returns in the final image ("blossoms kept falling, soft as shed contracts"). It pressures Fen's choice by reframing law as seasonal rather than absolute. Present in setup (contract breach context), middle (the key dialogue exchange), and closure (final image metaphor). One strong turn enabled (Fen's willingness to file against institutional will), but the concept operates more as thematic frame than direct tactical constraint—Maren's demonstration of structural dependence does the causal work. Mid-band for one key turn plus charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is applied to Fen as authorial characterization in the first encounter ("She was endearingly feisty, this one") and her sharp dialogue and arm-crossing show it. The trait enables her willingness to challenge Maren and later to file the claim despite Compact fury. However, the specific cost of "feisty" as opposed to "determined" or "principled" is not legible—her choice traces more to the structural demonstration than to this temperament label. Functional in one beat (initial confrontation stance) but largely replaceable; the trait could be swapped for similar descriptors without altering mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Persist" is the story's organizing verb: Maren corrects "trespassing" to "persisting" (setup and thematic anchor), the tuning-fork demonstration proves persistence is structural (middle escalation and causal turn), and the final image has both characters persisting with visible cost ("went on mending," Fen writing the claim, "the cathedral held"). The action redefines options at every turn—without Maren's refusal to leave, no eviction attempt; without the demonstration, no claim; without mutual persistence, no closure. Irreplaceable and causally essential across all three beats with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is signaled early (Maren carries it, "hadn't opened it properly in years"), its mechanics matter in the middle beat (she rummages, finds the ribbon and tuning fork), and both contents shape the demonstration that drives Fen's decision. The means is present in setup (bag mentioned, contents unknown), active in middle (retrieval and use), and echoed at closure (ribbon visible, fork's harmonic still implied). The bag's "forgotten" status adds specificity—these aren't tools Maren planned to deploy, which charges the accidental-wisdom tone—but the causal work is done by the tuning fork itself. Strong integration across beats but not fully indispensable (she could have remembered the bag earlier without changing outcome).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is inseparable from every beat: Maren must climb scaffolding to tend (setup with embodied action and spatial constraint), the trees' structural role is the story's central revelation (middle turn that changes all options), and the final image depends on the vertical persistence ("went on mending," blossoms falling, "the cathedral held"). The setting supplies the core problem (trees grow in wrong place), the hidden solution (they hold the roof), and the closure charge (mutual interdependence made visible). Remove this exact setting and the plot, stakes, and thematic resonance all collapse. Present in setup, drives middle escalation causally, and charges closure image with irreplaceable specificity and felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The breach-of-contract timeframe is signaled early ("Three weeks ago, the Compact had dissolved her position") and sets up the eviction threat that drives the scene. It tightens Maren's vulnerability (no income, no legal standing) and frames Fen's arrival with urgency. However, the time element does not escalate within the scene—no countdown or narrowing window presses choices—and the "three weeks" detail does not recur or constrain tactics. Functional in setup to establish stakes, but the dramatic present is driven by the demonstration and decision rather than temporal pressure. One key turn (post-contract status enables eviction attempt) but no active clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The generational-wisdom motivation is dramatized in Maren's choice to share the ribbon and Elsi's story, which bridges to Fen and enables the final handoff. Conflict is visible: Elsi wanted Maren to take "proper work" and stopped visiting (desire vs. cost), and Maren's persistence despite isolation shows the price of her values. The motivation shapes two beats (ribbon revelation and Fen's decision to file) and charges the closure image (young woman discovers wisdom through accident, Maren continues alone but no longer entirely alone). Felt friction between want (to matter, to bridge) and cost (estrangement, precarity). Strong integration with visible tradeoffs, though the motivation operates more through enacted choice than articulated internal struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accidental-wisdom tone is established early (Maren's patient, unsurprised replies; the forgotten bag setup) and modulates coherently through pressure: wry humor under eviction threat, quiet revelation during the tuning-fork demonstration, gentle closure without triumph. The final image ("wisdom sometimes arrives not through intention but through accident—through catching a dead twig, hearing a tuning fork") makes the tone explicit without breaking it, and the soft ending (blossoms falling, cathedral holding) charges the frame with earned cost. Tone shapes perception throughout and the closure image depends on it—remove the accidental frame and the ending reads as simple mentorship rather than unplanned interdependence. Coherent escalation with purposeful restraint that heightens rather than flattens pressure.</comment>
