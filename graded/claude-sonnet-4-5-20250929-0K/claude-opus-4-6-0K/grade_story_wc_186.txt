<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven: her retrocognitive gift is embodied through physical sensation ("tasting smoke") and shapes her relationship with objects. The astronomer Eda's embedded memories motivate Maret's eleven-month star-tracking vigil with lived-in specificity. The final choice—lighting the beacon and waiting for an answer—arises organically from her conviction that "every repeated act was a conversation with the past," though the emotional cost of potential failure remains implicit rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and tracks a clear accumulative arc: discovery of prism → tracking → pattern completion → revelation → rekindled signal. The closure is a Charged Poise moment ("waited for an answer from the sea") where Maret's hope and the rekindled signal reconfigure her stance with undeniable pressure; the cost—years of solitary labor, the gamble that something listens—charges the final image. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly through density layering and the final cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass pavilion is rendered through concrete sensory detail (curved panes, tuned frequencies, humming that becomes "almost like language") and directly constrains Maret's methodology: the prism's spectrum paints the walls, the "shard of hush" tracks across specific panes, and the deepest-voiced north pane triggers the retrocognitive flood. The post-collapse setting tightens her solitude and the stakes of rekindling contact. Spatial choreography (beacon tower rising from pavilion center, grease-pencil annotations webbing the glass) remains legible throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning and rekindling a signal across the empty ocean—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through eleven months of charting. The pattern-completion night delivers a meaningful tightening: the shard of hush aligns, the humming stops, retrocognition floods, and Maret decodes the coordinate. Agency is decisional (she tracks, marks, interprets) with visible cost (solitary labor, the beacon's persistent maintenance). No secondary conflict dilutes focus; the escalation is driven by protagonist persistence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme—that coincidences encode deliberate meaning, that patterns survive collapse—emerges through concrete action: Eda's split prism, Maret's tracking, the convergence of color/silence/star path. The final coordinate and the "signal she rekindled tonight" offer a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The image of hope as "a weed through cracked stone, stubborn and spined and alive" reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Subtext operates cleanly in the pavilion's layered humming and Maret's willed continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and apt; narrative certainty tracks what Maret knows through retrocognition. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: "thistledown notes," "ink in water," "shard of hush" feel voice-specific and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during retrocognitive floods, wider during summary of tracking months). No head-hopping; the single POV holds cleanly. Diction and rhythm reflect Maret's solitary, archival mindset without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (every line advances character, world, or pressure). No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or filter-verb stacks detected. Figurative language ("cathedral made of breath," "ink in water," "weed through cracked stone") is purposeful and coherent, not overwritten. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold at "called it a shard of hush" (a touch expository) but the phrase pays off at closure, so cost is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, ruined observatory, star tracking, and tuned glass pavilion as parts of a single pre-collapse instrument feels specific and non-obvious. The "shard of hush"—a calibrated silence within the spectrum—is a fresh inflection on communication-across-time narratives. Emotional specificity (hope as weed, the belief in repeated acts as conversation) avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its premise; the coordinate revelation in the convergence of light/pattern/sound is inevitable in hindsight and transforms familiar post-apocalyptic loneliness into purposeful vigil.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret's choices drive all major turns: she discovers the prism, carries it home, charts stars for eleven months, marks the pavilion, and interprets the final pattern. She lights the beacon nightly and waits for an answer, decisions that foreclose other paths (leaving, abandoning the vigil). Her role as custodian is enacted through repeated on-page action with visible cost (solitary labor, sustained hope against empty seas).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism appears in discovery, placement on the beacon ledge, nightly use splitting light into spectral ribbons, and the climactic pattern-completion moment. Its crack creates the "shard of hush," the aberration that Maret tracks for eleven months. Removing it would collapse the story's causal spine: no prism, no spectrum, no tracking method, no coordinate. The prism's broken state is revealed as deliberate design (Eda split it), reweighting its meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "shard of hush"—the silent line within the spectrum—is the story's central mechanism. Maret names it, tracks it across the pavilion for eleven months, and its alignment with the deepest-voiced pane triggers the retrocognitive flood and message decoding. It shapes her tactics (charting, marking), constrains her method (she must wait for celestial alignment), and charges the closure (the coordinate emerges from its convergence with color and star path). Without this exact concept, the plot fails.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Retrocognition enables Maret to read the prism's history (Eda's use, the deliberate split), plants Eda's star-tracking methods in her memory, and triggers the final revelation when the shard aligns. It constrains her approach (she relies on touch and past-echo rather than instruction) and carries implicit cost (isolation, the burden of ancestral knowledge). The trait is demonstrated in multiple beats (wall-touching at nine, prism discovery, pavilion flood) with visible consequences, though the personal price remains understated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rekindling is the story's culminating action: Maret lights the beacon nightly for decades, and the pattern-completion night "rekindled" the signal that reaches "whatever it was meant to reach." The verb appears in both Maret's habitual custodianship and the climactic moment when her tracking decodes the coordinate. Removing "rekindle" would require reframing the entire beacon-maintenance ritual and the closure's stakes. The action defines her motivation and the story's final hope.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is introduced early (Eda's charts, Maret's adoption of her methods), executed on-page for eleven months (recording constellations, overlaying with prismatic refractions), and delivers the closure (star paths converge with spectrum and silence to yield the coordinate). The mechanics matter: celestial movement governs the shard's position, and the alignment is causally necessary for the message. Swapping the method (e.g., tidal observation, radio waves) would require rewriting core causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pavilion's tuned glass panes hum when wind passes, translate prismatic light into "almost like language," and provide the canvas for Maret's grease-pencil annotations. The deepest-voiced north pane is the alignment target that triggers the retrocognitive flood. Eda tuned these panes as part of the instrument; the pavilion is not backdrop but co-actor. Its acoustic and optical properties constrain Maret's method and enable the coordinate decoding. The setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-collapse timeframe shapes stakes (empty ocean, no sailors, Maret as last keeper), motivates her solitary vigil, and establishes the pavilion's survival as either "meaningful or merely lucky." The decades-long emptiness tightens the gamble of rekindling a signal. However, the timeframe functions more as static backdrop than live pressure; no countdown or temporal constraint alters Maret's tactics within the eleven-month tracking window. Present as context but not dynamically tightening decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maret's belief that "coincidences have meaning" drives every choice: she carries the prism home, adopts Eda's methods, tracks for eleven months, and waits for an answer. The motivation is dramatized through sustained action with visible cost (years of solitary labor, nightly beacon maintenance, the risk of futility). Eda's conviction becomes Maret's; the final coordinate validates the premise. The desire is conflicted (hope vs. doubt: "stubborn and spined") and tested by prolonged effort. Removing it would hollow the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tone—"thistle-blown hope"—is coherent from opening ambiguity ("meaningful or merely lucky") through patient tracking to the final image of "hope rise in her chest like a weed through cracked stone, stubborn and spined and alive." The prose carries quiet persistence rather than triumph; the humming pavilion, the empty ocean, and Maret's waiting modulate pressure without flattening into despair or spiking into false certainty. The tone charges the closure image: fragile, persistent, alive against ruin.</comment>
