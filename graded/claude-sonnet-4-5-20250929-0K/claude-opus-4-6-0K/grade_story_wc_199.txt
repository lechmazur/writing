<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wren's interior life is rendered through concrete particulars—seed sorting, monument building, her "moss believes in stone" devotion—and the final transformation is earned through eleven seasons of accumulation. Her motivation to decode leaves drives micro-choices (catching, charting, building) that escalate into the climactic planting gesture. The embodied shift ("fingers were darker, root-threaded") avoids diagnostic label-speak and grounds the change. Minor slip: the transformation description leans slightly ornamental ("opalescent shimmer of moonstone") without fully dramatizing the cost of becoming something other than human.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (arbor, Wren, seed sorting, falling leaves). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through repeated pattern (eleven seasons of near-decoding) until the moonstone speck and monument-building trigger the message's arrival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/transformation)—Wren becomes the seed she's been sorting, forecloses her former purely-human path, and the arbor sings back. Cost is visible in bodily alteration and the finality of "emerged transformed." One meaningful deepening (the prodding of the monument unlocks the message) tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is rendered with precise constraints: leaves fall sideways, roots clutch cloud, nothing falls downward. These rules directly shape Wren's choices—she must sort with intention or nightshade sprouts where sage should grow. The workbench soil "carried up from the ruined ground" becomes the literal medium for her transformation when she presses palms into it. The arbor's physical properties (pale branches, moss-dressed, breath-holding) charge the final image of symbiotic singing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode the message in falling leaves, signaled early and sustained across eleven seasons. The moonstone speck's discovery and Wren's monument-building create the tightening—prodding the monument causes leaves to spell legibly for the first time. The final turn (realizing she is the seed to be planted) narrows options with visible cost: she physically transforms, forecloses her former human-only state, and gains the ability to read leaves. Agency is enacted through the prodding micro-choice and the decision to press palms into soil. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—devotion and transformation through patient attention to the overlooked—emerges entirely through image and action. The monuments to forgotten things, the eleven-season accumulation, and the dust-speck catalyst dramatize the premise without stating it. "You are the seed I sorted last" reweights all prior material: Wren's orderly devotion was never about mastering the arbor but preparing herself to be planted. The final image (singing while sorting, arbor singing back) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The "mossy delight" and "green things growing in gray places" encode earned transformation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and intimate throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Wren notices seed weight and hum, leaf vein patterns, the "opalescent patience" of moonstone—observation filtered through her orderly, devoted lens. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("moss believes in stone," "assembled itself the way dawn assembles light"). Mild ornamental drift in the transformation paragraph ("opalescent shimmer," "root-threaded") slightly elevates register but remains legible. No dialogue to assess; interior texture holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid specificity: "roots clutched nothing but cloud and charcoal air," "like a tooth returned to a jaw," "the way a shell must feel when the shoot finally pushes through." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting in the transformation beat: "emerged transformed, as she always did—not dramatically, not with fire or thunder, but in that quiet way of moss reclaiming stone" could compress. Two metaphor vehicles (dawn/light, shell/shoot) in close succession slightly cluster but remain coherent. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-sorting devotion, skyborne ecology, monument-building ritual, and self-transformation feels cohesive and non-obvious. The moonstone speck as catalyst and the "you are the seed I sorted last" reversal are earned in hindsight. The arbor premise—suspended in ash, requiring intentional planting, leaves as alphabet—integrates world-building and character stakes organically. Risk-taking (elliptical timeline, lyric closure, protagonist-as-seed literalization) heightens meaning. Slight familiarity in the mentor-figure absence and solitary devotion arc keeps it from the highest originality band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wren's choices drive all key turns: she sorts seeds (establishes routine and care), builds monuments (including the moonstone speck monument that triggers the message), prods the monument (unlocks leaf legibility), and presses palms into soil (enacts transformation). Her orderly nature constrains method and shapes the ending—she returns to sorting, now singing. Present in setup, middle prodding beat, and closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonstone speck appears early (discovery on sorting tray), is handled in the monument-building beat (centered "like a heart"), and the prodding of its monument triggers the leaf-message cascade. Its opalescent quality recurs in Wren's transformed eyes, charging the closure image. However, the speck itself could be replaced with any forgotten fragment; its moonstone-ness does not constrain tactics or provide unique properties beyond symbolic resonance. Two-gate fulfillment with lyric reprise but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regional folklore (root-speakers, leaves as messages, "hush where past meets prophecy") frames Wren's eleven-season effort and legitimizes her devotion. It shapes her tactics: she charts trajectories, compares veins to old alphabets. The folklore pays off when the message finally arrives and she becomes a "living voice" of it. Present in setup and closure, but functions more as atmospheric premise than active constraint—Wren never chooses between folkloric and non-folkloric paths.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is signaled early ("as she always did") and paid off at closure when Wren literally transforms with root-threaded fingers and moonstone eyes. The attribute constrains her arc—transformation is inevitable, only its form is in question. It enables the final action (singing while sorting) and forecloses her prior purely-human state with visible cost. The "always" element is somewhat undermined by being told rather than shown across multiple prior cycles, but the ending transformation is enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prodding the monument is the hinge action: "The moment she set it down, a leaf spiraled past her face" begins the cascade, and "She prodded the monument gently with her fingertip, adjusting the speck's position, and another leaf fell, then another." This action unlocks the message after eleven seasons of failure and redefines all prior options—she can now read leaves. Major turn traces directly to this beat; it is irreplaceable and causally central. Present in setup (monuments built), enacted in climax, and its consequence (leaf-reading) persists to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Monument-building is introduced early ("She had built monuments to lost varietals, to unnamed beetles..."), given specific mechanics (crossed twigs, bark curl, centered speck), and its execution in the middle beat triggers the story's climax. The method shapes Wren's devotion and provides the mechanism for breakthrough. It constrains her response to the speck—she does "what she always did with forgotten things"—and the prodding of this monument is the major turn. Present across setup, development, and causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor supplies multiple constraints: leaves fall sideways (not down), requiring Wren to catch them; misplaced seeds sprout wrong plants, demanding precision; the arbor "holds its breath" during the hush, creating the prophecy window. The thin soil layer becomes the literal medium for transformation when Wren presses into it. The arbor's response (singing back) charges the final image. Setting rules shape every tactic and enable closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is named early and returns at the climax ("Wren sat very still in the hush where past meets prophecy"). It frames the moment when the arbor "neither grew nor shed but simply held its breath," creating the window for message legibility. The timeframe constrains the narrative present—this is the season when breakthrough is possible—and charges the transformation beat. However, it functions more as atmospheric frame than live clock with escalating pressure; Wren does not race against the hush ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decoding the leaf message is Wren's sole motivation, dramatized through eleven seasons of charting, pressing, comparing, and near-misses. The motivation drives all on-page choices: sorting precision, monument-building, leaf-catching, and the final realization that she must plant herself. Friction arises in the repeated near-decoding ("each autumn the meaning slipped through") and the cost at closure—successful decoding requires bodily transformation and loss of purely human identity. Present throughout and shapes the ending stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" coheres in diction ("moss believes in stone," "moss reclaiming stone," "green things growing in gray places") and modulates from patient devotion to breakthrough joy. Tone remains textured and specific—delight is embodied in the arbor singing back, leaves falling "like children running home," and Wren singing while sorting. The tone charges the final image without tipping into sentimentality. It supports pressure throughout and heightens the closure effect.</comment>
