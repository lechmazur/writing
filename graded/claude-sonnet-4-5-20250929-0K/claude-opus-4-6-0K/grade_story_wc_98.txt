<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's interiority is consistent and embodied—her "luminous doubt" manifests in physical gestures (holding the seed to her ear, "feeling foolish and reverent"). Her micro-choices (opening the fruit early, pressing the seed, returning to dream notes) constrain later options and drive pressure. The final transcription act forecloses alternative paths with visible cost (urgency, shaking handwriting). Minor deduction: internal contradiction between empirical skepticism and faith could be sharper in a pivotal beat to intensify the stakes of her choice.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's transcription and the promise that "fourteen people would dream of sound again tonight" crystallizes her stance and reweights the prior doubt with undeniable pressure. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Causal linkage in dream interpretation → seed awakening, Accumulative in the layering of doubt and action). Cost is legible: urgency, physical shaking, and the monsoon's approach frame the forfeiture of certainty. The escalation tightens once (silence dreams → Tekua's dream → seed awakening) and narrows options cleanly under the chosen lens.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The ridge setting and the seed object constrain Maren's choices: she climbs at dawn, sits among trees, opens the fruit. The seed's physical transformation (pale → green → gold, warmth, vibration) charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("impossibly luminous," "light that seemed to come from inside the color spectrum"). Minor cap: the volcanic channels and village are mentioned but do not apply pressure in the beats where Maren acts; the ridge itself is vivid but slightly static after the initial bloom description.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled early and sustained. The fourteen-silence dreams create one meaningful tightening that narrows Maren's options to this seed and Tekua's lullaby. Agency is clear: her choice to interpret dreams, open the fruit, and speak the recognition "You carry a song" drives the closure. The monsoon's approach and the transcription urgency foreclose alternative paths with visible cost (shaking handwriting, "tall and dark and inevitable" clouds). One additional reversal or complication in the middle beats would have elevated this further.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—faith versus empiricism in cultural preservation—emerges organically from Maren's actions and doubt. The final image ("luminous and doubtful and alive") reweights the opening's "luminous doubt" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the seed-awakening ritual and the ambiguity of whether memory truly resides in seeds or is constructed. The piece resists tidy binaries: Maren does not resolve whether she practices "science or sorcery," yet her transcription anchors memory with undeniable cost. No explicit moralizing; the conceptual repricing is felt through the final move to "the next tree."</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-distinctive: "empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt," and the blended register of scientific observation and ritual ("felt foolish and reverent") anchor Maren's perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during seed-work, wider during exposition). The prose rhythm tightens under pressure ("not quiet—silence"). Minor deduction: the expository blocks in paragraphs 2–3 carry slight filter-verb stacking ("This was why…," "This was her method…") that slightly dulls immediacy, though they remain voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in peak beats ("She wrote every note, every word that surfaced, her handwriting shaking…"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor deductions: the phrase "reality checker" and "empirically whimsical practice" repeat without reweighting; paragraph 2's exposition includes slight paraphrase loops ("the stories, songs, recipes, warnings, and whispered histories" is a synonym stack). The seed-awakening sequence is clean and clear. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—knowledge fruit carrying collective memory—is fresh and grounded in specific world logic (volcanic ridge, seven-year bloom, dream interpretation method). The synthesis of scientific protocol and ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. The seed-awakening beat transforms the "silent lullaby" motif through embodied action. Minor deduction: the "reality checker" title and job description lean slightly toward template speculative-fiction roles; stronger occupational specificity (e.g., unique tools or institutional friction) would have sharpened originality. Risk-taking in the ambiguous closure ("did not know if…") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's role as reality checker drives all key turns: interpreting dreams, climbing the ridge, opening the fruit, recognizing the lullaby, transcribing it. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Her choices narrow options and impose cost (urgency, doubt, physical shaking). The character is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The seed is handled in multiple beats: opened, held to ear, pressed between palms, felt to hum, transcribed. Its physical transformation (pale → green → gold) reweights the closure image. The seed's awakening is the story's central action and forecloses alternative paths. Without this exact object, the closure fails.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Collective memory shapes the dominant stake (protect memories before monsoon) and tactics (dream interpretation as method). The concept constrains Maren's choices: she must recognize the memory to awaken it. The fourteen-silence dreams and Tekua's lullaby demonstrate memory loss and recovery on the page. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal pressure is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Empirically whimsical" appears in setup and closure ("luminous doubt"). It labels Maren's stance but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost until the seed-holding beat, where the attribute enables her to balance measurement and faith. The phrase reappears in the final line, reweighting prior doubt. Functional but slightly ornamental; a middle beat where the trait imposes a tradeoff would elevate this.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Awakening the seed is the story's hinge: Maren's recognition ("You carry a song") triggers the seed's transformation and enables transcription. This action is dramatized, not summarized, and drives the closure with undeniable cost (urgency, shaking handwriting). Present in middle and closure; causal pressure is high. Irreplaceable: without this exact action, the memory cannot be preserved.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dream interpretation is signaled early (paragraph 4: "through interpreted dreams, she could determine which seeds were ready"), used in the middle (fourteen-silence dreams, Tekua's dream), and shapes the closure (dream notes lead to recognition). The method constrains Maren's approach and enables the seed-awakening tactic. Mechanics are clear: cross-referencing symbols, cataloging images. Present across three beats with causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The ancient ridge in bloom is present in setup (paragraph 2), middle (Maren climbs and sits among trees), and closure ("The ridge bloomed around her"). The setting provides the fruit and creates the urgency (monsoon will strip blossoms). It pressures choices by limiting time and access. The ridge's luminous quality charges the final image. Solid integration; a middle beat where terrain or weather alters tactics would push this higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The monsoon timeframe is signaled early ("Three weeks, perhaps less"), pressures the middle beats (Maren's urgency to open an early fruit), and appears in the closure image ("monsoon clouds were building on the horizon, tall and dark and inevitable"). The clock tightens decisions: she must awaken seeds now or lose memories. The timeframe is live and tracked; it forecloses deferral with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Protecting cultural memory is dramatized in every beat: climbing the ridge, interpreting dreams, opening the fruit, transcribing the lullaby. The motivation drives choices and imposes cost (urgency, shaking handwriting, doubt about method). Friction appears in Maren's uncertainty ("did not know if what she practiced was science or sorcery") but does not halt action. The motivation is indispensable to story logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>"Luminous doubt" is seeded early ("luminous...light," "empirically whimsical...equal parts measurement and faith") and sustained through the middle beats ("feeling foolish and reverent," "did not know"). The tone modulates under pressure (urgency at the seed-awakening) and charges the final image ("luminous and doubtful and alive"). Coherent across turns; the tone reweights the premise without stating a moral. Specificity and closure linkage are high.</comment>
