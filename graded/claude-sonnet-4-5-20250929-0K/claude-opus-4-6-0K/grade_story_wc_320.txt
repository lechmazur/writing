<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—her sensory attention ("thumbnail-sized piece," "oxidized copper and old rain") reads authentically professional. The mentor-taught technique of "discarding assumptions" shapes her approach, and the tears at success feel earned by cumulative pressure rather than declared emotion. However, the final choice to "press play" on the city relies more on metaphorical framing than on a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost; we see her steady descent but no moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern convergence rather than because/therefore causality. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the composite frequency crystallizes Vireska's "pause" and Maren's action "presses play," reweighting the abandonment premise with conceptual cost (she now carries responsibility for reactivation). Orientation anchors (Vireska, Tower Fourteen, lunar perigee window) land cleanly within the first third. One friction: the cost at closure is felt but abstract; the story does not dramatize what forfeiture or tactical change "pressing play" entails beyond her steady walk, keeping the ending in the mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The suspended city, cable bridges, mist-pooled gorge, and Tower Fourteen's control room are rendered with vivid specificity and constrain Maren's choices: she must climb the tallest structure, kick the generator, tune manually. The oscilloscope and receptor cradle function as micro-setting that enables the key turn. The final image—bridges swaying "as if the gorge itself were tuning"—charges closure by treating environment as responsive participant, lifting the category into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlock the corridor during lunar perigee to complete the signal) is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through Maren's method shift: she stops assuming structure, hears the "shard of hush," and the fragment glows in response—a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and reweights the termination signal as a beginning. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (discarding assumptions) and fits the Accumulative lens. One limiter: the cost is conceptual (responsibility for reactivation) but not dramatized as a tactical trade-off or visible forfeiture on the page, keeping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: "every signal that stopped was simply waiting for the right listener to find where it started again" is earned by the composite waveform, not asserted. The ending's non-literal answer—Vireska as paused rather than abandoned—reweights prior material (rust, abandonment, gorge mist) with conceptual cost (Maren now carries the beginning). The piece resists moralizing; the tears and "fantasy practicality" idiom ground insight in embodied experience. No thematic echo or late-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: "a chandelier no one had remembered to take down," "the earth was trying to forget," "fantasy practicality of someone who repaired miracles for a living." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on sensory detail during tuning, zooms out for the descent). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "She now understood" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary-tell when the image could carry that realization unaided, but the surrounding specificity keeps the voice strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean with high information density and varied rhythm: "the static thinned, like a crowd parting" and "a frequency below hearing that pressed against her chest like a hand steadying her heartbeat" are vivid and purposeful. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. One artifact cluster: "stopped assuming" repeats across three consecutive sentences in the tuning beat, creating minor synonym churn (−0.3). No other scaffolding or filter stacks; clarity and propulsion are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of signal interpretation, lunar perigee mechanics, and the "pause/play" city premise feels specific and non-obvious. The "shard of hush" as presence-without-sound and the waveform completion (termination signal meeting quiet) are fresh inflections that grow from the premise. The fantasy-practicality frame ("repaired miracles for a living") avoids median hedging and commits fully. Risk-taking in the lyric final image ("the gorge itself were tuning") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a +0.3 within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices (climb Tower Fourteen, tune the array, discard assumptions, copy the composite frequency, descend) drive every key turn. Her profession frames expectation early, constrains her approach (manual tuning, mentor-taught technique), and enables the closure beat. Beat involvement: setup (first third), middle tuning decision, closure action (copying crystal, descent). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high (only a signal interpreter with this training could execute the method).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The star fragment appears in setup (pocket description), middle beat (placed in receptor cradle, begins to glow), and closure (provides half the composite waveform that reweights the abandonment premise). It narrows options (must be used during perigee at this tower) and its stored resonance is causally essential to unlocking the corridor. Specificity: "crystallized broadcast energy," "dying note of a network." Irreplaceability and beat involvement justify high score; no swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" as "presence without sound, a frequency below hearing" shapes the central stake and redefines the static wall Maren initially encounters. It appears in setup framing (the title stakes), middle discovery (the hush that parts the static), and closure (interlocks with the fragment to form the carrier wave). The concept alters tactics (requires discarding assumptions about structure) and provides the other half of the waveform, making it indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the control room hum after Maren kicks the generator: "The room hummed to life, serenely electric, every gauge needle trembling like a compass finding north." Present in middle beat; the trait colors the moment but does not constrain a later choice or carry visible cost. No closure participation. Lyric quality adds texture but remains ornamental relative to plot pressure; setup and middle presence push it to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tuning drives the entire middle sequence and closure: Maren sweeps dead bands, discards assumptions, hears the hush, and the waveform completes. The action is irreplaceable (swapping for "listen" or "search" would erase the tactile, equipment-specific method). Beat involvement: setup (console description), extended middle pressure (static wall, needle sweep, method shift), closure (composite frequency copied). Causal pressure and specificity are exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method ("discarding assumptions") is seeded via mentor backstory in the middle beat and immediately enacted: Maren stops assuming the signal will sound structured, loud, or meant for humans. The hush appears as direct result. Mechanics matter and shape the breakthrough; the method is not retroactively explained but shown through three specific renunciations followed by perceptual shift. Beat involvement and causal linkage justify high score; early signal would lift further, but mid-scene teaching with immediate payoff is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vireska's suspended structure, cable bridges, gorge mist, and Tower Fourteen constrain every choice: Maren must cross bridges, climb the tallest tower, use its specific console. The gorge's mist and the city's "pause" state supply the final image's charge. Setup anchors location early; middle beats use tower geography (stairs, control room, generator kick); closure repurposes bridges and gorge as tuned environment. Environment is indispensable to pressure and ending resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is established early ("closer tonight than it had been in eighteen years") and creates the window that opens electromagnetic corridors. It tightens the decision timeline (Maren must act during this specific alignment) and enables the method (tidal forces stretch frequencies). The timeframe appears in setup, drives middle urgency ("The moon slid closer"), and participates in closure framing. Causal pressure and beat involvement are strong; one gap: no explicit clock countdown or scene-length constraint to sharpen tactical trades.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation ("every signal that stopped was simply waiting for the right listener to find where it started again") is seeded early ("she believed…that every signal that stopped was simply waiting"), drives her method choice (discarding assumptions to hear the hush), and is dramatized at closure when she copies the composite frequency and recognizes Vireska as paused rather than ended. Friction between belief and initial failure (static wall) creates pressure. Cost is conceptual (responsibility) but dramatized through tears and the pocket-carrying image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" ("someone who repaired miracles for a living") anchors tone from the opening and modulates coherently: matter-of-fact detail (kick the generator, receptor cradle mechanics) blends with lyric resonance (chandelier city, gorge exhaling mist, "serenely electric"). Tone charges the final image (bridges swaying deliberately, carrying "something other than rust") without tipping into whimsy or clinical flatness. Coherence through turns and pressure-driven modulation justify solid high-7s to low-8s.</comment>
