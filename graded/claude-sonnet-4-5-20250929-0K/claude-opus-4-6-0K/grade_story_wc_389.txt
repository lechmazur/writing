<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific—the nail scratches, her self-deprecation, her trust in the cobalt portico. Her decision to broadcast emerges from 411 days of isolation and her fear that Elias is "almost right," creating a clear hierarchy of values. The final choice to make "one final mark... A day begun" feels earned by her sustained observation and waiting. Minor deduction: her internal conflict between fear and action could be more contradictory and embodied in the broadcast moment itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through radio fragments, the portico's recurring light, and Maren's wall marks, culminating in her counter-broadcast as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure reweights her isolation from survival into conversation, with the final mark shifting from "day survived" to "day begun"—a legible cost (ending her silent vigil) that forecloses her observer stance. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph). Deduction: the middle section's reflective density (Elias exposition, variant allegiance philosophy) flattens present pressure before the storm scene re-engages; the causal link between her months of encoding and the single broadcast moment could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory above the cloudline and the cobalt portico constrain Maren's choices: her "unique atmospheric position" enables the counter-frequency, and the portico's storm-flash geometry charges both her isolation rituals and the climactic broadcast ("a hundred blue suns"). The granite tooth, tempest choreography, and eastern rim sunrise are filtered through her POV and integrated into action. The body as micro-setting works well (bad knees, nail in pocket). The setting participates directly in the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether Maren's counter-message can complete Elias's vision and prevent fracture. The broadcast moment tightens pressure in one meaningful turn, and her choice to transmit costs her 411 days of silence, converting solitude into vulnerability. The phrase "I am asking you to unfold your own" crystallizes her stance against variant allegiance with visible cost. Deduction: the escalation is more accumulative than causal; the middle exposition on Elias and allegiance tells rather than dramatizes a present obstacle, and no on-page complication tests her resolve before she keys the mic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of allegiance as mutable versus self-authorship emerges through Maren's counter-broadcast and the "unfold your own" imperative, avoiding overt thesis. The cobalt light, ancient shadows/light pairing, and the wall marks recur with shifted meaning at closure. The final image—"watched it anyway. That was the whole point"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether hope can be mapped versus imposed. Minor slip: "variant allegiance" and the origami metaphor are articulated somewhat abstractly in the middle section, edging toward theme statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Maren's diction mixes lyric elevation ("cobalt glass portico... sapphire geometries") with grounded self-talk ("stubborn woman with a telescope and bad knees"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the broadcast. No dialogue on the page to judge. Minor deduction: phrases like "lyrically prophetic in a way that made your chest ache before your mind caught up" and "allegiance was not given; it mutated" drift toward essayistic register, slightly loosening narrative stance under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the storm/broadcast sequence. Figurative language is vivid but concentrated: "house of cards balanced on a sleeping dog," "signal ribboned outward... like stitches in a wound." Deductions: several template stems recur ("She had," "The," "Where he"), a paraphrase loop appears ("asked for your allegiance / asking you to unfold your own" echoes the prior contrast structure), and elevated diction in reflective passages ("mosaic of a civilization tearing itself apart," "populations could unfold like origami in reverse") stacks without pattern-teaching, reducing propulsion in the middle third. The patterned-artifact penalty applies (−0.6 baseline, no closure touch), and the filter-verb density ("had learned," "had listened," "had watched") clusters in the Elias section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lone astronomer, fragmented radio, and counter-prophecy is specific and non-obvious. The "unfold your own" imperative and the shift from "day survived" to "day begun" feel earned in hindsight. The cobalt portico as trust object is a memorable particular. Deduction: the prophet-versus-scientist frame and "ancient shadows" terminology echo familiar tropes (tech versus mysticism, lone voice versus cult), and the reflective exposition on variant allegiance reads slightly derivative of contemporary discourse on polarization. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren as "lonely visionary" is seeded early (chosen the observatory, sensed the old order's fragility), develops through her encoding work across months, and drives the climactic broadcast decision. Her choice to transmit alters tactics (ending her silence, risking exposure) and forecloses her observer role with visible cost. The element shapes two key beats (her listening/suspicion turn, the broadcast itself) and is indispensable to closure. Adjustment: the visionary trait is somewhat told in the Elias section rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under pressure before the broadcast.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt portico appears in four distinct beats: initial description and Maren's trust, her storm ritual ("pretending it was the ocean"), the broadcast moment ("a hundred blue suns"), and implicit in the closure image (the eastern light). Its unique atmospheric and emotional properties constrain her choice of this observatory and charge the final transmission. The portico is irreplaceable and causally linked to her broadcast's power. Could score higher if its mechanics (light scattering as metaphor for signal dispersion) were more explicitly leveraged in the broadcast's success.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is seeded early ("Loyalty was not a fixed star"), developed through the Elias exposition (factions splintering, populations unfolding), and directly opposed in Maren's broadcast imperative ("unfold your own"). It shapes the dominant stake and the closure's conceptual repricing (self-authorship versus imposed creed). Deduction: the concept is more thematic accent than on-page constraint; Maren does not face a concrete allegiance dilemma herself, and the factions below remain off-page abstractions rather than pressures that alter her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" is attributed to Elias ("a voice cutting clean through the interference, lyrically prophetic") and claimed for Maren's broadcast ("the same lyric resonance"), but the attribute functions as label rather than dramatized constraint. We do not hear Elias's cadence or see Maren modulate her speech rhythms to match or counter his. The trait influences her decision to frame her message in resonant terms but does not create a visible tradeoff or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears as metaphor (populations "unfold like origami in reverse") and as the climactic imperative ("I am asking you to unfold your own"). The action redefines the stake from countering Elias to enabling self-authorship, and the final mark ("A day begun") echoes the unfolding gesture. The element drives the closure unit and is irreplaceable. Deduction: the action is conceptual/linguistic rather than physical, and its cost is implied rather than dramatized; we do not see anyone below respond or Maren face immediate consequence for the broadcast.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are seeded early ("static was never truly empty," "Fragments lived inside the hiss"), enable Maren's months of listening and piecing together the mosaic, and provide the means for her counter-broadcast ("unique atmospheric position above the clouds"). The method constrains her tactics (she cannot descend, must wait for the right storm) and is indispensable to the closure. The frequencies' fragmented nature directly mirrors the theme of variant allegiance. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory above the cloudline supplies the "unique atmospheric position" that enables the counter-frequency, isolates Maren for 411 days (shaping her motivation), and provides the cobalt portico and storm as pressure and closure charge. The setting constrains her choices (cannot communicate below easily, must wait for the storm) and participates directly in the ending image (eastern rim, clouds, portico light). The stormlit moment is indispensable to the broadcast's power. Highly integrated and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" is signaled (Elias's first broadcast "two winters ago," Maren arrived "three years before") and contextualizes the 411 days of isolation. The prophet's rise provides the external conflict that precipitates Maren's broadcast. Deduction: the timeframe is backdrop rather than live clock; no ticking deadline tightens Maren's decision to transmit now versus later, and the prophet's timeline does not alter her tactics on the page. The element shapes context but not immediate escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is Elias's promise, and Maren's counter-message adds "ancient light" and "orbital mechanics of hope," directly opposing and completing the motivation. The desire is dramatized in her choice to encode and transmit, and the friction between imposed dawn (Elias) and self-authored unfolding (Maren) drives the closure. Deduction: the motivation is more thematic than viscerally embodied; Maren's own want (to complete Elias, to end isolation, to be heard) is somewhat abstracted, and we do not see her wrestle with the cost of speaking versus remaining silent in the broadcast moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" as tone is inconsistent. Gritty elements appear (411 scratches, nail pulled from floorboard, static and fragments, civilization tearing apart), but whimsy is largely absent; the prose is lyric-elevated and earnest rather than playful or ironic. The cobalt portico's "irrationally, completely" trusted figurehead and Maren's self-deprecation ("stubborn woman... bad knees") hint at whimsy, but the storm scene and broadcast are solemn. The tone does not modulate meaningfully across turns or charge the final image with the promised blend.</comment>
