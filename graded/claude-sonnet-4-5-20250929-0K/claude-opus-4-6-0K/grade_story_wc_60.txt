<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is strong and consistent: "to see the world in its fullest luminosity and then hold each observation at arm's length" establishes her contradictory impulses cleanly. Her trait of realistic imagination ("envision impossible things and then draft plausible blueprints") shapes her approach to the quest, and the final beat "even miracles at arm's length" shows earned Stasis with visible cost—she remains a skeptic while allowing wonder. Interiority stays embodied through action (chisel work, measuring patience) rather than therapy-speak, though "defiant hush of someone who refuses to ask permission" edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with causal elements: the breadcrumb trail structures eleven days of accumulation, and the closure lands on-page when Elara unsticks the box, releasing memories with visible consequence (fountains run, geese resume, city remembers). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Tuesday geese, Plaza of Dry Basins, Vaelith fountains). One escalation beat (chisel work at the sealed box) narrows to a meaningful tightening, and the release reweights all prior material. Cost is legible: "the skeptic allowed the luminous thing inside her chest to simply be"—a renunciation of her defensive stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fountain cityscape is vivid and specific: "carved into walls, rising from intersections, embedded in courtyards" with "mineral ghosts." The stained-glass box ("deep blues and ambers and reds soldered together with lead veins") is texturally rich and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through districts to the subterranean chamber. The geese overhead function as a recurring environmental anchor that reweights at closure when they resume migration, serving as both setting detail and pressure marker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unstick trapped memories to restore Vaelith) is signaled early and coheres through eleven days of breadcrumb-following. The chisel work at the sealed box provides one meaningful tightening under pressure: "testing and doubting and adjusting, until she felt the first give." Agency is clear—Elara's persistent, skeptical labor drives the resolution—and the cost is visible: "she intended to hear every note she could" commits her to sidereal patience as an ongoing price. No antagonist required; the city's negligence and mineral crust provide resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: memory as substance, forgotten fountains as emotional cholesterol, skepticism as both armor and cost. The final image ("the skeptic allowed the luminous thing inside her chest to simply be") answers the thematic question without stating a moral, reweighting Elara's defensive stance through the concrete act of unsticking. "Sidereal patience" recurs with escalating meaning from concept to lived constraint, and the piece resists tidy resolution—Elara "still did not entirely believe what she had done," sustaining ambiguity. No thematic echo or sermonizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Elara notices everything and distrusts what she notices, filtering details through her skeptical lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("defiant hush," "sidereal patience"), though occasional elevated register ("realistically imaginative," "emotional cholesterol") slightly tensions the POV's lexicon during high-pressure beats. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at closure when "the skeptic allowed the luminous thing inside her chest to simply be"—an internal shift that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with high information density: "memories had thickened and solidified inside the pipes like emotional cholesterol" performs multiple jobs (world logic, stakes, tone). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings shift across beats. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("luminous thing inside her chest," "golden water that carried voices") and some filter-verb reliance ("she could feel," "she understood") that dulls immediacy in early exposition. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final paragraph sustains propulsion without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (city memories trapped in waterworks, geese frozen mid-flight as time snags) offers a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. "Sidereal patience" and "realistically imaginative" combine familiar fantasy tropes (quest, magical object) with specific conceptual pressure. The breadcrumb trail and stained-glass box avoid generic quest markers through sensory specificity. Elara's skepticism as both tool and cost distinguishes her from stock fantasy protagonists. The piece commits fully to its logic (memories as substance, mineral crust as emotional blockage) without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara the "luminous skeptic" is present throughout, signaled early ("she noticed everything…and trusted nothing she noticed"). Her skepticism shapes key choices: following breadcrumbs with "sidereal patience," applying "precise, skeptical pressure" to the chisel work, and the closure moment "she still did not entirely believe what she had done" while allowing wonder. The trait constrains her approach (slow, doubting, methodical) and charges the final image when she permits belief. Three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stained-glass box appears late (~70% mark) but is causally essential: its sealed state creates the final obstacle, its translucent walls reveal trapped memories, and Elara's chisel work to unstick it produces the climactic release. It returns with reweighted meaning in the final image as the source of "golden water" and restored memories. Two beats (discovery, unsticking) with strong closure linkage and irreplaceable properties. Late introduction slightly lowers score from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is signaled early ("patience calibrated to the slow wheel of stars") and shapes Elara's approach across eleven days: "she could spend a few more hours prying at corroded valves." It reappears at closure ("Elara listened with sidereal patience, because some songs take longer than a human lifetime") with reweighted meaning as an ongoing cost. The concept constrains tactics (slow, methodical work) and charges the ending. Two beats plus closure, though middle development is more attitudinal than choice-altering.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" is defined early ("envision impossible things and then draft plausible blueprints") and enables Elara's understanding that "trapped memories were not metaphor" but substance requiring physical intervention. It informs her chisel work ("testing and doubting and adjusting") as a method. The trait is somewhat label-only without a visible on-page tradeoff or moment where imagination conflicts with realism. One beat involvement with closure contribution, but swappable with "pragmatic" or "problem-solver" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Unstick" is the core action that defines the climax: Elara works the chisel to "unstick the lid from the base," producing the story's major turn when "Light erupted." The verb recurs with escalating stakes (fountains "stopped," memories "trapped," time "unstuck") and the final image depends on this exact action—geese "unstuck" resume migration, time flows. Three beats with causal pressure and irreplaceable closure linkage. The action redefines options and carries visible cost (eleven days, persistent labor).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Following breadcrumbs" is signaled early (iridescent residue in Plaza) and structures the middle journey: "Each trace led to the next, a luminous trail left by the memories themselves." The method shapes eleven days of attempts across districts and matters tactically—without the trail, Elara cannot locate the Meridian Fountain chamber. Two beats (discovery of first breadcrumb, following trail) with causal pressure. The mechanics are visible and constrain her path, though the trail itself could be replaced with "following water sounds" or similar without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "city of forgotten fountains" (Vaelith) is anchored early and provides essential pressure: dry fountains are "everywhere—carved into walls, rising from intersections," their "mineral ghosts" visibly marking the problem. The subterranean chamber supplies the climactic obstacle (sealed box on green copper pedestal), and the fountains' restoration is the closure consequence ("every basin in Vaelith with golden water"). Setting constrains Elara's search (she must follow breadcrumbs through districts) and charges the ending when "the water ran warm against her boots." Three beats, causal pressure, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"From the pause of migrating geese" frames the timeframe from opening ("The geese stopped mid-flight…on a Tuesday") through closure ("The geese…resumed their migration"). The frozen geese serve as a visual clock marking time's disruption and create urgency—Elara's eleven-day quest occurs within this pause. The geese return at closure with reweighted meaning: "Time, unstuck, flowed again." Three beats (opening pause, mid-story anchor "remained frozen overhead," closure resumption) with causal linkage and closure charge. The timeframe is somewhat passive (Elara doesn't race against it) but redefines story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To liberate trapped memories" is the dominant motivation signaled early: Elara understands "trapped memories were not metaphor…and they were killing Vaelith slowly." Her choices (following breadcrumbs, eleven days of searching, chisel work) all serve this desire. Friction appears in her skepticism—she doubts even as she acts—and the cost is visible: she commits to "sidereal patience" as an ongoing price. Two beats (decision to follow trail, unsticking box) with closure linkage. The desire is somewhat told ("she had not forgotten") rather than shown through conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is coherent from opening ("silence that pooled where water once had") through closure action ("defiant hush of someone who refuses to ask permission" during chisel work). The tone modulates under pressure: quiet observation shifts to tense labor ("with a sound like ice releasing a river") then to quiet wonder ("for once the skeptic allowed…to simply be"). The final image charges the tone—"Elara listened"—as the hush persists even in restoration. Tone shapes how pressure is felt across three beats and is irreplaceable to the story's texture.</comment>
