<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus exhibits urbane restraint ("measured cadence," "uncommonly serene") that shapes his non-confrontational stance during the argument and his final decision to hand over the story stick. His epiphany about reversing power flows is earned through concrete pressure (Jin's accusations, the group's fracture) and leads to a meaningful choice with visible cost—relinquishing authorial control. Internal contradiction appears when his silence is read as condescension, revealing how his characteristic reserve both protects and isolates. The secondary cast (Jin, Dara) applies immediate pressure but lacks full dimensionality; they function primarily as accusers and responders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, shifting to a Situational/Conceptual frame at closure. The story anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus's decision to "reverse" authority and letter the audience's words live reweights the ethical premise (who holds power in storytelling) with conceptual cost—the performers become instruments, vulnerable to failure ("It might be terrible"). The cost is felt in Dara's hesitancy and Jin's slow acceptance, and the final image of the empty dome "collecting signals from a sky that had long since moved on" charges the reversal with irreversibility. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus writes the transcript and proposes the new performance model.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is established early with vivid, selective detail ("curved walls," "defunct radar panels let in slashes of coastal moonlight") and constrains the action: the tracking pedestal becomes the stage, the parabolic space holds sound and silence in a way that mirrors the group's containment. The campfire story stick, butcher paper, and brush pen are handled tactilely across multiple beats and alter tactics (Marcus mounts the stick on the bracket, uses the paper for live lettering). The setting charges the final image—"still collecting signals from a sky that had long since moved on"—with thematic resonance tied to obsolescence and receptivity. Spatial choreography (dome center, corners, entrance) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether storytelling about others' suffering can be ethical—is signaled early in the argument and sharpens when Marcus realizes "what reversed the flow of power." One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus proposes the live-lettering experiment at The Silt, which forecloses the old model ("the story won't be ours to judge"). The cost is legible: potential failure ("It might be terrible"), loss of authorial safety, and Jin's implicit acceptance signals a relational shift. The escalation is driven by Marcus's agency (his choice to reverse authority) under an Accumulative lens that deepens through the transcript-writing beat. No antagonist is required; the ethical calculus itself generates pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—ethical storytelling and the reversal of power—emerges organically from the argument, the transcript beat, and the final proposal without thesis statements. The closing image of the dome "still collecting signals" and debris "burning into nothing before they arrived, illuminating for one half-second the shapes of things already there" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stories may vanish before completion yet briefly reveal what exists. The campfire stick and radar dome recur with reweighted meaning (from relic to instrument, from military receiver to artistic receptacle). Subtext operates in Marcus's silence, Jin's crossed arms, and Dara's denial of tears. The piece resists tidy morals; the proposed reversal carries genuine risk and ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Marcus; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during his epiphany, cooler during group choreography). The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("urbane," "mineral-tasting," "half-lit understanding") that fits Marcus's calligrapher identity without becoming precious. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven: Jin's "You want the audience to run the show?" tests the idea; Marcus's quiet reply clarifies stakes. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marcus notices texture (notches on the stick), visual geometry (slashes of moonlight), and the quality of silence. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Brief convergence in the final collaborative packing does not breach POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening's long, layered syntax ("that particular quiet that follows fury, dense and mineral-tasting, like the air before a meteor burns through atmosphere") gives way to shorter, propulsive beats during the transcript scene. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in "He stood" and "They came warily" openers, and one near-paraphrase loop ("the question was never…The question was") in the epiphany paragraph. The meteor/debris imagery in the penultimate paragraph stacks three metaphoric vehicles without clear payoff, risking figurative muddle. No grammar errors; spatial choreography (center, corners, entrance) tracks cleanly. The prose remains clear and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—artists in a decommissioned radar dome staging subversive puppet shows and confronting storytelling ethics—synthesizes familiar territory (art collective conflict, ethical authorship) through specific, grounded choices: the campfire stick ritual, live calligraphy as performance transcript, the reversal from teller to scribe. The radar dome's repurposing as creative space offers fresh texture. The ethical turn (giving the audience the story stick) grows organically from the argument rather than arriving as a bolt-on twist. Proximity check: the meteor-debris imagery in the final paragraphs echoes well-worn sky/illumination metaphors without full transformation. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus (urbane calligrapher) is present throughout and drives two key turns: writing the verbatim transcript and proposing the live-lettering reversal. His professional skill (calligraphy, "fluidity that had made his name") enables the transcript beat and the new performance model. Introduced in the opening line; shapes the middle choice (transcript) and the ending proposal (reversal). The character's urbane restraint constrains his response during the argument (silence read as condescension) and enables the serene pivot afterward. Cost is visible: he relinquishes authorial control and accepts potential failure. Irreplaceable—a different artist type would not generate this specific solution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in three distinct beats: Marcus picks it up and examines the notches (early), he mounts it upright on the stage bracket (middle transcript scene), and he slides it into his coat "like a conductor's baton, though tonight he intended to hand it away" (ending). The object's rule ("Whoever gripped it spoke next") establishes its authority-granting function, which Marcus then subverts by proposing to give it to the audience. The stick's return with reweighted meaning (from residency token to instrument of reversal) charges the closure. Early signal, beat involvement across three moments, causal pressure (the stick's authority is the mechanism Marcus inverts), and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "half-lit epiphany" is dramatized on the page: Marcus feels "the half-lit understanding that had been flickering at the edges of his mind finally catch," and the text immediately specifies what he understands (the ethical question about storytelling power). The concept is reinforced by the dome's literal half-lighting ("slashes of coastal moonlight but left great arcs in shadow"). This understanding drives Marcus's transcript action and his proposal to reverse authority. However, the label "half-lit" itself becomes somewhat ornamental in the description; the epiphany's mechanics (argument → reflection → insight → action) are more functional than the specific "half-lit" quality. Present in the middle beat (epiphany paragraph) and shaping the ending choice. Cost connection: the insight's incompleteness is acknowledged ("not fully formed") and carries forward into the risky proposal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is noted explicitly ("uncommonly serene for a man who had just been screamed at") and embodied through Marcus's actions: he sets down his brush, waits, walks calmly to center stage, and speaks quietly. The trait enables his post-argument pivot (he does not escalate or withdraw) and contrasts with Jin's crossed arms and Dara's tears, creating visible status dynamics. The serenity is internalized ("He felt the serenity still, not as the absence of conflict but as its digestion") and tied to his final stance. Cost: the serenity allows him to propose a vulnerable experiment but also isolated him earlier (silence read as condescension). Present in two beats (post-argument reflection, final proposal). The attribute could be paraphrased as "calm" or "composed" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Reverse" structures the entire closure: Marcus writes the verbatim transcript to reverse the argument's flow, then proposes reversing who holds authority ("I want to reverse who holds the authority…We become their instruments"). The action is signaled in the middle beat and executed at the ending; the mechanics matter (live lettering, audience-driven puppetry) and redefine the group's approach. The word appears three times with escalating stakes. Removing "reverse" would require a complete conceptual overhaul; the story's ethical resolution depends on this specific mechanism. Early signal (implied in Marcus's understanding), beat involvement (transcript, proposal), causal pressure (narrows options to this new model), closure linkage (the proposal is the climax), and high irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" are the occasion and setting for the ethical debate; Jin accuses Marcus of "aestheticizing poverty" through these performances, and the group plans to perform "tonight…at The Silt." The method's subversive nature and the harbor-district context supply the ethical friction (exploitation vs. liberation) that drives Marcus's epiphany and the proposed reversal. However, the puppet mechanics are not dramatized on the page—we see props packed and hear the plan described, but no actual performance. The method shapes the stakes and Marcus's solution (reverse the power dynamic within this format) but arrives more as context than enacted procedure. Signaled early (argument), shapes the ending plan, but mechanics remain summary-level.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is established in the opening line and provides multiple functional resources: the tracking pedestal becomes the stage, the parabolic acoustics amplify silence and hold "the hush," and the defunct panels create the literal half-lighting that mirrors Marcus's epiphany. The dome's original purpose (receiving signals) is repurposed into a metaphor for the new storytelling model (receiving audience input) and charges the final image ("still collecting signals from a sky that had long since moved on"). Spatial choreography (center, corners, entrance) remains clear. The setting constrains action (limited space forces proximity) and shapes tactics (using existing structures for performance). Early signal, beat involvement across staging and closure, causal pressure, closure linkage, and thematic integration all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the opening and is noted as occurring "three minutes ago." This immediate aftermath supplies urgency (the group is scattered, emotions raw) and motivates Marcus's reflective pause. However, the time constraint does not tighten further—there is no countdown to the evening performance at The Silt that would force faster decision-making. The temporal anchor (post-argument cooling) is clear and shapes Marcus's serene pivot, but elapsed time within the scene is vague. The timeframe is functional but somewhat replaceable; "aftermath" or "cooling period" would serve similarly. Present in setup (opening), shapes the middle tone (wary regrouping), and the ending plan occurs within this window, but no live clock escalates pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is dramatized through the argument (Jin's accusation of aestheticizing poverty, Dara's defense, Marcus's silence) and Marcus's epiphany about reversing power. The motivation is conflicted: Marcus's prior approach (beautiful puppet shows about others' suffering) is challenged, forcing him to question whether subversion justifies the method. His proposal to give the audience the story stick enacts a new ethical stance with visible cost (potential failure, loss of control). The desire drives both the middle reflection (transcript as confrontation) and the ending choice (reversal). Friction between wanting ethical purity and risking artistic failure is legible. Early signal (argument), beat involvement (epiphany, proposal), causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all present. Could be described as "ethical responsibility" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" tone is established through the opening description ("that particular quiet that follows fury, dense and mineral-tasting, like the air before a meteor burns through atmosphere") and sustained via imagery: moonlight slashes, the dome's parabolic silence, and the penultimate paragraph's explicit meteor metaphor ("debris from ancient collisions streaked silently toward earth, burning into nothing before they arrived"). The tone modulates subtly—tense and mineral during the argument's aftermath, contemplative during Marcus's epiphany, charged with anticipation as the group packs—without breaking coherence. The final image of the empty dome "collecting signals" and the van departing carries the hush into openness. The tone charges the closure by framing the reversal as both transient and illuminating. Early signal, coherent through turns, and integrated into the final image.</comment>
