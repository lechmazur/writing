<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concretely embodied through her work with the juniper—"Too much. You wanted the tree to forgive you faster than it can" dramatizes her impatience and self-blame without label. The compass and lace become tactile anchors for contradictory impulses (the need to act versus the need to wait). Oren's characterization is thinner—his tutor role is consistent but his choices don't alter Maren's options on the page; he offers wisdom, she acts. The final cuts show agency with visible cost (removing growth to let light in), earning the shift from concentrated grief to diffused presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren identifies "that uncertain, tender, in-between shade" and commits to diffuse pruning, which reweights her stance from seeking a single perfect apology to accepting incremental, patient presence. The compass and lace motifs charge the final image with cost—she accepts the silence may "slowly, slowly change its mind" without guarantee. Orientation is swift (islet, post-severance, bonsai lesson). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (rain, compass, lace, tide) and cadence modulation rather than causal reversals; the ending deepens via pattern recognition, not a dramatic turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The breezy islet after rain grounds every beat: moisture on tools, salt-green air, the tilted channel marker, and tide rhythms all filter through Maren's attention and constrain her work (wet handles, breeze moving through the juniper). The compass—present at the table, needle swinging—physically anchors her orientation toward the mainland. The lace patterns function as micro-setting, a tactile object that teaches her the spiral logic she then applies to the tree. All three (islet environment, compass, lace) charge the final pruning choice and the closing tide image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: find the shape/color of an apology to her mother. Pressure accumulates through Oren's critique ("You wanted the tree to forgive you faster than it can"), the lace's encoded patterns, and Maren's realization that resolution is premature—she must "diffuse" rather than "concentrate." The tightening occurs when she shifts from seeking a single correct gesture to accepting incremental presence as the viable path. Cost is visible: she prunes the juniper with renewed patience, foreclosing the fantasy of immediate reconciliation. Agency is protagonist-driven (her realization, her cuts).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bonsai metaphor and tidal refrain: grief as something to be distributed rather than focused, silence as "full of everything we meant to say." The final color—"that uncertain, tender, in-between shade"—offers a resonant answer to the opening question without stating a moral. The lace patterns encode subtext (begin from the smallest branch; silence is not empty), and the closing tide image ("touching it again and again and again") charges the concept of patient, iterative presence. No sermonizing; the piece trusts particulars to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable, close focalization on Maren. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices moisture, texture, color gradations ("bruised forget-me-nots," "cerulean"), and spatial anchors (compass needle, reef, channel marker). Oren's dialogue is rhythmically distinct ("You trimmed the juniper... Too much") and his speech pattern supports his "rhythmically placid" trait. Diction remains character-appropriate; no register drift. Minor: filter verbs appear ("she could see," "she thought") but they're sparse and voice-motivated, fitting the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative language is dense but coherent ("sky the color of bruised forget-me-nots," "lace intricate as a river delta"). Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Minor scaffold appears in the transition from backstory to present ("She had come here after the severance—after her mother stopped speaking... Three months of nothing. Three months of words...") where "Three months" repeats without added pressure. The paraphrase slightly dulls momentum but doesn't obscure causality. No loops in peak beats; the closure passage is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bonsai-as-apology frame is familiar, but the piece transforms it through specificity: the ghost ship's compass, the lace with encoded instructions, the notion of diffusing grief rather than concentrating it. The "color of an apology" question is fresh, and the answer—"that uncertain, tender, in-between shade"—feels earned rather than clever. The emotional calculus (patience over resolution) avoids the safety middle. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and heavy metaphor could have obscured stakes, but they heighten rather than muddle. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Oren appears early, critiques Maren's work ("Too much"), and introduces the lace—two distinct beats. His "diffuse" instruction directly enables Maren's final pruning choice. However, his own agency is limited to teaching; he observes the resolution without a decision that alters it. He's essential to the middle turn but not indispensable to closure, which Maren executes alone. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage (instruction shapes final act) +0.7, minus slight swappability (another mentor could deliver similar wisdom) −0.3 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The compass is introduced early (first day gift), handled twice on-page (Maren holds it, turns it; it sits beside the lace while she works), and its needle pointing north toward the mainland charges the ending by grounding her spatial and emotional orientation. Its "ghost ship" origin and cracked glass carry specificity. It frames the lesson ("even lost things still know which direction matters") and recurs in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus slight ornamentality (it's more symbol than tool that constrains action) −0.6 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is explicitly named late in the story ("tides of remembrance rolling in, pulling back, depositing small truths") as a thematic echo. The tidal rhythm recurs in the final image ("The tide came in below them... touching it again and again"), reweighting the stake by suggesting iterative, patient presence. It shapes Maren's realization (diffuse rather than concentrate) but doesn't constrain a discrete choice earlier. Late explicit naming −0.4, lyric reprise +1.2, thematic coherence +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, minus summary-only use in middle −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" is shown through Oren's speech ("each word arriving only when the one before had fully settled") and his patient observation. It enables his teaching method (waiting, slow wisdom) and constrains his interaction style—he never hurries Maren. The trait is embodied in action and dialogue cadence, supporting one key beat (the lace lesson). Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, specificity +0.5, closure contribution (his method shapes her final choice) +0.6, minus slight label reliance ("rhythmically placid" is stated) −0.2 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Diffuse" is introduced mid-story as Oren's instruction ("Your work today is to diffuse... let it spread through the whole tree") and directly drives the climax: Maren's pruning shifts from concentrated to distributed cuts, altering her approach to apology. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it would break the resolution's logic. It appears in two beats (instruction, execution) and charges the final image. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5, minus mid-story introduction −0.3, minus slight summary flavor in the instruction beat −0.3 = ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lace is introduced early (Oren draws it from his bag), its mechanics explained (patterns encode lessons: spiral = begin from smallest branch; lattice = silence is full), and Maren explicitly follows its "spiral logic" in her final pruning. It appears in three beats (introduction, interpretation, application) and its structure constrains her method. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.8, minus slight exposition heaviness (the patterns are explained rather than discovered through action) −0.5, minus partial swappability (another encoded medium could serve) −0.4 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The islet after rain anchors every beat: wet tools, salt air, breeze, the channel marker, the reef, and the tide. Weather and environment pressure Maren's tactile work (moisture, wind moving through the juniper) and the tidal rhythm charges the closure image. The setting is indispensable—removing it would collapse the story's spatial and atmospheric coherence. Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.8, cost connection +0.4, minus slight postcard risk in opening description −0.1 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the severance" frames the entire narrative and is specified ("Three months of nothing"). The timeframe tightens Maren's need (unresolved silence) and supplies urgency without a ticking clock. It appears early and recurs implicitly (the compass points toward the mainland house "where her mother sat in her own silence"). However, it doesn't constrain a discrete on-page choice—elapsed time within the scene isn't tracked. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, thematic pressure +0.7, closure contribution +0.6, minus vague within-scene tracking −0.4, minus no lived clock −0.3 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to find "the color of unspoken apologies" is stated early ("I don't know what color an apology is") and drives every beat: the critique of her impatient pruning, the compass and lace as search tools, and the climactic realization ("that is the color. That uncertain, tender, in-between shade"). The motivation is conflicted (urgency versus patience) and tested through her pruning choices. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.7, cost connection +0.5, specificity +0.6, minus slight abstraction (color as metaphor risks vagueness) −0.5 = ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" is embodied throughout: the sky "the color of bruised forget-me-nots," the "green smell of things trying to grow after being cut," the "uncertain, tender, in-between shade" at closure. Tone modulates with pressure (breeze, compass needle swinging, tide's rhythmic touching) and charges the final image without stating emotion. It's coherent across beats and irreplaceable—the specific hue of regret is the story's organizing sensory logic. Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.8, cost connection +0.4, minus risk of over-saturation in figurative density −0.1 = ~8.0.</comment>
