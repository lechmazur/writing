<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual specificity is embodied throughout—she catalogs echoes "with the precision of someone reading a map in a language she was still learning," and her ability to sense "the way grief bent the air around a doorway" grounds her trait in concrete observation. Her final choice to "spend the rest of her life in these corridors" is motivated by accumulated understanding rather than sudden epiphany, and the renunciation of a normal life carries visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when she both seeks her grandmother's echo and must let it go, creating genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "richly perceptive" framing in the opening, which edges toward label-only in one beat before being dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—progressive disclosure layers voices and meaning until the final resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure lands on the page when Maren commits to remain "not because she was trapped but because every turning revealed another voice waiting to be acknowledged," a stance crystallization with visible opportunity cost (her life outside the nexus). The accumulative design teaches its pattern early and follows through; each corridor "disclosed another layer" in a coherent intensification. Cost is legible: she forgoes autonomy and ordinary connection to become custodian of the web.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus functions as a charged constraint: its three-corridor branch forces Maren's choice, and the stone's acoustic properties enable the entire dramatic action. The whispering seashell half amplifies the "hum beneath all things" in at least two beats and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when she sings into it. Starlight pooling in grooves and barefoot contact with stone are sensory anchors that reflect her perceptual priorities. The final image—her voice traveling "ahead of her like a lantern"—charges the setting with metaphorical weight tied directly to her stance. Minor deduction for "canyon like a river that had forgotten how to flow," a slightly generic opener that could apply to many canyons.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some people echo—is signaled early and tested when Maren hears her grandmother's voice, a tightening that narrows her path to the left corridor. The answer arrives as felt knowledge "through her bare feet from the stone floor," a deepening that changes her understanding and forecloses retreat. Her decision to remain in the nexus is protagonist-driven with visible cost: she commits her remaining years, and "her grandmother's echo shifted, settled, and finally rested" only after Maren accepts the thread. The accumulative lens holds; coincidence does not resolve. One meaningful escalation—hearing her grandmother, then understanding the web's purpose, then choosing to extend it—drives the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—voices that exceed the moment and the responsibility to carry them forward—emerges from the concrete action of singing and listening rather than statement. The seashell and stone function as recurring images that reweight meaning: first tools of perception, then vessels of legacy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the silence would sing back. It always had. It always would." This reconfigures the central question (why do some people echo?) without moralizing. "Reed-blown melancholy" suffuses the piece through diction and cadence without collapsing into sentimentality. Maren's final choice is "inextricable from the thematic question"—she becomes the answer by embodying continuity. No thematic echo or summary in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Maren's perceptual signature—"the way certain voices left residue in the walls of certain rooms." Psychic distance modulates purposefully: zooms in for barefoot contact with stone, pulls back for the web's historical span. Diction stays within her lexicon: "catalogued each one with the precision of someone reading a map" reads both professional and poetic. Syntax reflects her contemplative, tuned-in state: long, spiraling sentences mirror the canyon's architecture. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean. Minor deduction for "the reed-blown melancholy of it pressed against her chest," which edges toward stock phrasing and breaks the established voice's restraint in one beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: "her voice trailing behind her in fragments, each note she sang returning to her changed, deepened, as though the canyon itself were finishing her sentences" does triple duty (establishes her practice, the canyon's anomaly, and her relational frame in one image). Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Propulsion is steady through progressive disclosure. However, "some people echo because they sing with such fullness that the world cannot absorb them all at once" edges toward thematic summary rather than image, and "the reed-blown melancholy of it" is a stock construction. Paraphrase appears in "she understood now that her purpose was not merely to hear them but to ensure they were heard, to carry their echoes forward"—the clause triplet restates rather than advances. Apply −0.6 for minor scaffold and one stock phrase in a non-closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—a canyon that answers with accumulated voices—offers a fresh angle on legacy and memory. Progressive disclosure as structural method is well-integrated and non-obvious. The emotional specificity of Maren's grandmother's voice "old and cracked and achingly familiar" avoids generic templates. However, the core metaphor (voices as echoes, stone as memory) is familiar in fantasy and literary fiction; transformation comes more from execution than concept. The final choice—to remain in the nexus—is earned but not startling. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative mode without bold structural or perspectival leaps. No derivative premise, but the synthesis leans on established tropes (lone guardian, inherited calling) without radical recombination.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices create all key turns: she follows the left corridor after hearing her grandmother, interprets the web's purpose through her perceptual trait, and decides to remain. Present from the opening, constrains middle action (her singing into passages tests the nexus), and drives the closure (her commitment ensures continuity). Her trait and role are inseparable; removing "canyon echo singer" would erase the stakes. Causal pressure is strong. Cost is visible: she forgoes autonomy. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in two beats: she listens through it to the "hum beneath all things" and later sings into it to layer her voice into the web. The second use reweights its function from receiver to transmitter. However, it does not constrain a middle choice; its role is sequential rather than causally forking. Present in closure, but not indispensable—Maren could sing directly to the stone. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is signaled early ("a web of intrigue spun not by any single mind") and structures the revelation: "a web of conversations held in this place across decades, across centuries." It shapes Maren's understanding in the middle—each turning "peeled back another layer of the web"—and the closure reaffirms her role in extending the thread. However, "intrigue" reads more as metaphorical texture than stakes-shaping pressure; the web is architecture, not active opposition. It enables discovery but does not narrow options or create visible cost. Setup, modest development, closure presence. Functional but more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" enables every key action: Maren catalogues echoes, hears her grandmother's voice beneath the returned note, and interprets the web's purpose through felt knowledge. The trait constrains her path—she cannot unhear the voices—and the final cost (lifelong commitment) is inseparable from her perceptual sensitivity. Early signal, drives two beats (corridor choice, purpose realization), shapes closure. Visible tradeoff: her gift binds her. Causal pressure strong, cost clear, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Ensure" drives the resolution: Maren realizes "her purpose was not merely to hear them but to ensure they were heard, to carry their echoes forward into new corridors, new ears, new centuries." This realization triggers her decision to remain. The action is protagonist-chosen and alters the web's continuity—"her grandmother's echo shifted, settled, and finally rested, knowing the thread had been taken up." Appears late (final third) but transforms all prior material and articulates the stakes' true weight. Not easily swappable; "listen" or "remember" would not carry the same custodial commitment. Late arrival caps eligibility, but closure linkage and causal necessity lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Progressive disclosure is the structural spine: "each turning of the serpentine corridor peeled back another layer of the web," "first her grandmother's voice alone, then other voices woven beneath it," and the canyon "disclosed another layer" with each step. The method is signaled early, shapes every middle beat (each corridor reveals deeper history), and delivers the answer incrementally rather than all at once. The mechanics matter: without layered revelation, Maren's commitment would lack foundation. Early signal, three beats, closure participation (final understanding comes through accumulated disclosure), high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus constrains Maren's choices: the three-corridor branch forces her to choose left, and the stone's acoustic memory enables the entire dramatic action. Starlight "pooled in the grooves of ancient stone" and "fell in a single concentrated column" mark key beats. The setting is not postcard; it pressures Maren by returning her voice "changed, deepened" and delivering the answer "through her bare feet from the stone floor." Present in closure: she walks "deeper into the nexus, following passages that no previous singer had reached." Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, causal pressure. Starlight functions as micro-setting that marks decision points.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"The universe was singing its secret song tonight" anchors the moment and recurs in the final paragraph ("the universe hummed its secret song, and she hummed with it"), charging the closure with cosmic continuity. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it functions more as atmospheric marker than live clock. No visible escalation from the universe's hum itself. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting but no tactical constraint. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate absent. Trends mid-band for resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To learn why some people echo" is dramatized in Maren's actions: she follows the residue, listens with the seashell, chooses the left corridor, and receives the answer as embodied knowledge. The question drives her thirty-two years of listening and culminates in the felt realization that "some people echo because they sing with such fullness that the world cannot absorb them all at once." Friction appears between the desire to know and the cost of knowing—understanding binds her to custodianship. Early signal, shapes two beats (corridor choice, purpose realization), closure participation. Cost connection strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is coherent through all turns: "achingly familiar" grandmother's voice, voices "singing into the dark, trusting that someone would eventually come," and the final image of Maren walking deeper "not because she was trapped" but because continuity demands it. Tone modulates subtly—anticipation at the opening, grief when hearing her grandmother, quiet resolve at closure—without breaking the melancholic through-line. The tone charges the final image: her solitary commitment is neither triumphant nor despairing but elegiac. One stock phrase ("reed-blown melancholy of it pressed against her chest") slightly weakens control, but the overall modulation is strong and the ending resonance is undeniable.</comment>
