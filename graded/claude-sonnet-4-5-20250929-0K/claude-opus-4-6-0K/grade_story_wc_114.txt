<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and particular—her recognition that the swallowed truth "sat inside her like a stone on a scale, throwing off every other measurement" grounds the internal conflict in embodied sensation. The fever recovery provides a credible physical state that sharpens perception without over-explaining. The final choice to descend and speak is earned by the thermal-inversion metaphor that reframes stagnant silence as a weight that prevents movement. Minor dock: the sister relationship exists only in reflection; no on-page friction tests the resolve, though the renunciation of silence still carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (smudge, oracle, thermal inversion) that converge at closure when Sable decides to descend with "fault-tolerant" words. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her stance with visible cost ("clarity and cold are often the same thing") and forecloses further silence. Orientation anchors immediately (weather station, post-fever, mountain). One tightening: the oracle's answer transforms her question into actionable metaphor, narrowing options from paralysis to speech.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weather station is not mere backdrop—the barometric arrays, wind instruments, and altitude function as both literal setting and thematic anchor for precision under pressure. The smudge on the botanical illustration operates as micro-setting: a recurring object that charges the final recognition of imperfection as survivable. The oracle's "frosted corner where two walls met, occupying margins" ties spatial detail to the method and theme. The ozone, old snow, and copper light filter through Sable's professional and emotional lens, grounding every sensory choice in her meteorological expertise and current fragility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the weight of a swallowed truth to recalibrate herself—is signaled early and drives the oracle consultation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the oracle's thermal-inversion answer reweights the problem from abstract guilt to stagnant air that traps motion, narrowing options to descent and speech. The cost is legible on the page: speaking will be "fault-tolerant" (imperfect but functional), not precise restoration. Slight cap: the sister's lie and the inheritance remain entirely off-stage; no secondary character or external pressure tests Sable's resolve in scene, though the internal escalation from recognition to decision remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—truth's weight when unspoken, survival's imperfection—emerges from the gentian's smudge, the oracle's fault tolerance, and the thermal inversion without thesis statement. The final image ("clarity and cold are often the same thing") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: speaking will hurt but will unstick the trapped air. The botanical illustration's shift from perfection to contact-marked resilience charges the ending without overt symbolism. Fault tolerance as both technical concept and relational strategy integrates seamlessly; the piece earns wisdom from mountain air and instruments rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Sable notices "through pressure" like a barometer, filters sensory detail through meteorological idiom ("auroral light," "thermal inversion"), and her vocabulary remains calibrated to altitude and instrument work. Psychic distance is controlled—close third with no head-hopping. The prose modulates rhythmically with emotional intensity: longer, layered sentences during reflection compress to short declaratives at the decision point ("She would descend the mountain this week"). One minor slip: "the sorrow in it was the sorrow of all dawns" momentarily elevates diction past Sable's established voice, though it recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character state, setting constraint, or thematic layering. Rhythm varies purposefully—reflection breathes, decision tightens. Two deductions: "peripherally aware of the truth for months, sensing its gravitational pull without looking at it directly, the way one senses a storm system building beyond the next ridge" is a paraphrase loop (three ways to say the same avoidance). The phrase "fault-tolerant oracle" repeats its definition across two paragraphs without adding pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; figurative language (thermal inversion, lichen on stone) is coherent and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of fault-tolerant computing, mountain meteorology, and relational honesty is specific and non-obvious; the oracle as copper-and-ceramic margin-dweller transforms the "wise advisor" trope into a technical-poetic hybrid. The thermal-inversion answer (stagnant air that prevents motion) is a fresh, earned metaphor that grows from prior particulars. The smudge on the botanical illustration—imperfection as survival record—resists generic symbolic convenience. Risk: the piece commits to an oblique, lyric closure without safety-hedging into confrontation scene or tidy resolution, and the ending's charge depends entirely on prior image layering.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle is consulted once (middle beat), delivers the thermal-inversion answer that reframes the swallowed truth, and its "fault-tolerant" nature is invoked again at closure to describe the words Sable will speak. Setup present early; development (oracle answer narrows options); payoff (closure adopts its logic). Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Cap near 7.0: the oracle does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it clarifies, but Sable's decision feels inevitable regardless. Swappable with another metaphor-delivery device (tarot, dream) without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in two distinct beats: first as a reminder of delicate survival at altitude, then reweighted when the smudge becomes "a record of contact, of imperfect presence" that haunts her. Setup (early), development (the smudge observation shifts her stance on precision), payoff (informs the closure recognition that fault tolerance applies to relationships). Causal pressure moderate; the smudge enables the leap to "enough truth to keep the mechanism of love still functioning." Not fully indispensable—story could pivot on another imperfect artifact—but the gentian's alpine specificity and the graphite smudge tie tightly to setting and theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Swaying certainties shapes stakes directly: Sable's barometric knowing "had been swaying since she absorbed the lie into silence," prompting the oracle question and the need to recalibrate. The concept drives the middle beat (how to measure the weight) and closure (accepting imperfect, fault-tolerant speech). Setup clear; development (oracle reframes swaying as stagnation); payoff (she chooses words that won't be precise but will function). Causal pressure high; removing this exact concept would collapse the inquiry structure. Cost legible: she surrenders the demand for precision to restore relational motion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Peripherally aware appears as a trait label in one reflective passage ("She had been peripherally aware of the truth for months") that explains her avoidance but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Setup present (first third); no middle development beat where the trait alters a tactic; payoff absent (closure does not hinge on peripheral vs. direct knowing). One beat involvement, no causal pressure, ornamental. The phrase enriches the atmospheric layer but could be cut or replaced ("half-aware," "sensing indirectly") without changing any choice or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The smudge on the botanical illustration is noticed post-fever and reweights the drawing from monument to precision into evidence of contact and survivable imperfection. Setup (introduced in first half); development (shifts her stance on flaws); closure (informs the fault-tolerance decision). One beat with thematic charge. Cap mid-band: the smudge is observed, not created on the page in this scene; it functions as a past action reinterpreted rather than a live turn. Swappable with another mark or flaw without major structural loss, though the specificity (thumb drag, graphite) ties well to setting and voice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Occupying margins is named twice: the oracle "occupying margins the way lichen occupies stone" and the logbook where personal and meteorological data "coexist on the same page, occupying the same margins." Setup (early signal); no middle beat where the method constrains a choice; payoff weak (closure mentions fault tolerance but not margin-occupation). Ornamental metaphor without causal grip. The method is told rather than demonstrated through on-page tactics—Sable does not use marginal positioning to solve a problem or gain leverage. Easily replaceable with another spatial metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is indispensable: altitude creates the ozone/snow sensory field, the barometric arrays and wind instruments ground Sable's professional idiom, the isolation justifies the oracle's presence and her solitary reckoning, and the cold clarity charges the final image. Setup immediate; development (the station's instruments mirror her calibration need); payoff (stepping outside into altitude reminds her "clarity and cold are often the same thing"). Three beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage strong. Swapping to a different setting (lab, lighthouse) would require wholesale rewrite of voice, metaphor system, and thematic resonance. The station is both literal workspace and thematic crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after fever breaks" anchors the opening and justifies the "strange clarity that follows surrender," sharpening Sable's perceptual state and decision readiness. Setup clear (first line); development moderate (the post-fever body is "hollowed and light," enabling the oracle consultation without delirium's fog); payoff weak (closure does not depend on the fever's timing—she could decide to descend any morning). Two beats, modest causal pressure. The fever window creates atmospheric credibility but is not irreplaceable; a sleepless night or seasonal shift could serve similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the weight of a swallowed truth drives the oracle question, structures the middle beat (thermal-inversion answer), and resolves in the closure decision to speak. Setup early (internal monologue); development (the oracle reframes weight as stagnant air); payoff (descent to speak becomes the only tactic to restore motion). Three beats, high causal pressure, cost legible (she will speak imperfectly, risking relational friction). The desire is embodied ("sat inside her like a stone on a scale") rather than merely stated, and the friction between wanting precision and accepting fault tolerance is dramatized through the oracle's metaphor and the final resolve.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is signaled in the opening "thin, copper light" and returns in the penultimate beat: "the auroral light deepened from copper to rose, and the sorrow in it was the sorrow of all dawns—the acknowledgment that darkness had been real, that survival was not the same as restoration." Setup clear; tone modulates with pressure (somber reflection, decision clarity, cold resolve) and charges the final image without stasis. Payoff strong. One dock: the phrase "the sorrow of all dawns" momentarily abstracts into universal sentiment rather than staying character-particular, though it recovers with the survival/restoration distinction that ties directly to Sable's stake.</comment>
