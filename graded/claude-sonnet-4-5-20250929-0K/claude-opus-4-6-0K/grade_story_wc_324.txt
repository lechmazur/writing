<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is specific and her micro-choices under pressure track cleanly: she breaks protocol, speaks into the frequency, and guides the child's pulse with her own. The "incidental heroism" framing risks didacticism but the moment itself is embodied—her shaking hands, the stutter-catch-slow of the child's rhythm. Internal conflict is light; her curiosity-driven disobedience feels inevitable rather than wrestled. The final gesture (placing the hearing aid down "the way you set down something sacred") edges toward summary sentiment, but the cost—protocol breach, exhaustion—registers on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. The piece signals early (dead call → Calloway → child pulse), escalates via Maren's protocol break, and closes with a resonant reconfiguration: the child sleeps, Maren pins the photo back, commits to listening tomorrow. The cost is felt (shaking hands, broken protocol) and the ending reweights her routine vigilance with quiet heroism. Orientation anchors by line three (Maren, conservatory, twilight). One micro turn (child pulse tangled in signal) tightens stakes without clutter. No causality breaks; closure lands cleanly under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The atrium (mist, ferns, condensation) is vivid and recurring; the hearing aid is handled twice and its analog circuitry constrains her method. The photograph is pinned, studied, pinned again—micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective: "bruised hour," "reeling hush," condensation tracing lines. The foster home at number 14 arrives late but serves the tightening. The setting does not directly constrain a choice at the climax (her decision is internal), keeping this shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect a vulnerable child caught in the dead's channel. Pressure tightens when Maren detects the second pulse, then escalates via her protocol-breaking intervention. The child's rhythm "stutter, catch, then slow" is a legible reversal. The cost—shaking hands, Bureau review, broken protocol—is visible. Agency is clear: Maren's choice to speak into the frequency drives the turn. One meaningful tightening; no requirement for multiple reversals at this length. The escalation is protagonist-driven under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "incidental heroism" is enacted rather than stated, curiosity as compass, the hunger of the dark versus living warmth. The hearing aid's analog sensitivity functions as a motif that constrains method and charges the ending. The final image (photograph pinned back, "Tomorrow the dead would call again") offers quiet resolve without moralizing. "Incidental heroism, the Bureau would call it later" is a near-label but buffered by narrative distance. The piece resists a thesis, though the conceptual price (ongoing vigilance, no rest) could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is clear: Maren notices "faint pulses," "warm distortion," "sub-whispers"—her professional filter colors every observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("reeling hush," "bruised hour"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at the climax ("her own steady heartbeat") without filter clutter. The phrase "incidental heroism" reads as Bureau jargon, not Maren's internal voice, maintaining distance. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short bursts during the pulse sync). Clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "mist-clad atrium," "congregation," "warm distortion" are specific. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the child-pulse beat. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "being persistently curious about every anomaly" is expository scaffold (−0.3), and "the way you set down something sacred" is a stock simile that dulls the closure image (−0.3). Information density is high; no loops or paraphrase. Figurative language (breath on glass, bird in net) is coherent and sparse. Propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracing for the dead using analog tech—synthesizes familiar ghost-story and procedural elements with a fresh occupational frame. The hearing aid's analog sensitivity is a specific, non-obvious choice. Emotional truth (Maren's exhaustion, the child's fear) anchors the fantastical. The "incidental heroism" framing risks template language but is enacted through lived detail. The piece commits fully to its premise; no hedging. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear, stakes are clear. Within-band adjustment for coherent world-building and the fresh angle on "dead calling the living."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as "contact tracer for hearts" frames her role early, drives the key turn (detecting the child pulse, breaking protocol), and shapes the ending (pins the photo back, commits to listening again). Her professional stance and curiosity create the escalation. Three beats: initial listening, child pulse detection, protocol-breaking intervention. Causal pressure is clear. The role is irreplaceable: only a contact tracer would have the hearing aid, the files, the skill.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The photograph is pinned to the corkboard early, studied mid-scene to identify the foster home, and pinned back at the end—three touches across setup, development, payoff. It enables the choice (Maren scans for adjacent houses, finds the foster home) and returns with reweighted meaning (commitment to vigilance). Its reprise charges the final image. Not indispensable—Maren could use a digital map—but the tactile ritual (pin, study, pin) adds specificity and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" shapes the dominant stake: Maren acts not for glory but from "being persistently curious," following "a stray thread because she couldn't leave a question unanswered." The concept drives her protocol breach and is named post-action ("the Bureau would call it later"), maintaining dramatic irony. It reweights the ending: her heroism is routine vigilance, not spectacle. The concept constrains tactics (she doesn't seek heroism, it emerges) and charges the final image (tomorrow she'll listen again). High integration; the piece would lose thematic coherence without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is demonstrated early ("discovered, through being persistently curious about every anomaly") and drives the key turn: Maren doesn't dispatch a field agent but investigates the second pulse herself. Her curiosity constrains choice (she can't leave the question unanswered) and enables the protocol break. The trait is enacted in two beats: initial anomaly tracking, child-pulse investigation. Cost is visible: protocol violation, Bureau review. The phrasing "being persistently curious" is slightly expository, but the trait alters tactics and stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Assure" drives the climax: Maren speaks into the frequency—"You're safe. You're not alone. Listen to my heart, not theirs. You're safe"—and the child's pulse syncs with hers. This action is the story's decisive change, foreclosing the dead's grip and earning the ending's quiet heroism. Setup: her job is to sever links. Development: she detects the child pulse. Payoff: she assures the child directly. The action is irreplaceable and carries visible cost (shaking hands, protocol breach). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hearing aid is present in setup (its analog circuitry explained early), drives the detection of both pulses (Maren adjusts the volume wheel to coax clarity), and is the vehicle for her assurance (she speaks into the frequency). Its mechanics matter: older devices catch what digital filters out. Three beats: initial listening, child-pulse clarity, speaking into the channel. The method is indispensable—without the hearing aid, Maren cannot detect or reach the child. Specificity (1980s analog device) and causal necessity are high. The final gesture (placing it down gently) charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atrium is established early (mist, ferns, glass ceiling, twilight) and recurs at closure ("The atrium settled into its reeling hush. Condensation traced slow lines down the glass"). Its atmosphere ("reeling hush," fog congregation) supports tone and thematic texture. It does not directly constrain a choice at the climax—Maren's decision is internal, not spatially bounded—but it provides the professional context (Bureau station) and sensory continuity. Setup, tone support, and payoff presence are clear; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the timeframe early ("that bruised hour between twilight and full dark") and is signaled at closure ("Tomorrow the dead would call again"). The time constraint tightens stakes: Maren must act during this narrow window when the boundary thins. The phrase "twilight bled purple" and "tonight the mist was thick" establish urgency. The timeframe drives Maren's immediate protocol break (no time for field agents) and charges the ending's commitment to ongoing vigilance. Three-gate presence; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is dramatized in the opening ("Those were the voices Maren lived to protect") and drives every choice: flagging Calloway, detecting the child pulse, breaking protocol to assure the child. The motivation is conflicted via cost (protocol breach, exhaustion) and specificity (children, the grieving, the lonely). It appears in three beats: setup (her job's purpose), middle (child pulse urgency), payoff (photo pinned back, commitment to listen again). High irreplaceability: without this motive, Maren's protocol break lacks logic. Visible cost ties the motivation to stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is established early ("green silence," "mist gathered like a congregation") and recurs at closure ("The atrium settled into its reeling hush"). Tone modulates with pressure: quiet observation → urgency ("Fear") → tense sync ("stutter, catch, then slow") → exhausted quiet ("Her hands were shaking"). The tone charges the final image (condensation, photo pinned back, tomorrow's vigilance). Coherence is high; the tone does not fragment under pressure. Setup, modulation, and payoff presence qualify for mid-7s; strong atmospheric control.</comment>
