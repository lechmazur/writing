<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret's internal landscape is richly drawn—guilt over the princess manifests in her fidgeting and her need to prove "stillness was not permanent." Her motivation to free the village stems credibly from her own imprisonment by guilt. The chess-tutor backstory is concrete and shapes her strategic thinking with the puzzle box and tapestry. Minor slip: the final forgiveness moment ("Maret forgave the silence") edges toward articulation rather than pure embodiment, though the "fierce repose" image partly salvages it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: the rain falls, the village wakes, Maret "let it go"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to agency) with visible cost (seven years, the wandering scholar's death, her exile). The causal lens holds: puzzle-labyrinth → thread-pulling → raindrop trembles → village wakes. Orientation is swift (village name, seven-year freeze, rain suspended). One meaningful tightening occurs when the first raindrop falls and pressure accelerates to full awakening. The cost is felt but the final-beat articulation ("forgave the silence") slightly softens what could have been a purer image-driven close.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The time-freeze conceit is vivid and specific: rain "like scattered seed pearls," birds "mid-flight between chimney pots," the merchant's hand forever reaching. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry function as tactile micro-settings that constrain Maret's choices—each thread pull and ring rotation is concrete action. Spatial choreography is clean (table, square, outermost edges where time frays). The frozen village setting directly enables the central choice: Maret cannot free anyone without decoding the tapestry border in situ. The recurring environmental detail (rain, thunder lull) charges the final image when rain finally strikes cobblestones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: free the village (and by extension, herself from guilt). Pressure tightens through a causal sequence—labyrinth clicks, threads pulled, first raindrop trembles—culminating in the rain falling and village waking. The cost is visible: seven years of solitary labor, the risk of failure, and the emotional renunciation of self-blame. One meaningful deepening: when the raindrop trembles, stakes shift from theoretical decode to imminent success or catastrophic failure. Agency is protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves the freeze. The final image reweights prior stillness with kinetic release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (stillness vs. motion, guilt as paralysis, forgiveness as release) emerges organically from the time-freeze premise and Maret's chess-tutor failure. The woven hush as both literal tapestry and metaphor for imposed silence is layered without being overstated. The ending's "fierce repose" and the child's laugh offer a resonant, non-literal answer to whether mistakes freeze us permanently. Slight deduction: the phrase "Maret forgave the silence that had kept her frozen, and let it go" edges toward articulating theme rather than fully trusting the rain and laughter to carry it. Still, the particulars (platinum labyrinth, frayed threads, suspended rain) ground the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on Maret's fidgeting and chess-tutor memory, then zooming slightly out for the village tableau). Diction is elevated but character-consistent ("woven hush," "texture of silence," "fierce repose") and matches a reflective, strategic mind. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: she thinks through fidgeting, sees patterns ("seven moves ahead"), and perceives stillness as tangible. Backstory anchor is concrete (the princess calling through closing doors). The prose rhythm accelerates subtly in the final paragraphs as rain begins to fall. No filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence variety is strong; rhythm breathes ("Rain hung suspended… Birds perched mid-flight… A cart of winter apples stood eternal"). Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. Metaphors are coherent and vivid ("silence stitched upon silence," "dawn pulling apart the fabric of night"). No loops, synonym churn, or scaffold detected. Minor slip: "The fidgeting was not nervousness. It was how she thought" is slightly tell-heavy, though the follow-up action redeems it. The final paragraph's "fierce repose" and "let it go" risk mild abstraction but remain anchored in the rain's fall. Opening and closing lines both anchor and resolve cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of time-freeze village, chess-tutor exile, and tapestry-decoding method feels fresh and internally coherent rather than checklist-assembled. The woven-hush conceit and "winnowing" metaphor are specific to this voice. Transformation of the redemption-through-puzzle trope is solid: Maret's strategic mind and guilt converge organically in the act of thread-pulling. The piece avoids obvious echoes and resists tidy moralizing. Minor friction: the platinum labyrinth and tapestry border could risk fantasy-puzzle cliché, but the grounded emotional stakes and chess-tutor backstory keep it particular. The ending's synthesis (stillness breaking, forgiveness earned) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exiled chess tutor is signaled early (first major paragraph) and causally active: her strategic training informs how she works the labyrinth and tapestry, and her guilt over the princess drives the freeing choice. Present in closure: "the woman who had finally moved her piece." Shapes two beats (backstory anchor, final pull) and charges the ending metaphor. Specificity high; swapping to "exiled scholar" would lose the chess/strategy through-line.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth appears in opening description, mid-scene as Maret rotates it ("a ring clicked into place. The pattern matched"), and in the penultimate paragraph ("set down the platinum labyrinth"). Handles in ≥2 beats; its nested-ring pattern enables her to decode the tapestry threads. Material specificity (platinum) and puzzle mechanics matter. Closure linkage: she sets it down to press both hands on the tapestry, marking the shift from tool-use to final act. Could score higher if the labyrinth's exact contribution were more causally detailed, but it clearly enables the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Woven hush is both literal (the tapestry's threads) and atmospheric ("silence stitched upon silence until the quiet became a thing she could almost touch"). Introduced early, it shapes the sensory texture and thematic stakes: Maret must "tear" the hush to free the village. Reweighted at closure: "The woven hush began to tear, gently, like dawn pulling apart the fabric of night." Present across setup, middle (tactile pressure), and ending. Drives the central image and integrates tightly with the time-freeze premise and Maret's silence/guilt arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fidgets productively is shown on the page ("turning the small, intricate puzzle box with practiced fingers… each rotation… unlocking a pattern"). Labeled as "not nervousness… how she thought." Enables the tapestry decode by allowing parallel processing. Present in two beats (opening, thread-pull sequence). Cost is implicit—this trait kept her working for seven years—but no single on-page moment where fidgeting constrains or costs her visibly. Functional and character-specific, but the tradeoff is more background than live scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Winnow is explicitly named ("winnowing truth from ornament, separating the meaningful threads from the meaningless ones the way a farmer winnows chaff from grain") and dramatized: Maret pulls copper, blue threads, leaves gold intact. The method drives the climactic turn—threads winnowed → raindrop trembles → rain falls. Present in setup (scholar's description), middle (active winnowing), and closure (threads removed, tapestry pressed). Irreplaceable; changing to "decode" or "sort" would lose the agricultural metaphor and the physical specificity of pulling threads. Shapes the entire resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads in tapestry's border is the central method, introduced early via the wandering scholar and present throughout. Mechanics matter: "each color and knot a symbol," "winnow truth from ornament." Active in multiple beats—Maret studies, pulls threads, watches effects. Directly shapes the climax: thread removal causes raindrop tremble, then full thaw. Without this exact method, the story's logic collapses. Specificity is high (frayed border vs. main image, color/knot encoding). Indispensable to both plot and thematic texture (weaving as metaphor for constructed silence).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time-frozen village is the premise and primary pressure source. Present in opening (rain suspended, birds mid-flight, merchant's hand), middle (children stopped mid-laugh, mother reaching), and closure (village waking, child laughs). Constrains all choices: Maret cannot leave, the villagers cannot act, only she (at the frayed borders) can work. The setting is the antagonist and the stakes; removing it breaks the entire story. Micro-scale village square and tapestry table also function as tactile setting that enables the decode. Indispensable across setup, pressure, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Distant thunder and its lull are mentioned three times: opening ("Distant thunder murmured"), middle ("In the lull between those low, far sounds, Maret worked"), and near-end ("The thunder rolled closer"). The lull provides atmospheric pacing and a recurring sensory anchor. However, it does not visibly tighten a decision or alter tactics; time pressure is more the seven-year duration than a live countdown. Functional for tone but somewhat replaceable with another ambient sound. Lyric reprise reweights slightly, but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>To forgive oneself for past mistakes is Maret's explicit motivation, seeded early ("Forgiveness seemed impossible when the person she needed it from was herself") and dramatized through her seven-year labor. Friction is live: she works not for glory but to prove "stillness was not permanent." The final beat delivers payoff: "Maret forgave the silence that had kept her frozen, and let it go." Present in setup (guilt over princess), middle (working to free trapped villagers as proxy), and closure. Cost is visible—seven years, isolation, the scholar's death. Only minor deduction: final articulation is slightly told rather than purely image-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fierce repose is named in the penultimate paragraph ("There was a fierce repose in her expression") and operationalized throughout: Maret's calm, methodical work under immense pressure, the "woven hush" as texture, her refusal to weep. Tone modulates subtly—reflective backstory, then tightening as the raindrop trembles, then release as rain falls. Coherent through turns. Charges the final image: stillness breaking into motion with controlled intensity. Present across the arc. Minor friction: the phrase appears late and is somewhat tell-labeled, but the preceding prose earns it through consistent atmospheric control.</comment>
