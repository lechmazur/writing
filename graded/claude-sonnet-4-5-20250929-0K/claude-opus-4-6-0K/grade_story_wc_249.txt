<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, showing embodied emotion through her drumming and the physical sensation of memories. Her motivation to give Davi rest is earned through the accumulated weight of eleven months living with his neural architecture. The final renunciation—"every breath belonged to her"—carries visible cost (she keeps the memories as "tenants") and forecloses the path of continued struggle. Minor slip: the therapeutic framing "rewired brain" in the final paragraph edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's quickly grounded by concrete images.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira stops fighting the entangled memories and accepts them as shared rather than invasive, visible in "no longer his alone but theirs." The cost is legible—she retains the foreign memories permanently but gains peace. The accumulative lens holds throughout: pressure builds through layered sensory details and the recurring lagoon image until the final tonal shift. Orientation anchors clearly within the first two paragraphs (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the drumming makes the lagoon tangible and allows release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting: the crystallized frequencies respond to Mira's drumming, creating the conditions for the climactic moment when "the garden sang in frequencies...register[ed] as anomalous." Sensory detail is vivid and selective (low-frequency stalactites "hummed like sleeping animals"), filtered through Mira's specific perception. The body itself acts as micro-setting—her hands drum without permission, embodying the entanglement. The garden directly enables the closure by translating percussion into the golden lagoon manifestation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mira seeks to resolve the pressure of carrying Davi's memories by manifesting the shared dream as a place of rest. The escalation follows accumulative logic—her nightly drumming intensifies until the lagoon becomes tangible enough for release. Agency is present in her choice to keep drumming faster despite risks ("anomalous" frequencies the monitors will catch). The cost is visible: she permanently integrates the memories rather than erasing them. One tightening when "she understood then what she was trying to do" crystallizes the previously intuitive goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the entangled-memory conceit: what it means to carry another's interior life and how grief can settle into cohabitation rather than erasure. The auric lagoon motif shifts from intrusive dream to intentional sanctuary, charging the closure without explicit statement. The final image—"a drummer finally set down his sticks"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how shared neural architecture can find peace. Subtext operates throughout in the physical drumming (motor memory as haunting) and the deliberate ambiguity of whether Davi is ghost, echo, or integrated self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices in layered sensory modes (sound crystals "hummed like sleeping animals," water "warm and heavy as honey") that reflect both her own awareness and Davi's entangled perception. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climactic drumming sequence. Diction remains within POV's plausible lexicon; scientific terms ("neurodegenerative," "neural tissue") read as absorbed institutional language rather than filter breaks. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly during peak pressure ("Her hands moved faster. The garden sang...") without head-hopping or voice drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences layer action, interiority, and setting without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the drumming sequence. Some minor slips: "the kind of beauty that exists only because it is breaking" edges toward stock lyricism, and "She was not supposed to be here at this hour" followed by the explanation of her rebellion creates a small paraphrase loop. The metaphor "threading foreign memories...like gold wire through fraying cloth" is vivid but the vehicle doesn't quite cohere with neural recording (wire doesn't thread digitally). No loops touch the closure beat, which remains propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes memory-transfer SF with embodied grief in a fresh way: the motor artifact of drumming as literal haunting reads as specific and non-obvious. The sound wave garden as both experimental apparatus and manifestation space avoids generic lab settings. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "Project Entangle" framing and institutional research context lean slightly toward familiar SF tropes, though the emotional specificity (Portuguese lullabies, rain on a particular Tuesday) personalizes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as experimental treatment guinea pig is established in the opening line and drives all beats: her eleven-month tenure frames the stakes, her access to the sound garden enables the climactic drumming, and her final acceptance that "every breath belonged to her" completes the arc. The role shapes her agency (she must work within institutional constraints, sneaking out during monitor gaps) and pressures her identity crisis. Cost is visible: she remains indefinitely entangled. Present in setup, middle rebellion, and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears in three distinct beats: as recurring dream that "had worn a groove in his neural tissue," as superimposed vision during drumming ("golden water shimmering between the sound crystals"), and as tangible manifestation where "she felt him let go." Its meaning reweights from invasive dream to intentional sanctuary. Irreplaceable: the golden/amber glow charges the final image and its warmth "remained in her bones" after dissolution. Early signal, causal pressure (manifestation requires drumming), and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Entangled memories is the story's engine: establishes stakes (Mira "drowning in someone else's life"), constrains tactics (she must navigate both her own decay and Davi's architecture), and directly shapes the resolution (memories settle as "tenants...no longer his alone but theirs"). The concept narrows options throughout—her hands drum without permission, the lagoon intrudes nightly—and the closure hinges on accepting entanglement rather than separation. Cost is undeniable: permanent neural cohabitation. Irreplaceable and present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Quietly rebellious is established through her night-time escapes "during the gap between night checks" and reinforced by "slipping from her room...in ways they never seemed to catch." The trait enables the climactic drumming session (she accesses the garden illicitly) and incurs cost (the monitors will register anomalous frequencies). The attribute shapes one key turn (her decision to keep drumming despite detection risk) but remains somewhat swappable with "defiant" or "resourceful." Present in setup and development; cost is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perching appears early ("perched on the edge of the central observation platform"), establishes spatial position for the drumming, and her stationary posture contrasts with the escalating hand movement. The action enables the key turn: seated stability allows sustained percussion that builds the harmonic response. Moderately irreplaceable—standing or kneeling could substitute with minor edits, though "bare feet dangling above...stalactites" adds vulnerability. Present in setup and development; contributes to closure atmosphere but doesn't redefine final options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drumming on everything is signaled early as motor artifact ("she caught herself drumming...cafeteria table, armrest...her own thighs"), establishes the entanglement's physical manifestation, and drives the climactic sequence where "she began drumming now on the platform's metal railing." The method's mechanics matter: vibrations cascade through crystals, creating harmonics that manifest the lagoon. Irreplaceable: only sustained percussion generates the frequencies needed for release. Cost is visible when faster drumming triggers anomalous readings. Present across all three gates and causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is indispensable: crystallized frequencies that "resonated at different pitch when touched" provide the sole mechanism for neural mapping and, crucially, for manifesting the shared dream. The setting constrains access (eastern wing, night checks), enables the climax (garden "answered her" and "sang in frequencies"), and charges the final image (the sustained tone "rang through the garden like a bell"). Its acoustic properties are irreplaceable—no other setting could translate drumming into dimensional breakthrough. Early anchor, shapes middle choice (where to attempt breakthrough), and active in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "hush of the universe inhaling...midnight and whatever comes after" establishes atmospheric stakes and explains why Mira can act (monitor cycle gap). The temporal window tightens her choices slightly—she must work within the brief silence. However, the timeframe doesn't create urgent pressure; no countdown forces faster action, and the phrase functions more as tonal marker than tactical constraint. Present in setup, weak development pressure, lyric reprise in closure ("The universe exhaled") reweights the opening metaphor with release.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to breathe life into a shared dream is dramatized through escalating action: nightly visits, drumming experimentation, and the climactic realization "what she was trying to do...make the lagoon real enough that some part of Davi could rest." Desire creates friction with cost—manifesting the dream risks detection and permanently integrates the memories. The motivation drives two key beats (the understanding moment and the accelerated drumming) and shapes closure when "he let go" fulfills the goal with visible consequence. Present in interiority, tested under pressure, resolved with trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is embodied throughout: "the kind of beauty that exists only because it is breaking," "harmonics...filled the chamber with auroral sorrow." Tone modulates appropriately—contemplative during the opening perch, intensifying during drumming ("warmth remained in her bones"), and resolving into quiet acceptance ("she breathed in the quiet"). The final image charges with bittersweet peace rather than triumph or grief alone. Coherent through turns, tied to specific sensory details (golden light, sustained bell-tone), and inseparable from the closure's emotional register. Diction and rhythm support tonal consistency without static repetition.</comment>
