<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her careful invisibility serves both character and plot. The interiority is concrete ("Every act of invisibility was a choice") and her decision to proceed alone after the abort signal shows agency under pressure. Internal conflict is present but muted—she moves with resolve rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats. The final choice to broadcast feels earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost at closure could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: the broadcast holds, people pause and remember, and Maren allows herself to reappear—a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (visibility after years of invisibility). The causal lens holds: abort signal → lone walk → puddle-guided navigation → transmission. One meaningful tightening (safe houses burned, map lost) forces the puddle-reflection tactic. The Orientation Test is met early (records office, Maren, regime context by ~100 words). Minor: the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The auric lagoon's golden luminescence and the puddle reflections constrain Maren's navigation and charge the final image with doubled starlight. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "puddles gathered in the broken sidewalks, each one holding a small sky." The phone booth as micro-setting (salt grass, faded logo) anchors the climax. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the walk south. The setting actively guides choice (puddle-map) and the lagoon's doubled sky reinforces the theme of hidden histories made visible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving true history against regime revision—is signaled early and coherent throughout. The tightening is clear: two arrests, one turncoat, safe houses burned, map lost. Maren's agency drives escalation: she decodes the puddle-map and proceeds to broadcast. The cost is legible conceptually (she trades invisibility for visibility, "allowed herself to reappear") and tactically (lone operator, no backup). The price is felt but not viscerally depicted; the final broadcast is triumph tinged with uncertainty ("did not know how many would hear") rather than sacrifice with immediate consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the puddle-reflection method: "The city's past was still visible if you looked at it sideways, in the mirror of water and fading light." The story resists moralizing; indifference is "manufactured, maintained, and therefore breakable" functions as dramatized insight rather than thesis statement. The auric lagoon's doubled starlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of visibility and memory. The final image reweights prior material (underestimated → voice transmitted through golden water) without stating a moral. Minor: "because someone had to, because the alternative was a silence that swallowed everything" edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization, no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and distinct: "They softened. They adjusted. A protest became a parade." Perceptual signature is character-specific (archive-minded, attentive to reflections). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from the opening's wry tone to the meditative walk to the charged final image. Free indirect style is clean. The phrase "auric lagoon" and "iron saints" carry slight register elevation but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Rhythm varies without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates appropriately. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. "The goal was indifference—a populace that shrugged" and similar constructions carry clarity and momentum. Minor: "The plan was elegant" and "Then the plans unraveled" use mild scaffolding. "She set the forms down, straightened her desk, and walked out as if leaving for lunch" reads slightly list-like but remains clear. The final paragraph's "because someone had to, because the alternative was" employs parallelism that borders on repetitive stem but remains purposeful. No filter-verb stacks or clarity-harming artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection navigation is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of the visibility/invisibility theme with tactical problem-solving. The regime's soft revisionism ("A protest became a parade") offers a fresh angle on dystopian control. The auric lagoon as broadcast point combines setting and stakes memorably. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on these particulars. Minor: the underestimated-rebel-becomes-key-actor premise echoes familiar templates; the specific execution (defunct phone booths, mineral-glow lagoon, puddle-map) transforms it. Risk-taking in the puddle-navigation conceit heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's decisions create key turns: she decodes the abort signal, walks alone, follows puddle reflections, and transmits the broadcast. Setup early (opening paragraph), development across the walk (choice to proceed despite map loss), payoff in transmission and self-revelation. Causal pressure is strong; her agency drives all major beats. Cost is conceptual (invisibility → visibility) and legible at closure. The trait "underestimated" is demonstrated rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears in three distinct beats: initial mention as the one object that matters, insertion at the lagoon booth, and opening the panel to activate the relay. Setup in the records-office section, development implied through the walk (she carries it), payoff at the booth. The key's specificity (Pacific Meridian logo, defunct company, maintenance-panel access) is irreplaceable. Causal pressure: without it, no transmission. Cost linkage: the key enables the final act of reappearance. Early signal and closure participation both present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Revised histories shape every beat: the regime's method ("softened, adjusted"), the Lakeshore Declaration's revision, the counter-archive's purpose, and the broadcast's content. Setup paragraph two, development throughout (safe houses as storage for originals, the broadcast plan), payoff in the transmission of "the true text." The concept constrains all tactics (smuggling, encrypted caches, signal dampeners) and charges the closure (transmission as counter-revision). Cost is conceptual but undeniable: challenging indifference risks exposure. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is demonstrated on the page: Maren decodes puddle reflections as a map, uses the key to access the relay, and completes the broadcast alone. Setup in opening ("Every act of invisibility was a choice, carefully resourceful in its design"), development in the puddle-navigation tactic, payoff in successful transmission. The trait enables a key tactical shift (lost map → puddle-map). Cost: proceeding alone without backup. Visible tradeoff rather than label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Reappear" is the story's conceptual and emotional climax: "Maren…allowed herself to reappear—not as a ghost in the records office, but as a voice transmitted through golden water and starlight." Setup through sustained invisibility ("the kind of woman whose name supervisors forgot"), development as she navigates alone, payoff in the penultimate paragraph. The action redefines all prior material (invisibility as tactic → visibility as broadcast). Cost is legible (forecloses safety). Indispensable; removing it collapses the closure. The action is both physical (transmission) and symbolic (stance shift).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map is signaled at the Alcott Street beat, demonstrated through sequential reflections ("Another puddle, another reflection: a street sign"), and guides the route to the lagoon. Setup mid-story (~40% mark), development across the walk south, payoff in arrival at the booth. The method's mechanics matter: she must look sideways, use dusk light, decode inverted images. Causal pressure: without it, she cannot locate the booth. The method embodies the theme (past visible if viewed obliquely). Minor penalty for mid-story introduction, but transformation of prior material (forgotten booth → revealed by reflection) is strong. Cost linkage: alone, no map, must improvise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon supplies the final broadcast location and charges the closure image with its golden luminescence and doubled starlight. Setup as destination, development as Maren arrives ("had forgotten how it looked"), payoff as the setting frames the transmission ("signal pulsed outward from the auric lagoon"). The lagoon's mineral glow and "second sky" effect reweight the visibility theme. The booth at the lagoon's edge is the story's anchor point. Causal role: the booth is there, enabling transmission. The setting is indispensable to the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "when plans unravel" is signaled at 4:47 PM abort signal, drives the walk from dusk into starlight, and tightens Maren's solitary decision. Setup paragraph four, development across the walk ("walked until dusk," then night at the lagoon), payoff in the nighttime broadcast. Time progression is tracked and alters mood (dusk enables puddle-reflections, starlight charges the lagoon). The unraveling (arrests, safe house fires) occurs off-page but is causally active, forcing Maren's lone action. Cost: no time to regroup, must act immediately. The timeframe shapes two major beats (abort → walk, dusk → night transmission).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to counter indifference and preserve true history—is dramatized through her walk, puddle-navigation, and broadcast. Setup in opening paragraphs (regime's indifference, counter-archive work), development in her choice to proceed after abort, payoff in transmission and the line "indifference was not a natural state. It was manufactured, maintained, and therefore breakable." The motivation is conflicted implicitly (safety vs. mission) and drives all choices. Cost: visibility, isolation, uncertain outcome ("did not know how many would hear"). Friction between want (preserve memory) and cost (exposure) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" tone is coherent: restrained, purposeful, with hope emerging quietly through the puddle-map discovery and the lagoon's glow. Tone modulates from wry opening ("which was their way of saying she didn't matter") to meditative walk to charged final image ("holding the line because someone had to"). The tone avoids triumph or despair, settling in Charged Poise. It charges the closure: the broadcast is neither victory nor defeat but an act of refusal. The tone supports the theme (freedom enacted through small, persistent acts) and remains stable under pressure.</comment>
