<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivations are clearly rooted in suffocation by over-care, and her isolation follows earned causality. The girl's arrival triggers genuine interior conflict—Maren's surprise at "I came here to learn how to teach suffocating to breathe" reads as discovery rather than placeholder insight. Minor deduction: the scars function more as symbol than embodied constraint during peak moments; the sister's crescent marks and the burn are told rather than felt under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Maren moves from maintaining emptiness as refusal to imagining "a door she might open," with visible cost (three years of self-imposed exile now reweighted). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (doorknocker, scars, ash, starlight) that converges at the final beat to reconfigure the sanctuary's meaning from hiding-place to threshold. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's open roof and absent walls function as micro-setting that charges the final image: "starlight encroached gently through every absent wall" directly answers Maren's lesson about needing space inside love. The doorknocker ring—iron, cold, clicking—grounds tactile choice in multiple beats. Spatial choreography (charred pew, rectory door site, ridge location under stars) remains coherent and the setting's emptiness credibly pressures both characters' stances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning to breathe under suffocating love) is signaled early and tightens when the girl's words become "a key turning in a lock." The girl's arrival provides one meaningful turn that forces Maren to reweigh her isolation. Agency is clear: Maren's offer to teach/learn together forecloses her three-year withdrawal with felt cost. Deduction: the escalation is more textural accumulation than causal pressure; the girl's needs do not materially test Maren's stance beyond providing the mirror that lets her articulate what she's been doing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (love requires space to breathe) emerges organically from the sanctuary's architecture and Maren's bridge-burning practice. The final image—"starlight encroached gently...filling the sanctuary with the kind of brightness that only enters where something has burned away"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Encroach" reweights earlier uses (the girl describes others encroaching into her space) to show gentle pressure as the answer rather than total absence. No thematic echo or on-the-nose summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable distance; Maren's perceptual signature (measuring silence, reading scars as language, the clicking ring as tactile anchor) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: "They love me so much I can't breathe" and Maren's response carry subtext and goal pursuit. Minor slip: "linking through scars, the oldest language" tilts slightly elevated for the moment's intimacy, though it recovers quickly into concrete action (showing palms).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is controlled with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is high: "The doorknocker ring was all that remained of a door that no longer existed, a knocker with nothing to knock on" does triple work (object, metaphor, constraint). Deductions: "loaded emptiness did its work" and "something passed between them that was not words but recognition" edge toward telling peak moments rather than trusting the image. One minor filter stack in the girl's introduction paragraph ("marks...that Maren recognized...that say") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (burned sanctuary as metaphor for self-imposed isolation) is familiar but executed with specificity: maintaining ruin "at the precise moment of its collapse" and the doorknocker with no door provide fresh angles. The girl's arrival as catalyst is more template than transformation—her function is primarily to unlock Maren's realization rather than complicate it with her own agency or friction. The ending's move from closed to open door is earned but predictable in its arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (tender shadow keeper) appears continuously, frames the opening expectation, and makes the climactic choice to teach/learn together. Her decision at closure forecloses three years of isolation with visible cost. Setup clear, development through maintaining the sanctuary and processing the girl's arrival, payoff direct. Causal pressure: her past bridge-burning and present tending of emptiness enable the final stance shift. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring is introduced early (paragraph 3), appears in at least three beats (prying it, wearing it clicking against things, turning it when the girl asks to be taught), and charges the closure: "for the first time in three years, she imagined a door she might open rather than close." Its specific properties (too large, iron, clicking, from a door that no longer exists) create metaphoric and tactile pressure. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; the ring's history as "a knocker with nothing to knock on" reweights when someone finally knocks (metaphorically, the girl's arrival).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fading threshold" is embedded throughout: the sanctuary held "at the precise moment of its collapse," "between what had stood and what would eventually return to earth," and the final beat places both characters "neither inside nor outside, neither connected nor alone." The concept directly shapes Maren's tactics (maintaining ruin without restoration or demolition) and the closure reweights it from static boundary to dynamic teaching space. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is established early through backstory (measured letters, surgical disappearance) and visible in Maren's three-year withdrawal. It constrains her initial stance and her surprise at the girl's need signals internal conflict. However, the attribute is more backdrop than active shaping force in peak beats—the climactic choice to open rather than close is told as discovery rather than dramatized through a visible tradeoff between her careful-burning method and a new risk. Setup and payoff present; middle development indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears three times with shifting valence: others' affection as tourniquet, the girl describing boundary violation, and finally "starlight encroached gently through every absent wall" as the answer. This lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake and charges the final image. However, it does not drive a major on-page turn or constrain a middle choice—its work is accumulative and thematic rather than tactical. Setup subtle, development minimal, payoff strong but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is signaled midway when the girl's wrist marks are described, enacted when Maren shows her palms and "something passed between them...recognition," and named explicitly: "Linking through scars, the oldest language." It enables the trust that allows the girl to ask for teaching. Setup adequate (~40% mark), one clear development beat (showing scars), payoff present in the mutual agreement. Deduction: the mechanics are more symbolic than tactical; the scars do not constrain how they link, only that they do.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" is established in the opening line, pressures both characters through its "loaded emptiness" and open roof, and charges the closure image where "starlight encroached gently through every absent wall." The setting's specific properties (no walls, only memory of them; sky for roof; ash floor) directly embody Maren's lesson about needing space inside structure. Setup immediate, development continuous (the girl sits and looks up at stars, the absence does its work), payoff indispensable. The sanctuary's architecture makes the thematic and tactical resolution possible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact three years ago" anchors backstory and establishes duration of isolation. The timeframe provides scale for the cost Maren pays when she imagines opening a door "for the first time in three years." However, it does not create urgency or tighten on-page decisions—the girl's arrival could occur at any point in Maren's exile without altering tactics. Setup clear, closure linkage present, but no middle pressure from the clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is Maren's articulated motivation in the climactic dialogue: "I came here to learn how to teach suffocating to breathe." It is dramatized through her choice to offer mutual teaching and her prior work maintaining the sanctuary's breathable emptiness. The desire faces friction (her surprise at meaning it, three years of isolation as cost). Setup indirect (maintaining ruin as preparation), development through interaction with the girl, payoff explicit with visible trade-off. Minor deduction: the phrasing arrives late and is slightly on-the-nose, though the image work supports it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is established in paragraph two ("stillness that felt deliberate, curated"), modulates through the interaction (silence as shelter, not absence), and charges the final image where emptiness "grow[s] warm at its edges, become[s] something that could hold without gripping." Tone coherence is strong across turns: the heaviness never lifts into false hope, yet the ending's brightness feels earned by prior constraint. The phrase "loaded emptiness did its work" edges toward telling, preventing a higher score, but the tonal execution through line-level choices is otherwise controlled and purposeful.</comment>
