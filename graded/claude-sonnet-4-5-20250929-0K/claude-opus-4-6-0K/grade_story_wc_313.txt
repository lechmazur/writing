<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta and Elias each carry distinct interiority—her buried memory of her mother, his belief that "places held stories"—and the discovery of the photographs triggers a visible shift in Marta's stance. However, the emotional arc feels somewhat summarized rather than fully dramatized: "a memory she had expunged decades ago... returned like water seeping" reads more like narrated exposition than embodied contradiction under pressure. The gathering scene compresses multiple former residents into a collective response, diluting individual stakes, and the final wind-chime moment, while poignant, arrives as resolution rather than a choice with visible cost. The piece avoids label-speak but leans toward gentle summary in key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: the falling silent of the chime → the reservoir's retreat → the photographs → the community gathering → the wind chime's altered song. Orientation anchors appear early (Marta, kitchen, October evening, thirty-seven years since the flood) and the closure image—the wind chime singing "not like mourning but like a town remembering itself"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in Elias's addendum and Marta's acceptance. One deduction: the gathering and its outcomes are summarized in a single paragraph rather than dramatized, softening the felt cost at the closure beat. The lens holds and the before/after is clear, but the final third compresses pivotal turns into exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway, reservoir waterline, and emerging steeple anchor spatial orientation and evolve with the drawdown. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "asphalt gleamed like a blade," "algae-streaked and resolute," and the wind chime's copper tubes "hung limp" all serve pressure rather than catalog. The ridgeway overlook functions as micro-setting where the photographs pass hand to hand, and the corkboard becomes a physical anchor for the closure gesture. The environment constrains choice (the water's rise sets a deadline) and charges the final image (the wind chime's return), satisfying the 9+ gate for environment/recurring object. Minor: the general store foundation and juniper groves remain backdrop rather than tactile pressure points.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovery and witnessing of the drowned town's memory before the water rises again—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph discovery and community gathering. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: Marta's personal memory unlocks → Elias proposes collective witnessing → the gathering transforms private grief into shared heritage → the final report and wind chime acceptance. However, the gathering itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and the resolution (Elias files the addendum, Marta lets the chime sing) feels more like acceptance than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Agency is present but muted; the water's return will happen regardless, and no sacrifice or trade-off is made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as reclamation, the necessity of communal witnessing to spin loss into shared meaning—emerges organically from the photographs, the gathering, and Elias's methodical archiving. The sapphire-hued Harlan Blue label ("Distilled from what grew here. Like us.") functions as a charged particular rather than overt symbol, and the final wind-chime image reweights the opening's silence with conceptual cost: mourning becomes remembering. The piece avoids moralizing and maintains complexity (recovery is temporary; the water will return). One hairline slip: "stories needed witnesses to spin them into shared meaning" verges on thematic echo, articulating the premise in near-prompt language. The ending image is resonant and non-literal, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Marta's perception with close access to Elias's motivations when on-page. Diction is controlled and elevated without jarring shifts: "mirrored hush," "methodical in his duties yet incapable of treating even ruined things as merely structural concerns," and "silence that reflected rather than emptied" all cohere. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("Come see before full dark," "We should show these to everyone"). Perceptual signature is character-specific—Marta's suppressed memory, Elias's archival precision—and psychic distance modulates appropriately. Minor: the phrase "a town remembering itself, note by copper note, into the listening air" approaches poetic ornament at the closure beat, slightly elevating register under peak emotion, but remains voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several passages slide into mild overwriting: "the atmosphere itself had paused to remember," "sediment but as heritage," "her breath caught," and "like water seeping through a crack in a wall" stack figurative language without urgent causal work. The gathering paragraph compresses multiple beats into summary: "People wept and laughed in the same breath" reads as emotional shorthand rather than embodied action. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("someone's forgotten afternoon, someone's erased kitchen, someone's first kiss") that feel list-like rather than propulsive. No paraphrase loops, but the density of metaphor in reflective passages nudges toward ornament. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density in non-peak beats and summary compression at a pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—drowned town resurfacing during a drawdown—is familiar (reservoir nostalgia, climate/infrastructure forcing recovery), and the emotional arc (grief → communal remembering → acceptance) follows a recognizable template. The sapphire-hued liqueur label and Elias's archival addendum add specific texture, and the wind-chime frame offers a fresh structural anchor. However, the gathering and its transformation feel compressed and somewhat generic; the story does not fully dramatize the friction between individual loss and collective witnessing. The piece executes its premise competently but does not transform it through bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. Swappability test: the town, liqueur, and warden could be replaced with similar elements (flooded valley, local craft, preservationist) without breaking the emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias Venn, the levee warden, is introduced early and his "precisely humane" motivation ("places held stories") shapes two key beats: he recovers the photographs and proposes the gathering. His final act—filing the addendum catalog—directly enables the thematic closure. However, his choices are not tested by friction or cost; he observes, proposes, and archives without visible sacrifice or trade-off. The gathering happens off his agency but is summarized rather than dramatized. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but decision pressure remains mild. Mid-band: essential presence, limited causal cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued liqueur label appears in the photograph jar (middle beat) and is copied onto the corkboard with Marta's inscription at closure. It triggers Marta's memory and anchors her thematic statement ("Distilled from what grew here. Like us."). However, the label itself is not handled or used in distinct beats—it is described once in the photograph and then referenced in the final display. The reprise reweights meaning but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. Present in two beats with closure linkage, but static rather than evolving. Lyric resonance achieved, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reservoir town resurfacing is the core concept and shapes every major beat: the water's retreat triggers Marta's call, enables the photograph recovery, sets the gathering's urgency (before the water rises again), and charges the final image (the wind chime's altered song as the town "remembering itself"). The concept constrains tactics (limited time window) and pressures the emotional stakes (ephemeral recovery). Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure. The town's re-submersion is accepted with visible cost (Elias's archive is the only permanence). Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is attributed to Elias in exposition: "methodical in his duties yet incapable of treating even ruined things as merely structural concerns." This trait motivates his photograph recovery and archival addendum, but it is never tested by on-page friction or visible trade-off. The attribute is told and then enacted off-stage (we do not see him wrestle with competing duties or face a cost for his care). Label-only trait without constraint or dramatized pressure. Present but ornamental; no visible cost tied to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears once in Marta's interiority: "A memory she had expunged decades ago—not from cruelty, but from survival—returned." This action (past suppression) is named but not dramatized; we do not see Marta's earlier choice or its cost. The return of the memory drives her emotional shift, but the expunging itself is summarized backstory rather than a present stake. The word is specific and thematically charged, but swappable with "buried" or "suppressed" without structural loss. Mid-band: functional in one beat, but not indispensable or irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The trail of photographs (Polaroids in a mason jar) is signaled early when Elias recovers them from the general store foundation. The method shapes two beats: the jar's discovery and the photographs' circulation at the gathering, where they "unlock" individual memories. The mechanics matter—the jar preserves the images, and their physical passing hand to hand enacts the communal witnessing theme. Present in setup and middle with clear causal role. However, the gathering itself is summarized, so the method's payoff is compressed. Strong setup and development; closure linkage is thematic rather than directly causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway at twilight is introduced early and anchors the overlook scene where Marta and Elias view the steeple and examine the photographs. The setting provides urgency (twilight = limited visibility) and becomes the site of the gathering. "At twilight the asphalt gleamed like a blade" charges the image with tone. The ridgeway returns at closure as the site of the corkboard memorial. Present in setup, middle, and closure with clear spatial anchoring and atmospheric charge. However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and symbolic anchor rather than pressure point. Solid integration, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening sentence: "When it finally fell silent on that October evening" anchors the inciting moment. The wind chime's silence triggers Marta's call to Elias, and the water's ongoing retreat sets a ticking urgency (before the repairs finish and the water rises again). The timeframe shapes the gathering's window and charges the closure when the wind chime "stirred again weeks later." Present across setup, middle, and closure with clear before/after bracketing. However, the "weeks later" ellipsis compresses the final turn, and the repairs' spring deadline is mentioned but not felt as immediate pressure. Strong framing, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to spin stories into shared meaning"—is articulated in exposition and drives his proposal to organize the gathering. The desire is tested when the water's return will erase the physical town again, but his archival addendum offers a permanent counter. The motivation shapes two beats (the gathering and the final report) and charges the thematic closure. However, the phrasing "spin them into shared meaning" echoes the prompt's language and verges on thematic echo, and the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. Present with clear causal role and closure linkage, but told more than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is introduced when Elias speaks "carrying the mirrored hush of someone speaking in a church" and returns in the gathering description: "the silence between their words held the same mirrored hush... a stillness that reflected rather than emptied." The tone modulates from mourning (opening silence) to charged remembering (closure: "not like mourning but like a town remembering itself"). The tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the final image. Present across setup, middle, and closure with clear tonal arc. Strong integration and resonance, though the "mirrored" metaphor is repeated rather than evolved through distinct sensory anchors.</comment>
