<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior voice is specific and contradictory—she justifies wandering yet recognizes it as abandonment, and her final stillness emerges from this sustained tension. The self-written obituary beat embodies her realization through concrete action (the indigo thread wound tight, the notebook closed) rather than summary. Minor slip: "projecting presence...while already composing her departure" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in the autumn-touch metaphor. The choice to stay is earned by the accumulation of her own written words and the seasonal pressure, foreclosing her pattern of leaving with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers image and reflection toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—Maren's stillness at the end forecloses her perpetual departure with undeniable cost: "she had nowhere else to be" crystallizes the shift from motion to rootedness. Orientation anchors arrive early (shadowed garden, crumbling estate, last ferry gone until spring). The closure lands on the page through the thread-as-bookmark image and the refusal to reach for her bag, reweighting all prior absences. Cost is legible: she stops projecting and becomes present, accepting winter's confinement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden's decay and seasonal particulars (chrysanthemums, skeletal maples, bronze light, single rose against frost) constrain Maren's choice by literally trapping her until spring and metaphorically mirroring her self-assessment. The indigo thread from the palace carpet functions as micro-setting—handled twice, it charges the final image as bookmark. The spatial anchors (stone bench, terraces, cracked flagstones) are selective and voiced through a traveler's eye. Minor gap: the palace interior is sketched but not revisited, slightly diluting the carpet's integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Maren can stop moving long enough to become present rather than project it. The pressure accumulates through her self-obituary, each line tightening her recognition that "returning was never the same as staying." The indigo thread wound tighter is a micro-turn that deepens cost; the blackbird's "elegy and invitation" crystallizes the choice. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she does not calculate distances, stays through autumn's end. The escalation is textural—density and emotional honesty increase—with the final stillness foreclosing her four-year pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: the obituary Maren writes for herself reweights her entire cartography project, and "the geography of healing" shifts from map to inhabited territory. The indigo thread links imagined paradise to decomposing garden, both versions of beauty charged by her choice to stay. The final image—thread as bookmark, not departure—answers the thematic question (can she stop leaving?) without stating a moral. The blackbird's song as "elegy and invitation" is earned subtext. No thematic echo; the ending resists tidy resolution and lets lonesome splendor hold ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: diction like "wandering cartography of sorrow," "latticed shadows that shifted like breath," and "touching people the way autumn touches a garden" maintains lyric elevation without breaking POV plausibility for a writer-traveler. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the self-obituary, wider during garden description). Minor slip: "justification and peace were different countries, and she had a visa for only one" is clever but edges toward aphorism that could fit any story. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm reflects Maren's contemplative state and tightens slightly at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do two jobs (e.g., "Her notebooks were filled..." establishes both occupation and method). Rhythm varies well, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Two minor artifacts: "explained absences" recurs three times with slight synonym churn ("justified," "explained," described as "gentle abandonments"), and "the geography of healing" is restated as "invisible terrain where grief and recovery shared a border"—a paraphrase loop. The metaphor density in the final third (shadows lengthening, blackbird's minor key, lonesome splendor as ache and opening) approaches saturation but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living—is fresh and the inversion (writing her own) is earned rather than gimmicky. The indigo thread as link between imagined and decomposing beauty is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (restless traveler learns to stay) is familiar, and the garden-as-mirror-of-internal-state borders on convention. The piece transforms the material through Maren's occupation and voice, but the final realization that she must inhabit rather than traverse healing feels anticipated by mid-story. The "lonesome splendor" tone and autumn imagery are executed at a high level but do not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choice to write her own obituary (mid-story) and her choice to stay at the end (not reaching for her bag, not calculating distances) are the story's key turns. Early signal: she is introduced in paragraph two. Beat involvement: three distinct beats (arrival/reflection, writing the self-obituary, choosing to stay). Causal pressure: her occupation enables the self-assessment that narrows her options. Closure linkage: her stillness is the final image. Cost: she forecloses her four-year pattern. Irreplaceability: the occupation of writing obituaries for the living is unique and could not be swapped for generic "writer."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The indigo thread appears in two beats: Maren pulls it from the carpet and winds it around her finger (mid-story), then presses it between notebook pages as bookmark (ending). It links imagined paradise to decomposing garden and shifts meaning from departure marker to staying marker. However, the carpet itself is described but never revisited; the thread's unique properties (indigo silk, part of a paradise scene) are noted but do not constrain a choice—Maren could have used any object as bookmark. The thread charges the final image but does not drive a turn. Present by first third, functional reprise, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is signaled early ("The explained absences in her life") and frames the dominant stake throughout. It shapes Maren's self-assessment in the obituary ("a series of gentle abandonments"), alters her tactics (she writes about them honestly), and is reweighted at closure when she stays instead of leaving. The concept is causally active in three beats and underpins the story's central tension. Cost: recognizing her absences as abandonments forecloses her justification and traps her (willingly) on the island. Irreplaceable: the story's logic hinges on this exact framing of her travel pattern.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is demonstrated throughout (chrysanthemums, skeletal maples, bronze light, indigo silk, latticed shadows) and enables Maren's work (her notebooks are "filled with vividly descriptive portraits"). However, the attribute itself does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—Maren's descriptive skill supports her occupation but does not create a tradeoff or friction. It is functionally present in her obituary-writing but could be replaced with "observant" or "detailed" without structural change. Present by first third, one beat involvement (the self-obituary), but no distinct cost or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears in the thread beat ("the silk press a thin ridge into her skin, intimate as a whispered confession") and in the self-obituary ("She touched people the way autumn touches a garden: intimately, with great tenderness"). It characterizes Maren's mode of connection and is reweighted at closure when she becomes present rather than projecting intimacy while leaving. Two beats, thematic reprise that charges the ending, but the action itself (touching intimately) is metaphorical rather than a distinct physical turn. The word could be replaced with "tender" or "close" without breaking causality. Functional, purposeful, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is signaled in the self-obituary ("perfected the art of projecting presence—of seeming to inhabit a room fully while already composing her departure") and directly contrasts with the ending, where "presence was not something she projected but something she became." The method shapes the story's central transformation and is causally active at closure. However, it is articulated late (mid-story) and only in summary; the mechanics of how she projects presence are told, not dramatized in a prior beat. Two-gate fulfillment (development, payoff) with strong thematic reprise, but late signal and lack of enacted demonstration lower integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is present from the opening line, supplies the constraint that traps Maren (last ferry gone until spring), mirrors her internal state (decay, lonesome splendor), and provides the final image where she stays. It is causally active in three beats: arrival, writing the obituary while sitting in the garden, and choosing not to leave. The season's pressure (winter coming) tightens her choice. The garden's particulars (stone bench, terraces, skeletal maples, single rose) are handled and reweighted. Irreplaceable: removing the garden or its autumn timing would break the story's closure. Strong early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is signaled in the opening line and reinforced ("the last ferry wouldn't return until spring," "The ships were gone, and winter was coming"). The timeframe creates the constraint that forces Maren's choice—she cannot leave even if she changes her mind—and charges the ending with inevitability. It appears in three beats (arrival, reflection, closure). However, the time pressure is static rather than escalating; once established, it does not tighten further. The cost is clear (confinement until spring) but the clock does not alter tactics during the story. Early signal, closure linkage, cost, but modest causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is signaled early (paragraph two) and frames Maren's four-year journey. It is reweighted in the self-obituary ("the geography of healing as she understood it now: not a map with destinations, but a territory you had to inhabit") and resolved at closure when she stays. The motivation is causally active in two beats (initial framing, realization during writing) and drives her final choice. However, the friction between this want and other costs is told rather than dramatized in a prior beat—her absences are summarized, not shown in conflict. Strong thematic presence, clear reprise, but limited on-page pressure before the realization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is embodied throughout (decaying chrysanthemums, feral hedges, skeletal maples casting latticed shadows, single rose against frost, blackbird's minor-key song) and modulates with Maren's emotional state. The tone is signaled early ("the garden sprawled in terraces...its fountains dry, its hedges gone feral") and charged at closure ("this lonesome splendor, this ache that was also an opening"). It coheres across all beats and is inseparable from the ending's emotional effect. The phrase itself appears late but the tonal elements are woven from the start. Irreplaceable: the story's closure depends on this exact balance of beauty and abandonment.</comment>
