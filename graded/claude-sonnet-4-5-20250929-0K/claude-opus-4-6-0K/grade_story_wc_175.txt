<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and her methods specific ("bowline for remembrance," knots as vocabulary), grounding her abstract mission. Her trait system is consistent: the "esoteric realist" who builds temporary signals operates through deliberate, embodied choices (lashing, fixing the wing, watching). The closure renunciation—she will "undo the knots" and leave—is earned by the prior pattern and forecloses permanence with visible cost. Minor slip: her internal contradiction (why this grotto, this butterfly) is asserted more than dramatized through a micro-choice that tests competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates meaning through layered images (moss, ferns, moth wing, turning wing) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: "the wing turned, and the cadence hung suspended, and the stillness blushed, and that was enough." The cost is conceptual—ephemeral labor honoring the unfinished—and felt in the morning's promised dismantling. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wing animates in the night, reweighting the entire structure's purpose. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto's moss, ferns, updraft, and cloud-filtered light are vivid and selective. The environment charges the final image: the wing turns "in the darkness above the clouds," and "the ferns would unfurl over the impression her body had left." Setting detail is filtered through Maren's attention (the light "pale and shy, as though embarrassed to intrude") and constrains her method (the updraft animates the wing). Micro-setting (the frame, the moss underfoot) drives the central action. No spatial drift or token landmarks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to honor the overlooked by building a signal that might be "seen by whatever needed to see [it]." The accumulative lens means pressure accrues through Maren's deliberate acts (climbing, assembling, knotting, fixing the wing) rather than reversals. One meaningful tightening: the butterfly may not pass; the wing's animation in the night reweights the entire venture. The closure crystallizes the cost—she will dismantle the structure—and forecloses permanence. Agency is renunciation with visible price. Minor: the stakes remain abstract (no live alternative pulling her away) and the cost, while legible, is more thematic than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—interrupted cadence, the unbearable suspension of unfinished histories—emerges organically from the monarch's thwarted migration, the textile-mill women, and Maren's ephemeral structures. The final image ("the cadence hung suspended") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the moth wing (cathedral window, lost labor) and the knots (each a word in a vocabulary). No sermonizing; the resonance arises from particulars. One hairline slip: "interrupted cadence" is named twice in reflection, risking echo, but the concept remains dramatized through the butterfly's orphaned journey and the turning wing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the light that filtered through the opening overhead was pale and shy, as though embarrassed to intrude." Diction is elevated but remains character-coherent (Maren invented "esoteric realist" and thinks in knot-vocabulary). No head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable; reflection anchors in present stimuli (clouds, ferns, wing). Minor: register occasionally drifts elevated ("transiently rooted," "blushing stillness") in ways that feel slightly authorial rather than focalizer-native, though the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create natural cadence. Information density is high: "a bowline for remembrance. A clove hitch for passage. A figure-eight for the interrupted cadence" does triple duty (character method, thematic accent, world-building). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("the clouds turned the color of a healing bruise, purple and gold and tender"). Two deductions: (1) Minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraph: "the wing turned" / "the cadence hung suspended" / "the stillness blushed" reads slightly list-like at the closure beat, risking a −0.3 artifact penalty. (2) "She did not smile. She did not weep" is a small filter-verb negation stack that slightly dulls immediacy. Core propulsion remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—esoteric realist builds ephemeral signals honoring overlooked histories—feels specific and non-obvious. The knot-vocabulary, the moth wing from a textile mill, and the monarch's thwarted migration are fresh particulars. The grotto "did not want to be remembered" and Maren's transient method transform the memorial trope. Tone ("blushing stillness") is distinctive. Minor: the core frame (artist performs ritual in remote place) echoes familiar contemplative-artist templates, though the execution and thematic specificity elevate it. No proximity echoes or derivative beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren assembles the frame, fixes the moth wing, and waits—three beats. Her decision to build the signal shapes the entire story, and her choice to dismantle it at closure forecloses permanence. Present in setup (paragraph two), middle (knot-tying), and ending (watching, then the morning dismantling promise). Causal pressure: her method narrows her stance to ephemeral honor. Cost: she accepts impermanence. Irreplaceability: swap "esoteric realist" for "artist" and the knot-vocabulary loses specificity, but the arc holds. Score neighborhood: strong setup, two beats, closure linkage, but swappability friction (−0.4) and no visible physical trade-off lower from high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moth wing is introduced early (first third), handled in assembly ("fixed the wing to the apex…with thread so fine it disappeared"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("the moth wing turning slowly on its thread, animated by a breath"). Three beats: retrieval from vial, fixing, nocturnal animation. It charges the final image and links the textile-mill women to the monarch. Causal: its translucence and lightness allow the updraft to animate it, signaling receipt. Cost: its fragility embodies the ephemeral method. Minor swappability friction (−0.3): a butterfly wing or feather could serve similar symbolic work, though the cathedral-window image is specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named in reflection ("that was what haunted her") and echoed at closure ("the cadence hung suspended"). It shapes Maren's motivation (honoring unfinished journeys) and her method (ephemeral signals). Present in setup (named paragraph five) and payoff (final paragraph). Two beats: reflection and closure reprise. The concept reweights the story's stakes—unfinished histories deserve witness even without resolution. Minor friction: it remains more thematic resonance than on-page constraint that alters a tactic; the butterfly's potential non-arrival is the nearest concrete pressure point. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; the return is purposeful and charged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is named early ("She was transiently rooted here, as she was everywhere") and governs Maren's method: she stays one night, then leaves. Present in setup (mid-story) and implicit at closure (she will descend). One beat: the declaration. It enables her choice to dismantle the structure, foreclosing permanence. Cost: she accepts impermanence and its invisibility. Friction: the trait is asserted in a reflection rather than tested through a micro-choice that dramatizes the cost of staying versus leaving (−0.5 to −0.7). Functional but closer to label than lived constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The knot-tying appears in one extended beat (paragraph four): "A bowline for remembrance. A clove hitch for passage. A figure-eight for the interrupted cadence." It embodies Maren's method and vocabulary, signaling her esoteric-realist stance. Present in middle development. The knots charge the frame's meaning and link to the closure promise ("undo the knots"). Causal: the act of knotting is her method of honoring. Cost: each knot is deliberate labor she will reverse. Minor swappability (−0.4): other ritual gestures (weaving, carving) could serve similar symbolic work, though the knot-vocabulary specificity is strong. One-beat involvement and no direct closure appearance lower from highest bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is named in setup (paragraph three: "Her method was building temporary structures…small architectures placed in landscapes where something true had been lost") and demonstrated in the middle (assembling the frame, fixing the wing). Two beats: method declaration and assembly. Present at closure implicitly (she will dismantle). The method is Maren's core identity and shapes the entire arc. Causal: the ephemeral design forecloses permanence. Cost: her labor vanishes. Minor friction (−0.5): the mechanics are asserted in reflection rather than tested by a constraint (weather, materials, time pressure) that alters a tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early (paragraph one: moss, limestone, mist, ferns, pale light) and pressures choices: the updraft animates the wing, the cold condenses mist, the altitude positions Maren above the clouds where the butterfly might pass. Three beats: arrival/description, assembly within it, nocturnal animation. Present at closure ("above the clouds," ferns will unfurl). The setting enables the signal's function (updraft) and charges the final image (darkness above clouds). Causal and atmospheric. Irreplaceability: the altitude and updraft are weight-bearing; a lowland grove would not serve. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("during the migration of the last monarch butterfly") is named in setup (paragraph four) and creates urgency: "Maren wanted to be ready." The butterfly's passage window is tonight. Present in middle (waiting) and closure (the butterfly may have passed, or altered course). Two beats: preparation and nocturnal vigil. The timeframe tightens Maren's window but does not create visible trade-offs or force a tactical choice under pressure. Minor friction (−0.6): the clock is declared but not live on the page—no moment where she debates leaving early or risks missing the window. Functional setup and thematic payoff, but mid-development constraint is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to honor overlooked histories" is stated early (paragraph three: "invisible forces…grief, forgetting, the slow erosion of meaning") and drives every choice: climbing, assembling, fixing the wing, waiting, dismantling. Four beats: declaration, knot-tying (each knot honors), nocturnal vigil, closure acceptance ("that was enough"). Present in setup, middle, and payoff. Causal: the motivation shapes the entire arc and forecloses permanence (she will undo the knots). Cost: her labor is invisible and ephemeral. Minor friction (−0.5): the motivation is asserted in reflection rather than tested by a friction that tempts her to abandon or alter the mission.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is named early (paragraph one: "the kind of quiet that comes not from absence but from reverence") and returns at closure ("the stillness blushed"). The tone—reverent, hushed, tender—is stable through turns and modulates subtly (the clouds "turned the color of a healing bruise" under pressure). Present in setup, sustained in middle (ferns "curled slightly inward, as if settling in to listen"), and charged at closure. Three touches across the arc. The tone shapes perception and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful. Minor: "blushing" as descriptor risks slight preciousness, but the effect is intentional and the reprise reweights the opening.</comment>
