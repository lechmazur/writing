<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vael's interiority is concrete and embodied through her reed-weaving ("letting its strange illumination guide her fingers"). Internal conflict emerges in her simultaneous longing and edge-dwelling, and her choice to confess her mark demonstrates a micro-turn that forecloses isolation with visible cost. The final image of being "woven in return" crystallizes her arc. Korin's tenderness ("touched the grandmother's open hand with a tenderness that made Vael's breath stall") and the gathered community add pressure, though their voices remain somewhat convergent in register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the gathering of figures and people around the arbor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Vael's solitary practice transforms into communal weaving. Closure lands on-page with visible cost ("the particular brightness that lives inside a lamp...you are expected"). Orientation anchors early (crystalline orchard, Vael, reed-sculpting). The ellipsis between "Over the following weeks" compresses transit efficiently under the accumulative mode, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vivid and purposeful, filtering light into "spectrums that hurt the chest more than the eyes." The marsh reeds function as micro-setting, constraining Vael's practice and enabling the shared craft. Spatial choreography is clean (perimeter, arbor center, crater bowl). The setting charges the final image as the arbor "fill[s] with reed people," transforming from Vael's solitary workspace into communal ground. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency, though some details lean decorative rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Vael's desire to graft herself onto community—is signaled early and tightens when she confesses her tag to Korin, foreclosing anonymous safety. The arrival of others deepens pressure accumulation under the Textural lens, and the final image crystallizes her stance: she has built the space and now stands "waiting to be woven in return," a Charged Poise that makes cost felt. One meaningful tightening (confession) and one deepening (community gathering) drive escalation. Agency is visible in her choice to reveal, to teach, and to wait.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reed-weaving particulars: chosen kinship versus inherited bonds, loneliness as both wound and catalyst. The final image—"waiting to be woven in return"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The luminescent ache that "changed" rather than vanished avoids tidy resolution. Subtext operates in gesture (Korin's tender touch, the tag as "quiet graffiti") and the arbor's transforming light. The piece resists abstraction through concrete action (braiding, pressing thumbs into chests, interlocking hands).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Vael's perceptual signature consistent ("edges were the only geography she understood"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with elevated register ("beyond the murmur of lost languages") matching the lyric mode. Korin's dialogue carries subtext and goal ("whoever makes this symbol understands something about belonging that I need to learn"), though his idiom converges slightly with the narrative voice. The phrase "Boldly sympathetic, Vael thought" edges toward diagnostic self-awareness but recovers quickly. Psychic distance shifts intentionally to accommodate the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong sentence-level propulsion ("She was building a family. Not from flesh..."). Information density is high, though some figurative language clusters without full payoff ("glass-bright silence," "shimmering crater," "molten gold" in close sequence). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The phrase "luminescent ache she had carried for years" verges on stock metaphor but is reweighted at closure. Grammar and usage are clean; spatial choreography tracks clearly. Opening and closing lines anchor voice effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reed-sculpting frame transforms the "chosen family" trope through specific craft detail (fibers that "remember the shape of water," figures that interlock so "neither could stand without the other"). The elusive street artist's tag as a breadcrumb trail adds a non-obvious search mechanic. The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor avoid generic "everywhere" settings. Emotional truth—tolerance versus kinship—feels earned rather than asserted. The final image's synthesis (solitary practice → communal weaving → mutual grafting) grows inevitably from prior particulars without overt moral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vael's choices drive key turns: she confesses her mark to Korin (middle beat), teaches reed-weaving (development), and stands waiting to be woven in return (closure). Setup is early (first paragraph). Her practice shapes the arbor's transformation and enables communal gathering. Causal pressure is strong: without her decision to reveal, the community cannot form. Closure linkage is direct ("waiting to be woven in return"). High irreplaceability and two-plus beat involvement support the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arbor appears in three beats: Vael sculpts beneath it early, it provides "strange illumination" guiding her fingers (middle), and it "fill[s] with reed people" at closure. Its "darker, warmer" light transforms crystalline brightness, contributing to the luminescent ache theme. Setup is early; middle use constrains her practice spatially; closure linkage is present but the arbor itself does not causally enable the final turn—Vael's confession and teaching do. Solid integration across beats but slightly replaceable with another gathering structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship spun from intention and need" is explicitly stated and shapes the dominant stake throughout. Vael's figures are "constellations" (setup), Korin seeks kinship beyond tolerance (middle), and the final image ("waiting to be woven in return") crystallizes the concept on the page. It constrains Vael's choices (building figures, teaching weaving) and defines the closure. Causal pressure is strong: without this concept, the story's logic collapses. Two-plus beat involvement and closure participation elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as an internal label when Vael observes Korin's willingness to reveal his wound. It characterizes his choice to share ("I was orphaned into a community that tolerates me") but does not constrain a later on-page action with visible cost. Setup is middle (second third); no closure participation. Functional but the trait could be conveyed through action alone without the label. Mid-band for one-beat involvement without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action of dedicating figures appears early ("pressing her thumb into the woven chest and whispering a name"), recurs when Vael and others "dedicated to a connection they were choosing," and implicitly charges the final image (Vael waiting to be woven/dedicated in return). Setup is early, middle use expands to communal practice, and closure reweights the act as reciprocal. Major turns trace to this ritual: confession enables teaching, teaching enables communal dedication. High causal pressure and irreplaceability; the specific act of dedication defines the kinship web.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The search for the tag is signaled early (Korin arrives with the symbol, "I've been searching"), its mechanics matter (Vael has been "pressing it into surfaces for years"), and it drives the inciting turn (Vael's confession unlocks community). Setup is early, middle use (confession) narrows options, and the tag's function as breadcrumb trail is irreplaceable—without it, Korin and others cannot find Vael. Closure participation is indirect but the search enables the entire accumulation. Two-beat involvement with strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater are vividly described early and provide the spatial anchor for all action. The marsh supplies reeds (enabling Vael's craft), and the orchard's edge reflects Vael's psychology ("edges were the only geography she understood"). The setting does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost but does charge the final image (the arbor fills with figures, transforming the space). Setup is early, closure linkage is present, but middle development lacks a moment where the setting's properties alter tactics. Solid lyric integration without sharp causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The phrase "beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears in the opening to establish the orchard's antiquity and recurs implicitly in the arbor's age ("so old its origins had passed beyond...into pure conjecture"). It sets tone and world texture but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No live clock; the "weeks" ellipsis is permissive rather than constraining. Setup is early, but no middle or closure pressure from the timeframe itself. Functional atmosphere but replaceable with any deep-past framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vael's desire "to graft oneself onto community" is dramatized early (building a reed family, living at edges), conflicted in her simultaneous longing and isolation, and tested when she confesses her tag (middle choice with cost). The motivation drives every major turn: sculpting, revealing, teaching, waiting. Closure directly embodies the desire ("waiting to be woven in return") with visible cost (vulnerability, patience). Friction between want (connection) and cost (exposure) is palpable. Strong causal pressure, three-beat involvement, and irreplaceability support high score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone of "luminescent ache" is coherent through turns: the light that "hurt the chest more than the eyes" (setup), Vael's longing for bonds she's never had (middle), and the ache that "changed" into "the particular brightness that lives inside a lamp" (closure). Tone modulates with pressure (solitary melancholy → tentative hope → charged anticipation) and charges the final image without resolving into simple happiness. Diction ("shimmering," "glimmering," "molten gold") reinforces the luminescent quality throughout. Strong integration and closure linkage.</comment>
