<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her tinker-archetype choices drive the story forward through three years of research and the seven-day singing sequence. However, the interiority remains surface-level—her internal contradictions or costs are told rather than embodied ("the stubborn faith that what was made to work would work again"). The villagers and Thessaly lack distinct pressure; they function as chorus rather than crucible. The final choice to complete the ritual feels inevitable without visible struggle or a path foreclosed, weakening the sense of earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren gathers fragments over three years, then enacts seven hymns in sequence, culminating in the vine's uncurling under the harvest moon—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the opening image with visible cost (three years, grease-blackened fingers, vocal strain). Causality is clean within the montage structure. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (arbor, village edge, Maren's workshop). The cost is present but understated; the vine's slow movement charges the closure, though the emotional or relational price to Maren personally is muted—she watches rather than renounces or risks a live stake at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arbor is vividly anchored ("cathedral shafts through ancient leaves," "papery weakness," "dew... as if the arbor were weeping") and its decay pressures the repair task. The harvest moon's amber light and the vine tendril's physical state constrain Maren's tactics and charge the final image when it uncurls. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the workshop and village interiors remain generic; the setting serves as stage rather than micro-environment that alters on-page choices during the seven-day sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the arbor—is signaled early and pursued through seven escalating hymns under the Accumulative lens. The vine's slow uncurling provides one meaningful tightening (the sixth day's children joining, the seventh night's collective song) that narrows the window and raises emotional cost. Agency is present in Maren's decision to sing and the villagers' gradual joining. The escalation is more additive than dialectical; no reversal or complication tests Maren's commitment, and the resolution feels guided by patient accretion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—restoration through remembering, patience over mechanism—emerges from concrete images (the vine, the hymns, the moon) rather than assertion. The final line ("tender and green and reaching") offers a resonant image that reweights the opening wrongness. However, the piece edges toward sermonizing: "Miracles were for people who did not understand repair" and "the stubborn faith that what was made to work would work again" articulate the theme rather than leaving it implicit. The lack of moral ambiguity or competing goods reduces complexity; the arbor simply listens and responds, and no counter-pressure complicates the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric, patient diction ("cathedral shafts," "curling inward like fists closing against the world") anchored in Maren's tinkerer metaphors. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates gracefully from workshop close-ups to montage summary to collective song. Brief filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she understood") in early paragraphs are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Thessaly's humming and the children's refrains lack distinct idiom, but at this length minimal secondary-voice work is acceptable when the primary POV remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (e.g., "the way a tinkerer notices a gear that skips"), and figurative language is purposeful without overwriting. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports momentum. Minor slip: "the silence that had settled over the village like dust on a forgotten shelf" in the opening slightly overreaches, and the phrase "golden light of the harvest moon" in the penultimate paragraph is near-stock. These do not touch the closure beat and remain within tolerance for the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whimsical-tinkerer-restores-forgotten-ritual premise is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through moral ambiguity, unexpected cost, or non-obvious complication. Maren's patience and the community's gradual joining feel earned but predictable. The vine's uncurling is specific and vivid, yet the emotional and thematic arc could be transposed to any restorative-practice template with minor edits. The synthesis of song-as-repair and tinkerer logic offers modest freshness, but the lack of reversal or friction in the final third keeps the piece in the capable-execution range rather than the inventive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout; her decisions (three years of research, choosing dawn to begin, singing each hymn) drive all beats. She is named and active in the opening, middle research montage, and the seven-day sequence. Her choices narrow options (committing vocal strain, inviting communal participation) and the closure—watching the vine uncurl—is the direct payoff of her sustained agency. However, the final beat is observational rather than a new costly decision, and her tinkerer trait shapes metaphor more than it constrains a high-stakes trade-off on the page, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vine tendril appears in four distinct beats: opening observation ("hung limp, pale at their tips"), Maren cradling it on the first morning, the dew-fall during hymn three, and the final uncurling under the harvest moon. It is handled on the page, its physical state (papery weakness → gripping the trellis) reweights with visible change, and it charges the closure image. The tendril is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the arbor-restoration stakes. Strong integration across setup, middle, and ending with evolving causal role and specificity. Minor cap: its agency is passive (it responds rather than complicates), keeping it shy of the 8.5+ indispensable tier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The harvest moon is signaled early ("autumn to sing... under the harvest moon"), frames the seventh hymn as the climactic alignment, and appears in the final image ("enormous and amber... light poured through the canopy like honey"). It provides temporal pressure (one night when everything aligns) that narrows the window for the ritual's success. However, the moon itself does not impose a visible cost or complicate Maren's tactics—it is a backdrop that marks the moment rather than an active constraint. Its role is thematic and atmospheric; removing it would weaken resonance but not break the logic of song-restores-arbor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories for the children at market day" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph as character color. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action, alter a tactic, or return with reweighted meaning. The trait is ornamental—it enriches Maren's whimsy but plays no causal role in the research, the hymns, or the closure. Swappable with any secondary hobby detail. Late introduction (not visible in her actual on-page work) and no middle or closure participation cap the score in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Remedy" is named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("This was a remedy, administered through forgotten songs") and implicitly structures the entire arc: Maren diagnoses (arbor sickens), researches (three years), applies treatment (seven hymns), observes result (vine uncurls). The action is irreplaceable—"repair" or "restoration" could substitute thematically, but "remedy" ties directly to Maren's tinkerer metaphor and the medical patience of the fix. It shapes all major beats and charges the closure claim. However, it is more thematic frame than a discrete physical act that Maren must risk or renounce; the lack of a visible tradeoff at the remedy's application keeps it shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Forgotten songs are introduced early (second paragraph: "songs had been forgotten"), researched across the three-year montage (Thessaly's fragments, waterlogged notation, Maren singing alone), and enacted beat-by-beat in the seven hymns. The method is irreplaceable—ritual speech or dance would fundamentally alter the story's logic. Each hymn's performance pressures the arbor's response (dew falls, villagers join, vine uncurls) and the seventh song directly shapes the closure. The mechanics are legible and costly (voice cracks, public vulnerability, communal reliance). Strong causal role, closure linkage, and specificity. Minor cap: the songs succeed without complication or failure risk visible on the page, leaving the method slightly too assured for 9+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn is named in the title beat ("the great verdant arbor stood at the eastern edge") and anchors the opening, the seven-day hymn sequence, and the final image. Dawn light ("cathedral shafts," "coolness of night," "dew") charges the first hymn and recurs in the harvest-moon glow at closure. The setting pressures the ritual's timing (dawn, then evening progression) and its public/communal dimension (villagers gather at the edge). Removing the arbor collapses all stakes. However, "at dawn" functions mostly as atmospheric marker; the arbor's physical layout (tendrils, canopy, trellis) constrains the vine's movement but does not force a tactical choice by Maren during the hymns. Strong setup, development, and closure presence with high specificity, shy of indispensable due to limited on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" is signaled early (autumn gathering, harvest moon), frames the seventh hymn's timing (moon fullest and lowest), and tightens the ritual window—Maren must complete all seven before the alignment passes. The timeframe pressures the escalation (day-by-day hymn progression) and charges the closure moment. However, the piece does not dramatize a live clock risk (e.g., threat of missing the moon's peak, weather complication). The alignment is more symbolic convergence than ticking constraint; the hymns proceed on schedule without visible cost if delayed. Present across setup, middle, and ending with moderate causal role, capped by lack of on-page friction or tradeoff tied to the deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Restoring sacred practices is Maren's explicit goal from the opening ("the rites had lapsed... year by year, the arbor sickened") and drives every beat: three years of research, the decision to begin at dawn, the seven hymns, and the closure claim ("the ancient sacred practices took root once more"). The motivation is dramatized through sustained effort (grease-blackened fingers, vocal strain, public vulnerability when villagers join). However, the story tells us Maren's faith ("the stubborn faith that what was made to work would work again") rather than showing internal friction between doubt and commitment. No moment where restoration conflicts with another want or imposes a visible relational cost. Strong setup and closure linkage with clear causal role, capped by lack of embodied internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" appears in the opening hymn beat ("A gathering hush lay across the world, as if the earth itself had drawn a breath and held it") and modulates across the seven days: quiet attention (fourth evening villagers listening), Thessaly's humming, children's high voices threading through, culminating in collective song under the amber moon. Tone is coherent and intensifies with pressure. The hush charges the final image (silent arbor response, slow vine movement). However, the tone is consistently reverent-patient without purposeful friction or dissonance; no moment where urgency, doubt, or communal discord breaks the gathering mood. Present across all three gates with clear modulation and closure linkage, capped by lack of tonal tension or cost.</comment>
