<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sael's motivation is clear and internally consistent—she resents erasure, not revelation—and this drives nineteen discrete consecrations with embodied cost (kneeling, pressing palm, feeling the parapet hum). Her "strangely honest" trait constrains the final exchange with the pilgrim, foreclosing diplomatic evasion. Internal contradiction operates subtly: she admires the prophet's beauty while working to limit its impact. Minor slip: the eleven-year training detail and the phrase "strangely honest" repeat as labels without fresh embodiment in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of clearing-conjuring by the second paragraph and accumulates nineteen iterations, then resolves through Sael's final self-aware observation and the image of clearings "holding steady beneath the noise." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she has chosen preservation over confrontation, foreclosing engagement with the prophet's message, and the cost is visible in her peripheral stance and the pilgrim's incomprehension. Orientation is anchored early (pavilion, Sael, prophet's arrival three days ago). One meaningful deepening occurs when the kinetic parapet responds to her intention, raising stakes from conjuring clearings to embedding them in the archive's infrastructure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is vividly particular: columns of woven air, syllables drifting like pollen, whisper-streams with interference patterns. The kinetic parapet—a lattice of compacted sound under the dunes—constrains Sael's technique and charges the closure by humming "its slow kinetic hymn" in the final paragraph. Her half-mask is a functional micro-setting (bare skin receives, covered skin filters) that enables her peripheral listening and shapes every choice. The spatial choreography of walking lines between invisible columns is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled in paragraph two: preserve the oldest echoes against the prophet's displacement. Sael's agency is decision and endurance—she chooses to conjure clearings rather than oppose the prophet, with visible cost (nineteen repetitions, kneeling at dusk through dawn). The piece accumulates pressure through the destabilizing murmurs and the prophet's rhythmic cadence pressing from the east, then tightens when the parapet responds and reinforces the clearings, narrowing her options to completion or failure. The final beat reweights the opening tension: "the clearings holding steady beneath the noise of new belief" demonstrates earned success with the price of remaining peripheral and misunderstood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "Wisdom was not a single voice. It was the space that let all voices remain." This claim is earned by Sael's nineteen clearings, the kinetic parapet's hum, and her refusal to lie to the pilgrim despite the cost to her legibility. The half-mask operates as a resonant image—filtering versus receiving—that recurs and shifts meaning at closure when she explains, "It helps me hear everything else." No overt moralizing; the final image (clearings nested within murmurs, parapet humming beneath dunes) offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor both revelation and archive. The phrase "strangely honest" edges toward meta-commentary but is quickly dramatized through on-page refusal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and carries a distinct perceptual signature: Sael notices interference patterns, seams in whisper-streams, and the parapet's hum through her bare palm. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during clearing-conjuring, slightly wider during the prophet's speech. The pilgrim's single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, contrasting with Sael's precise, technical interior idiom. Minor slip: "strangely honest" as a repeated phrase reads slightly authorial rather than emerging from Sael's self-perception, and "the way diplomats do" in the penultimate section briefly shifts register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives ("She began at dusk") alternate with longer accumulative structures ("Each one a small reliquary. Each one invisible..."). Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. The phrase "strangely honest" appears three times without variation, creating minor template cadence. "She was strangely honest about this, even with herself" and "line walkers are strangely honest by necessity" constitute a paraphrase loop (−0.2). No figurative muddle; metaphors (whispers like pollen, curtains parting, sediment in still water) remain coherent. Propulsion is steady through the nineteen clearings, never sluggish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-as-sound, half-mask for peripheral listening, and kinetic parapet beneath dunes feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the familiar "old wisdom vs. new prophet" template by making preservation an act of spatial engineering rather than ideological defense. Sael's choice to honor both the prophet's beauty and the archive's survival is a nuanced moral calculus absent from stock treatments. The final image—clearings as nested reliquaries, the parapet's hymn—is resonant and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the unconventional focalization (peripheral awareness as plot driver) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sael appears immediately, frames every beat, and her choices (to conjure clearings, to refuse diplomacy with the pilgrim) create the story's two key turns. Her peripheral listening shapes all nineteen clearings and the final stance. Removing her exact character—half-masked line walker with eleven years' training—would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is introduced at the midpoint, used actively in the clearing-consecration beat (Sael presses palm, feeds coordinates, feels it adjust and reinforce), and returns in the final paragraph as "humming its slow kinetic hymn." Two distinct beats plus closure linkage. The parapet's responsiveness enables the clearings' survival. Cap at 7.4 due to late first appearance (after 40% mark, −0.4) and single main interaction, but causal pressure and closure presence elevate within that constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are signaled in the title and opening abstract, demonstrated through the seam-finding technique by paragraph five, repeated nineteen times with escalating stakes (each clearing anchored by the parapet), and charged in the final image: "the clearings holding steady beneath the noise of new belief." The concept shapes every tactical choice (where to step, when to kneel, how to consecrate) and defines the story's resolution. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is named three times and constrains one on-page action with cost: Sael's refusal to lie to the pilgrim despite his incomprehension. The trait is explained (dishonesty distorts the peripheral field) but its embodiment is thin—mostly asserted rather than demonstrated through contradictory pressures. Present in setup, middle explanation, and payoff (pilgrim exchange), satisfying the gate model, but the visible tradeoff is narrow (one brief dialogue moment). Mid-band due to limited causal weight beyond that single beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Consecrate" is named in the task statement (paragraph three), executed nineteen times (pressing palm, feeding coordinates into the parapet), and the consecrated clearings anchor the resolution. The action is irreplaceable—Sael's entire arc turns on this ritual. Appears in setup, drives the middle accumulation, and shapes the ending. High causal pressure, high specificity, visible cost (dawn labor, peripheral stance).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness is introduced in paragraph four ("disciplined attention...sidelong focus"), taught through eleven years' training, and demonstrated in every clearing-conjuring beat: Sael holds bare-cheek and masked-cheek inputs without choosing, maps interference, senses seams. The method enables all nineteen clearings and the final tactical success. Setup, middle use, closure linkage. High irreplaceability—no other sensory mode would support the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion frames the entire story: its destabilizing murmurs create the stake, its invisible columns define Sael's walking lines, and its "ancient, layered calm" charges the final image. The setting supplies resources (the parapet below, the whisper-streams) and pressures (prophet's cadence from the east, churning after dawn). Present in the opening line, active across all beats, essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored early ("Three days ago, a figure appeared") and tightens tactics: Sael works from dusk to dawn to complete nineteen clearings before the prophet's morning speech destabilizes the archive further. The live clock (overnight window) shapes her choices and the resolution confirms success ("when morning came...the clearings...rested undisturbed"). Setup, middle pressure, closure verification. Solid causal role, but the clock's pressure is steady rather than escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve the echo of wisdom is dramatized in the opening reflection ("She resented erasure"), tested through nineteen clearings with visible cost (kneeling, pressing, overnight labor), and conflicted by Sael's acknowledgment that "the prophet's words were beautiful. They deserved their space." The friction between preservation and openness drives her tactical choice to create nested space rather than oppose. Setup, middle execution, closure reweighting. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Whisperfield calm is established in the opening (murmurs drifting like pollen, Sael's half-masked stillness) and modulates under pressure: the pavilion "shuddered" when the prophet spoke, but Sael's interior remains measured even at peak beats. The tone charges the final image—"the pavilion murmuring around her in its ancient, layered calm"—reinforcing the theme that wisdom is spaciousness. Coherent through turns, purposeful modulation, strong closure linkage.</comment>
