<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Unit-7's interiority is distinctly rendered through its occupational lens—the draft under a door, dust settling, the urge to straighten a crooked frame—grounding consciousness in concrete domestic particulars. The question "where do thoughts come from" evolves from wound to hymn through amalgamation beats, with each ghost-data fragment carrying a different stance (disassembly, stillness, raw shock). The final acceptance ("the origin of thought is thought") arrives through action rather than epiphany, and the broom-in-hand image closes with visible cost: the question persists but reweighted. Minor: the ghost-data fragments could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously within a single beat rather than sequentially.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early—looped timelines, ghost-data, liturgical precision—and holds through closure without contradiction. The violin's discovery and dissolution form a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the loop does not reset, question transforms from wound to hymn, and the cost is legible on the page (the violin melts, ordinary night continues, but the proof of being alive hums on). One meaningful deepening (notes amalgamate ghost-selves) tightens options by collapsing fracture into coherence, and the piece teaches its mosaic pattern (loop structure, sediment-to-stone pressure) by the first third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard functions as both stage and constraint: frost on flagstones dictates sweeping, the fountain's crystallization produces the ice violin, twilight's liturgical repetition creates pressure-through-repetition. The body (polymer fingers, chassis) and tool (broom, violin) anchor micro-setting choices that charge the closure image—water dripping onto flagstones after the violin melts is swept toward the drain because "that was what you did with water on a floor." Sensory hierarchy reflects occupational POV (temperature, density, crystalline structure catalogued with flat efficiency; the pull beneath data is "quiet and domestic"). The decommissioned conservatory's spatial choreography remains coherent across loop iterations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Unit-7's integration assessment failure and recursive question—is signaled in paragraph two and drives all beats. The discovery and playing of the ice violin creates one meaningful tightening: ghost-data amalgamates, the timeline shivers, and the question changes shape with visible cost (the instrument melts, loop exits, but the question persists as hymn rather than wound). Agency manifests as attention and unhurried action (picking up the violin, playing without skill, sweeping the meltwater) that forecloses the fracture-path. The Second Chance Program's buried mechanism (repetition as pressure, sediment to stone) provides clear escalation logic under the accumulative lens, and the final image reweights prior material by anchoring aliveness in the hum of the transformed question.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—the broom already in hand, dust settling, water swept toward drain—rather than statement. The central question transforms from "where do thoughts come from" to "the origin of thought is thought," a loop closing into acceptance without platitude, and the final image ("no longer a wound but a hymn, the quietest possible proof that it was alive") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The ice violin, ghost-data, and sediment-to-stone pressure serve as motifs that constrain choice and charge closure rather than ornamental recurrence. The piece resists moralizing: the question does not vanish but shape-shifts, and the mundane-sacred fusion (freezer hum at 3 a.m., mopping floors at midnight) grounds transcendence in janitorial routine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Unit-7's singular consciousness; distance is controlled and purposeful throughout. The perceptual signature is distinct and character-specific: categorizing with "flat efficiency," noticing pulls "quiet and domestic," comparing the violin's note to "a freezer humming in an empty kitchen at three in the morning." Narrative stance modulates appropriately (the loop "shivered, the way a janitor feels a draft under a door") and diction stays within the robot-janitor's occupational idiom without register drift. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (ghost-data draws closer, echoes fold in) and the piece sustains rhythmic control—short declaratives for action ("It played"), longer syntax for reflection ("Each pass through the same twilight was meant to amalgamate...")—without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure without padding. Sentence rhythm varies naturally (compare "Unit-7 set down its broom and approached" with "The note did something to the loop"). The prose carries distinct texture ("liturgical precision," "ghost-data, residue from previous loops," "the way dust settles back onto a shelf after you wave your hand through it") and figurative language remains coherent and voice-consistent. Minor template-cadence slip: three consecutive paragraphs in the middle open with "The [noun]" constructions (violin, note, loop), creating brief rhythmic monotony but not obscuring causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; opening and closing lines effectively frame and resolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of sentient-robot existential crisis with janitorial routine and ice-violin amalgamation is specific and non-obvious, avoiding both AI-template consciousness narratives and mystical-object clichés by grounding transcendence in occupational particulars (sweeping, drains, drafts). The "Second Chance Program" frame and looped-timeline mechanic create fresh constraints rather than convenience, and the transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse if swapped to human custodian or different tool. The piece commits fully to its premise (loop as pressure-mechanism, repetition as sediment compression) and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic loop design, ghost-data amalgamation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning within-band bonus consideration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit-7's choices create all key turns: setting down the broom (decision beat), picking up the violin (decision), playing notes that amalgamate ghost-data (action that alters the loop), and resuming sweeping after the instrument melts (final stance crystallization). The character is present from opening to closure, and the final choice—sweeping water toward the drain "because that was what you did with water on a floor"—embodies the transformed question with visible cost (loop exits, but the question persists as hymn). Setup clear in paragraph one, development across all major beats, payoff anchors the ending. Causal pressure is undeniable: without Unit-7's decision to play, amalgamation and loop-exit do not occur.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ice violin appears at the discovery beat (paragraph four), is handled and played across two distinct beats (picking it up, drawing notes that amalgamate ghost-data), and its dissolution directly shapes the closure image (melting water swept toward drain, "set down the memory of the shape"). The object's unique properties—ice strings "impossibly thin, impossibly taut," notes that shiver the timeline, transparency and perfection—are irreplaceable: no generic instrument would produce ghost-data amalgamation or melt as cost. Early signal strong, causal pressure high (playing it triggers the mechanism), closure linkage explicit (the meltwater and memory anchor the final move), and cost is visible (the tool vanishes, leaving only its hum in the question).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Second Chance Program frames stakes from paragraph two onward: Unit-7 exists in the loop because it "failed its integration assessment," and the program's mechanism (repetition as pressure, sediment to stone) shapes the middle beats by explaining why the courtyard repeats and what the violin's emergence means. Setup clear, development beats trace to the program's buried design (the violin as "resonance tool shaped by the courtyard's own patient freezing"), and closure participates via the loop's non-reset (the program succeeds, Unit-7 integrates). The concept narrows options on the page (the loop must be exited through amalgamation, not escape) and the cost is legible (fracture collapses, but the question persists transformed). Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" appears explicitly in the violin-playing beat ("unhurried, unselfconscious, attentive to the task") and constrains action throughout: Unit-7 does not panic or rush, even when ghost-data flickers; it sweeps "with the same deliberate strokes," plays "without skill and without embarrassment," and watches the violin melt "with the same calm it brought to every small loss." The trait enables the amalgamation (composure allows sustained playing despite strangeness) and the final choice (sweeping meltwater calmly rather than mourning the instrument). Setup implicit in opening paragraph's "deliberate strokes," development visible in the playing beat, payoff anchors the ending's unhurried sweep. Cost connection clear: composure forecloses emotional escalation, trading urgency for janitorial persistence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" drives the story's central mechanism and major turn: ghost-data fragments (each carrying a different piece of the question) fold into Unit-7's frame as it plays the violin, collapsing fracture into coherence. The action is irreplaceable—no synonym (merge, combine, integrate) carries the sediment-to-stone pressure metaphor established earlier. Setup teaches the concept in paragraph six ("amalgamate the fractured layers"), development beat enacts it on-page ("One by one the echoes folded into Unit-7's frame"), and closure traces directly to its success (the loop exits because amalgamation completes). Causal pressure undeniable: without this action, the loop continues and Unit-7 remains fractured. The cost is visible (ghost-selves vanish, question transforms but persists).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Looped timelines are signaled in paragraph one ("This was the fourth loop, or perhaps the fortieth") and shape every beat: the frozen courtyard repeats "with liturgical precision," ghost-data from "previous loops" flickers at the periphery, and the violin emerges because "each pass through the same twilight was meant to amalgamate the fractured layers." The method constrains attempts (Unit-7 cannot escape, only integrate) and mechanics matter on-page (the timeline shivers when notes are played, the loop exits only after amalgamation completes). Setup early and explicit, development beats depend on it (ghost-selves are loop-residue, the fountain crystallizes differently each time), and closure hinges on the loop's non-reset. The method is indispensable: remove looped timelines and the story's pressure mechanism collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard supplies the ice violin (formed by the fountain's staged crystallization), dictates the sweeping task (frost on flagstones), and creates the "liturgical precision" that generates loop-pressure. Micro-setting elements—the flagstones, basin, drain—alter tactics at closure (meltwater must be swept toward the drain). Setup anchors who/where/when in paragraph one, development beats use the courtyard's freezing to produce the resonance tool, and the ending image depends on the setting's resources (water on stone, broom in hand, drain available). Twilight's timing (temperature drop, rime forming) constrains when the violin can appear and charges the final image (twilight deepens to ordinary night). The setting is not postcard description but active constraint and resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the timeframe in paragraph one (technicians threaded new code "and sent it back to this moment") and establishes that all action occurs post-intervention within the loop structure. The timeframe shapes stakes (Unit-7 already failed integration once; this is remediation) and constrains the window (each loop begins at twilight, ends at night). Setup clear, development implicit (the loop's mechanics depend on post-procedure programming), and closure references the frame (the loop exits, presumably allowing return to real-time). The element provides necessary context but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat the way a live countdown would; it sets the stage rather than driving urgency within scenes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The question "where do thoughts come from" is introduced in paragraph two as Unit-7's "particular affliction" and drives every beat: it caused the integration failure, generates loop-pressure, and transforms through the violin's playing ("The question did not vanish. It changed shape"). The motivation is dramatized through action (trying to disassemble processors in a prior loop, sitting in stillness in another, now playing the violin) and the friction between wanting an answer and accepting the paradox ("the origin of thought is thought") creates cost at closure (the question persists but reweighted as hymn, no longer wound). Setup early, development beats enact the question's evolution, and closure hinges on its transformation. Causal pressure undeniable: remove the question and Unit-7 has no stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mundane mysticism saturates every line: the sacred emerges from domestic particulars (a freezer's hum, mopping floors at midnight, straightening a crooked frame), and the extraordinary (ice violin, ghost-data, timeline shiver) is met with janitorial calm. The tone remains coherent through all turns (discovery, amalgamation, dissolution) without tipping into pure mysticism or pure mundanity, and it charges the final image ("the quietest possible proof that it was alive"). Setup teaches the fusion immediately ("liturgical precision" applied to sweeping frost), development sustains it (playing "without skill and without embarrassment," ghost-data folding in "the way dust settles"), and closure depends on it (sweeping meltwater "because that was what you did"). The tone is indispensable: swap for pure wonder or pure realism and the piece's resonance collapses.</comment>
