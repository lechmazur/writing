<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and purposeful—her way of arranging plants to signal commercial intelligence coheres with her claim "I can see when something broken still wants to resonate." The micro-choice to affix the reed tongue carries embodied risk and forecloses decorative safety. Aster's final unlocking "behind her ribs" avoids therapy-speak yet lands as earned by the cumulative barter structure. Minor limitation: Maren's colorblindness functions more as thematic seasoning than a constraint that shapes a pivotal on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of awakening-through-exchange by ~25% and sustains it through parallel beats (herb garden arrangement, reed tongue discovery, breath-activated painting). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the exchange between Maren and Aster crystallizes when Aster breathes and the reed speaks, reweighting the barter with felt cost ("neither woman could say who had given more"). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (who, where, when). One tightening suffices: the reed's arrival narrows Maren's tactics and charges the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard is legible and purposeful: phoenix-heat warps air, flagstones yield the reed, kiln warmth frames the workspace. The reed tongue itself functions as micro-setting—its trembling in wind constrains Maren's final compositional choice and charges the closure beat when Aster's breath activates it. Spatial choreography remains clean across all moves. Slightly below 8.0 gate: the courtyard supplies resources but does not force a trade-off that visibly alters tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete the "Bartered Awakenings" series and articulate the unfinished central piece. The reed's arrival tightens options—Maren commits to embedding it, foreclosing decorative safety. Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens: density increases from arranging herbs to layering gesso and ash around the protruding reed. Cost is felt when Aster witnesses the "small unlocking" and Maren accepts mutual debt ("neither woman could say who had given more"). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; agency is clear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—awakening through barter, beauty in imperfection—emerges organically from Maren's plant arrangements, the broken reed, and the breath-activated painting. The final image (Aster breathing, reed trembling, unlocking) offers a non-literal answer: exchange itself is the awakening. Sage in threes signals "something important happened here" without moralizing. Slight overstatement in "the luminous grammar of what remains" risks abstraction, but the concrete particulars (rosemary angled east, reed affixed like a nerve) anchor the resonance and prevent drift into platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren with clean section-break pivot to Aster's focalization in the closure beat—no mid-paragraph head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices "the architecture of light and dark," Aster reads gardens "the way others read letters." Dialogue ("You're putting a piece of junk in your best painting") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "whatever Maren imagined stone to be" momentarily shifts psychic distance without full motivation. Distance control and voice specificity otherwise exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere ("basil clustered near the door for welcome, rosemary angled east for remembrance"). Rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing frames cohere. Deductions: "the phoenix rises" repeats as scaffold across three beats without evolving function (−0.3). "Bartered Awakenings" title + "the bartered awakening was complete" + premise label loop constitute paraphrase churn (−0.3). Figurative density ("metallic wound," "nerve ending exposed to air," "luminous grammar") clusters in final third without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting (−0.2). No artifacts touch closure unit directly, so caps do not apply.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Colorblind painter in a glassblower's courtyard offers a fresh synthesis; the breath-activated reed integrates premise (imperfection resonates) with closure mechanics in a non-obvious way. Plant-language barter and the "phoenix" ritual supply specificity that resists generic template. Risk: embedding a found object to complete the painting is bold and heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight limitation: the "finding beauty in imperfection" frame, while executed with care, remains a familiar archetype and the final paragraph's "luminous grammar" edges toward poetic abstraction rather than irreplaceable particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (colorblind painter) is present throughout and her choices drive key beats: arranging the garden (setup), deciding to affix the reed (development), and layering gesso around it (closure participation). Her colorblindness shapes thematic resonance ("I can't see your colors… but I can see when something broken still wants to resonate") and signals the alternate perceptual mode that enables the barter. The condition does not constrain a high-stakes on-page choice—Maren's painting process would function similarly if she saw full spectrum. Two gates strong, third (causal pressure via the attribute itself) partial. Swappability moderate: another sensory constraint (e.g., hearing loss) could substitute with edits. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two beats) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure partial +0.3, specificity +0.4; swappability −0.5, ornamental risk −0.3. Base ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue is introduced at the inciting beat (Thursday discovery), handled when Maren holds it to light and watches phoenix-heat warp around it (middle), affixed to canvas with visible cost (renouncing decorative safety), and activated by Aster's breath in the closure image where it gives "its imperfect note" and triggers the unlocking. Three gates satisfied. The reed's broken state and whisper-when-wind-catches specificity are irreplaceable—no generic object could substitute without losing the "imperfect tone" that articulates the theme. Visible cost: embedding it transforms the painting and forecloses safer compositional paths. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity/irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.5. No frictions. Final ~8.4, rounded to 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" frames the series title, governs Maren's arrangement signals (herbs cluster to guide Aster's business decisions), and names the closure realization ("the bartered awakening was complete"). Setup present (first paragraph identifies the concept and the courtyard barter), development (each canvas depicts "a moment of exchange—one consciousness stirring another"), closure participation (final line explicitly invokes it and the mutual debt articulates the barter). Three gates met. The concept shapes stakes (complete the series) and constrains Maren's tactics (layering texture to make the painting "awaken something" in viewers). Cost: mutual dependency and the impossibility of separating giver from receiver ("neither woman could say who had given more"). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (two beats) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.5; label-only echo in final paragraph −0.4, thematic convenience (concept stated rather than purely inferred) −0.3. Base ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is named once in paragraph 2 ("innocently cunning in a way that disarmed even the shrewdest merchants") and demonstrated when Maren's plant arrangements signal which buyers Aster should trust, doubling her business. Setup gate met (paragraph 2), development implicit (the arrangements operate throughout), closure absent (the trait does not reappear or constrain the reed-painting decision). Two gates. The trait enables the barter but does not force a visible trade-off on the page—Maren never chooses between cunning and innocence under pressure. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one functional beat) +0.4, causal pressure +0.4, specificity +0.3; label-only mention −0.4, no closure linkage −0.6, swappability (another social-disarming trait could substitute) −0.6. Base ~5.9, rounded to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Awaken" operates at setup (the series title "Bartered Awakenings"), development (paintings "depicted a moment of exchange—one consciousness stirring another into life"; the reed will "awaken something" in viewers), and closure (Aster's breath awakens the painting and "something behind her ribs shifted, a small unlocking"). Three gates met. The action defines the stakes and method: Maren must create paintings that perform awakening, not merely depict it. The reed's installation makes the awakening reciprocal (viewer's breath activates the painting). Cost: Maren renounces static beauty to embed a participatory device. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5; some swappability (another participatory verb—"stir," "ignite"—could replace with edits) −0.7. Base ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plant arrangement communication is introduced in paragraph 2 (basil for welcome, rosemary for remembrance, lavender in odd numbers to signal trusted buyers) and Aster "read the gardens each morning the way others read letters"—business doubled. The method reappears in closure when Maren plans "thyme for courage near the gate, sage in clusters of three to say: something important happened here." Setup and closure gates met; middle development weak (the method does not constrain the reed-painting choice). The mechanics are specific (odd numbers, direction, clustering) and the method's success is shown (doubled business), but it does not pressure the central conflict. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two beats) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.6; middle gate missing −0.5, no causal pressure on the painting decision −0.7. Base ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard anchors all action: Maren paints there after the phoenix firing, the courtyard fills with "shimmering heat" that warps air around the reed, the flagstones yield the musician's dropped object, and the furnace's dimming marks the closure timeframe. Setup immediate, development throughout (courtyard warmth and flagstones enable the reed discovery), closure present (final image places us "outside, the furnace waited"). Three gates met. The courtyard supplies the reed and frames the barter but does not force a spatial trade-off that alters tactics mid-scene. Early signal +0.8, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (enables discovery) +0.7, specificity +0.5; postcard-description risk (phoenix ritual, molten light) without full pressure −0.4. Base ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" names the timeframe in paragraph 1 and recurs in the final line ("the furnace waited for its next phoenix"). The tradition frames Maren's courtyard access and the "trembling air" that charges her perception. Setup and closure gates met; middle development absent (the phoenix timing does not tighten a decision or create urgency—Maren works "through the afternoon" without a ticking constraint). Two gates, no pressure. The timeframe is atmospherically rich but functionally ornamental. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, specificity (ritual detail) +0.4; no middle gate −0.6, no urgency or deadline −0.8, swappability (another daily ritual could frame the barter) −0.5. Base ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find beauty in imperfection" is voiced explicitly when Maren says "I'm finding beauty in imperfection… That's all I've ever done" and demonstrated through her colorblindness, the broken reed, and the choice to embed the flaw rather than smooth it. Setup (paragraph 1 establishes her condition and painting practice), development (reed discovery and decision to affix it), closure (the "imperfect note" and unlocking validate the motivation). Three gates met. The motivation drives the reed-affixing choice and forecloses decorative perfection with visible cost. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.6; slight verbatim statement risk ("That's all I've ever done") −0.3, some swappability (another acceptance-of-flaw motivation) −0.4. Base ~7.9.</comment>
