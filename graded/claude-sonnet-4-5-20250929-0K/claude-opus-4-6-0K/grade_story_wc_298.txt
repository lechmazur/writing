<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is vivid and embodied—her desperate love for Lise drives the descent and shapes the barter. The internal conflict between "reckless idealism" and the "quiet, ordinary" self she accepts is felt on the page. The cost—trading her wild hope for Lise's restored desire—is legible and forecloses a path. Minor: "fiercely gentle" appears as a label without dramatized micro-choices that expose the tension between those impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Maren trades her reckless certainty for Lise's restoration, a Decisive Change with visible cost ("heaviness where lightness had been"). The lens is Causal—descent, ritual, exchange, ascent—and linkage is tight. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. One persistent constraint (the ritual's symbolic architecture) shapes tactics at the basin. The cost is on the page and reweights the stakes decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is visceral and specific: roots through skulls, black water that reflects no light, pale unpicked fruit. Micro-setting details (the basin, the burned card floating) constrain the ritual and charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (corridor → chamber → basin → stairs). The environment embodies the theme and directly shapes Maren's final choice, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring Lise's hollowed-out desire—is signaled early and drives the ritual. Escalation tightens through Maren's symbolic gestures (name, hand in water, closed eyes) and culminates in the felt cost: her certainty exchanged for Lise's capacity to want. Agency is clear: Maren chooses the descent, performs the ritual, and accepts the trammel. The price is legible and narrows her options permanently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: roots feeding on the dead, the barter of futures/pasts, wild hope trammeled into patience. The ending reweights the material without moralizing—Maren's transformation is specific, non-literal, and resonant. "Dusky resolve hardening in her like amber around an insect" reconfigures her earlier recklessness. The core concept (bartered destinies) integrates with theme through dramatized action, not assertion. No thematic echo or stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "loam and quiet centuries," "femurs into gilded columns," "dusky resolve." Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally. Minor: a few moments lean slightly elevated ("inlaying meaning everywhere," "unseen architecture") but remain within the narrator's idiom and serve the ritual's gravity. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world, character, theme). Figurative language is controlled and coherent: "roots held the dead in a long embrace," "amber around an insect." Minor density concern: the dealer's exposition ("bartered destinies, where one person's future…") runs slightly expository in the second paragraph, momentarily pausing pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise is fresh and the ritual's symbolic architecture (name/hand/eyes) feels specific. The barter's cost—trading reckless hope for ordinary patience—avoids generic sacrifice templates. The final image ("dusky resolve hardening…like amber") synthesizes motifs with specificity. Minor: the "hollowed-out daughter" and "desperate mother descends" frame sit closer to archetype than full transformation; the story elevates through execution and atmospheric particularity rather than structural novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's reckless idealism drives the descent (setup), shapes her trust in the ritual (middle), and is explicitly traded away at closure ("the very recklessness that had brought her here"). The trait creates the key turn and its loss is the cost. Causal pressure is clear and the element is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears early (setup), floats on the black water during the ritual (middle involvement), and sinks as the barter completes (closure participation). Its image—figure at crossroads, half eaten by flame—mirrors Maren's transformation. The card is irreplaceable; no generic token could carry the same symbolic charge. All three gates met with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bartered destinies frames the stakes from the dealer's exposition, governs the ritual mechanics (trading Maren's certainty for Lise's desire), and delivers the closure. The concept shapes tactics—Maren performs specific symbolic gestures—and the cost is legible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor: the dealer's explanation slightly front-loads the concept; more discovery through action would tighten integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is mentioned once as a descriptor ("fiercely gentle in the way only desperate mothers can be") but does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible friction. The trait fits Maren's motivation but remains label-only. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation absent. No causal pressure or cost tied to this specific pairing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears late (final third) but names the exact mechanism of the barter and defines the closure cost: Maren's wild hope is bound into ordinary patience. The action is irreplaceable—no synonym captures the binding/constraining sense. Closure linkage is strong and the cost is legible. Late arrival prevents higher score, but transformation is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled by the dealer ("inlaying meaning everywhere") and demonstrated at the basin: every gesture carries intent (name/laughter, hand/listening, eyes/trust). The ritual's success depends on this symbolic layering. Setup and middle involvement present; the method shapes the barter's mechanics. Moderate causal pressure. Could score higher with earlier teaching or more beats where the method alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced immediately (setup), its roots/bones/fruit create atmosphere and constrain movement throughout (middle), and the basin at its center is the site of closure. The setting is irreplaceable—roots feeding on the dead embodies the barter's logic. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. The orchard's physicality shapes every choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The half-lit corridors frame the descent and ascent, creating a cohesive atmospheric window. The timeframe is present (lantern glow, dripping water) but does not tighten decisions—Maren is not racing a clock. Setup and closure participation met (she walks the corridor slowly at the end, reweighted). Lyric resonance present but no tactical pressure from time itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to patch holes in Lise's soul—is dramatized early, drives the descent and ritual, and defines the barter's cost. The desire is conflicted: she trades her own wholeness for her daughter's. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and friction between want (restore Lise) and cost (lose herself). All three gates met with indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" is not named until the penultimate paragraph but emerges throughout: the amber glow, loam and quiet centuries, the water's darkness, and Maren's patient transformation. Tone is coherent, modulates with the ritual's gravity, and charges the final image ("dusky resolve hardening…like amber"). Strong closure linkage; earlier explicit signal would lift score.</comment>
