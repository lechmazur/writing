<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and embodied through the shrinking-hand detail and time-bleed symptoms. The final realization—that she unconsciously gave her hours to save her daughter—arrives with genuine emotional weight and is earned by the card-reading setup. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she climbs to reclaim what was stolen, then discovers she gave it willingly. Minor gap: the decision to sacrifice the talisman feels slightly abrupt; one more micro-choice showing her weighing the cost would have tightened the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren accepts the cost of her sacrifice and chooses to return with "minutes" instead of magic, forecloses the path of reclaiming lost time. Orientation anchors quickly (glade, cartomancer trade, post-birth context by ~150 words). Drive lens reads Causal with lyric texture: card-reading → climb → revelation → ritual surrender form a clean because/therefore chain. Cost is visible: she unfastens the talisman, "ink bled… into the earth," magic exchanged for time. One pressure point—the swirling hand-card and epiphany—could have been tested by a micro-turn to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glade is vivid and purposeful: starlight pooling in the saucer, luminous grass, altitude that "made her throat ache" all anchor the ritual space and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (cartomancer's eye for ink, starlight). The crack in the saucer mirrors her "fissure" explicitly, which borders on overt symbolism but remains tactile. Spatial choreography is clean (kneel, lay saucer, draw card, unfasten chain). Does not quite constrain a choice—setting enables the revelation but doesn't force tactical adaptation—so high-7s ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find lost time before she's unmade) is clear early and tightens through the climb and card-drawing. The reversal—time wasn't stolen, it was given—narrows options decisively: she can either reclaim it and doom her daughter or accept the trade. Agency is Maren's: she chooses to sacrifice the talisman and "return lighter… full of minutes." Cost is legible (loss of magic, shortest stature). One deepening move (revelation) rather than layered escalation keeps this in high-7s; a secondary complication or visible tradeoff during the climb would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and generational debt emerges from particulars: the hand-tracing custom, the bleeding minutes, the cracked saucer as continuity symbol. "Repentance: the willingness to look at what you have done and call it yours" is close to a thesis statement but is integrated as card-knowledge rather than authorial intrusion. The final image—packing the saucer "crack and all" and descending through parting clouds—resonates without moralizing, and the hand-tablecloth callback reweights the opening material. No false balance or tidy moral; Maren's choice costs her magic permanently. Minor proximity to overt articulation ("call it yours") prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; psychic distance is controlled and diction stays character-particular ("onyx-ink," "oak gall," "bellows"). The prose modulates well: compressed urgency during the climb, lyric expansion in the glade, quiet resolve at the end. "Choking" beauty and "fist behind the sternum" embody emotion without therapy-speak. No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. One minor slip: "the truth arrived like a fist" is slightly generic compared to the rest of the perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm is strong overall: varied sentence length, good use of fragments ("Not blood, not strength, but time itself"), and propulsive sequencing. Information density is high; most lines do double duty (world-building + emotion). Two frictions: "swirling into the shape of a hand—small, newborn, unmistakable" is slightly over-determined (pick two adjectives), and "the cards, when she begged them" leans toward preciousness. Minor synonym drift: "breath… heartbeat… time" in one sentence risks list feel. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Figurative language is mostly clean, though "starlight pooled" and "luminous grass" border stock pastoral in combination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—cartomancer losing time to save her early-born daughter—offers a fresh synthesis of magical-realism body horror and maternal sacrifice. The hand-tracing custom and cracked-saucer motifs feel specific and earned rather than ornamental. Transformation of familiar material (sacrifice for child) through the card-reading frame and "cloudbound repentance" glade is solid. Risk: the lyric register and mountain-pilgrimage structure flirt with New Age tropes but are grounded by the procedural cartomancy and concrete physical toll (shrinking fingers). Not derivative, but the emotional arc is recognizable; one more subversive inflection in the final choice would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout. Her choice to unfasten the talisman is the closure turn; she also chooses to climb, to draw the card, to "call it yours." Two causal beats (climb decision, talisman sacrifice) plus closure participation. Specific cost (loss of magic) tied to her action. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The saucer appears twice: broken gift in backstory paragraph, laid on grass for the card ritual, packed at the end. It mirrors the "fissure in her own continuity" explicitly, which is functional but not indispensable—another object could carry the crack metaphor. Does not constrain a choice; its reweighted meaning is asserted rather than dramatically tested. Lyric reprise and purposeful recurrence earn mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" names the glade's function and frames Maren's final act. It shapes stakes (she climbs to this specific place) and the closure hinges on accepting what "repentance" means: owning the gift rather than reclaiming it. Present in setup (card image), middle (glade arrival), and payoff (the choice to leave the talisman). Functional but slightly abstracted; the concept could be implicit without the label. Two-gate solid, not three-gate indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is declared once ("she climbed willingly perplexed") but does not constrain an on-page action or create visible tradeoff. The perplexity is resolved by the card revelation without her having to navigate the uncertainty in a way that alters tactics. Label-only mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unfastening the talisman chain is the climactic act: "She reached behind her neck and began to unfasten…" triggers the ink bleeding into earth and time rushing back. This is the decisive physical choice that enacts the sacrifice and closes the arc. Irreplaceable; no other action would carry the same ritual weight or complete the exchange. Three gates (setup of talisman as "oldest card," decision, payoff) with high causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hand-tracing custom appears in the backstory block (mother traces Maren's hand, discovers shrinkage) and returns in Maren's vision of tracing her daughter's hand in the future. Two beats, purposeful reprise that reweights the shrinking motif into generational continuity. Does not shape a middle attempt or constrain a choice during the climb. Lyric bookend use, solid but not essential to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glade is introduced early (cards give the image, Maren climbs to it) and provides the ritual space for the revelation and sacrifice. Starlight pools in the saucer, grass receives the ink; the setting enables the magic and charges the final image ("clouds that parted around her"). Constrains tactics subtly (she must reach this place to repay the debt). Three gates, good integration, but does not force a mid-scene adaptation, so stops short of 7.5+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the birth" frames all action and motivation: the hemorrhage, anesthesia gap, and time-bleed stem from that event. The timeframe is setup and drives the central question (where did the lost hours go?). It does not tick as a live clock during the glade scene; once Maren climbs, urgency shifts from time pressure to revelation. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic payoff in daughter's future). Functional but not mechanically active in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to find where lost time accumulates is stated early, tested by the card-reading, and resolved by the discovery that she gave it. The motivation is embodied (shrinking fingers, drifting hours) and conflicted: she wants to reclaim time but discovers reclaiming it would harm her daughter. Friction between want (restoration) and cost (daughter's life) is clear and drives the final choice. Three gates, strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone is consistent: awe-struck and oppressive beauty ("so beautiful it was choking," "throat ache," "rang like crystal"). The lyric register modulates with Maren's emotional arc—wonder on arrival, grief at revelation, quiet resolve at departure. Tone charges the final image: clouds "parted around her like curtains drawn open on a new, uncharted morning" integrates beauty and cost. Strong coherence and pressure throughout, no drift.</comment>
