<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's grief is embodied through concrete actions—polishing gems, folding cranes—and her internal state emerges through these rituals rather than exposition. The interiority remains consistent (lamp oil-stained fingers, meditative repetition), though the emotional progression is largely static: she grieves at the opening and continues grieving at the close without meaningful contradiction or compounding cost that forces a harder choice. The daughter Luma exists only in memory and projection, so no relational crucible tests Maren's stance on the page. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("grief would not end, but it would take flight") that edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through iterative ritual (dream-gem polishing → projection → crane folding → lantern assembly) that deepens in each cycle, and the final image—hanging the lit lantern and committing to tomorrow's repetition—registers as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (the grief persists, transformation is ongoing, no escape). Orientation anchors are present early (Maren, tea garden, basilica, post-Luma's death). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow detaches and the dream-gem activates, intensifying the ritual's stakes. The closure reconfigures the premise: grief becomes a sustained practice rather than a problem to solve, and the cost (no resolution, only iterative labor) is legible in "Tomorrow she would sleep again and harvest new gems." No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating isle tea garden, glass basilica, and thermal jasmine are vividly rendered and filter through Maren's craft-trained perception (lamp oil, obsidian paste, lattice floor). The Severance phenomenon—shadow detaching at dusk—provides a recurring environmental constraint that enables the dream-gem activation, directly shaping the central ritual. Spatial choreography is clean (tea table, basilica walls, jasmine tree branch). The ending image (lit lantern hung from the branch, cranes' shadows on glass) charges the closure by anchoring the iterative ritual in physical space. Minor gap: the broader archipelago context and "upward-setting sun" are poetic but remain decorative; the micro-setting (table, tree, lantern) does the functional work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming grief into a sustainable ritual of remembrance. The pressure accumulates through the Severance event, which triggers dream-gem activation and compels Maren to complete the cycle (fold cranes, build lantern, hang it, commit to repetition). The final act—hanging the lantern and resolving to continue tomorrow—forecloses the path of singular catharsis or escape, establishing grief-work as an open-ended practice with visible cost (no end, only repetition). One meaningful deepening when the shadow detaches and the dream ignites the basilica at architectural scale, raising the emotional and symbolic stakes. The cost is conceptual but legible: Maren's agency is renunciation of resolution, and the piece earns this through prior causality (three months of loss, one month of dream recording, tonight's ritual). No coincidence resolves; her choice to continue drives closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the dream-recording apparatus, crane-folding ritual, and Severance phenomenon: grief as iterative transformation rather than linear resolution. The final image—lit lantern, trembling paper crane—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the recurring motifs (light, folding, descent/ascent) that shift meaning across beats: polishing gems reveals clarity, cranes suggest flight, the lantern houses both. The piece resists tidy closure; Maren's commitment to tomorrow's cycle acknowledges complexity (grief persists, yet takes form). Minor slip: "the boundary between dreaming and waking dissolved entirely" edges toward overt thematic statement, though it remains anchored in the projection scene. The crane "trembling as if remembering how to breathe" charges the ending without explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all perception through Maren's craft-trained attention (lamp oil, filament calibration, obsidian paste). Diction is elevated and lyric ("colors that had no names in the waking world," "thermal jasmine… tasted of altitude and longing"), consistent with the piece's tone but occasionally drifting into ornamental register ("luminous, tormenting moment") that prioritizes texture over immediacy. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, though some passages ("Dream recording… was not invention but excavation") read as authorial summary rather than Maren's lived thought. The perceptual signature (lantern-maker's focus on light, facets, lenses) is distinct and purposeful, anchoring the voice throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("grief into colors that had no names," "leaves steeped themselves in morning fog," "light erupted… projecting Luma onto the glass walls"), creating lyric texture but occasionally stacking metaphors without pause ("fold formless anguish… a shape that suggested flight" immediately follows geometric crane description). Template cadence appears in paired constructions: "not a ghost, not a memory, but a recorded dream"; "watched and wept and folded"; "dream by dream, crane by crane, light by light." Paraphrase loop: "To fold grief into origami cranes was not to diminish it but to transform it" restates the transformation concept already enacted on the page. The prose is clean and grammatically controlled, with strong momentum through the Severance sequence, but the cumulative figurative load in peak beats (basilica projection, crane-folding) slightly dulls immediacy. No causality breaks; routing to Q7 for density and template patterns. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative stacking and template runs; −0.3 for paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording technology, floating-isle tea garden, shadow-severance phenomenon, and origami-crane ritual feels purposeful and non-obvious, avoiding pure fantasy whimsy through grounded craft detail (filament calibration, obsidian paste, gem polishing). The premise transforms familiar grief-work tropes by anchoring them in a lantern-maker's technical practice and an invented cosmology (Severance, upward-setting sun). The emotional arc—grief as iterative ritual rather than cathartic resolution—resists the safety middle and commits fully to its implications. Minor friction: the glass basilica and floating isle, while vividly rendered, risk decorative exoticism; their function is primarily atmospheric rather than causally essential. The piece's boldest choice is Earned Stasis as closure, which heightens stakes by foreclosing easy consolation. Risk distinction: +0.3 for sustained commitment to accumulative structure and refusal of cathartic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's craft—lantern-making repurposed for dream recording—frames the entire ritual and directly enables key beats: discovering dream recording at the workbench (setup), polishing the gem to activate the projection (middle development), building the lantern to house cranes and gem (closure participation). Her technical knowledge (filament, obsidian paste, hollow core design) constrains and shapes each action. The lantern hung at the end is the culmination of her craft, and her decision to continue tomorrow signals ongoing agency. The character's choices create the story's turns; swapping "lantern maker" for another craft would require substantive rewrite. Strong setup, beat involvement (three distinct: discovery, polishing, lantern assembly), causal pressure, and closure linkage. Cost: the labor is unending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in setup (opening line, establishes locale), development (walls become projection surface during Severance, "every transparent surface alive with the amber glow"), and closure (crane shadows dance on basilica walls, final image holds "The basilica glowed"). Its transparent architecture is functionally necessary: it receives and amplifies the dream-gem's light, transforming private memory into architectural scale. Removing it would break the projection beats and deflate the ritual's visual/emotional charge. Two causal beats (projection surface, shadow-dance screen) plus closure participation. Specificity: transparency and spire geometry matter. Minor friction: the basilica is more setting than object Maren handles directly; it enables rather than being worked by her hands, slightly reducing irreplaceability compared to the gem or lantern.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dream recording is introduced early (discovery backstory, "one month since Maren discovered"), directly enables the projection beat (gem glowing with Luma's scene), and shapes the ritual's stakes: grief made visible and repeatable. The concept constrains tactics—Maren must sleep, harvest, polish—and drives the commitment to continue tomorrow. Closure depends on it: without dream recording, the ritual collapses into generic memory-work. Two beats: discovery (setup via brief backstory) and activation during Severance (middle/climax). Causal pressure: the recorded dream defines what Maren can recover and share. Slight dock: the mechanics are asserted more than dramatized on the page (we see one polishing cycle, but the recording itself happened off-stage). Still, the concept is irreplaceable and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" occurs once, during the Severance: "Maren descends while ascending, her shadow pooling downward… as her chest lifts… toward the basilica's highest spire." This paradoxical state enables dream-gem activation ("In this split state… the dream-gems activated"), making it causally necessary for the projection beat. Closure participation is indirect: the phenomenon is past by the final image, though its effect (the projection) persists. Setup is clear, one key beat (activation), and the trait's mechanics matter. Minor dock: the attribute is more environmental condition than character trait; it happens *to* Maren rather than being chosen or embodied. Swappability: "at twilight" could substitute with edits, though the descent/ascent duality resonates thematically. Cost is atmospheric rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Transform" is the story's engine: polishing transforms rough gems into clarity, folding transforms grief into cranes, the lantern transforms paper and light into shadows, and the ritual transforms loss into ongoing practice. Setup is immediate ("transform" as Method, echoed in "gem polishing… transformation both"), development spans every beat (polish, fold, assemble, hang), and closure hinges on it: "the grief would not end, but it would take flight… ascending from the body even as the body descends." Removing transformation collapses the throughline into static mourning. Three beats minimum (polish, fold, lantern assembly), causal pressure throughout, and closure linkage is explicit. The word itself appears sparingly, but the concept structures every action. Irreplaceable; the story *is* iterative transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Gem polishing appears early (Maren "polishing a gem she had cut from her own recorded dream"), is detailed with craft specificity ("fine-grained obsidian paste and a cloth soaked in tea," "Each pass… stripped another layer of distortion"), and directly enables the projection: "By the time her shadow returned… the dream-gem had dimmed to an ember." The method shapes the middle beat (polishing = revelation of clarity = activation during Severance) and primes closure (the polished gem goes into the lantern). Two beats: polishing ritual and its payoff in projection. Causal: without polishing, the gem doesn't project clearly. Slight dock: the mechanics are more described than dramatized in real-time action; we see her with the polished gem, but the polishing itself is summary. Still, the method is specific, irreplaceable, and tied to her craft identity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is setup (opening, "Maren sat in the floating island tea garden"), provides resources (thermal jasmine tea used in polishing, jasmine tree branch for hanging the lantern), and anchors closure (lantern hung "from the lowest branch of the jasmine tree"). The setting's unique features—floating above an abyss, site of the Severance phenomenon, tea-infused polishing cloth—constrain and enable Maren's ritual. Three beats: location for polishing, Severance trigger, lantern placement. Spatial micro-setting (tea table, lattice floor, tree branch) alters tactics. Removing the garden would require rewriting the ritual's anchor and the Severance mechanics. Strong setup, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Cost: the garden's isolation mirrors Maren's solitary grief-work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" defines the Severance window, which occurs "every evening… at dusk" and is the story's structural hinge: setup establishes the nightly ritual, the Severance itself occupies the middle beat (shadow detaches, gem activates, projection plays, shadow returns), and closure commits Maren to repeating the cycle tomorrow. The timeframe tightens decisions: Maren must complete the ritual (fold forty-seven cranes, assemble lantern) before the shadow reattaches and the projection fades. Two beats: Severance activation and its end ("By the time her shadow returned"). Causal pressure: the detachment window enables and limits the dream-gem's activation. Closure: "Tomorrow she would sleep again" signals the timeframe's cyclical recurrence. The nightly rhythm is irreplaceable; the story is structured by it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Folding cranes is introduced early (opening paragraph, "She folded paper cranes… each one inscribed with a name she could no longer speak aloud"), enacted on the page during the Severance ("Her hands moved without instruction, pressing paper into wings… Each crane she finished, she placed on the tea table"), and anchors closure (forty-seven cranes go into the lantern, "a paper crane trembled as if remembering how to breathe"). The motivation is dramatized through action and embodied detail (fingers moving, cranes glowing in dreamlight, shadows dancing). Friction: want versus cost is implied (the cranes can't restore Luma) but not sharply tested; Maren's grief is consistent rather than conflicted. Three beats: opening ritual, active folding during Severance, cranes in final lantern image. Causal: crane-folding is necessary to complete the lantern and charge the ending. Irreplaceable: the repetitive handwork embodies her iterative grief practice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is established early ("refracting grief into colors that had no names") and sustained through contrasts: dream-gem's "amber glow" against the abyss, Luma's laughter filling the nave, "luminous, tormenting moment" explicitly named, and the final image of the lit lantern and trembling crane. The tone modulates with pressure—calm polishing, split-state Severance, weeping projection, quiet resolve at closure—without flattening into monotone. The dual charge (beauty and pain) is coherent across all beats and charges the final image: light persists, torment persists. Minor dock: "luminous, tormenting" as an explicit label in mid-text edges toward telling the tone rather than fully enacting it, though surrounding imagery supports the claim. Setup clear, modulation present, closure participation strong.</comment>
