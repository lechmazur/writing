<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and purposeful—the broken needle as tactile relic, the distinction between performed and felt emotion, the bodywork of pressing palms to stone. The backstory (~25%) anchors cleanly in present stimuli (sorting records, touching the needle) and primes the closure choice to abandon the relic. Minor slip: the transition from "felt nothing" to weeping could show one more micro-contradiction or hesitation under pressure to fully earn the shift, but the filament metaphor and the backward-song mechanism provide enough causal scaffolding. The final renunciation (setting down the needle) forecloses reliance on the relic with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren's weeping and decision to set down the needle reconfigure her relationship to silence and feeling, with the cost legible in the image of abandoning the talisman. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increase through the backward-song experiment, then a cadence shift in the frost-night breakthrough that reweights the dominant stake (reconnection to music). Orientation anchors by ~180 words (cavern, deaf teacher, autumn, phonograph memory). One meaningful deepening (the lullaby moment) narrows options and charges the final image. Cost is undeniable: she releases the broken needle, the physical proof of her first ghost-emotion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern functions as more than backdrop: its limestone acts as a membrane filtering frequencies, the stone floor conducts reversed vibrations, and the drum-making legacy primes resonance as both craft and metaphor. The broken needle is handled across multiple beats (pocket touch, thumb press, final placement on stone) and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (cross-legged, palms flat, speakers buried in walls). The autumn/frost timeframe subtly tightens urgency without overt clock pressure. One small gap: occupational detail (phonograph mechanics, digital reversal) is asserted rather than shown through tactile interaction, but the piece uses body and recurring object effectively to meet the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnection to music's emotional core—is signaled early and tightens through the experiment's failure-then-success arc. The backward lullaby on frost night is a clear reversal that narrows options (the method works) and forecloses her prior tactic (relying on the needle-relic for proof). Agency is renunciation: she sets down the needle with visible cost (abandoning the talisman that linked her to the three-second ghost). One secondary accent (grief over lost prodigy identity) braids without diluting focus. The price—releasing physical proof of her breakthrough—is legible and proportionate to the 750-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—silence as generative space rather than absence—emerges through concrete particulars: the filament metaphor, the backward songs bypassing learned defenses, the cavern holding tears "as something sacred rather than empty." The needle's shift from relic to discarded object reweights prior material without stating a moral. The final image ("the space where feeling gathered before it became sound") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic echo or meta-commentary dilutes the closure. One minor note: "mirrored hush" in the penultimate paragraph leans slightly abstract, but it's grounded enough in prior sensory work (stone, vibration, weeping) to avoid penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices through touch and vibration metaphors (filament, membrane, knot). Diction remains character-bound ("the hush around her was no longer absence" fits a former prodigy's formal precision). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates aptly under pressure—shorter sentences during the weeping beat, slower cadence in the reflection on backward songs. One small slip: "a woman who taught music by pressing her palms against piano lids and reading vibrations the way others read faces" is elegant but risks slight explanatory distance; the immediacy recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences do double work (e.g., "She called it a filament of hush" names the concept and embodies her habit of renaming loss). Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Two paraphrase loops lower the score: "She felt nothing. / Not the vibrations, not the resonance…" and "They slipped past the part of her that had learned to perform emotion without feeling it. / By the time her mind assembled the melody…" restate cause within adjacent lines. One template run: "She had found… She had been… She kept…" across three paragraphs uses identical stems without pattern-teaching. No figurative muddle; metaphors (filament, membrane, knot) cohere. Closure beat is artifact-free. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The backward-recording method offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sensory deprivation and technological mediation; the filament-of-hush metaphor is specific and apt. The cavern choice (drum-making legacy, limestone as membrane) transforms the relic-quest premise through grounded physical logic. Emotional truth—numbness persisting despite adaptive skill—avoids template arc. One friction: the "deaf music teacher experiments with sound" frame echoes workshop exercises; the backward-song twist elevates it, but full transformation requires one more layer of unpredictable choice or cost (e.g., a social or professional price paid for the cavern isolation). Threshold: solidly above median, short of rare.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all key turns: sorting records (discovers reversed track), reconstructing the experiment in the cavern, pressing the needle for reminder, setting it down at closure. Her decision to abandon the relic reconfigures her stance and forecloses reliance on physical proof. Present in setup (paragraph two), middle (experiment builds), and ending (needle abandoned). Causal pressure is clear—her agency narrows options and the final renunciation carries visible cost. Strong irreplaceability: only a deaf music teacher who once felt emotion through sound would need this exact arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The needle appears in three beats: discovery (broken after three-second emotion), tactile habit (touched in pocket, pressed to thumb), and closure (set gently on stone). The reprise reweights meaning—from relic to discarded proof. Integration is solid but not indispensable: the story could function with another tactile token (e.g., the reversed record itself) without major structural loss. The needle enables no middle tactic and constrains no choice beyond serving as reminder. Two-gate participation (setup, closure) with charged reprise lifts it to mid-6s; lack of middle causal work caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The filament metaphor is introduced early ("She called it a filament of hush, this dead wire…"), constrains framing (Maren seeks to repair the broken emotional wire), and returns at closure ("The filament was whole again, trembling and alive"). It shapes the dominant stake directly. One friction: the concept never forces a tactical choice on the page—it remains metaphorical frame rather than active pressure. The closure reprise reweights it (dead wire → alive) with cost tied to abandoning the needle, which qualifies as lyric-resonance payoff. Strong setup and closure linkage, weak middle development caps it at upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Audibly muted pulses" describes the backward songs traveling through limestone; the trait enables the experiment's sensory design. Mentioned once in the cavern-experiment paragraph, it constrains method (high frequencies absorbed, deep pulses remain) but does not return or force a later tradeoff. Functional but swappable—"low-frequency vibrations" would serve nearly as well. One-gate participation (middle setup) with no closure presence or cost connection. Caps at mid-5s for single-beat enabling without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Enthralled" appears only in the final sentence ("she… was enthralled by it completely"), describing Maren's state after the filament repairs. It charges the closure image but does not drive prior turns—the weeping and needle-renunciation do that work. Late arrival (final line) and ornamental use (state label, not action) trigger caps. The term does reweight the ending (shift from numb performance to genuine absorption), qualifying as lyric reprise. Closure participation rescues it from low band; lack of middle causal work and late intro cap it at low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled early (father's reversed folk record), drive the middle experiment (recording musicians, reversing tracks digitally, burying speakers), and deliver the closure turn (backward lullaby on frost night breaks the knot, triggers weeping). The method's mechanics matter causally: reversal bypasses learned defenses because recognition lags behind bodily response. Irreplaceable—forward songs failed; only reversal works. Three-gate participation, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, high specificity, and visible cost (tears, needle abandoned). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern is introduced early (title heritage, shaped-by-resonance description), supplies the experiment's physical logic (limestone as membrane, stone floor conducts vibration), and hosts the closure action (Maren sits cross-legged, sets needle on stone). It constrains method (requires burial of speakers, absorption of high frequencies) and charges the final image ("the cavern held her tears… with a mirrored hush"). Three-gate participation with causal and closure pressure. One small gap: the drum-making legacy is evocative but ornamental—removing it would not break logic. Still, the setting's acoustic properties are indispensable to the backward-song method. Strong but not rare.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Autumn and turning seasons are mentioned in the opening and frost arrives on the breakthrough night, creating a loose temporal bracket. The frost moment slightly tightens urgency (season fully turns, experiment succeeds), but the timeframe does not constrain choices or drive tactics—Maren could experiment in any season without structural change. The "faint rustle" phrase appears once and does not return. Two-gate presence (setup, closure accent) but swappable and low causal pressure. Functional mood-setting, not essential timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is the dominant stake, introduced early ("the emotional core of music had gone numb inside her"), dramatized through the experiment's failure-then-success arc, and resolved at closure (weeping, filament whole, needle abandoned). The desire is conflicted—she fakes understanding to survive, yet the charade costs her integrity. Micro-choices (pressing the needle, sitting nightly despite failure) show friction between want (reconnect) and fear (permanent loss). The cost of success (releasing the relic, accepting vulnerability) is visible. Three-gate participation, strong causal and cost linkage, high specificity. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is seeded early ("silence underground was different from the silence she carried"), modulates through the piece (hush as absence → hush as sacred space), and charges the penultimate paragraph ("the cavern held her tears… with a mirrored hush that gave silence back as something sacred"). Tone coheres through turns without flattening—contemplative under pressure, intimate at closure. The final line ("the space where feeling gathered before it became sound") extends the tone's reweighting. Strong setup-to-closure arc with purposeful modulation. One small gap: "mirrored" leans slightly abstract in the penultimate use, but the image recovers specificity in context. High-7s for coherent tonal charge.</comment>
