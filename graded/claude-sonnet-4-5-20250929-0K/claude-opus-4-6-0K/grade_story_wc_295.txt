<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, her lucid-dream methodology consistent. Her final action—adding Seda as co-author—reads as purposeful witnessing rather than a dramatically earned turn forcing contradictory impulses. Gregor's arc (sanitarium visit, telegram, grief) is sketched but operates mostly as catalyst. Internal conflict remains mild; the cost is relational closure for Gregor rather than a forfeited path for Elara.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Elara at the observatory, night nine, examining rubbings. The closure unit—writing Seda's name as co-author and Gregor's acceptance—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (witness fulfills burden-sharing). Causal links hold: telegram → correlation → decoded line → co-author credit. One meaningful deepening (recognition that witnessing heals) tightens the stake. Cost is visible in Gregor's grief and the vindication of Seda's work, though the price Elara pays is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly particular: copper dome, tracking motors, star charts. The daylily-pressed telegram functions as micro-setting object that charges the final beat. Sensory filtering reflects Elara's nocturnal rhythms and archival focus. Spatial choreography (desk, notebooks, charts aligned) remains clear. The setting constrains choice by housing the archive and isolating the protagonists at night, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but does not press a tactical dilemma at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the inscriptions and validate Seda—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when Gregor presents the telegram, narrowing Elara's task to witness and co-authorship. Agency is soft: Elara's final act (adding Seda's name) is ethical rather than a forced trade-off. Cost is present (Gregor's grief reframed, Seda vindicated) but the protagonist does not forfeit a live option or face a tactical reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—shared burdens as medicine—emerges organically from the decoded line and the co-authorship gesture. The daylily's veins echo dream transcripts, motif recurrence constrained and purposeful. "Words are the oldest medicine" risks thematic echo but is embedded in action (writing Seda's name). The final image (Mira pulsing, "still speaking") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity in witnessing as healing avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices stellar rhythm, glyphs, the "architecture of dreams." Diction remains apt ("midnight solace," "slow suffusion of light") with minor elevations ("cartography," "technology of shared burdens") that fit the scholarly register. Gregor's brief dialogue and gesture feel natural. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the telegram beat. No filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: the telegram beat delivers backstory, object, and turn in one move. Minor scaffold: "Understanding dawned the way all true understanding does" explicates what the scene already shows. "Words were the technology of shared burdens" edges toward thesis statement. One paraphrase loop near the end ("not merely to decode symbols but to witness"). Clarity and propulsion remain strong; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—variable-star periodicities as ancient script—is fresh and specific, rooted in observational astronomy and dream-mapping. The "shared burdens" frame risks template familiarity but is grounded in Seda's institutional erasure and Elara's credential ("not a complaint but a credential"). The final image (Mira's heartbeat, "still speaking") is non-obvious. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on these particulars. No close literary echoes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout; her chronicler methodology shapes the correlation discovery and the final co-authorship decision. Introduced early, active in the decode beat, and her choice to add Seda's name closes the story. Cost is oblique (ethical rather than tactical). Two strong beats (correlation, co-authorship) plus closure participation; causal but not indispensable—another scholar could decode. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.2, causal +0.8, swappability −0.5, cost generic −0.2 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced in beat two (Gregor sets it on her desk), handled twice (Elara reads, Gregor presses to chest at end). The daylily's veins map the glyphs, charging the correlation discovery. Returns at closure when Gregor clutches it, reweighted by vindication. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure shaping +1.4, causal +1.0, specificity (veins as map) +0.6, cost +0.4, late first appearance (second third) −0.3 = ~8.2. Irreplaceable: veins matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept structures the dominant stake: Elara decodes to share the burden Seda carried alone. The decoded line ("What one carries alone will crush") articulates it; the co-authorship enacts it. Signaled by the telegram's "burdens shared are burdens halved," developed in the decode, paid off in the final gesture. Three beats (telegram, decode, co-author), causal, closure-shaping. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.5, cost +0.5, thematic label risk −0.3, swappability (could be "witness" alone) −0.4 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early ("words were the oldest medicine"), restated at closure ("healed with words because words were the technology"). Shapes the final action (writing Seda's name). One strong beat (co-authorship); cost is Gregor's grief reframed. Early +0.6, one beat +0.4, closure +1.0, causal +0.7, label-only phrasing ("technology of shared burdens") −0.4, swappability (could be "validates" or "honors") −0.6, summary mode −0.3 = ~6.4. Visible but soft.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Witnessing is the verb that ties the story: Elara witnesses the correlation, witnesses Gregor's grief, and fulfills Seda's unwitnessed discovery. The decoded line hinges on it ("Nobody would witness what she had found"). Co-authorship is the act of witness that closes the arc. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure decisive +1.8, irreplaceable +0.7, cost +0.5 = ~8.7. Remove "witness" and the closure collapses.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira-class variables are introduced early (Seda's work), mechanic explained mid-story (pulsations → stroke order), and the decoded sequence depends on them. Mira returns in the final image, "still speaking." Three beats (telegram, correlation, closure), causal, closure-shaping. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.6, specificity (Mira in Cetus, pulse period) +0.6, cost generic −0.2, mechanics back-loaded −0.3 = ~7.9. The method is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory houses the archive, isolates the pair at night, and supplies the star charts. Introduced in the opening, active in the decode beat, ambient at closure. Two beats (archive access, chart correlation), setting enables but does not press a tactical choice. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +0.9, closure ambient +0.4, specificity (copper dome, tracking motors) +0.5, swappable (any archive site) −0.6 = ~7.1. Postcard risk mitigated by "midnight solace" function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" frames the decode beat and is literalized ("dawn… not as a single flash but as a slow suffusion of light"). Present in the title region and closure; no mid-scene clock. One beat (decode), lyric reprise at end. Early seed +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure reprise +0.8, causal +0.6, swappable (could be "revelation") −0.6, vague tracking −0.3 = ~6.2. Resonant but not mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's goal—decode the temple inscriptions—is stated early and drives her presence at the observatory. The decode beat fulfills it; the co-authorship extends it to vindication. Two beats (correlation, decode line), causal, closure-adjacent. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.3, closure adjacent +1.0, friction (personal cost to Elara is thin) −0.4, told motivation ("she believed") −0.3 = ~7.8. Clear but not agonized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is named and enacted: Elara works at night, the observatory quiet, "the particular peace of being awake while the world dreamed." Tone is elegiac, contemplative, modulates gently at the grief beat. Present throughout, coherent at closure (Mira pulsing, patient). Three touches (opening, work nights, closure), charges final image. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.2, coherence +0.8, single static register −0.4, label-only phrase −0.2 = ~7.5. Consistent, not dynamic.</comment>
