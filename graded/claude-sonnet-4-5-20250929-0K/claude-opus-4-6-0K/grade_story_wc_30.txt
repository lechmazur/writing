<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's fluctuating identity is rendered through concrete behavioral shifts (cataloging by emotion at first quarter, fishing at full moon) rather than labels, and the contradiction lives in scene. The titan-gear exoskeleton functions as embodied self-image ("the delicate woman inside the giant's skeleton"). Internal texture remains consistent across phases—each self independently chooses wonder—which earns the stasis at closure. Minor: the full-moon self's memory of "a father's hands mending nets, a life Maren had never lived" feels slightly under-dramatized in its friction with present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered contradictions (librarian/fisherman, giant frame/slight body, repeated day/miracle) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) in the final image: Maren stands in silver water cradling the folio, reaffirming wonder in the contradiction and the staying. Cost is conceptual and felt—she has foreclosed departure and embraced perpetual recursion—legible in "the day that would not end and did not need to." Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One tightening occurs when the creel's dual use (fish/metal) reweights her role from passive cataloger to active sustainer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is not ornamental: flooding twice daily governs access to submerged stacks and determines when Maren can work, the titan-gear compensates for drag, and the grates supply both fish and sediment. The creel functions as micro-setting (tool that enables dual tasks). The final image—"stood still in the silver water, in the winter light, in the day that would not end"—charges closure by anchoring stasis in tangible environment. Spatial choreography (wading depth, lower shelves, furnace room behind east stacks) remains legible throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving wonder (library maintenance, fish collection, metal repair) against the flattening of eternal recurrence. Pressure accumulates through the migrating-identity constraint, which threatens continuity, yet each phase independently chooses the same stance. The tightening occurs when we learn the creel and smelting serve book repair—turning the apparent digression into proof of sustained care. Agency is endurance with visible cost: she stays when others wandered away, and the piece forecloses departure in the final beat. No antagonist needed; the situational pressure (stopped calendar, solitude, identity flux) coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from enacted particulars: wonder as method, contradiction as structure, acceptance as survival. The creel's double function (fish vessel → metal source) and Maren's self-acceptance model the piece's argument without stating it. "Sense was not what held the world together after tomorrow vanished. Wonder was" risks being a thesis statement, but it is earned by prior demonstration (moon-phase shifts, the furnace work, choosing miracle over repetition). The final image—mechanical arms cradling a paper bird—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one survives recursion. No moralizing; ambiguity (is eternal recurrence trap or gift?) remains live.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren; psychic distance tightens during sensory immersion (final paragraph) and loosens during exposition (moon-phase catalog) with clear purpose. Perceptual signature: she notices contradictions and recurrences without alarm, filtering through acceptance. Diction is controlled—"titan-gear," "smelt," "creel"—and the prose texture (lyric compression in "salt water rose through the marble floor grates at intervals governed by the moon") reflects her patient, precision-oriented mind. No dialogue present; not required here. Filter verbs ("felt the titan-gear lock") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates purposefully: the opening paragraph breathes with tidal cadence, the moon-phase catalog quickens through list structure, the final beat slows into stasis. Information density is high—nearly every line advances setting, character contradiction, or thematic material. Minor scaffold: "She had books to tend, and wonder was a thing that needed tending most when routine threatened to flatten everything into sameness" contains a small paraphrase loop (tending/tending). "It made no logical sense" briefly tells rather than trusts prior demonstration. No template cadence, no metaphor muddle. Sentence variety and clarity remain strong under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—librarian in exoskeleton, fishing in a flooded archive, smelting fish (homophonic twist on purpose), identity flux survived through repeated independent choice—feels specific and non-obvious. The migrating-identities condition and the stopped-calendar premise could trend derivative (mental illness metaphor; Groundhog Day echo), but the piece transforms both through the tidal-library setting and the creel's dual function. The final image (giant arms cradling paper bird) is particular to this voice and stakes. Risk: the lyric compression and thematic density could obscure causality for some readers, but here it heightens stakes without breaking legibility.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (titan-gear librarian) drives the piece: her choice to stay (foreclosing departure), her acceptance of identity flux, her independent reaffirmation of wonder at closure. Present in setup, middle (wading to submerged stacks, gathering fish, working metal), and ending (cradling the folio, standing in silver water). The titan-gear enables tactics (lifting waterlogged volumes, compensating for drag). Cost: solitude, eternal recursion, foreclosed departure—visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The creel appears at full-moon phase (setup), is used to gather fish mid-story (middle beat), and hangs at her hip in the final image (closure participation). Its dual function (fish collection → metal smelting for book repair) is specific and irreplaceable—removing it would break the link between fishing and library maintenance. Reweighted meaning: what seems a digression proves instrumental. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the object is indispensable to the piece's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Migrating identities shapes on-page stakes: the new-moon self catalogs without thought, first-quarter wants reorganization by emotion, full-moon claims the creel and fishes, last-quarter grieves. This flux threatens continuity but is accepted; each phase independently chooses wonder, which becomes the through-line and enables the ending's Earned Stasis. The concept constrains action (only the full-moon self fishes) and charges the theme (acceptance of contradiction). Present in setup, developed across middle beats, resolved at closure when all selves' shared choice is articulated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moon phases govern identity shifts (constraint) and determine task availability (full moon → fishing; new moon → translucent cataloging). The fluctuation is tied to specific behaviors on the page, not merely described. Visible cost: she cannot control which self appears, yet each must independently choose to stay and tend. The attribute enables the creel's arrival and use, shapes tactics (working through flooding only when the right self is present), and supports the closure argument (wonder chosen repeatedly across selves).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Smelt" (extracting metal from sediment) is the story's pivot: it explains why a librarian fishes (to gather sediment-bearing water and release fish into the fountain) and ties the creel to book repair (metal → clasps and hinges). Introduced mid-story but causally central—removing it would sever fishing from library maintenance. The action is specific (not generic repair) and charges the theme: creating utility from contradiction. Present in middle beat, shapes closure participation (the work continues), irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Accepting contradictions" is not merely stated—it is enacted across the piece: librarian/fisherman, giant frame/slight body, repetition/miracle, multiple selves/unified choice. The method is signaled early ("acceptance had become her method for surviving everything that followed") and demonstrated in each phase's independent reaffirmation of wonder. It shapes the ending: she does not resolve contradictions but holds them, standing still in the water with mechanical arms cradling paper. The method is the structure; removing it would collapse the piece.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal atrium governs access (flooding to waist/chest height twice daily), necessitates the titan-gear, supplies resources (kelp, fish, sediment), and structures Maren's work rhythm. Present in setup (opening paragraph), pressures middle choices (wading to submerged stacks, gathering fish through grates), and charges the final image (standing in advancing silver water). Micro-setting (grates, furnace room, fountain basin) alters tactics. The setting is indispensable—the story's logic, stakes, and closure image all depend on tidal flooding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" (the calendar stops producing new days) establishes the existential frame: each morning opens onto the same date, flattening routine into potential despair. The timeframe motivates Maren's choice to stay (others wandered away) and sharpens the theme (choosing miracle over repetition when change is impossible). Present in setup, referenced at closure ("the day that would not end and did not need to"). The stopped clock is conceptually central but does not tighten on-page tactics beat-to-beat—time does not run out within the scene. Still, removing it would erase the premise's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To preserve wonder in routine" is dramatized through concrete acts: staying when others left, working through flooding, repairing books no one may read, choosing "miracle" over "repetition" each phase. The motivation is tested by identity flux (will each self choose the same?) and answered at closure when she stands in the silver water affirming wonder. Friction exists: solitude, eternal recurrence, and the effort to sustain care without external reward. The desire is the dominant stake and drives the ending's Earned Stasis. Strong integration; the motivation is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity: "pale winter sun angling through the glass roof," "silver water," the cadence of tidal breathing, and Maren's acceptance without despair establish a coherent, meditative tone. The tone modulates appropriately—rising briefly during the moon-phase catalog (more energetic list structure), then slowing into stillness at closure. It charges the final image: standing in water, holding the folio, affirming wonder without agitation. The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the piece's argument; removing it would shift the ending from stasis to mere resignation.</comment>
