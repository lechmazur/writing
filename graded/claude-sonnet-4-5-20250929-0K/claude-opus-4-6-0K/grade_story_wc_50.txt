<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior world is rich and specific—the locksmith's understanding of "frozen arguments between entry and refusal" gives her an embodied expertise that shapes perception. Her drive to "store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is dramatized through micro-choices: oiling gears with patience, mapping angles, replacing the hairspring. The character earns credibility through technical particularity and a clear hierarchy of values, though the final act is observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (locksmith, cavern, autumn, timer mechanism) within the first two paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (weekly descents, three notebooks, the timer's spiral repair) and culminates in a cadence shift when Maren climbs out and the cavern "began, slowly, to compose." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she stores wonder with visible cost (weeks underground, convalescence parallel)—but the cost remains oblique and the final image does not reweight prior stakes as sharply as high-band closure requires.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not mere backdrop: its parabolic walls, fissure-angle light, and acoustic properties directly shape Maren's method (mapping angles, charting delays). The timer mechanism functions as micro-setting, constraining her repair choices (seized gears, spiral crack as lens). The seasonal frame—frost, stunned fields, convalescence—mirrors and pressures her work. Environment constrains choice and charges the final image ("the marble collected her departing footsteps"), satisfying the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early: understanding the cavern's compositional process via the timer mechanism. One meaningful tightening occurs when the timer "began to run again—not forward, but in a spiral," reweighting her method from repair to measurement. The piece coheres under the Accumulative lens, and pressure deepens through her weeks-long descent and three notebooks. However, the escalation is observational; no reversal forecloses a live option with immediate cost, and the final act (climbing out) lacks a forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: stone as collaborator, echoes ripening into newness, the timer's spiral as design rather than damage. The closing image—"store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later"—offers a resonant answer to the question of how observation and mystery coexist without resolving into platitude. The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection through the nautilus spiral, seasonal wound, and the marble's compositional patience. Minor weakness: the final phrase "began, slowly, to compose" edges toward on-the-nose thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "locks were just frozen arguments between entry and refusal" and "echoes weren't mere repetitions...they were harvested versions" showcase a perceptual signature rooted in Maren's craft. Diction modulates purposefully—technical precision ("parabolic sweeps," "hairspring") grounds lyric compression ("the veined white throat of the earth"). Psychic distance remains stable; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose sustains its texture under reflective pressure without flattening into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level execution is clean and propulsive: "the season had already begun to wound itself" and "sound moved through it the way light moves through a prism" carry density without overwriting. Sentence structure varies, figurative language is coherent, and no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Minor friction: "studying reflection angles at different times of day" in paragraph five reads slightly expository, and the final clause "and began, slowly, to compose" stacks adverbs where a sharper cut would land harder. Information density is high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—locksmith as acoustic archaeologist, timer as spiral-time instrument, cavern as compositional collaborator—feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "scholar discovers ancient mystery" template through embodied craft detail (oiling gears, replacing hairspring) and the seasonal wound metaphor. Risk-taking in pacing (weeks compressed, no antagonist) heightens thematic coherence. The "harvest of echoes" frame is fresh, though the contemplative closure without decisive rupture keeps the piece just below the boldest originality band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout; her locksmith expertise shapes perception and method (reverse-engineering, oiling gears, replacing hairspring). She makes micro-choices across multiple beats (bringing the timer, mapping angles, repairing mechanism), and her decision to climb out on the frost-break day closes the arc. However, the final choice is timed to seasonal change rather than a protagonist-driven turn that forecloses a competing path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The timer mechanism appears in the opening, drives the middle repair sequence (seized gears, spiral-cracked crystal, hairspring replacement), and shapes the closure ("ticked in her coat pocket, spiraling"). Its specific properties—spiral crack as lens, ticking that intensifies in the cavern—are irreplaceable and causally active across at least three beats. The element is indispensable to both method and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is named early and frames Maren's approach: she discovers echoes "thickened by the stone's memory" and that "the cavern was not just reflecting—it was composing." The concept constrains her method (charting delays, clocking intervals) and charges the final image (marble collecting footsteps to compose). It drives two key beats and contributes to closure, though the phrasing risks label-only use in places.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is signaled early ("learned to listen not to the obvious notes but to the ones that slipped along the periphery") and demonstrated through action: she attends to the timer's faint tick, harmonic drifts, dropped-pebble cascades. The trait enables her discovery that "something was being added" and constrains her method throughout. Visible in at least two beats with tactical consequence, though the cost of this focus is not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is established as her method in paragraph four and drives the middle section: mapping angles, charting delays, parsing intervals. The action is causally necessary—without it, she cannot repair the timer or measure the cavern's process. It shapes at least two major beats and contributes to closure (three notebooks, intervals recorded). However, the action could be replaced with "systematic observation" without deep structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is signaled in paragraph five and demonstrated on the page: morning light at low angle versus afternoon's higher climb, sound and light as "collaborators...following the same geometric laws." The method shapes her mapping work and is causally tied to her discovery. It appears in two beats and supports the closure's emphasis on measurement, though the mechanics are more described than used under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable: its parabolic walls, fissure, and acoustic properties generate the puzzle, supply the resources (stone's memory, echo cascades), and constrain Maren's method (angle-mapping, timer placement). It is present in every beat and charges the final image ("the marble collected her departing footsteps and began, slowly, to compose"). Removing it would collapse the story's logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across the lull of a wounded season"—is signaled early (frost, stunned fields, convalescence) and brackets the action ("those weeks descending," "the first day the frost broke"). It provides atmospheric pressure and a loose deadline, but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat or alter tactics under a live clock. The seasonal arc supports theme and closure participation but remains more poetic frame than functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is articulated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph but dramatized earlier: she brings notebooks, fills three with figures, and is "content with that" even without full understanding. The desire drives her weekly descents and repair work, and the phrasing reweights the closure image. However, the motivation is more reflective frame than conflicted force—no on-page friction tests whether storing wonder competes with solving the puzzle.</comment>
