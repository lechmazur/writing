<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's skepticism-to-permission arc is embodied through her bone-setter's craft, creating a coherent internal trajectory. The "yearning" motive is specific (turning mistakes into constellations) and drives her choice to enter the garden. Minor weakness: the climactic moment ("she chose to believe it") leans slightly toward assertion rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure, but the professional lens (bone-setting as metaphor for accepting fracture) anchors the shift credibly. Britta's "shrewdly innocent" trait functions well as both catalyst and thematic mirror.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal setup → Accumulative/Textural deepening → Conceptual Repricing at closure). Orientation anchors quickly (village bone-setter, post-changeling discovery). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: Maren's choice to listen beneath the oak reweights her skepticism into faith-as-mending-method, with the cost legible in her acceptance of "unverifiable" knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the tooth and understands "certainty was not a wall but a living thing." The garden's impossibility functions as the pressure that forces her stance shift, and the final image (hands on bark, choosing belief) closes the before/after with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The secret garden supplies vivid, purposeful detail (roses in November, stone basin reflecting stars at midday, oak with sea-creature roots) that constrains Maren's worldview and charges the closure. The tooth's tactile wrongness ("a word misspelled so subtly") is specific and affects her next move. The hedge maze functions as both physical and symbolic threshold, and the final oak becomes the site where setting (roots, bark) anchors her climactic choice to listen and believe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the Harrow child and, implicitly, redeeming her own daughter's death—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren finds the tooth and her certainty fractures; this narrows her options from skeptic-observer to active seeker. The cost is visible: she forgoes rational proof and commits to faith-as-method, foreclosing her identity as pure skeptic. Agency is clear in her choice to place hands on the oak and listen, driven by prior causality (yearning, craft metaphor, garden discovery).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (certainty as living, breakable thing; mending through faith) emerges organically from Maren's craft and the garden's impossibility. The tooth and oak roots operate as concrete anchors, not symbols for their own sake. The final image—hands on bark, listening for crying "caught halfway between this world and some luminous, unverifiable other"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question of miracles and forgiveness. The constellation metaphor recurs with earned weight, reframing her grief as navigable pattern. No overt moralizing; the piece trusts particulars to carry the thematic freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; perceptual signature is consistent (bone-setter's tactile attention, e.g., "reading its truth through her fingertips"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the garden, slightly wider in the opening frame). Diction remains within Maren's lexicon; the prose rhythm tightens in the climactic beats. One minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" is told about Britta rather than shown in action, though the dialogue demonstrates her performance. Otherwise, voice control is strong and elision (e.g., the child's fate) is purposeful, holding tension rather than withholding for convenience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean and propulsive, with strong figurative clarity ("roots surfaced and dove like the backs of sea creatures," "roses turned their faces toward her as if remembering some older sun"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or setting. Minor deductions: the opening clause "Maren had always been the kind of woman who doubted miracles but forgave those who believed in them" reads slightly generic and the phrase "luminous, unverifiable other" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated diction that doesn't quite land with earned weight. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and no paraphrase loops appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bone-setter-as-metaphor-for-faith synthesis is fresh and the garden's impossibility is rendered with specific, non-clichéd detail. The piece transforms the changeling trope through Maren's professional lens and her grief. Risk-taking is evident in the choice to leave the child's recovery off-page and anchor closure in Maren's internal shift rather than a rescue. Minor limitation: the premise (skeptic finds wonder in hidden garden) is a familiar template, though the execution personalizes it through craft and loss. The final image is earned and particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's forgiving skepticism is established early and drives the key turn: she forgives herself and chooses belief at the oak. The trait constrains her initial doubt and enables the climactic choice. Present in opening, middle decision (entering the garden), and closure (listening beneath roots). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tooth appears at midpoint, is handled tactilely ("felt the way she felt bones"), and prompts her insight that certainty is breakable. It reappears when she pockets it and begins searching. Present in two beats with causal pressure, but does not return at closure with reweighted meaning. Functional but slightly undercharged at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is the central conceptual stake, signaled via the substitute body discovery and enacted when Maren holds the tooth and understands certainty as "not a wall but a living thing." It shapes her final choice to set the fracture with faith. Present in setup, middle realization, and closure stance. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Britta's "shrewdly innocent" trait is introduced early and motivates her role as confessor and guide. It enables Maren's entry into the garden via the tip. Present in setup and one middle beat (the conversation), but does not return or constrain later action. Causal role in one major beat; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Yearning is established early ("she yearned—not for proof of fairies, but for something she couldn't name") and drives Maren's choice to enter the garden and, at closure, to listen beneath the oak. Present in setup (grief for her daughter), middle (garden entry), and closure (choosing belief). Strong causal pressure and closure participation; visible cost (foreclosing skeptic identity).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bone-setting is Maren's professional identity, signaled immediately and used as metaphor throughout ("the patient art of aligning what had broken so it could heal stronger along the seam"). It shapes her climactic choice to "set" the fracture in her certainty with faith. Present in setup, middle insight (tooth handling), and closure metaphor. Strong thematic and causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret garden is introduced at the one-third mark and supplies the impossible conditions (roses in November, stars at midday) that fracture Maren's certainty. The oak's roots provide the tactile site for her final choice. Present in middle and closure; the setting constrains her worldview and charges the final image. Slight late-entry penalty, but strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" is established in the opening and motivates Maren's urgency to find the real child. Elise's three-day weeping provides temporal anchor. However, the time pressure does not escalate visibly in the garden sequence; the search feels contemplative rather than timed. Present in setup and implicit in middle, but does not tighten tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" is dramatized early (grief for her daughter, desire for restoration) and drives Maren's entry and final choice. The phrase recurs with earned weight in the middle beat ("constellation she had refused to see") and is implicit in the closure choice. Present across setup, middle, and closure with visible friction (yearning vs. skepticism) and cost (accepting faith over proof).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Nostalgic innovation is coherent: the piece balances lyric reverence for fairy-tale elements (hedge maze, changeling tooth, oak hollow) with fresh craft-metaphor grounding. Tone modulates from clinical opening (bone-setter certainties) to wonder in the garden to quiet resolve at closure. The register supports the accumulative deepening and charges the final image without tipping into sentimentality or archness.</comment>
