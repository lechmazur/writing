<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction is embodied: he tends a garden yet knows he cannot save Mara through words ("words were the sharp weapons"). His motivation—to "graft new meaning onto old wounds"—drives the amber-pendant gesture and remains character-particular. Mara's shivering, red-rimmed guarded gaze, and physical clutching of the pendant ground her trauma without label-speak. The closure choice (proffering the pendant) is earned by prior causality and forecloses speech-based resolution with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, abandoned data center, three weeks post-confession) land by ~120 words. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the drip pattern → amber discovery → Mara encounter sequence accumulates density and reweights the dominant stake (Mara's sanctuary versus exposure). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared "honeyed hush" crystallizes as a safe inhabitation with the pendant as anchor; cost is legible in Mara's reliance and Elias's silent vigil. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moss-covered servers, thawing stalactites, and drip-pattern arrow are selective and purpose-driven, constraining Elias's movement and discovery. The amber pendant (fossilized seed, protected vulnerability) charges the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clear: aisles, terminal, "two rows over." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's priorities (wet stone, ozone, sunlight shaft). The setting pressures Mara's hiding and supplies the artifact that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara's sanctuary versus backlash—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the drip pattern leads Elias to the amber, which then enables his non-verbal offer. Agency is renunciation (Elias withholds speech) and endurance (Mara's trembling acceptance), both on-page with felt cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final gesture narrows options (no words, only the pendant). Cost is visible in Mara's clutching and Elias's seated vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—resilience and regrowth after rupture—emerges through the moss devouring servers, the amber seed's "eternal potential," and Elias's grafting metaphor enacted at closure. The pendant offers a non-literal answer: some things endure the thaw. Subtext operates in Elias's silent approach and Mara's guarded acceptance. The final image (Elias beside her, listening to water drip) reweights prior material without stating a moral, balancing quiet resonance with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; his perceptual signature (topographic lichen maps, honeyed hush) is distinct. Diction is lyric but controlled ("watchful dreamer," "sticky quiet"). No dialogue appears; silence is thematized and purposeful. One brief register drift: "eternal potential" reads slightly elevated but remains within Elias's reflective stance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the pendant exchange. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high (each paragraph advances character, setting, or pressure). Minor paraphrase loop: "honeyed hush" recurs three times with slight synonym variation ("sticky quiet," "safe to inhabit"); −0.3 for near-redundancy. One filter-verb cluster in the Mara-discovery paragraph ("knew," "looked up") but not stacked densely enough to disallow 9+ globally. No scaffold or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The post-collapse moss-garden data center and the amber-pendant-as-bridge synthesis feel specific and non-obvious. The "pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" guiding Elias is a fresh causal inflection that grows from setting. Emotional truth (trauma, silent care, tentative trust) avoids generic templates. The story commits fully to its premise (grid down, cameras blind, moss reclaiming metal) without retreat. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band for sustained atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present from the opening and frames the story. His decisions—pruning, redirecting condensation, following the drip pattern, picking up the pendant, approaching Mara, proffering the amber—drive three distinct beats (tending, discovery, offering) and shape the closure. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (chooses silence over speech) +0.9, closure linkage (the pendant offer is the final act) +1.2, specificity (watchful dreamer who tends rather than scavenges) +0.5. Total ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Amber pendant appears mid-story at the terminal, is picked up and examined (embodied: "smooth, fossilized resin warm against his palm"), then proffered to Mara in the closure beat. Two distinct uses: discovery and gift. Early enough (before final third) −0.0, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables the non-verbal offer) +1.0, closure linkage (Mara clutches it, the final image hinges on it) +1.5, specificity (ancient seed, protected vulnerability metaphor) +0.6, cost connection (Mara's acceptance shifts her stance) +0.5. No late penalty. Total ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Honeyed hush is named in the opening paragraph ("stunned, honeyed hush") and returns in the closure ("shared, honeyed hush that felt safe to inhabit"). It shapes Elias's motivation (silence versus words) and reweights the ending. Setup +0.6, lyric reprise (first → last third) that reweights the dominant stake +1.2, thematic charge at closure +0.9, specificity (sticky quiet, safe inhabitation) +0.4. No middle beat development capping applies because the reprise carries cost. Total ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quietly proactive is embodied on-page: Elias prunes the fern, redirects condensation, follows the drip pattern, picks up the pendant, and approaches Mara—all deliberate, non-aggressive actions. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats (tending garden, approaching Mara) +0.9, causal pressure (his proactive care enables the encounter) +0.8, closure linkage (seated vigil is proactive patience) +0.7, cost connection (choosing silence is a tradeoff) +0.4. Swappability nudge −0.2 (could be "gentle" or "careful" with minor edits). Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Proffer occurs in the closure beat: "With a gentle, open-handed gesture, he chose to proffer the amber pendant to her." This act is the final turn; Mara's acceptance shifts her from guarded to anchored. Setup (Elias picks up pendant earlier) +0.5, one beat (the offer) +0.4, causal pressure (non-verbal choice narrows options) +1.2, closure linkage (the proffer is the decisive act) +1.7, specificity (open-handed, no demand) +0.6, cost connection (Elias forgoes speech, Mara accepts dependence) +0.5. No late penalty (prepared by prior pendant discovery). Total ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drip pattern is signaled early (roof breach, thawing stalactites) and its mechanics matter: microscopic fissures create a "shimmering arrow" that points Elias to the terminal where the amber rests. Setup +0.7, one beat (guides discovery) +0.4, causal pressure (without the pattern, no pendant) +1.1, specificity (gravity and erosion logic) +0.5. Missing closure participation (the pattern does not appear in the final image) caps at ~6.0 per gate model; slight elevation for strong causal work. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Abandoned data center turned moss garden is present from the opening, supplies the tactile environment (servers, vines, sleeping bags), and constrains Mara's hiding and Elias's approach. Setup +0.8, three beats (tending, discovery, encounter) +1.4, causal pressure (Mara hides in the rack that stored her identity; the setting enables sanctuary and exposure tension) +1.3, closure linkage (the moss and dripping water frame the final vigil) +1.1, specificity (moss devouring digital history) +0.7. Total ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored ("three weeks since the confession") and colors Mara's backlash flight, but it does not tighten decisions on the page. Setup +0.5, one thematic beat (post-viral context frames Mara's fear) +0.4, no live clock that alters Elias's tactics, no closure participation beyond mood. Swappability −0.5 (could be "two weeks" or "a month" without structural change). Total ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") and enacted: Elias tends the moss, redirects water, and offers the pendant to Mara. Setup +0.7, two beats (tending garden, offering pendant) +0.9, causal pressure (his desire to transform scars drives the non-verbal gesture) +1.1, closure linkage (the grafting metaphor is fulfilled in the final image) +1.0, cost connection (Elias accepts the burden of patient care) +0.4. Slight label-only phrasing in exposition −0.3. Total ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Protected vulnerability is embodied throughout: the amber seed in resin, Mara curled beneath vines, Elias's gentle approach, the "honeyed hush" as safe inhabitation. Tone modulates with pressure (from watchful observation to intimate vigil) and charges the final image (the pendant clutched, the shared silence). Setup +0.6, three beats (amber description, Mara's trembling, closure embrace of vulnerability) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (fragile life shielded by time) +0.6. One static-mood patch in the middle third −0.3. Total ~7.1.</comment>
