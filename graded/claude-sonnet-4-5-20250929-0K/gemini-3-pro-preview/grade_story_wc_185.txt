<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (pressing hands to ears, dragging boots, kneeling). Her mapkeeper expertise drives concrete choices under pressure, and the final slump shows cost. Internal contradiction is present but mild—her desperation versus methodical analysis could push harder against each other in the peak beat. The embodied emotion ("teeth ache," "trembling fingers") grounds her throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Elara achieves "hard-won sanctuary" but the silence is described as "thick and solid…a warm blanket of iron," signaling weight and finality. The causal lens holds—echo chamber stone aligned with ice fissures produces the counter-song. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy beings approach and she executes her plan, narrowing options to this single acoustic gambit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, ice fissures, and echo chamber stone all constrain Elara's final choice—she must be at this precise intersection of stress lines. Sensory details (thin air, ozone stink, misting breath) are filtered through her mapkeeper lens. The subterranean setting provides the necessary acoustic architecture. However, spatial choreography of the energy beings' approach could be sharper; "drifted closer" and "filling the tunnel" lack precise distance markers during the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore silence before mental fracture) is signaled early and tightens when the energy beings sense her bio-rhythm. Agency is clear: Elara's mapkeeper skill and the echo chamber stone are deployed in a single decisive action with visible cost (she slumps, finally resting in "absolute quiet"). The choice to strike at the stress-line intersection is earned by prior expertise. One meaningful escalation—screeching approach to contact—raises cost and narrows options to this moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: mapping peace within chaos, engineering silence through understanding natural structure. The echo chamber stone shifts from "historical curiosity" to "potent weapon," and the final image of "hard-won sanctuary" reweights the opening's "desperate" motivation without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the contrast between the invaders' "jagged lightning" and Elara's methodical tracing of fractures. The piece resists explaining its central question, letting the bloom of hush answer through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (mapkeeper's eye reading fissures as "legible script") is distinct and consistent. Diction remains controlled, though a few phrases ("hammered repose," "sonic fabric") drift slightly elevated for a crisis moment. No head-hopping. The piece teaches its lyric compression early ("screaming static…scoured") and maintains that texture. Filter verbs ("she hoped," "she needed") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the peak beat. However, minor scaffold appears: "It was here…that she hoped" and "It was a grim…sort of peace" repeat the expository "It was" stem within close proximity. "The stone sang, releasing a sound that was not loud, but incredibly dense" could compress. Information density is high in the mapkeeper details. The final image carries momentum without muddle. No loops touch the closure unit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mapkeeper profession and acoustic-weapon concept offer a fresh synthesis; "bloom of hush" as visible counter-frequency is non-obvious. The transformation of geological expertise into tactical weapon feels earned. However, the "energy beings" antagonist reads somewhat generic (neon wire, high-pitched whine). The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through without retreat. Risk is present in the lyric compression and technical specificity, which heighten without obscuring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices (seeking the frozen lake, examining fissures, aligning the stone, striking at the stress-line intersection) drive all major beats and the closure. Setup: paragraph one establishes her as mapkeeper. Development: she reads the ice and identifies the weakness. Payoff: her final action dissolves the invaders. Causal pressure is high; her expertise is irreplaceable. Cost is visible in her slump and the "heavy stillness."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in setup (carried since the first sky-fire), is handled and aligned mid-story, and its activation creates the closure beat. Two distinct uses: she withdraws it, then taps it against the ice. Specificity is high ("fist-sized geode," "hollowed by ancestors," "trap fugitive sounds"). Its luminous glow marks escalation. Removing it would eliminate the weapon and collapse the plot. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "bloom of hush" appears only at the climax as the visible result of the counter-song. Setup and development are absent; the concept is not named or foreshadowed earlier. Payoff is strong: it shapes the final action and dissolves the invaders. Causal role is clear but late arrival (final third) and lack of mid-story use cap the score. The concept does change options decisively at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the echo chamber stone's glow and marks escalation ("flared white" during use). Setup: the stone is described as luminous in paragraph fifteen. Development: the glow intensifies under use. Payoff: it dims after success, signaling completion. However, the trait is more atmospheric than constraining—remove "luminous" and the mechanics still function. One beat involvement, minor causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Conjure" frames Elara's entire tactical approach: she must "conjure a frequency that did not exist in nature," then actively conjures the counter-song through the stone. Setup: the need is named mid-story. Development: she begins to conjure, pulling stored silence. Payoff: the conjured bloom dissolves the invaders. Two beats, high causal pressure, closure-critical. The verb is specific and irreplaceable; swapping for "create" or "generate" would flatten the magical-technical register.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns is signaled early (paragraph eight: "delicate work of examining crack patterns in ice") and drives the method. Setup: she kneels to examine. Development: she traces fissures to identify the weakness and the precise intersection. Payoff: she strikes at that intersection to release the counter-song. Two beats, causal linkage is strong. The mapkeeper skill is irreplaceable. Removing this method collapses her expertise and the plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Harmonic Caves and the frozen subterranean lake provide the necessary acoustic architecture and temperature conditions. Setup: paragraph one establishes the caves. Development: the frozen lake and ice fissures supply the physical medium she reads and strikes. Payoff: the cavern's geometry amplifies the counter-song. The setting constrains tactics (she must go deep, to the coldest point) and enables the final act. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening ("the screeching arrival of the invaders") and tightens when "the energy beings drifted closer." Setup: the invasion is the inciting pressure. Development: her urgency is clear ("before the relentless dissonance fractured her mind"). Payoff: the resolution ends the immediate threat. However, elapsed time is vague and does not function as a live countdown that alters tactics beat-by-beat. One strong involvement, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Her motivation ("to find the quiet in the storm") is named explicitly in paragraph four and dramatized through every choice: seeking the deepest recess, examining fissures, conjuring the counter-song. Setup: motivation stated early. Development: each action pursues silence. Payoff: she achieves "absolute quiet" at visible cost (slumps, finally resting). Friction is present—methodical work versus desperate need. Cost is felt in the "heavy stillness" and her exhaustion. High causal integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears mid-story as the target state ("grim, metallic sort of peace…heavy, final, earned through endurance") and charges the ending's "thick and solid" silence that "pressed against her skin like a warm blanket of iron." Setup: tone is signaled by paragraph twelve. Payoff: the final image embodies it. The tone modulates from desperate urgency to the weighted stillness. However, mid-story development is thin; the phrase does not recur or constrain a choice between its introduction and the ending.</comment>
