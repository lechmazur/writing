<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and embodied—"fingers curling around the cold brass," "eyes fixed on the crowd, adjusting the timing." His motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" drives the action clearly, and the final satisfaction shows change. The reactively visionary trait is demonstrated, not labeled, through his recognition of the void and immediate response. Minor issue: the trait feels slightly expository ("a trait that marked him as reactively visionary") rather than fully dramatized, but it doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through sensory accumulation (wet stone, fog, posture shifts) toward a cadence-shift closure where the steam-horn sequence dissolves tension and reweights the navigated absences into community. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Decisive Change)—the final note and murmur of recognition confirm the transformation with felt cost (Elian's solitary archive work now rewritten as communal act). Cost is visible in "the pause in their history was over" and "satisfied that the fragments had coalesced." One meaningful deepening (the valve installation and staggered sequence) tightens the stake cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is vivid and purposeful: "slick and luminous under a bruised purple sky," "wet ivory stones," fog pushed back by sound. The herald's trumpet valve functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining Elian's choice (without it, the annunciator is mute). The valve's salt-pitted texture and the rusted manifold pressure the climactic beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's professional lens (chemical memories, steam pressure, frequency). The setting charges the final image—sun breaking through, wet stone illuminated—without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: bridge the silence before it hardens into permanent alienation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian sees the "terrifying quiet not as peace, but as a fracture" and runs to the mechanism. The staggered-interval choice (not "one long blast") is a visible tactical decision with immediate consequence—heads lift, shoulders drop. Agency is decision and execution; the cost is legible in the shift from solitary archivist to communal voice-maker. The Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through gathered detail, then releases in the sonic sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the navigated absences (spaces between people as palpable as stone) are addressed by the sonic pattern, which "dissolved the tension." The herald's valve—salvaged from submerged ruins—embodies continuity and repair without stating a moral. The final image (murmur, weeping, coalesced fragments) reweights the opening silence with undeniable emotional cost. No overt thematic statement; the story asks whether fragmented memory can be compiled into meaning and answers through action. The phrase "navigated absences" risks abstraction but is grounded by spatial metaphor and the exiles' embodied huddles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Elian's perceptual signature: "chemical memories trapped in mist," "data points of grief and hope," "frequency required to turn...castaways back into a community." Diction stays consistent—archivist's lens colors perception without corporate jargon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight on valve installation, wider on crowd effect. The phrase "reactively visionary" is the only minor register slip, reading slightly expository. No dialogue on the page. Prose rhythm supports pressure: short bursts during the run, measured cadence during the steam sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances situation or sensory accumulation. Sentence rhythm varies—long accumulative openings, short action beats ("He ran," "It fit with a satisfying...clunk"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold: "a trait that marked him as reactively visionary" tells rather than shows, but it's isolated. Metaphors are controlled ("hesitant ghosts," "islands of intimacy") and coherent. The staggered-interval sequence is clear and propulsive. Opening and closing images anchor and resolve cleanly. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination—ocean-spray archivist, salvaged valve, sonic reintegration—feels specific and non-obvious. The "reactively visionary" frame and "navigated absences" concept risk abstraction but are grounded by concrete action (valve installation, staggered blasts). The story transforms a reunion premise through the lens of archival method and sonic ritual. Emotional specificity (weeping of joy, shifting posture) avoids generic template. The turn from silent fracture to voiced community is earned in hindsight. No close echoes of famous material, though the exile-return trope is familiar; execution lifts it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from paragraph three. His occupation frames his perception ("cataloging chemical memories," "data points") and his choice to act ("compile fragments into meaning") drives the climax. His decision to use staggered intervals rather than one blast is a key tactical choice. The final satisfaction confirms his arc. Appears in setup, middle decision, and closure; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Could the story work with a different occupation? Possibly, but the archivist lens charges the thematic resonance of compilation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced mid-story (paragraph twelve), then handled across three beats: pocket retrieval, installation, operation. Its specific property (completes the circuit, modulates steam) enables the climax. Without it, the annunciator is mute—story logic fails. The valve's salt-pitted history (submerged customs house) links to the exile timeframe. Late setup (−0.3) but strong causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), and irreplaceability (+0.7) push it high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("landscape of navigated absences," "spaces between people") and returned at closure ("dissolving the tension of the navigated absences"). The concept shapes Elian's perception of the problem and his method (sonic pattern to bridge gaps). It's thematic but also tactical—he views the crowd as scattered data requiring a unifying thesis. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting; middle development is weaker (the concept doesn't constrain a mid-scene choice), capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Named explicitly ("reactively visionary; he could never predict...until the void of the moment demanded it") and demonstrated when Elian sees the fracture and immediately acts. The trait enables his recognition and speed but doesn't visibly cost him—no tradeoff shown (e.g., prior failures from reactivity, lost time). Present in setup and climax; causal enabling is moderate. The label-only mention (−0.3) and lack of visible cost keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action "to hearten the weary assembly" is the climax: the sonic sequence lifts heads, drops shoulders, replaces silence with murmur and weeping. The verb choice ("hearten") is specific and the effect is shown, not swapped for generic comfort. It shapes the final image and could not be replaced without losing the story's resolution. Present in closure with strong causal role (+1.6) and closure linkage (+1.4), early framing as the need (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled late (paragraph twenty: "staggered intervals, mimicking the rhythmic...heartbeat") but the mechanics matter immediately—first note low, wait, second higher. The method shapes the outcome: "not...one long blast, which might have sounded like a warning." The staggered pattern is contrasted with an alternative, showing it's not ornamental. Late setup (−0.4) but strong causal pressure (+1.3) and closure linkage (+1.2) elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present from the opening: "slick and luminous...bruised purple sky," "wet ivory stones," fog, lighthouse. The setting supplies the manifold and valve; the acoustic properties (vibration through stone, fog pushed back) affect the outcome. The rain's aftermath creates the silence and the reflective surfaces that amplify the resolution. Setup (+0.6), beat involvement (opening, climax, closing image; +0.9), causal enabling (+0.8), closure charge (+0.9). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled immediately: "the morning after the exile ends," "thirty years lost," "a generation." The timeframe creates the navigated absences and the urgency ("before the silence hardened into permanent alienation"). It doesn't function as a live countdown but establishes the historical pressure that drives Elian's recognition and action. Setup (+0.7), causal framing (+0.7), closure relevance (the history's pause ending; +0.8). Solid integration without ticking-clock mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stated mid-story ("to compile fragments into meaning before the silence hardened") and dramatized through his choice to install the valve and operate it in staggered intervals. The desire is in friction with his prior solitary work ("decades...microscopic and solitary") and the risk of failure (if the valve doesn't hold, if the sequence is wrong). The final satisfaction confirms the motivation paid off. Setup (+0.5), causal pressure (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.6), cost connection (shift from archivist to actor; +0.5).</comment>
