<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to touch time is consistently rendered and embodied through his physical interaction with the bridge. The retrocognitive trap is described but its constraint on present choice remains largely abstract—the floating photographs block vision but don't force meaningful micro-trade-offs until the climax. Internal voice is consistent and vivid, though the final weeping feels slightly told rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The trauma backstory (hospital, funeral, nursery) primes the closure adequately but doesn't tilt present tactics through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 3). Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Elian's theft and weaving cause the geometric trap, which triggers the disintegration closure. The closure—photographs shatter, texture of time is felt—lands on the page with visible cost (trauma remnants dissolved, weeping). One meaningful tightening occurs when he shoves the fragment into the convergence point, narrowing options and delivering the change. The bridge's "quaking reverie" and the disintegration sequence are legible under the lens, though the hyperbolic geometry mechanism arrives late and could constrain earlier tactics more visibly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living bridge is vivid and specific: banyan roots, fog-choked chasm, vines woven into hyperbolic knots. Sensory detail is selective (ozone, petrichor, vibrations rattling teeth) and filtered through Elian's urgency. The bridge's trembling and spatial distortion constrain the climactic act, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography at the convergence point—where exactly he kneels, how the vines wrap the fragment—could be more concrete. Micro-setting (vines, roots, fragment) does functional work at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: escape retrocognitive prison by discovering time's texture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—theft, weaving, fragment insertion—and the cost (shattering trauma images, weeping) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bridge enters "quaking reverie" and the photographs warp under geometric pressure, narrowing options to the final shove. The halo fragment's "holy, dangerous resonance" signals risk, and the disintegration sequence delivers visible consequence. No multiple reversals, but the single deepening suffices for this length under the Hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—confronting trauma through tactile engagement with the present—emerges from action rather than statement. The shift from flat, two-dimensional memories to multi-dimensional present is realized through the hyperbolic geometry conceit and the final sensory contact with time's "coarse, braided bark." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: time is not smooth water but woven moments, grounding Elian in "the tangible, quaking beauty of the absolute present." The motif of flat versus dimensional space constrains the climax and reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elian's perception. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and voice-particular ("bleach-spotted memory," "sepia haze," "guttural cry"), though some phrases verge on ornamental ("colossal structure woven from the still-growing roots of ancient banyan trees"). Under peak stress, compression is acceptable, but the final paragraph's "tangible, quaking beauty of the absolute present" edges toward thematic echo. Perceptual signature—spatial designer parsing geometry—is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propels through the weaving sequence. Information density is high in the climax (geometry, fragment, disintegration). However, the opening paragraph carries scaffold: "colossal structure woven from the still-growing roots of ancient banyan trees that spanned a fog-choked chasm" stacks modifiers without urgency. The phrase "floating, translucent rectangles that resembled fading photographs" is repeated conceptually ("two-dimensional prisons," "flat images," "sepia haze") across the first third, creating synonym churn. The final beat—"tangible, quaking beauty of the absolute present"—is elevated but legible. No major loops in the climax, but early density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognitive trap, hyperbolic geometry, and halo fragment is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of trauma through spatial rather than temporal logic is a fresh angle on memory-haunting. However, the "designer confronts his own labyrinth" premise is a familiar template, and the hyperbolic geometry conceit arrives late without middle-beat use, reducing its irreplaceability. The final image—time as braided bark—is memorable and particular. Risk-taking in the geometry and disintegration sequence elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian's profession as hedge maze designer is signaled early and frames his approach to the problem (weaving a botanical trap). His choice to steal the fragment and his weaving action create the key turns at closure. However, the maze-design expertise doesn't constrain middle tactics—he could be any desperate protagonist with botanical knowledge. Present in setup, drives closure action, but not indispensable across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in three beats: withdrawn from satchel, woven into vines, shoved into convergence point. Its "holy, dangerous resonance" and luminescence enable the disintegration by cutting through the sepia haze. The fragment's specific properties (stark white light, humming resonance) matter causally and charge the closure. Removing it would break the story's logic. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fading photographs shape stakes throughout: they obstruct Elian's vision, block depth perception, and constitute the prison he must escape. The geometric trap is designed specifically to shatter them by creating dimensional expansion they cannot survive. The disintegration of photographs is the climactic action and visual proof of success. The concept constrains tactics (he must build a trap for two-dimensional objects) and delivers the closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap is established early and explains the photographs' presence. It motivates Elian's quest and frames the story's stakes. However, the trap itself doesn't constrain on-page choices—it's a static condition rather than a dynamic trade-off. The story could function with "haunted by traumatic visions" without the retrocognitive label. Present across setup and motivation, but swappable for a near-synonym with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Disintegration is the climactic event: photographs shatter into gray dust, memories dissolve, and the void fills with vivid color. The action is the direct result of the hyperbolic knot and fragment convergence, and it delivers the closure by freeing Elian into the present. Removing it would collapse the story's resolution. Shapes the ending decisively with visible consequence and cost (trauma remnants gone, weeping release).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled at setup ("laws of hyperbolic geometry rather than standard growth") and explained during the weaving ("exponential saddle shapes and negative curves"). Its mechanics—creating more space than physically allowed—enable the disintegration by generating dimensional pressure. However, it appears primarily in one extended beat and doesn't constrain earlier attempts or tactics. Causal at closure but not developed across beats; swappable for another exotic spatial method with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is present from the title and opening line. Its "still-growing roots," vines, and trembling responsiveness supply the material Elian weaves and the spatial anchor for the climax. The bridge's "quaking reverie" is the physical manifestation of success and charges the final image. The setting's properties (supple glowing tendrils, thick vines) enable the hyperbolic weaving. Removing it would require a different substrate and closure image. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to discover time's texture is stated early and drives every action: theft, weaving, fragment insertion. Elian's belief that time is "tactile architecture" shapes his method. The final beat—reaching out to feel time's "grainy, warm" texture—is the direct payoff. The motivation is conflicted (desperation vs. hope) and embodied in his actions. Strong causal linkage to closure, though the friction between desire and cost could be sharpened in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Quaking reverie is embodied in the bridge's trembling, the "euphoric dizziness," and the atmosphere thickening with ozone. Tone modulates from desperate focus during weaving to awe at the disintegration to grounded weeping at closure. The "shivering of a waking god" image and "quaking beauty" reprise charge the final beat. Coherent through turns and tied to the bridge's physical state. Could be more distinct from generic mystical-wonder tone, but it supports pressure and the ending image.</comment>
