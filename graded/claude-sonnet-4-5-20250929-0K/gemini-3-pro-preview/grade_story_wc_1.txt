<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-specific (glass artist perceiving through temperature and form), with micro-choices that reveal her adaptation from aesthetic to survival mode. The internal contradiction between fear and the need to understand is embodied through her trembling hands and her waiting for the right viscosity moment. However, key emotional shifts rely on slightly elevated diction ("hyper-aware survival mechanism," "deepest motivation") that edges toward telling rather than pure embodiment. The final resolve feels earned but the journey leans on reflective summary in places where a sharper micro-choice might have charged the closure beat more.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Elara discovers the frost-free tracks and begins walking with visible cost (three days of cold, bruised fingers, the destroyed workshop). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—sensory particulars and the temperature-memory concept deepen until the final image reweights her stance from paralysis to purposeful pursuit. Orientation is clear early (canyon, after arson, night to dawn). One meaningful tightening occurs when the frost reveals the invisible tracks, narrowing her options from blind flight to guided pursuit. The cost is legible but slightly abstract; pointing to "bruised fingers" and "stiff joints" provides felt consequence, yet the story could sharpen the moment of forfeiture (what she gives up by following this path) for a stronger 8+ claim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the hard stone hides tracks, forcing Elara to wait for thermal revelation; the canyon's acoustic properties and temperature gradient are plot-active. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her glass-artist lens (molten silica, viscosity, ambient thermal layers). The frost patterns and residual wheel-heat function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single-scene window. The canyon does more than frame—it supplies the method of discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is survival and understanding the smugglers' route, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: waiting for dawn to reveal the thermal tracks narrows her options from paralysis to purposeful pursuit. Agency is renunciation of blind flight and endurance through the coldest hours, with visible cost (cold, stiff joints, three days of shock). The escalation is textural—accumulating sensory pressure and conceptual depth—rather than multiple reversals, which fits the inferred Accumulative lens. However, the peak choice (to follow the tracks) feels inevitable once revealed rather than a trade-off between competing goods, limiting the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—invisible heat as testimony, purpose in pauses, adaptive perception—emerges organically from the glass-artist lens and the frost revelation. The final image (walking beside frost-free lines, "glass hardening into its final, unbreakable form") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the drifting wind and temperature metaphors. The "scorched testament" concept integrates cleanly. Minor deduction: "deepest motivation was to discover purpose in the pauses" edges toward thematic echo, though the surrounding particulars mostly earn it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (glass artist noticing temperature, viscosity, thermal layers). Diction is controlled and mostly character-specific. However, elevated phrases—"hyper-aware survival mechanism," "drifting resonance," "fragile timeframe"—slightly drift from the immediate sensory register under peak stress. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating toward the frost discovery. The prose stays within Elara's lexicon except for the occasional abstract noun cluster that reads slightly externalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with strong information density and varied syntax. Overwriting appears in clusters: "profound darkness felt like a different element entirely," "drifting resonance of the wind...a low and mournful vibration," "deepest curve of the night," and the stacked metaphors in the final paragraph ("ghostly tracks," "guiding hum," "glass hardening"). These figurative layers in high-pressure beats blur clarity slightly (−0.5). "Steadily adaptive" and "fragile timeframe" read as slightly elevated for the moment. No loops or scaffold, but the density of metaphor in the closure run limits propulsion. Clarity remains high overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The thermal-memory method (frost revealing wagon-wheel heat) is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that grows from Elara's glass-artist expertise. The emotional arc (aesthetic to survival perception) and the scorched-ledger motivation are grounded in lived detail. The combination feels organic rather than checklist-driven. Risk-taking in the sensory-science method elevates the piece. Minor deduction: the survival-after-arson frame and the "following tracks" structure are familiar; transformation rests heavily on the frost-reveal method rather than a fresh emotional calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's choice to wait through the night and then follow the tracks drives the closure. Her glass-artist perception enables the thermal discovery (viscosity analogy, temperature awareness). She appears in all three gates (setup, middle waiting, ending walk) and her decisions constrain the arc. However, much of the story is reflective observation; the peak choice (to follow) feels enabled by discovery rather than trading competing costs, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ledger strip is present in setup (lap, bruised fingers) and closure ("clutching," "seemed to vibrate in sympathy"), establishing an early-final reprise. It signals the smuggling plot and links "charcoal" to the "scorched testament." However, it is never handled in a second distinct beat or used to alter a choice mid-story. The lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks causal pressure in the middle, placing it in the functional-but-limited band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" shapes the dominant stake (the ledger as evidence, the arson as betrayal) and charges the closure image ("scorched testament...seemed to vibrate in sympathy with the path"). It appears in setup and ending, and the burnt-paper/thermal-memory link is causally active. However, the phrase itself is more thematic label than on-page constraint; the ledger drives plot, but "scorched testament" as concept does not alter a middle choice. One strong reprise pushes it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is demonstrated on-page: Elara's perception shifts from aesthetic to survival, she waits for the right thermal moment (glass-cooling analogy), and she adapts her tracking method to the canyon's properties. The trait enables the frost discovery and costs her three cold nights of waiting. Present across all three gates with visible trade-off (endurance vs. flight). The phrasing "steadily adaptive" in narration is slightly label-heavy, but the trait's mechanics are embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Retrace" is the central action: Elara's goal is to follow the smugglers' route, and the entire arc builds to the frost-track discovery that makes retracing possible. It drives the middle escalation (waiting for the reveal) and the closure (beginning to walk the path). The action is irreplaceable—removing "retrace" collapses the plot. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The trait could constrain more mid-story choices to push higher, but it is essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frost-pattern method is seeded early ("everything held a memory of temperature"), developed in the waiting beat ("delicate crystallization of water vapor"), and executed at closure (frost revealing the heat-free lines). It enables the discovery, constrains Elara's timing (must wait for dawn cold), and charges the final image. The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally active across all three gates. Visible cost: three nights of cold waiting. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon provides the hard stone (no tracks), acoustic resonance (bottle-like wind), and thermal gradient necessary for the frost method. It constrains Elara's tactics (can't run, must wait) and supplies the discovery mechanism. Present in setup, middle waiting, and closure walk. The setting is causally active and shapes multiple beats. However, much of the canyon description is atmospheric rather than decision-forcing, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt on her life" frames the survival stakes and the three-day recovery period tightens her physical state (cold, bruised, stiff). The timeframe is present in setup ("last three days," "fragile timeframe") and closure (dawn walk). However, it does not create a live countdown or force a mid-story choice; the timing is more about enabling the frost discovery than constraining tactics. Functional across two gates but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is the stated motivation and demonstrated through her choice to wait for the frost rather than flee. The desire is conflicted (fear vs. understanding) and drives the closure choice to follow the tracks. Present in setup and ending with visible cost (cold endurance). However, the phrasing leans abstract and slightly label-heavy ("deepest motivation was to discover purpose"), and the friction between wants and costs could be sharper in a middle beat to elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears in the wind description (twice: "drifting resonance...mournful vibration," then "grew louder...guiding hum") and modulates from mournful to guiding as Elara's stance shifts. The tone is coherent through the waiting arc and charges the final image. However, much of the tone is established through atmospheric description rather than dynamic pressure shifts, and the label "drifting resonance" itself is slightly externalized. Purposeful reprise with thematic reweighting lands it in mid-band.</comment>
