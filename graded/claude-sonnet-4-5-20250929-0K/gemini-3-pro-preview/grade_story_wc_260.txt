<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly dramatized through contradictory impulses—her desire to chase Julian versus the immediate need to save the chameleon. Internal conflict is embodied through trembling hands and the specific work of debriding tissue, not summarized. The parallel shedding (creature's poisoned skin / her naivety) risks schematic neatness but remains grounded in surgical action. Micro-choices under pressure (picking up the scalpel, hushing the animal, excising layers) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Elara, roofless workshop, post-con night). The dominant stake—saving the chameleon while processing betrayal—tightens through the surgical sequence and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she retains compassion as discipline, not weakness, foreclosing naive trust with visible cost. Drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative accent (the shedding metaphor deepens), held cleanly to closure. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length; cost is felt on the page in the final paragraph's stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The roofless workshop, silver mist, and starlight are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's professional attention (moss-glowing walls, galaxy of dust motes). The slate table and scalpel constrain the surgical choice; the chameleon's color shifts (stressed brown to teal to leafy green) function as embodied feedback that alters her tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting charges the final image (starlight gathering in the wound, mist cooling her brow). Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) satisfies the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—balancing self-respect (justice for Julian) against immediate compassion (saving the creature)—is signaled early and tested in each surgical beat. The chameleon's violent teal scream and the hiss that "pulled her back" provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Agency is clear: Elara chooses surgery over pursuit, incises dead tissue, and the creature's tail-wrap at closure reweights trust with felt cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the inferred lens; the cost (lost naivety, shortened tail) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (compassion as discipline, not weakness) emerges through the surgical act and the parallel shedding metaphor. The final image—chameleon's tail-wrap mirroring internal reconstruction—offers a resonant answer without stated moral. However, "true compassion was not a weakness to be exploited, but a discipline to be honed" edges toward thematic statement in the penultimate beat, reducing subtextual charge by ~0.3. The piece invites reflection through particulars (necrotic gray, silver grace, leafy green) but the articulation hovers near explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Elara's perceptual signature (handler vocabulary, focused attention on scales and color). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming into "infinite care" during surgery, pulling back for reflection). The dialogue fragment ("I know... He hurt us both") is natural and goal-driven, merging with ambient hum. Minor voice convergence in the reflection on "discipline to be honed" slightly dulls the POV-particular texture, but overall control under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflective passages), information density is high, and clarity holds through surgical sequence. However, "the beat of a heart or the rustle of scales," "a galaxy of dust motes," "sympathetic shedding within her own psyche," and "silver grace" stack figurative language in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching, triggering ~−0.4 for density. "The atmosphere held a shimmering stillness" and later "the heavy silence" risk gentle redundancy. No loops or scaffold; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The parallel shedding (literal surgical debridement / metaphorical loss of naivety) is a specific synthesis that organically fuses character, action, and theme. However, the "con artist dupes idealist" frame and the "healer's epiphany through wound care" read as recognizable templates. The magical-realism inflection (regenerating fauna, starlight sealing) adds texture but does not fully escape derivative structure. One fresh inflection: the chameleon's tail-wrap as renewed faith gesture, earned by prior surgical particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession directly enables the surgical choice and shapes her perceptual filter (coaxing basilisks, reading color shifts). Her decision to stay and operate rather than chase Julian is the story's first major turn, and her surgical skill drives the climax. The "gentle handler" trait is tested and redefined at closure ("steadier now, weighted by knowledge").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chameleon's tail tip appears in beat one (dull necrotic gray), is surgically debrided in beats two and three (flaking parchment, raw pink dermis, calcified shell dropping), and returns at closure (healed, slightly shorter, wrapping her wrist as gesture of renewed faith). Removing this exact object would collapse the surgery, the shedding metaphor, and the trust-reconstruction arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fragile convictions shape the opening stake ("bedrock of trust... easily shattered") and the middle reflection ("could not afford to become cynical... could no longer afford to be blind"). The concept reweights options in the choice to stay rather than pursue Julian. However, it is more dramatized in reflection than in conflicting micro-choices; the surgical action serves compassion more than testing the conviction itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" is rendered on the page through the "shimmering stillness," moss glow, dust motes, and the mist's ambient vibration. The tone anchors Elara's calm under pressure and charges the final image (starlight, silver grace). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it enhances atmosphere without altering tactics. Present across beats but remains primarily textural.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" is signaled early ("she had to reconstruct the animal's health starting from the extremity") and drives the entire surgical sequence: incising, peeling, dropping the calcified shell, witnessing regeneration. The internal arc (reconstructing her own faith) mirrors the physical act. Swapping "reconstruct" for "repair" or "heal" would weaken the shedding metaphor and the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By shedding layers" is introduced in paragraph three ("peeling away the lie to find the healthy flesh beneath"), enacted in beats four and five (incising gray skin that "flaked away like old parchment," peeling back to raw dermis, dropping the calcified shell), and echoed at closure ("naivety... falling away"). The method shapes both the physical surgery and the psychological arc, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The misty workshop under stars provides vivid atmospheric detail (no roof, silver mist mingling with starlight, moss-glowing walls, nebula overhead) and anchors the final image ("starlight seemed to gather in the wound," "mist swirled closer"). However, it does not constrain Elara's choice or supply a tactical resource; the surgery could occur in any workshop. The setting charges tone and closure but does not alter stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the con is revealed" frames the opening situation (Julian gone, credits and counterfeit serum taken) and eliminates the pursuit option, narrowing the choice to immediate surgery. The timeframe is present in the first paragraph but does not impose a ticking clock or escalate during the surgical sequence. It sets up the stake without tightening tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to balance self-respect (which "screamed for justice") and compassion (the "immediate, tender" need to save life) is dramatized in the opening choice to stay rather than chase Julian. The friction recurs in beat four ("He hurt us both") and is resolved at closure ("she had retained her purpose... lost her money and pride, but... failed to take her softness"). The competing wants create visible cost and drive the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Shimmering stillness" is established in paragraph three ("the atmosphere held a shimmering stillness, the kind of quiet that amplifies the beat of a heart"), sustained through the surgical sequence (hushed voice merging with mist, "heavy silence" after tool-down), and charges the final image ("quiet, vivid glow of the nebula"). Tone modulates subtly with the chameleon's color shifts (stressed teal, contented green) and supports closure without imposing cost.</comment>
