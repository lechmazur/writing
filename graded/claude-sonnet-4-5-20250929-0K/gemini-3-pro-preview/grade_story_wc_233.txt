<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Isolde's disenchantment and dream-driven motive are clear, and her choice to climb despite danger reflects consistent traits. The final shift—from disenchanted queen to guardian—is signaled but feels slightly abrupt; the transition from touching fire to closing eyes and waiting lacks a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Valerius serves as presence and minor opposition but remains functional. Interiority is present ("the mystery solved") but leans toward summary rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who, where, and when early (Queen Isolde climbing the Spire, post-warning bell). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds through bleeding starlight and ember grotto, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Isolde becomes guardian, the fireflies shield, and she waits out the storm. Cost is felt (she leaves her kingdom, sheds her crown identity) but the final "mystery solved, ready to wait" edges toward summary rather than a charged image that makes the price undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto, bleeding starlight, ember geode, and freezing limestone create a vivid, specific setting that pressures every move. Spatial choreography is clear (ledge, slippery floor, final steps to the geode). The fireflies emerging from the ember grotto constrain the climax (biological light repelling cosmic corruption) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (freezing grip, sizzling drops, radiant heat). Minor note: "lacy menace" and "lace-like patterns of nothingness" echo without fresh reweighting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unraveling the recurring dream mystery—is signaled early and drives Isolde's climb. Escalation reads through accumulative pressure: dangerous ascent, dodging caustic starlight, reaching the ember grotto. The fireflies' arrival shifts the situation, but Isolde's agency in that turn is passive (they form the shield; she realizes). The final act—sitting and waiting—feels more like endurance than a decision that forecloses a path with visible trade-off. Time and exhaustion constrain tactics (Valerius catches her), but the peak lacks a choice that narrows options with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship versus hollow rule emerges from Isolde's arc and the fireflies-as-seasonal-shield image. The bleeding starlight and ember grotto operate as charged particulars rather than allegory. The ending offers a resonant answer—"no longer a queen of a stone castle, but the guardian of this fragile, burning spark"—but the phrase "the mystery solved" and "ready to wait" summarize theme rather than dramatizing it through a final image that reweights prior material without statement. Subtext operates in Isolde's disenchantment and Valerius's fear, though much is directly articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Isolde as focalizer. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature reflects her disenchantment ("hollow weight," "color") and elevated diction ("viscous light," "lacy menace"). Valerius's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor issue: "the mystery solved" in Isolde's interiority reads slightly over-articulated for peak pressure; a more oblique realization would sharpen voice. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between climb and grotto. No head-hopping or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled with strong figurative language ("sky weeping viscous light," "daggers of light," "ribcage of blue ice"). Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. Minor issues: "lacy menace" (opening) and "lace-like patterns of nothingness" echo without progression; "the mystery solved" is slightly scaffolding; "spotting the first fireflies of summer" as a Method appears only once in the closure beat without prior setup or dramatized mechanics, reading somewhat ornamental. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, but elevated register persists uniformly under stress without vocal modulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of bleeding starlight, ember grotto, and fireflies as biological shield offers a fresh synthesis. Isolde's arc from disenchanted queen to seasonal guardian avoids stock redemption. The physicalized cosmic threat (starlight as caustic liquid) is vivid and specific. However, the fireflies-as-solution arrives late without prior cueing, and the "first fireflies of summer" as seasonal metaphor feels slightly imported rather than inevitable from prior particulars. The ending's insight—"the season protects itself"—is articulated rather than embodied in a final image that reweights without summary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Isolde is present throughout and makes the key choice to climb and reach the ember grotto. Her disenchantment drives the quest. However, at closure she is more witness than agent: the fireflies act, she realizes and sits. The decision to "wait out the storm" is endurance rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost tied to her queenship.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto is seeded early ("faint contrasting warmth"), drives the middle beat (the dangerous crossing to reach it), and anchors closure (Isolde sits within it, the fireflies emerge from its heat). It provides the sanctuary and biological catalyst. Removing it breaks the story's logic. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is the central hazard and cosmic premise. It appears early (Isolde's dreams, then the grotto ceiling), shapes stakes (the deluge threatens annihilation), and constrains tactics (dodging drops). At closure the fireflies repel it, and Isolde waits for "the stars to heal their wounds." It charges the final image and is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is illustrated once in dialogue ("Then we have no time to waste on fear, Valerius") and echoed in the final phrase ("stubborn, quiet command"). It does not constrain a choice or create visible trade-off. The attribute is present but largely label-only, not driving a beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire narrative: opening ascent, cresting the precipice, crossing the grotto floor, stumbling near the ember formation. It creates the journey's pressure and places Isolde at the site of closure. Removing the climb would require a fundamental rewrite. Strong causal role across multiple beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears only in the closure beat without prior setup or mechanical groundwork. It is the moment of tension-break and metaphor (seasonal transition), but the fireflies themselves do the work; the exhale is a reaction. Functional but late, and the specific method (shared exhale) does not constrain or enable prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is the story's arena: ceiling of bleeding stars, sizzling floor, slippery surface, and the ember geode within. It pressures every move, supplies the ember sanctuary and firefly habitat, and anchors the closure image. Spatial specifics (narrow ledge, far end of the ridge, blue crystal) guide choreography. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the final warning bell tolled hours ago; the firmament is already unstable" signals urgency early. Time pressure is mentioned ("no time to waste on fear") and the deluge is imminent. However, elapsed time is not tracked beat-to-beat, and the clock does not visibly tighten a mid-story choice. It frames the stakes but does not alter tactics on the page in a second beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—unraveling recurring dream mystery—is stated early and drives Isolde's climb and her focus on the ember grotto ("This was the object she had seen every night"). At closure she realizes the dreams were "a call to steward the transition." The motivation is dramatized through her goal-directed action, though the final articulation ("the mystery solved") leans toward summary. Solid integration with setup, development, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is introduced in the opening (wind "whispered with a lacy menace") and echoed in the grotto ("lace-like patterns of nothingness" where starlight dissolves stone). The tone persists coherently: beautiful and deadly, delicate and annihilating. It charges the final image ("The menace remained overhead, delicate and deadly"). Tone modulates appropriately with pressure and supports the thematic texture of fragile, burning life against cosmic threat.</comment>
