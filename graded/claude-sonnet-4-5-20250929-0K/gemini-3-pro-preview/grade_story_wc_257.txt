<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "teach withering to bloom again" is clear and his craft process is well-detailed, but his interiority remains largely static—subdued ardor described once rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. The woman's transformation at the end feels observed rather than earned through her own micro-choices; she arrives broken and leaves straightened by Elias's alchemy, not her own agency. Embodied emotion is present in "her voice dry as dead leaves" and "clutching it as though it contained her own heartbeat," but the therapeutic framing ("trapped behind the curtains of intention") edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient complication. The protagonist-as-facilitator design limits internal conflict visibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (Timeless Observatory), and when (after rock bottom) cleanly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vellum stencil accrues pressure through handling (exam, press, setting, illumination) and the final projected image reweights the woman's "curtains of intention" with visible emotional cost (her gasp, straightening shoulders). One meaningful deepening occurs when the match-flame projects the holographic lilies, crystallizing intent into externalized image. However, the woman's transformation is more witnessed than causally earned by her own on-page choice, weakening agency at closure and capping the band slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Timeless Observatory is vividly anchored: "golden twilight that never darkened," "celestial charts on the ceiling remained static," "glass-walled sanctuary...miles beneath his feet." The charcoal-stained fingers, brass press with "low, thrumming vibration," and oxidized silver band supply tactile, tool-based micro-setting. The vellum stencil's purple hectograph ink and the match-flame illumination charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion. Minor penalty: the origami raven's mechanics (updraft spiral, coordinate delivery) are described but spatial choreography of its journey and the woman's arrival lacks intermediate anchoring—she simply "entered" days or hours later without transition grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks to resurrect the woman's withered state through his craft. One meaningful tightening occurs when the flame illuminates the vellum within the synthetic diamond, projecting the tattoo she "couldn't make permanent" onto her chest—a charged reversal of intention into externalized reality. The woman's agency is limited; she presents the problem and receives the solution, with Elias driving all tactical moves (press, setting, illumination). The cost is visible in her emotional shift (gasp, straightening), but it's delivered *to* her rather than paid *by* her in a choice that forecloses a path, keeping the score in mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "curtains of intention" concept emerges organically from Elias's diagnosis and the vellum stencil's nature—a transfer intended for skin but never applied. The synthetic diamond as "a lie made of truth, a pristine construct built from messy ruin" offers a concrete, non-obvious thematic vehicle. The final holographic projection answers the central question (can unrealized intent be resurrected?) without stating a moral, and the woman's straightening posture embodies the shift from withering to bloom. The piece resists tidy resolution—Elias notes "the ash remained dead" even as "the woman had begun, slowly, to live"—embracing complexity. Minor dock: Elias's articulation "You are trapped behind the curtains of intention" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias with controlled distance; the woman's interiority is accessed only through visible cues (trembling hands, dry voice, gasp). Diction is elevated and consistent: "subdued ardor," "peculiar alchemy," "manufactured perfection that nature could never achieve." Dialogue is spare and purposeful; Elias's exposition about the synthetic diamond and the woman's whispered confession both advance plot and reveal character. Minor penalty: "Days or perhaps merely hours later—time was fluid here" is a narrator intrusion that asserts timelessness without anchoring the effect in Elias's perception, risking a brief distance slip. The perceptual signature is strong in Elias's craft-focused noticing (charcoal stains, magnifying loupes, prisms).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance craft, character, or atmosphere. The brass press "hummed with a low, thrumming vibration" and the "holographic phantom of the lilies" are vivid, specific images. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "He had retreated...after hitting rock bottom, a collapse so total that the world below had ceased to hold any gravity" restates the same concept across two clauses; "Days or perhaps merely hours later—time was fluid here—the heavy iron door creaked open" uses meta-commentary to skip transition work. The phrase "a lie made of truth, a pristine construct built from messy ruin" stacks near-synonymous clauses. Rhythm varies well in the final beat, but earlier passages lean on longer periodic sentences without sufficient syntactic contrast. Applying patterned-artifact baseline: −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of mourning jewelry made from ash-compressed synthetic diamonds and the projection of an un-inked tattoo stencil through the gem's prisms offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The "curtains of intention" frame and the Timeless Observatory setting transform familiar grief-craft tropes through specific world logic and spatial particularity. The piece commits fully to its premise—Elias's method is detailed, the woman's problem is embodied, and the resolution grows from prior elements. Minor friction: the "timeless" observatory and origami-coordinate delivery system hint at fantasy conventions (healer-in-tower, magical summons) without fully grounding their rules or limitations, leaving some soft spots in world integrity. The ending's inevitability in hindsight is strong.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (mourning jewelry maker) drives all key beats: he folds and releases the origami raven, diagnoses the woman's problem, compresses the ash, sets the stone, and strikes the match to illuminate. His choices directly shape the narrative arc and the woman's transformation. Early signal in paragraph one; causally active across press, setting, and illumination beats; closure participation via the match-flame action. Cost is less visible for Elias himself (his "quiet, burning satisfaction" suggests fulfillment rather than sacrifice), but his agency creates the turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum is introduced in beat two (woman unfurls it), examined by Elias ("purple hectograph ink depicting a wreath of lilies"), placed beneath the gem during setting, and reweighted at closure when the match-flame projects its image onto her chest. Handles in three distinct beats; the purple ink's refraction through the synthetic diamond is irreplaceable—swap the vellum for another medium and the holographic effect breaks. Cost linkage: the woman's inability to make the tattoo permanent is the problem the stencil embodies and the projection resolves.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is articulated by Elias mid-story and shapes the thematic stakes: the gap between what the woman "meant to do and what actually happened" is named as the source of her withering. The stencil and synthetic diamond literalize this concept—intent frozen in vellum, resurrected through manufactured gem. However, the concept operates more as diagnosis and theme than as an on-page constraint that alters tactics. The woman does not wrestle with "curtains" through her own choices; Elias names and solves it. Functional and thematically integrated, but not tactically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is signaled when Elias explains the synthetic diamond: "a terrifying, manufactured perfection that nature could never achieve on its own...a lie made of truth." This attribute enables the holographic projection—natural diamond structure might not refract the purple ink with the same precision. The trait constrains Elias's method (he must compress ash into synthetic diamond rather than encasing it in glass or resin) and charges the thematic opposition between messy ruin and pristine construct. Present in setup and explanation; causal at closure when the gem's artificial perfection projects the image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The illuminate action (Elias strikes a match and brings flame close to the jewel) is the story's climactic beat: it projects the holographic lilies onto the woman's chest and triggers her transformation. Setup appears in "The final step remained"; the action itself redefines the woman's options from withered to blooming. Swap "illuminate" for "present the ring" or "place it on her finger" and the holographic projection—core to the closure effect—vanishes. Irreplaceable and causally decisive at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method (leaving origami figures with coordinates inside) is demonstrated in beat one: Elias folds a black-paper raven, tucks a slip with latitude/longitude into its wing, and releases it "into the updraft...toward the specific heartache." The woman's arrival "days or perhaps merely hours later" implies the method worked, but we do not see her find the raven or choose to follow the coordinates. The method shapes Elias's outreach tactic and frames his role as summoner, but its mechanics do not constrain middle beats or return at closure. Early signal, single beat, no closure participation: mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The Timeless Observatory is anchored early ("high, glass-walled sanctuary," "celestial charts on the ceiling remained static," "golden twilight that never darkened") and supplies atmospheric charge. The "open embrasure" and updraft enable the origami raven's release; the workbench, magnifying loupes, and brass press provide craft-space resources. The setting's "timeless" quality mirrors Elias's role and the woman's suspended grief. However, the observatory does not constrain a key choice—Elias could perform his craft elsewhere with minor edits—and spatial layout (iron door, embrasure, workbench relative positions) remains soft. Strong atmospheric integration, moderate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" anchors Elias's backstory motivation in paragraph one, establishing the timeframe as post-collapse recovery. However, the phrase functions as exposition rather than a live pressure: no on-page clock tightens decisions, and "time was fluid here" explicitly removes temporal urgency. The woman's arrival is vague ("days or perhaps merely hours later"), and the transformation sequence (ash compression, setting, illumination) carries no time constraint. Present as context, absent as tactical force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is signaled in paragraph one and dramatized across all major beats: summoning via origami, diagnosing the woman's "curtains of intention," compressing ash into synthetic diamond, and illuminating the jewel to project the tattoo. The motivation drives his craft choices and shapes the woman's arc from "folded inward" to "shoulders straightening." Cost is present in his "subdued ardor that burned quietly beneath his ribs" and the knowledge that "the ash remained dead" even as life returns. Motivation is active, conflicted (resurrection of the dead is impossible; he offers symbolic repair), and causally tied to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is established in paragraph one ("a form of resurrection, performed with a subdued ardor that burned quietly beneath his ribs") and maintained through Elias's "focused intensity," controlled craft moves, and the woman's muted entrance ("her presence dim and folded inward"). The tone modulates slightly at closure when the woman gasps and straightens—a quiet but felt shift from withering to nascent bloom. Diction ("gray sprawl," "dry as dead leaves," "trembling and beautiful") supports the tone consistently. The tone charges the final image without breaking into sentimentality or melodrama, satisfying coherence and modulation tests.</comment>
