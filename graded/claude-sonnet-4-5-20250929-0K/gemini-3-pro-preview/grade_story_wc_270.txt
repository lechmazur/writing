<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she intends to resurrect the world against Council stagnation—but her interior life remains thin. The "cursed" telepathy with plants is label-only until the moss warns her; no contradictory impulses or genuine doubt appear, leaving her competent but flat. The final triumph gesture reads as declared rather than earned through visible internal cost or foreclosed paths. Embodied emotion is sparse; the trembling fingers are the sole physical marker of stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and hold. The drive lens reads as Causal: Elara's decoding enables the unsealing, which triggers the embryo's activation. However, closure lacks visible cost—she raises her hands "in triumph" with no on-page price paid or option foreclosed; the guards' arrival feels like setup for off-page consequence rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration legible in the final image. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Elara has lost or must now endure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs constrain Elara's timeline (patrols closing in, boiling water as catalyst) and supply the unsealing mechanism. Sensory detail is vivid—"sulfurous steam," "crimson moss," "scalding pool"—and filtered through urgency. The final image (kaleidoscope irises, calculating soil pH) charges the setting's rebirth promise. Micro-setting (boiling water, obsidian rocks, moss) actively shapes the unsealing choice, meeting the 9+ gate, but spatial choreography of the descending guards is vague, capping the score at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unseal the embryo to resurrect the wasteland—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure tightens as the patrols close in, but the final beat grants Elara triumph without visible trade-off; the guards arrive "too late," which undercuts rather than escalates cost. No on-page reversal or loss alters her tactics. The moss's psychic shift from screaming to reverent hum is atmospheric but not a consequence of her choice under pressure; it serves the embryo, not Elara's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of "passive worship into active resurrection" emerges from Elara's defiance of the Council's stagnation. The kite/sky motif (wonder yields unlock codes) is purposeful, and the final image of the embryo commanding regrowth offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "weaponized hope" and "The Reconstruction was over" are near-thesis statements that nudge toward summary. The embryo's "implanted destiny" risks allegorical transparency—a designed savior—but is grounded enough in action to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—moss screams, trembling fingers, spectacles adjustment—is character-specific. Diction is generally controlled, but "a living shackle," "the earth was still angry," and "kaleidoscope irises" edge toward elevated metaphor that strains the practical urgency of the scene. The prose modulates with pressure (short clauses as she decodes, longer as the embryo unfurls), and focalization remains clean. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several scaffolding phrases dull momentum: "It was the vessel of an implanted destiny" and "It was a method of transmission" are expository restatements. The metaphor "curled around Elara's ankles like a living shackle" is vivid but borders on purple when stacked with "the earth was still angry." "Kaleidoscope irises" and "weaponized hope" feel like coined phrases rather than earned images. No major loops, but minor redundancy (moss "screamed" then "shrieked") and elevated diction in peak beats (decoding, unsealing) create slight drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic reconstruction, plant telepathy, genetic savior in amber, and kite-based cryptography is inventive in combination. The kite's recursive algorithm hidden in geometric art is a fresh detail. However, the "designed savior to restore the biosphere" premise is a familiar template (chosen-one engineering), and the Council's ban-technology-as-religion reads as stock dystopian backdrop. The moss's reverent recognition of the embryo and Elara's triumphant final stance offer emotional specificity, but the piece does not fully transform its genre tropes through unpredictable moral calculus or character complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's choice to unseal the embryo drives the entire arc. She decodes the kite, executes the unsealing, and faces the guards in the final image. Her insurgent status and grandmother age are present but do not constrain tactics or add visible cost beyond the label. The role shapes two beats (decoding, unsealing) and is causally active at closure, meeting the essential threshold.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber sphere is handled in three beats: pulled from the satchel, vibrated by the frequency pulses, and dissolved in the boiling water to release the embryo. Its properties (warm, resin-preserved embryo, nutrient-dense fluids) are specific and irreplaceable. It appears early, enables the unsealing action, and transforms at closure into the kaleidoscope-eyed child. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; removing the amber would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "implanted destiny" concept is named and drives the stakes—Elara seeks to awaken a genetically designed savior. It shapes the unsealing action and is active in the final image as the embryo "calculates soil pH and atmospheric composition, preparing to command the regrowth." However, the concept is mostly told rather than dramatically tested; no on-page cost or friction arises from the destiny itself. It frames the premise but does not constrain Elara's choices mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's plant telepathy appears in two beats: the moss screams of intruders and later hums reverently. It warns her but does not constrain a choice—she presses forward regardless. The trait is label-plus-function ("accidental telepathy…a constant, buzzing headache") but lacks visible cost or trade-off in the unsealing action. It does not alter her tactics or participate in closure beyond atmospheric mood.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The unsealing is the story's major turn. Elara decodes the kite, transmits the frequency, lowers the sphere into boiling water, and the embryo emerges. The action is prepared across multiple beats and executed on the page with mechanical specificity. Removing the unsealing would erase the climax and closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage are clear; the action is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kite's cryptic script is introduced in the middle third, decoded by Elara, and drives the unsealing. The method is specific (binary language in knots and color bands, tonal frequency pulses) and irreplaceable—no other method is suggested. However, it is not signaled early; Elara's weeks of staring are summarized, not dramatized. The decoding shapes one key beat and enables closure, meeting the mid-band threshold.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs supply the boiling water catalyst, the geothermal hum that harmonizes with the sphere, and the scalding environment that pressures Elara's timeline. The moss on obsidian rocks warns her, and the mineral water mixes with amber fluids to grow the embryo. The setting is present in setup, middle (unsealing), and closure (embryo in pool), and its properties are causally necessary. Removing the springs would break the unsealing logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "Reconstruction" timeframe is named and frames the Council's stagnation versus Elara's action. It provides context (technologies sealed away, settlement with digital scanners) and charges the stakes (ending the Reconstruction, beginning rebirth). However, it does not tighten on-page tactics or create a live clock. The patrols' approach adds urgency, but the timeframe itself is thematic backdrop rather than a constraint that alters Elara's moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to evolve tradition with intent, transforming passive worship into active resurrection"—is stated clearly and drives her defiance of the Council. It shapes her choice to unseal the embryo and is present in the final image of rebirth. However, it is told more than dramatized; no on-page friction tests her commitment or forces a trade-off between evolution and tradition. The motivation is coherent and causally active but lacks visible cost or internal conflict.</comment>
