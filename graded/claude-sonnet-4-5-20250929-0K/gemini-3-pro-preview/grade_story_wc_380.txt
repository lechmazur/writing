<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied—the pressed wildflowers anchor his quest with sensory particularity. His navigation through gravity wells using coffee grounds demonstrates embodied problem-solving under pressure. The final choice (focusing on the flowers as psychic anchor) feels earned by the prior setup and forecloses the drift into ceiling spikes with visible cost. Minor: the deleted-memory premise could press harder on what he's giving up by recovering this ghost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. The whale's death → physics fracture → gravity fluctuations → navigation challenge → exhumation → gravity shriek → flower-anchor → stabilization traces cleanly. Closure lands on-page: Elias reclaims the memory-crystal and survives the fluctuation, a Decisive Change with felt cost (the "breath-stealing thud" and prior terror). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening (gravity shriek triggered by theft) narrows options and forces the psychic-anchor solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt cathedral, gantry, supersaturated lake, and ceiling spikes constrain movement and shape every choice. The copper bowl and trowel function as micro-setting tools that alter tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful: "sound like breaking bone," "blue as a bruise," the "high-frequency hum of salt growing over lost time." The environment charges the final image (salt flats, flickering dock lights) and the gravity fluctuation directly threatens Elias with the spiked ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the deleted memory before it dissolves. Pressure escalates causally: treacherous terrain → stable eye → exhumation → gravity shriek → weightlessness threat → psychic anchor → survival. The theft triggers the fluctuation, a direct consequence of Elias's choice, and the cost is legible (panic, near-death). The resolution is earned by his prior setup (the flowers as anchor) rather than luck. One meaningful tightening with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: memory as archaeology, the literalization of "buried regrets," the psychic weight of lost summers. The pressed wildflowers shift from brittle evidence to psychic anchor, reweighting their meaning at closure. The final image—"reclaimed his ghost"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (where deleted memories go) without stating a moral. The "gleaming silence" motif bookends and charges the ending without thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Elias filters the chamber through sailor superstition and lantern-lighter labor. Diction remains character-particular ("grotesque archaeology," "sound like breaking bone") and modulates under stress without losing texture. Psychic distance tightens during the gravity fluctuation ("scrabbled at the air, panic rising") then releases at closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the final line's certainty ("no longer feared") earns its declarative weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "cathedral of white sodium facets," "crusty bank," "gravity shrieked" all carry high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the fluctuation ("Weightlessness seized him, lifting his boots…") and breathing at closure. Minor: "a small packet" and "a small trowel" repeat the modifier; "the gleaming silence pressed" recurs without full pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold, and figurative language remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—star-faring whale, deleted-memory salt sediment, coffee-ground divination—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The literalization of "salt of tears" and memory-as-mineral avoids metaphor convenience by anchoring it in a facility's industrial process. The psychic-anchor solution grows organically from the flower setup rather than arriving late. Risk-taking (whale as cosmic event, gravity-reading via grounds) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: the emotional arc would collapse without these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (dock-side lantern lighter) drives every choice: he navigates the gantry, reads the coffee grounds to avoid gravity wells, exhumes the salt node, and uses the flower-anchor to stabilize. His occupation frames his "practiced, terrified grace" and his non-standard mission. Present in setup, middle navigation, and closure. His decision to focus on the flowers at the climax alters the outcome with visible cost (the hard drop). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in three beats: carried beneath his coat (setup), brushed during panic (mid-fluctuation), and focused on as psychic anchor (closure). Their scent-memory link to the crystal acts causally to stabilize gravity. The element is irreplaceable—no generic memento could perform this psychic-anchor function. Visible cost: without them, he drifts into the ceiling spikes. High causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity shape every tactic: Elias must navigate fluctuating wells, crouch against inversions, and survive the final shriek. The concept enables the coffee-ground method, creates the central obstacle, and triggers the climax (theft → gravity fluctuation). Causally indispensable: remove gravity fluctuations and the entire navigation challenge, method, and climax collapse. Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure beat. Charged specificity with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" constrains navigation (Elias cannot use digital sensors, must rely on coffee grounds) and triggers the climax (sudden fluctuation after theft). The unpredictability forces superstitious divination rather than tech, shaping both method and escalation. Visible cost: the fluctuation nearly kills him. Present across setup, middle, and closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exhume drives the major turn: digging triggers the gravity shriek, which creates the weightlessness crisis and forces the psychic-anchor solution. The action is causally central—remove it and the fluctuation, threat, and flower-anchor payoff all vanish. Present in middle and directly shaping closure. High irreplaceability with visible cost (the "breath-stealing thud"). Exhumation also literalizes the memory-archaeology theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coffee grounds appear in four beats: introduced as navigation method, demonstrated with left/right avoidance, shown floating upward (crouch response), form a stable ring at the lake, and explode upward during fluctuation. The method is causally essential—it enables safe traversal and signals the stable eye. Mechanics matter: grounds cluster, float, ring, explode, each altering Elias's choices. Removal would break navigation logic. High specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt crystal growing chamber pressures every choice: the gantry limits movement, the supersaturated lake marks the exhumation site, ceiling spikes threaten during weightlessness, and the dock's flickering lights frame closure. The chamber's industrial function (deleted-memory sediment) makes the exhumation goal legible. Micro-setting (copper bowl, trowel, salt bank) alters tactics throughout. Indispensable: the setting's physics and architecture enable the entire premise and escalation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe (after the whale beaches) establishes the fractured physics that create gravity fluctuations and disable sensors, forcing Elias's superstitious method. The "three days ago" marker and ongoing "death throes" create urgency (memories dissolving in sediment). The whale's magnetic blood and psychic shockwaves are causally central to the premise. Present in setup and shaping all middle tactics. Visible constraint with moderate closure linkage (vibrations reverberate during exhumation).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation (find where deleted memories go) drives every beat: Elias's traversal, coffee-ground navigation, stable-eye search, exhumation, and psychic-anchor focus all serve this goal. The desire is dramatized through embodied risk (terror, breath-stealing fall) and conflicted stakes (grotesque archaeology vs. reclaiming his ghost). Friction between want (recover memory) and cost (death by gravity) charges the climax. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone (gleaming silence) appears in the opening line, recurs as "high-frequency hum of salt growing over lost time," returns after the gravity shriek, and bookends at closure ("The gleaming silence returned, indifferent and vast"). The oxymoron charges the sterile cathedral atmosphere and modulates under pressure (silence "pressed," "shrieked"). The final image ("no longer feared its emptiness") reweights the tone with cost. Coherent across turns with charged reprise.</comment>
