<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by a clear desire (to interpret silence as possibility) and the final choice—opening his mouth to sing—forecloses his prior stance with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when his cultivated silence becomes "a barrier," forcing the climactic reversal. However, interiority leans toward elevated diction ("supernatural dampness," "vast and quiet marble") that feels abstractly literary rather than carpenter-specific, and the embodied struggle remains thin; we see him carry the shard but not the physical toll of the work or the searing purity beyond a single mention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a closure unit of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the horse's eyes spark, the hush retreats, the bell falls silent). The escalation—wrong turn, discovery, singing to match vibration, fusing the fragment—tightens once and the final image reweights silence and voice with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: Elias abandons his sealed-lip identity to complete the work, and the foliage withers as magic concentrates. One micro-turn (realizing silence is now a barrier) sets up closure cleanly. No causality breaks; the chime timeframe holds consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train, cattle-car oasis, and workshop provide vivid, selective detail filtered through Elias's craft-focus (petrified oak, moss pedestal, sequined masks). The halo fragment's "whispering gleam" and the misting hush create coherent atmosphere. The wind bell functions as micro-setting constraint: its resonance bounds the timeframe and forces urgency at closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (corridor, hidden door, oasis, return), though the "twisting corridor" and "vibrating air distorts perception" introduce slight fuzziness without dramatized cost. The fragment itself charges the final image when pressed into the horse's forehead, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: crown the lead charger before the chime fades. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes silence is a barrier and must sing to match the fragment's vibration, narrowing his options and forcing a trade-off (voice vs. craft perfection). The resolution is earned by his agency—he chooses to sing—and the horse's transformation with the retreating hush provides visible consequence. The cost is felt: abandoning lifelong silence. However, the middle stretch (searching for varnish, wrong turn) offers little escalation; the discovery is serendipitous, and the fragment's danger is asserted more than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: silence as possibility vs. barrier, craftsmanship as devotion, the fragment as divine accident. The final image—horse's golden intelligence, eternal voice within the train—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The halo fragment and singing coalesce into a tight symbol of transcendence earned through risk. Subtext operates in the withering foliage and the fact that Elias's first utterance is tonal, not verbal, preserving his belief that words are clumsy. Minor slip: "cultivated silence was no longer a tool, but a barrier" edges toward direct thematic statement, though it remains character-internal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated narrative texture ("serpentine ruin," "luminosity," "sordid magic") that reads consistent throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; we access Elias's perception and understanding without head-hopping. The perceptual signature—sifting debris "with the methodical grace of a saint," noticing jagged edges and moss pedestals—reflects his carpenter's focus and reverent stance. No dialogue on the page to assess. However, diction occasionally drifts into authorial-literary register ("vast and quiet marble waiting to be chiseled," "frequency just below the threshold of human hearing") that feels imposed rather than character-originated, slightly weakening voice-as-character integration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant but controlled in most beats. Information density is high in the oasis discovery and singing sequence. However, the opening and middle sections show overwriting: "expanding sphere of that single, long-decaying note," "thick, misting hush permeated the air, a supernatural dampness," "vast and quiet marble waiting to be chiseled" stack elevated metaphors without always serving immediate pressure. The phrase "low-level radiance that seemed to hum with a frequency just below the threshold of human hearing" is technically precise but tonally clinical. Minor template cadence: "He did not speak… he simply built, carving… sanding…" and "He took a wrong turn, stepping through… but instead opened…" echo similar stems. No loops or scaffold obscure causality, so artifacts remain in the non-closure zone, capping deduction at −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The circus-train-as-liminal-workshop and halo-fragment premise offer a fresh synthesis of folklore and craft devotion. The silent carpenter who must sing to complete his masterpiece transforms a familiar "silence vs. voice" trope through specific world logic (matching vibration, angel debris) and the weird circus setting. However, the oasis discovery and fragment's precise function arrive conveniently; the wrong turn feels like a plot convenience rather than a choice-driven turn, and the fragment's vibration-matching requirement is asserted late without prior foreshadowing. The emotional arc—abandoning silence to transcend craft—reads earned, but the mechanical setup (wind bell timeframe, hidden cattle car) leans toward checklist assembly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent carousel carpenter is established in paragraph one, drives the search for varnish (first third), discovers the fragment (middle), makes the key decision to sing (climax), and presses the fragment into the horse (closure). His trait—sealed lips, belief that words are clumsy—constrains his initial tactics and shapes the cost of the final choice. Removing this exact character identity would break the story's thematic spine (silence as barrier) and the climactic reversal. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; causal pressure across three beats; closure linkage strong; visible cost (abandoning lifelong silence). Slight deduction: the carpenter's hands are "calloused" and he "sifts" and "sands," but specific carpentry technique or tool-use detail is absent, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in the middle third (oasis discovery), is handled and its properties tested (sharp edges, searing purity, vibration), and is pressed into the horse's forehead at closure, where it fuses and sparks golden intelligence. Its unique properties—crystallized morning light, volatile edges, hum frequency—matter causally: Elias must sing to match its vibration, and the fragment's acceptance by the wood completes his goal. Two distinct beats (discovery/transport, fusion) plus closure participation. Early signal is missing (no mention in first third), applying −0.4. Specificity and causal pressure are strong; visible cost (withering foliage, searing palm) tied to the element. Removing the fragment would eliminate the climax and closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "misting hush" is mentioned repeatedly (opening, middle, final paragraph) and is said to "permeate the air," "swallow creaks," "soften edges," and "retreat" at closure. It frames atmosphere and the concept of silence as possibility. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice on the page; Elias's search and singing are shaped by the wind bell timeframe and the fragment's vibration, not the hush itself. The hush functions as ambient condition and lyric motif but remains passive. Setup and payoff present (first and last paragraphs), but middle development is absent—no choice turns on the hush's presence. Lyric reprise reweights the atmosphere (hush retreats, replaced by "completed purpose"), reaching mid-band via charged closure participation, but lacking causal pressure or middle constraint caps further growth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" is attributed explicitly in the first third ("He was quietly persistent in this search, sifting through the debris"). The trait is demonstrated in his methodical sifting, the navigation of the corridor, and the sustained singing that softens the fragment. However, the label itself does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible tradeoff; persistence is a backdrop to other causal forces (the chime timeframe, the fragment's volatility). The trait enables the singing sequence (he continues until the fragment softens), satisfying one beat involvement, but no moment dramatizes persistence vs. impatience or frames a choice-cost around this exact trait. Setup and development loosely present; closure participation indirect (he sustains the song to completion). Lyric-resonance tier: early seed → demonstration → closure participation, but minimal cost or constraint tied uniquely to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Singing is introduced at the climax ("Elias… opened his mouth to sing"), shapes the peak turn (silence → voice), and directly enables closure (softens the fragment, allowing its transport and fusion). The action is irreplaceable: without singing to match the fragment's vibration, the halo cannot be carried or fused, breaking the closure mechanism. Two distinct beats (singing to tame the fragment, singing during transport and final fusion), strong causal pressure (narrows options to this one act), and closure linkage (the "final, soaring note" presses the fragment home). Visible cost: abandoning lifelong silence. Early signal absent (no setup in first third), applying −0.3. Swappability test: no generic substitute (speaking, humming, chanting) would match the story's logic or thematic spine. Specificity and cost connection both high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"A wrong turn" is signaled and dramatized in the middle third: "He took a wrong turn, stepping through a rusted door that should have led to a broom closet but instead opened into a hidden oasis." The method's mechanics—vibrating air distorting perception—are explained on the page. The oasis discovery is the story's central complication, introducing the halo fragment and forcing the singing choice. Two beats (wrong turn → discovery; hidden sanctuary → fragment acquisition). Causal pressure: without this method, no fragment, no climax. However, the "wrong turn" itself is passive and serendipitous; Elias does not choose to take it, and no cost or tradeoff is dramatized around the navigation error. Setup present (corridor and distortion cued early), development and payoff strong, but agency is low, capping score below 8.0. Method shapes attempts indirectly (the train's geometry is a constraint) but the turn itself is coincidental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is established in the opening sentence and recurs throughout: workshop car, sleeper cars, cattle car oasis, wind bell outside. The train's structure supplies resources (the oasis, the moss pedestal) and constrains movement (twisting corridor, hidden door). The setting charges atmosphere (liminal twilight, grey vapor void) and the final image ("the story within the train had found its own eternal voice"). Three beats: workshop setup, corridor navigation/wrong turn, closure within the workshop car. Causal pressure: the train's geography and the oasis within it are indispensable to the plot. Closure linkage: the train frames the completed work and the golden twilight. Minor deduction: the train's hovering tracks and void of grey vapor are vivid but do not alter tactics; the setting is more stage than active pressure. Still, micro-setting (workshop, corridor, oasis) clearly shapes movement and discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3 and Q9G.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wind bell chime is introduced in the opening sentence and explicitly bounds Elias's work: "he knew he had only until the chime faded to complete his masterpiece." The timeframe recurs at closure: "the wind bell finally fell silent, but the story within the train had found its own eternal voice." The constraint is specific and visible: the expanding note decays, and Elias's final action ("a final, soaring note that seemed to stretch the very limits of the chime's duration") races the deadline. Two beats (setup, closure); causal pressure (the deadline tightens the singing and fusion); closure linkage strong. The cost is conceptual: transcending mortal time by completing the work within the chime's span. Slight deduction: the middle stretch (searching, wrong turn, discovery) does not visibly track or reference the chime's decay, loosening urgency in development, so the timeframe is setup + payoff without sustained middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To interpret silence as possibility" is stated explicitly in the first third ("his motivation was singular and driving") and dramatized at the climax when he realizes "the silence he had cultivated was no longer a tool, but a barrier." The motivation drives his sealed-lip stance, his methodical work, and the final reversal (opening his mouth to sing). Two beats: setup (carpenter's silence) and climax (silence reframed, choice to sing). Closure linkage: the horse gains "eternal voice," fulfilling the motivation's transformation. Visible cost: abandoning silence to complete the work. However, friction arises between want (interpret silence) and the stated need (crown the charger); the motivation reads more as thematic premise than embodied desire tested by conflicting impulses. The label "interpret silence as possibility" is author-voiced rather than character-specific idiom, reducing specificity by −0.4. Still, the reversal and cost are clear, and the motivation is causally active across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" is introduced with the halo fragment ("emitted a whispering gleam, a low-level radiance") and recurs at closure ("whispering gleam expanded, filling the car with a serene, golden twilight"). The tone descriptor is consistent—quiet, luminous, charged—and modulates with pressure: searing and volatile when discovered, warm and malleable when sung to, serene at closure. The gleam charges the final image and ties to the thematic resolution (silence → voice → eternal gleam). Setup, development (gleam softens under song), and payoff all present. However, "whispering gleam" as tone is conflated with the fragment as object; it is unclear whether the element is a tonal quality or a plot device. Treating it as tone: coherent and purposeful, but static in emotional register (always hushed/luminous) without sharp modulation under peak stress. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but tone does not independently shift to heighten pressure—it remains stable and beautiful throughout.</comment>
