<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—her professional curiosity drives the search—and her diligent examination of mundane objects shows character-specific traits. Internal experience is rendered through embodied perception ("wind-chapped cheeks," "knees dusted with gray powder"). However, the emotional progression feels muted; the "thrill of success" at the end arrives without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose a path, and the sociable isolation remains a stated condition rather than a lived tension that complicates her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece accumulates clues—murmurations, dog-ear geometry, hopscotch grid—that converge in the materialization of stranded luminance, a decisive on-page discovery that reweights her quest. Closure cost is conceptual: she has "charted the unchartable," fulfilling her professional stake. The lens holds through patterned density increase. Minor slip: the luminance dissolves "back into harmless dust motes," softening the cost and leaving the after-state less changed than the buildup promised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The airship's interior—cedar-scented nursery, dusty floor, round window—grounds action and constrains choice; Elara kneels, aligns the book, traces the hopscotch board. The starling murmurations function as both atmosphere and magnetic-anomaly signal, charging the environment with purpose. Spatial choreography is clear (starboard rail → stern nursery). The hopscotch board and phrasebook directly enable the closure discovery, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through professional focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—charting stranded luminance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through clue accumulation: the dog-ear angle, the hopscotch grid, the room's hum, culminating in the sphere's materialization. Agency is observational and interpretive rather than decisional; Elara decodes rather than choosing between live options. The cost is professional validation, not a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs (the room "began to hum"), but the stakes remain intellectual discovery without friction or sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge waiting for the right interpreter emerges through the stranded luminance, dog-ear geometry, and the "private audience with the universe's secrets." The final image—luminance dissolving, Elara standing with dusty knees—offers resonance tied to ephemeral discovery. However, the theme leans toward wonder without complication; no counter-reading or ambiguity challenges the tidy success. The "sociable isolation" remains ornamental rather than thematically charged at closure, and the piece flirts with a "charted the unchartable" moral summary without subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. Diction is purposeful and ornate ("violet bruise of twilight," "living smoke," "silent lightning"), creating a consistent voice that matches the ethereal-cartography premise. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices geometry, chalk diagrams, and magnetic anomalies through a navigator's lens. Register occasionally drifts into elevated poeticism ("sociable isolation," "forgotten geometry") that reads slightly writerly but remains voice-coherent. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery ("copper hull groaning rhythmically," "strobing pattern of darkness"). Information density is high; sentences often do double work (setting + mood, action + character). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knelt... She flipped... She raised..." runs stack slightly. The opening and closing lines anchor well. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in some beats ("viscous and warm," "trapped star that had forgotten how to burn out") verges on overwriting without obscuring clarity. Syntax varies purposefully.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ethereal cartography, navigational geometry, and avian magnetism is specific and non-obvious. The dog-ear/hopscotch alignment is a fresh narrative hinge that grows from the premise. Emotional truth—wonder without cost—feels slightly safe; the ending grants discovery without complication. The airship-and-starlings frame is atmospheric but not uncommon in speculative fiction. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with earned particulars, but the arc trends toward validation rather than transformation, limiting transformative depth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives every beat: leaning over the rail, retreating to the nursery, examining the floor, aligning the book, tracing the hopscotch. Her choices (to kneel, to flip to the dog-ear, to raise her quill) create the key turn—materializing the luminance. The trait is causal and present in the closure image. However, her decisions are largely observational decoding rather than stakes-altering choices with visible trade-offs. She is present in all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) and her trait shapes tactics. Costs are professional validation, not personal sacrifice, capping the upper band slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook dog-ear appears early ("battered text... a specific polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear"), is handled mid-scene ("held the book open against the floor, aligning the hypotenuse"), and directly enables the closure discovery by unlocking the hopscotch grid's navigational meaning. The dog-ear's geometry is its unique property; a generic bookmark would not work. It is causally active in two distinct beats and shapes the ending. The element is irreplaceable and charged with cost (decoding effort, professional breakthrough). All three gates are met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is the core concept, named early and sustaining the dominant stake. It shapes Elara's tactics (hunting for residue, decrypting the ship's history) and materializes on-page as "a sphere of stranded luminance... a ball of silent lightning" at closure. The concept is causally active in framing, middle search, and payoff. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and stakes. It is specific, irreplaceable, and charges the final image. All three gates are met; the concept drives pressure and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is shown through action: Elara examines "the mundane with the intensity of a forensic scientist," kneels to study silt, aligns the book. The trait enables the middle beat (decoding the hopscotch) and the closure discovery. However, it is largely descriptive reinforcement of behavior already dramatized by her role as map apprentice. The trait does not constrain or create visible cost; it amplifies what her occupation already supplies. Present in setup and payoff, functional in middle, but somewhat redundant with the character element, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Note" (documenting the discovery) is the climactic action: "She raised her quill, ready to document" and "She proceeded to note the exact coordinates... She sketched the glowing sphere rapidly." The action is signaled, executed, and completes the professional arc. It is causally necessary (cartographer must chart) and specific to her role. However, the act of noting/sketching is reactive documentation rather than a decision that narrows options or imposes trade-offs. All three gates are met; causal pressure is strong but swappability is moderate (another recording method could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The method—noting secret patterns in the dusty hopscotch board—is seeded early ("layers of gray silt... over an intricate, hand-drawn game"), developed mid-scene (aligning the dog-ear with the chalk diagram), and executed at closure ("traced the path from square one to square nine... the room began to hum"). The hopscotch grid is mechanically essential; its "sky" segment triggers the luminance. The method is irreplaceable and specific. All three gates are met; causal pressure is high; the method shapes attempts and payoff with visible cost (kneeling, tracing, the effort of decoding).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The antique airship *Celestial Needle* is named early, provides the nursery setting where the discovery occurs, and houses the trapped luminance ("riding the airship for years"). The setting constrains action (Elara retreats "into the ship's dusty interior," kneels on the floor) and supplies the closure resource (the nursery's hopscotch board). However, the airship's role is largely container; the nursery's micro-setting does the tactical work. The airship is present in all three gates and causally relevant but not irreplaceable—another old vessel could substitute. Specificity (copper hull, rumored history) adds texture but not unique pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The starling murmurations are introduced early ("sailing amid starling murmurations") and return at closure: "The starlings outside suddenly banked away, breaking the magnetic tension, and the luminance dissolved." The murmurations signal the magnetic anomaly and time the ending. However, they function as atmospheric clock rather than tightening decision pressure; Elara does not race against their departure. The timeframe is present in setup and payoff, shapes the middle realization ("the birds were not random"), but does not constrain tactics. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is observational. Lyric reprise reweights but without urgent cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to chart the next great discovery in the field of ethereal cartography"—is stated early and dramatized through every choice: leaning over the rail, retreating to the nursery, examining the floor, aligning the book, sketching the sphere. The desire drives all three beats and the closure. However, the motivation is friction-free; no competing want or fear complicates the pursuit. The cost is effort, not sacrifice. The motivation is essential and present throughout, but the lack of internal conflict or trade-off caps the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is introduced early ("a profound sense of sociable isolation, feeling intimately connected to the groaning vessel and the endless horizon despite having no human companion") and reprised at closure ("The sociable isolation now feeling like a private audience with the universe's secrets"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (professional focus → wonder). However, it remains largely ornamental; the tone does not constrain choice or create friction. It charges the final image with a lyric callback but without pressure or cost. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is absent. The tone is consistent but not causal.</comment>
