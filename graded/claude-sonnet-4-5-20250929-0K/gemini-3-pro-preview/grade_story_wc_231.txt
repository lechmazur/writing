<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("borrowed memories," "stolen truths"), and his micro-choice to honor the flower in the lantern room carries visible cost (his isolation "less hollow now"). However, the emotional arc relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the protagonist observes and decodes rather than struggles with competing desires. The backstory about "keepers of the archive" and his role feels expository without altering present choices. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward poetic abstraction ("burning motivation," "heavy burden") rather than visceral contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of image and the protagonist's deepening understanding of the stranger's sacrifice, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Silas honors the voluntarily forgotten with visible cost ("his own isolation felt less hollow now"). The closure reweights the premise (lighthouse for the lost → for the voluntarily forgotten) with conceptual cost legible on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; the cost is felt rather than sharply decisive, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock, spiraling copper lighthouse, and etheric tide are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Silas's professional lens. The flower itself functions as micro-setting, constraining his investigative choice and charging the final image when placed in the lantern room. Sensory hierarchy is strong: "swirling vapor," "humming faintly," "damp, salty air" all anchor perception. The setting subtly mirrors internal states (mist/isolation) without overt symbolism, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the stranger's final gesture) is signaled early and drives the single investigative beat. The tightening occurs when Silas shifts focus from the woman to the empty space, narrowing his approach and revealing the sacrifice. Agency is investigative attention that forecloses ignorance with felt cost (carrying "the secrets of ghosts"). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length. The pressure remains coherent, though the protagonist's role is more observer than actor under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (love requiring no presence, voluntary erasure, "quiet spaces between people") emerges organically from the flower, the memory-vision, and Silas's realization without direct statement. The final image (Edelweiss in the lantern room, "not to guide ships, but to honor the vast, quiet spaces") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates cleanly in the gaps Silas observes. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity (sacrifice as both gift and erasure). Minor dock: some phrasing trends abstract ("profound truths," "real story") where specificity would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and modulates with Silas's emotional state. Perceptual signature is distinct: he notices "borrowed memories," "heavy weight," "rhythmic whisper"—vocabulary consistent with an eccentric keeper. Syntax and diction remain controlled, though some lines drift toward elevated register ("jagged, snowy precipice," "abyssal void") that slightly tensions the established voice. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. The prose reflects the focalizer's mind, but a few stock phrases ("trembling, ink-stained fingers") dilute particularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is often vivid ("solidified iridescent light," "oxidized copper and clockwork gears"). However, multiple lines lean on stock constructions: "trembling, ink-stained fingers," "swirling vapor," "burning motivation," "solemn, eccentric grace." Template cadence appears in the middle third ("He picked it up," "He sat," "He chose," "He concentrated," "He pulled"). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but figurative density in non-peak beats ("grey entropy of the mist," "ocean of time") slightly slows momentum. Information density is generally high; clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse keeper cataloging emotional debris, memory-reading via flower) synthesizes familiar fantasy elements into a specific frame. The turn—focusing on absence rather than presence—is fresh and earned. The "Sector of Lost Things" and opal dock are particular to this world. However, the core emotional arc (protagonist finds solace by honoring another's sacrifice) and the wise-outsider-keeper archetype trend familiar. Transformation test: the plot and emotional progression could function with different specifics (different artifact, different setting) without fundamental change. The piece commits to its premise and avoids safety-hedging, lifting it above mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and makes the key choice to place the flower in the lantern room, altering his understanding of his role. His eccentric traits (triple-lens spectacles, ink-stained fingers, "borrowed memories to feel human") are signaled early and shape his investigative method. However, the choice at closure is more interpretive honor than a decision under competing pressures. Two beats: receiving the flower, placing it in the tower. Causal pressure is moderate; the element is essential but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Edelweiss boutonnière appears in three distinct beats: discovery on the dock, pressed to temple for investigation, and placement in the lantern room. Early signal (second paragraph), clear middle use (vision sequence), and closure participation (final placement with reweighted meaning: "not to guide ships, but to honor..."). The object's physical state ("grey and brittle, yet holding...integrity") matters and its symbolic charge drives the ending. Removing it would break the story's logic and closure. Strong causal linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" is signaled early ("psychological debris," "flotsam screamed with raw emotion") and directly enables the investigative action (pressing flower to temple, vision). It shapes Silas's self-concept ("relied on these borrowed memories to feel human") and the stakes (decoding before memory fades). However, the concept functions primarily as a setting rule and thematic claim rather than creating on-page friction or constraining choices. Present in closure conceptually (Silas now carries the stranger's memory), but not dramatized as a cost or tactical constraint in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the hum/whisper of the flower's memory and contrasts with the usual "screamed with raw emotion" flotsam. It signals the memory's unique quality and motivates Silas's choice to investigate rather than discard. The trait enables one key action (investigation) but does not constrain later moves or impose visible cost. Functional but largely atmospheric; could be replaced with a similar descriptor (e.g., "quietly insistent") without structural change. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Investigate" is signaled early ("compulsion...to decode"), drives the central beat (pressing flower to temple, observing the vision), and leads to the closure choice (honoring the memory). The action's specific method (observing gaps, tracing shadows) matters and defines Silas's approach. Removing it collapses the middle sequence. However, the investigation itself is more revelation than struggle; it does not face obstacles or impose visible cost during execution. Essential to structure, strong presence across beats, but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is taught in the setup ("profound truths...hid in the silence between the beats") and executed on the page in the investigative beat: Silas focuses "not on the visible woman, but on the empty space...tracing the outline of someone...deliberately erased." The method is specific, irreplaceable, and drives the revelation of the stranger's sacrifice. It shapes the middle turn and charges the thematic conclusion ("gaps were where the real story lived"). Present in setup and middle; echoed thematically at closure. Strong specificity and causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The opal dock is present in the opening ("solidified iridescent light, humming faintly") and closing ("glimmered one last time before fading"), and Silas sits on its edge during investigation. Early signal, physical presence in two beats, and final-image reprise. However, the dock does not constrain choices or supply resources; it functions as atmospheric staging. Swappable with another liminal platform (stone pier, glass bridge) without altering logic. Lyric resonance (first/last appearance) lifts it above ornamental, but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At nautical twilight" is mentioned in the opening and the piece ends with "the onset of true, impenetrable night." The timeframe provides mood and a symbolic boundary (transition from twilight to dark mirrors Silas's shift in understanding), but it does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics. No live clock pressures action; the investigative sequence is not time-limited. Present at setup and closure, but functionally decorative. Could be replaced with "dusk" or "evening" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to decode a stranger's final gesture" is dramatized on the page: Silas feels "compulsion rising," "burning motivation," and acts by pressing the flower to his temple. It drives the investigation and the closure choice (placing the flower to honor the gesture). The desire faces mild friction (incomplete vision, "corrupted by age") but is not deeply conflicted; Silas pursues it without competing wants or visible cost during execution. Present across all beats, causal, but lacks internal tension or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout: Silas observes others' memories without participating, the stranger "excised themselves" while watching the woman, and Silas's "own isolation felt less hollow." Tone is consistent and modulates subtly (curiosity → understanding → solemn acceptance). The final image ("leaving the keeper alone with his stolen truths") charges the tone with cost. The tone is essential to theme and ending resonance, though it operates more as atmosphere than a constraint on choices. Strong presence and thematic integration.</comment>
