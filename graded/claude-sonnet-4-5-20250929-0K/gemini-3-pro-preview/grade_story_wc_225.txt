<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas is presented with consistent motivation (guilt over past teaching → desire to unfreeze time) and the internal contradiction between his strategic ruthlessness and moral burden shapes his arc. The backstory exposition is substantial (~25% by line count) but anchors in the platinum labyrinth fidget and the frozen village, tilting the present choice to pull the anchor thread. The climactic moment "He did not waver. He pulled the thread" demonstrates embodied agency under pressure, though the ease of the solution (finding the knot, pulling it once) slightly undercuts the struggle. The emotional shift from guilt-stasis to exhale-and-continue reads earned, but the lack of on-page bodily cost (no injury, exhaustion detail in the resolution beat) keeps it from the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (Silas, fountain, market square, time-frozen village) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal chain is motivated: Silas's wish → woven hush → weakening barrier → archive intervention → thread-pull → village unfrozen. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the comfort of stasis sacrificed, villagers resume unaware). The ending supplies a micro turn (labyrinth clicks solved) that functions as closure reinforcement without fracturing the main DC. One pressure-building move (finding the anchor knot, pulling it) is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in "sacrificed the comfort of the stasis" and Silas's exhale of relief/burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spatial choreography is clear: fountain rim → market square → village archive → tapestry table. Sensory details (cool platinum, limestone, ozone-and-regret smell of the black thread, deafening droplet splash after silence) are vivid and selective. The tapestry itself functions as micro-setting; its frayed border constrains the method of solving the spell and the anchor knot charges the final action. The frozen village supplies atmospheric pressure but does not dynamically alter Silas's tactics beyond providing the puzzle's location. The ending reprise (droplet falls, smoke disperses) reweights prior stillness with momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: unfreeze the village to allow time/consequences to flow and achieve self-forgiveness. The piece tightens once when Silas identifies the anchor knot and pulls it despite the woven hush's protest, narrowing his option to maintain stasis. Agency is decision under duress ("He did not waver"), and the cost is explicit: "sacrifice the comfort of the stasis to save the reality of the village." Thunder approaching provides external time pressure. No antagonist beyond the spell itself, which is acceptable for this design; the single reversal (resistance snaps → shockwave → restoration) meets 600–800-word escalation standards with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of guilt, stasis versus flow, and the necessity of accepting consequences emerges through image (frozen village, labyrinth puzzle, frayed tapestry threads). The parallel between chess strategy (expendable pawns) and the spell-breaking choice (sacrificing comfort) is present but leans toward overt allegory in the closing lines: "played the game, made the sacrifice, won the right to continue living." This borders on thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than letting the final image do the work. The droplet splash and villagers blinking offer concrete closure, yet the labyrinth's "solved configuration" in the final sentence tilts toward stated moral, reducing subtextual charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is close enough to access Silas's strategic interiority without head-hopping. Diction is consistent and elevated ("fierce repose," "winnow the threads"), reflecting a chess-tutor intellect. No dialogue on the page, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature (noticing tactical patterns, labyrinth mechanics, thread syntax) is character-specific. One brief register wobble: "the woven hush vibrated, protesting the intrusion like a plucked string" reads slightly more decorative than the tight analytical voice elsewhere, but does not break coherence. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong verbs ("teased loose," "winnow," "plucked"). Two patterns lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop in paragraph three ("the phenomenon was known... as the woven hush, a silence so dense..." then "It was a barrier that preserved..."), restating the stasis concept; (2) template cadence in the resolution paragraph with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers ("The resistance snapped. A ripple distorted... The solid smoke... The water droplet..."). These occur in the closure beat, triggering the artifact-at-closure deduction. Information density is high; sensory details (ozone, rough wool, plucked-string vibration) avoid generic placeholders. No grammar or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frozen-village-as-manifestation-of-guilt premise and the puzzle-solving climax echo familiar redemption arcs and time-freeze tropes without strong transformation. The chess-tutor backstory and labyrinth-as-thinking-tool offer specificity, and the "frayed threads in a tapestry's border" method is a fresh inflection on spell-breaking mechanics. The parallel structure (chess strategy = thread-pulling) is clear but predictable. The piece does not take structural or perspectival risks beyond mild elevated diction. Emotional truth in Silas's guilt and the villagers' obliviousness grounds the execution, but the core arc (guilt → acceptance via symbolic puzzle) follows a well-worn path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas (exiled chess tutor) drives every beat: observes the frozen village, recalls his guilt, walks to the archive, analyzes the tapestry, pulls the anchor thread. His profession informs his tactical approach ("a puzzle far more complex than the platinum labyrinth... yet the mechanics felt identical") and his teaching philosophy ("all others are expendable currency") shapes his willingness to sacrifice stasis. Present in setup (paragraph one), middle (archive approach), and ending (pulls thread, exhales). Cost is tied to his choice: he must give up the guilt-refuge to restore time. Swapping "chess tutor" for another strategic profession would soften the thematic link to "expendable pawns" but not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears in three beats: opening (Silas turns it while thinking), implicit middle reference ("a puzzle far more complex than the platinum labyrinth in his pocket"), and ending ("gripped the platinum labyrinth one last time, feeling the gears within it click into a solved configuration"). Its function as a thinking aid and thematic parallel (puzzle = life problem) is clear. The final click-into-solved adds symbolic closure but does not causally enable the spell-breaking; the labyrinth remains a motif rather than a plot driver. Removing it would lose thematic resonance but not alter the action sequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The woven hush is the central magical obstacle: it freezes the village, creates the stasis Silas must break, and protests physically when he winnows threads ("the woven hush vibrated, protesting the intrusion like a plucked string"). It shapes stakes (village survival, self-forgiveness) and tactics (Silas must decode and unravel it at the tapestry). Present in setup (paragraph three defines it), middle (Silas approaches the epicenter), and ending (resistance snaps, hush dissolves). The concept is indispensable; without it, no frozen village, no puzzle, no closure. The term itself recurs with specificity ("a silence so dense it felt like heavy wool"), charging the wool-thread imagery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is dramatized once in the opening beat: Silas turns the labyrinth and the narration explains "every rotation... aligned his chaotic thoughts, sharpening the strategic patterns." The trait enables his calm focus but does not constrain a later choice or create visible cost. It appears in setup, absent in middle tactical work, and returns only as a passive prop-grip at the end. The attribute reads more as character flavor than plot lever; swapping it for "meditates" or "paces" would not alter outcomes, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Winnow" is the verb anchoring the climactic action: "He began to winnow the threads, meticulously separating the silver strands of the containment spell from the golden wool of the original art." This mechanical process drives the middle-to-end beat, demonstrating Silas's skill and patience under pressure. The action reappears implicitly when he "teased loose" and "pulled the thread." Removing "winnow" (substituting "cut" or "untangle") would lose the precision and agricultural patience connotation but the plot survives; however, the word's specificity and functional centrality place it in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border—is signaled in paragraph six ("achievable only by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border where the spell's syntax had grown ragged") and executed in the climax (winnowing silver from golden threads, finding the anchor knot). Its mechanics matter: the frayed border is the vulnerability Silas exploits. The method shapes his approach (careful separation, no brute force) and differentiates this solution from generic "break the spell" beats. Present in setup (announced), middle (enacted), and ending (result). Swapping "border threads" for "central weave" would alter the tactical nuance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is the inciting situation and stakes anchor: it must be unfrozen to restore life and allow Silas's self-forgiveness. The frozen state supplies atmospheric specifics (droplet hanging, solid smoke, statue-like villagers) and the archive as the spell's epicenter provides the tactical location. The setting constrains Silas's choice: he cannot leave without undoing the harm. Present in setup (market square, fountain), middle (archive interior), and ending (village breathes, people blink). The frozen quality is indispensable; a merely "quiet" or "fearful" village would not generate the same puzzle or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears twice: paragraph four ("he had to act during the lull of distant thunder") and paragraph seven ("the thunder rumbled again, closer this time"). The timeframe creates mild urgency (storm approaching = barrier weakening) but does not impose a visible countdown or alter Silas's tactics beat-by-beat. The thunder functions more as atmospheric cue than ticking clock. Present in setup (announced) and ending (closer rumble as he pulls the thread), but absent from middle decision points. Removing the thunder would lose texture but not break the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation—to forgive himself for past mistakes—is stated explicitly in paragraph five ("to forgive himself for past mistakes, he had to stop hiding in this suspended moment") and dramatized through his choice to pull the anchor thread despite the comfort of stasis. The motivation is present in setup (backstory guilt over teaching ruthless chess), middle (walking to the archive with "fierce repose"), and ending (exhale, "won the right to continue living"). The friction between wanting absolution and fearing consequences is legible, though the resolution leans tidy. Cost is visible: he gives up the refuge and accepts time's flow.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named once in paragraph four ("a demeanor of fierce repose, a calm that was not passive but coiled, calculated, and ready to strike") and embodied in Silas's controlled, methodical approach to the tapestry. The tone—strategic calm under existential pressure—coheres through the arc (no panic, no rage, steady focus). It modulates slightly when the woven hush protests ("did not waver") and resolves in the exhale-and-drop moment. The tone charges the final image of earned continuation but does not shift dramatically with pressure, remaining consistent rather than dynamic. Present in setup and ending; implicit in middle.</comment>
