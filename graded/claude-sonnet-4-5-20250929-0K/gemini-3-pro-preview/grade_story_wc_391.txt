<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is rooted and complex—sculpting patience from impatience—and her micro-choices (watching the moon, timing the lever) embody her internal conviction under pressure. Kael's impatience provides a useful foil, though his presence is more functional than dynamic. The closing reverence in his gaze ("terrified reverence, finally understanding") edges toward on-the-nose emotional summary rather than embodied realization. Interiority remains consistent and character-particular, with no diagnostic label-speak touching closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, viaduct) and the causal chain is legible: rain on the viaduct → altered conductivity → lunar pull at zenith → grounding current released → bridge collapse. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the supply line severed, the rebellion begun) that lands on the page. A minor seam: the phrase "magnetic viaduct after rain" is told twice in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild redundancy without adding pressure. The inferred lens is Causal, held cleanly through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and purposeful, anchoring choice (the grounding lever, the ice's reflective resonance). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional POV ("invisible lines of power," "degrees of arc"). The "waxen crescent moon" and "blue sparks" charge the final image. The physical choreography (Elara at the ramparts, Kael to her left, the viaduct below) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—disabling the supply line—is signaled early and tightens through the time constraint (moon's zenith). Elara's agency is renunciation of immediate action in favor of precise timing, a choice that forecloses Kael's impulsive path with visible cost (the rebellion's impatience must be sculpted). The escalation is causal and accumulative: rain → freezing → conductivity shift → gravitational alignment → lever throw → collapse. No reversals are needed; the single tightening is meaningful and the cost (severing the connection) is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: patience as destructive force, stillness over flash, inevitability over noise. The moon-tracking method, the lever, and the silent collapse all embody the concept of patient revolution without meta-commentary. The final image ("silent and unstoppable as the winter frost") reweights prior material through concrete action rather than statement. Kael's "terrified reverence" borders on thematic echo but remains grounded in his on-page learning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchors in Elara's professional idiom ("environmental harmonic," "horizon mapper," "gravitational alignment") and remains stable. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, advancing conflict through subtext ("If we blow the supports now, they will rebuild"). Distance control is clean, with no head-hopping. One slip: "coiled spring ready to snap, yet held static by the crushing winter air" and "trapped spirits demanding release" lean slightly purple in a high-pressure beat, though the voice stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally high, and sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Three prose artifacts weaken the line level: (1) "magnetic viaduct after rain" is paraphrased twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, (2) "watching how the freezing water created a conductive sheen" immediately follows "observed the magnetic viaduct after rain" in a synonym loop, and (3) the phrase "the wind whipped her cloak" / "the wind howled through the basalt columns" recycles wind imagery without functional variation. Apply cumulative penalty −0.9 in Q7 only. No loops touch the closure beat, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies. The final image ("silent and unstoppable as the winter frost") is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of sabotage through precision timing rather than explosives offers a fresh angle, and the magnetic-viaduct/lunar-pull mechanism is specific and non-obvious. The "patient revolution" motif transforms a familiar resistance trope through Elara's professional skill set (horizon mapping, gravitational alignment). Risk is present but modest; the piece commits fully to its premise without bold structural or perspectival innovation. The emotional core (patience as power) feels durable rather than trendy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara as vigilant horizon mapper is signaled early, shapes mid-scene choices (tracking moon paths, measuring arc), and drives the closure action (throwing the lever at the precise moment). Her observation is paired with decision throughout, and her professional skill constrains tactics (waiting for alignment rather than immediate strike). The character role is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct after rain is seeded early, handled in two distinct beats (observing the conductive sheen, then its collapse), and directly enables the closure through altered conductivity. The "after rain" detail is causal: the moisture creates vulnerability. The viaduct's destruction is the story's decisive change. Removing this exact element would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Patient revolution is articulated explicitly ("the core concept of a patient revolution") and shapes Elara's tactics (waiting for alignment vs. immediate strike). It constrains her teaching goal (sculpting patience from impatience) and charges the final image ("silent and unstoppable"). However, it is summarized more than dramatized in micro-choices; the concept is thematic accent rather than on-page friction with visible cost tied to patience itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears once in dialogue framing ("her tone softly purposeful") and aligns with Elara's measured approach. It does not constrain or enable a discrete on-page action with visible cost; rather, it describes her established stance. The trait is consistent but more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is the story's hinge action: Elara throws the lever "to unyoke the sanctuary's natural magnetic field from the artificial grid of the viaduct." This single verb is irreplaceable—it captures both the mechanical act and the conceptual severance. The major turn (bridge collapse) traces directly to this action, and the language is specific and non-swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled early ("Her method was precise, determined entirely by tracking moon paths across the winter constellations"), shapes mid-scene choices (counting degrees of arc, waiting for zenith), and enables the closure by identifying the gravitational alignment moment. The mechanics matter: the moon's pull is the trigger. Removing this method would require a different sabotage logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake anchors orientation, supplies the grounding rod (a tactical resource), and creates the elevated vantage for observation. The frozen lake provides the environmental harmonic ("ensuring the ice would reflect the necessary resonance"). Both setting components pressure choices (timing, vantage, conductivity) and charge the final image (ice as silent, unstoppable force). The setting is essential across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" is established early as the enabling condition ("The operation required a specific environmental harmonic that was only possible after the lake freezes over"). The timeframe tightens decisions: Elara must wait for both the freeze and the lunar zenith. The time constraint shapes the entire escalation and is paid off at closure. It is causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to sculpt patience from impatience is articulated explicitly and tested through Kael's pressure to strike immediately. She dramatizes this through the choice to wait, but the internal friction (her own impatience vs. her teaching goal) is not embodied; the conflict is external (Kael's impatience) rather than Elara's contradictory impulses. The motivation is present and shapes one key turn, but the cost is more didactic (teaching Kael) than personal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is embodied throughout: "the atmosphere tonight vibrated with a restrained wildness, the tension of a coiled spring ready to snap, yet held static by the crushing winter air." Tone modulates with pressure (quiet observation → lever throw → silent collapse) and charges the final image ("silent and unstoppable as the winter frost"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the patient-revolution concept without becoming static.</comment>
