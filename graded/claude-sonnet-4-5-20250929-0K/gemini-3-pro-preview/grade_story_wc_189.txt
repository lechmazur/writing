<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is specific and embodied through the jade cicada, tangential observation method, and micro-choices (watching the starfish, stroking the jade, choosing how to interpret the texture of time). Her final release of Kael is earned by the extended silent processing and shows visible cost—accepting solitude mapped through future mornings cataloguing alone. The warmly observant trait constrains her response method throughout. Minor: Kael remains a silhouette; his defiance/guilt is told rather than shown in gesture or failed speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elara, tidal-pool chronicler), where (grotto), and when (pause after resignation) by the second paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence deepens through cicada handling, starfish observation, and texture discovery until the final release constitutes Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she grants permission with visible cost (future solitude). The cost is legible in "mornings where she would catalogue…alone, and the evenings where only the wind would answer." Lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening through the extended observational sequence that reweights her stance from potential argument to acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto (limestone ceiling as fractured eye, tide pool with starlight and seaweed, starfish detaching) directly charges the closure by supplying the observational material through which Elara processes Kael's departure. The jade cicada's ridges and coolness ground her bodily under pressure. Micro-setting succeeds: the pool's incoming tide shift enables foresight of future years. Sensory detail is filtered through professional bias (purple sea urchins, swaying fronds) and the final tide metaphor integrates setting into the release speech. All three gates met with closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to respond to Kael's departure) is signaled early and coherent. The accumulative deepening occurs through Elara's extended observation that narrows her options—by studying the pool she forecloses argument and chooses acceptance. The starfish detaching models the necessary release. Agency is clear (her choice to look away, stroke the cicada, interpret texture, then speak), and cost is visible (future solitude). One meaningful tightening when she shifts from processing to speech. No reversal required under Accumulative lens; the deepening suffices and the cost charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transition/molting emerges through cicada (shedding skins, resurrection), starfish (detaching to drift), and tide (brings/takes away) without direct statement. The final image—Elara's release speech using tide metaphor—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stagnation cannot survive, depth should not be feared. The texture-of-time inquiry resolves as "fibrous and tough…like the husk of a coconut" with "sweet sustenance of memory inside," specific and earned through her observational method. Subtext in her averted gaze and delayed speech. No moralizing; wisdom arises from grotto particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with strong perceptual signature: tangential observation, professional idiom (mollusks, anemones, purple sea urchins), tactile focus (jade ridges, coolness). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("warmly observant nature," "fibrous and tough"). The single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, merging with grotto echo. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during cicada handling, pulls back for foresight passage). Free indirect style is clean. Kael has no dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short "Now, however" pivot vs. longer foresight sentence); information density is high (cicada both grounds and symbolizes). Clarity holds throughout. Minor issues: "warmly observant nature" is slightly label-like; "solid coolness…grounded her warmly" creates a temperature contradiction (coolness/warmly). "The final, sharp consonant of his resignation" is elegant but borders on purple given the rest is plainer. "Fibrous and tough, like the husk of a coconut floating between islands" is a strained vehicle—coconuts don't typically float *between* islands as a known image. These keep the score sub-8.0 but don't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tangential-observation method as problem-solving is a specific, non-obvious angle; the cicada as transition talisman integrates organically. The grotto as field-work sanctuary adds freshness. Emotional specificity (texture of time, fibrous husk) avoids generic templates. The premise (mentor releasing protégé through nature observation) is familiar but transformed through Elara's professional lens and the extended silence. The coconut metaphor and some elevated diction ("ephemeral ecosystems," "herald of the incoming sea") feel slightly ornamental. Solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tidal-pool chronicler: present in setup (decades mapping ecosystems), frames her observational method (watching pool/starfish), and her professional idiom colors perception throughout. Development: her choice to process via pool observation rather than direct confrontation is enabled by this identity. Closure: the tide metaphor in her final speech is occupation-linked. Three gates met. Causal pressure: her method constrains response options (tangential rather than direct). Cost: acceptance of future solitary cataloguing is profession-specific. Strong integration but not indispensable—a different naturalist role could work with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jade cicada: setup (paragraph 2, "always carried"), development (paragraphs 2, 4, 5: tracing ridges, drawing patience, leaving warm), closure (implicit in final speech about molting/depth, though not named). Three gates met. Two distinct beats: initial grounding touch and later stroking for patience. Causal: grounds her during processing, symbol of transition primes her acceptance stance. Specificity: "river stone as green as deep water," "jade wings" create irreplaceability. Cost connection: her release decision is filtered through this talisman's meaning. Could score higher if explicitly reprised in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transition periods: setup (cicada as "ultimate transition periods"), development (starfish detaching, her foresight of future years as "necessary molting"), closure (final speech: "nothing that stays stagnant can survive," "do not fear the depth"). Three gates met. Shapes stakes: the concept reframes Kael's departure from loss to metamorphosis. Alters tactics: Elara's decision to release rather than argue is causally tied to this lens. Cost: accepting her own transition into solitude. Indispensable—removing this concept would collapse the thematic and tactical logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Warmly observant: setup (paragraph 2, "grounded her warmly observant nature"), development (watching reflection, noting seaweed/starfish with patience), closure (final look with "gentle, knowing affection"). Three gates met. Constrains: her response method is tangential observation rather than confrontation. Visible tradeoff: extended silence risks misunderstanding but enables deeper acceptance. Functional across beats but somewhat label-dependent; the trait is shown more in method than distinct cost. Mid-band: present and causal but not irreplaceable—"patient observer" would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Foresee: setup (implied in her chronicler role), development (paragraph 4: "able to foresee the shape of the years that awaited her…saw the mornings…evenings"), closure (informs her acceptance and final speech). Three gates met. Major turn: the foresight passage is the pivot where she processes future solitude and decides it's "not as a tragedy, but as a necessary molting." Causal: this action enables her final stance. Cost: what she foresees (loneliness) is the price she accepts. Strong integration; the foresight beat is the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Through tangential approach: setup (paragraph 3, "employed her usual method of understanding the world through a tangential approach, focusing her attention sideways"), development (watching pool/starfish instead of Kael's face), closure (this method yields the texture insight that enables her speech). Three gates met. Shapes attempts: the method is signaled, demonstrated, and causally determines her response. Cost: indirect observation risks missing Kael's emotional need but grants her deeper acceptance. Mechanics matter: looking "sideways to comprehend the center" is the tactical backbone. Highly integrated; swapping for "careful thought" would lose structural coherence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ancient grotto under stars: setup (paragraph 1, "ancient grotto…limestone ceiling opened like a fractured eye"), development (sanctuary for recording, now vessel for stillness; tide pool supplies observation material), closure (grotto echo merges with her voice in final line). Three gates met. Pressures choice: the pool's incoming tide and starfish enable her foresight. Micro-setting: the specific environment (fractured ceiling, tide pool, starlight) charges her observational method. Cost connection: the grotto will be her solitary future workspace. Strong but could score higher if spatial details constrained a physical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Across the pause in a difficult conversation: setup (title and opening, "silence…refusing to settle"), development (paragraphs track the stretching silence through cicada touches and observations), closure (she "finally broke the silence"). Three gates met. Tightens decisions: the extended pause is the frame for all her processing. Live clock: "silence had stretched thin, vibrating with tension" signals nearing end. However, the timeframe is more atmospheric container than active constraint—no moment where the silence's duration alters her tactics. Functional but replaceable with "during a night vigil" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>To discover the texture of time: setup (paragraph 2, "primary motivation…was not to formulate a counterargument, but to discover the texture of time"), development (paragraph 4, she decides texture is "fibrous and tough, like the husk of a coconut"), closure (this discovery enables her acceptance and release). Three gates met. Dramatized: she actively seeks and finds the answer through observation. Conflicted: the desire competes with potential need to argue or comfort Kael. Cost: the inquiry delays response and what she discovers (toughness, sustenance of memory) commits her to acceptance. Strong integration; the motivation drives structure and payoff.</comment>
