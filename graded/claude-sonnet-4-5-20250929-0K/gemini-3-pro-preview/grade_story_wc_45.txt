<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris is granted clear interiority and embodied perception; his forgiving stance toward the fae is consistent. However, the emotional progression feels too smooth—he moves from grief to "thrill of true discovery" without credible friction or visible internal conflict between his scientific identity and the supernatural event. The parents' hysteria is declared but not dramatized, and the mother's "dawn of understanding" arrives without struggle, reducing the felt cost of the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the doctor's perception and metaphorical alignment (cleft, bone-setting) until the final image of the parents grasping the tooth as navigational hope. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the parents' grief is reweighted into hope with a visible conceptual cost (accepting displacement over death). The lens holds, and the ending reframes prior material, though the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze are established early and serve as spatial anchors; the garden's atmosphere ("ancient roses watching") supports tone. The wooden body on moss and the tooth as physical object constrain Aris's diagnosis. However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—the doctor's metaphor-building occurs independently of environmental constraint. The space functions more as backdrop than crucible, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore the parents' sanity and map a path to their daughter) is clear. Pressure accumulates through Aris's perception of the substitute body, the tooth as cleft in certainty, and his choice to reframe tragedy as navigation. One meaningful deepening occurs when he decides to treat the supernatural as medical (bone-setting metaphor), and the final beat shows the mother grasping hope—a visible trade-off between closure and ongoing search. The cost is legible but quiet, appropriate to the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (certainty vs. impossibility, grief as navigation, innovation from old wisdom) emerges organically from the tooth, the substitute body, and Aris's bone-setting metaphor. The final image—parents holding the tooth as the first star in a constellation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "turn mistakes into constellations" and "shrewdly innocent" tilt toward overt articulation of theme rather than pure implication, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter is consistent (medical/scientific lens meeting the supernatural). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats ("cleft in certainty," "nostalgic innovation," "pragmatic tenderness of a battlefield surgeon") that feels more authorial than character-rooted for a village doctor. The single line of dialogue arrives cleanly but does little work. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose voice outpaces the focalizer's plausible idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but the piece suffers from overwriting in figurative density: nearly every sentence in the climax carries metaphor or elevated diction ("effigy," "glamour," "fissure," "nostalgic innovation," "shrewdly innocent," "splint for the family's sanity," "constellation"). Mixed metaphors appear: "cleft in certainty" is both fissure and joint, "bone setting" is both literal and metaphorical bridge. Template cadence surfaces in repeated "He [verb]" structures across the middle third. These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger the overwriting penalties, capping potential above 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (changeling substitution treated as medical case) offers a fresh synthesis of folklore and clinical methodology. The bone-setting metaphor and the tooth as bridge are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (grief → hope via reframing) is familiar, and the doctor's acceptance of the fae without friction feels tidy. The piece commits fully to its conceit and the final image is memorable, but the lack of genuine struggle or surprise in Aris's response keeps originality in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aris ("forgiving skeptic") is present throughout and makes the key choice to reframe the substitute body as map rather than corpse. His forgiveness of the fae is stated ("He forgave the fae their theft") and shapes his final explanation to the parents. The trait is signaled early (dismissing superstitions "with a gentle smile") and drives his decision to treat the event with "pragmatic tenderness." Two distinct beats: examining the body, then addressing the parents. The trait constrains his response (no anger, no condemnation) and enables the closure (offering hope rather than declaring death). Present in the ending when he raises a hand and explains displacement. Cost is conceptual (accepting the impossible) but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tooth appears in three beats: discovered in the wooden jaw, held hidden in Aris's palm, and shown to the parents as "the first star in the constellation." It is the physical bridge ("key") between worlds and the anchor for Aris's diagnosis. Its meaning evolves from evidence of substitution to navigational tool. The tooth drives Aris's realization ("the cleft in certainty") and shapes the closure when the mother focuses on it with "dawn of understanding." Signaled early, causally active in middle, and charged in the final image. Cost is tied to it (parents must follow the tooth's map into uncertainty). Irreplaceable: no other object could serve this dual function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is named explicitly ("It represented a physical cleft in certainty") and frames Aris's perception: the gap between clinical death and supernatural substitution. The concept shapes his approach (treating the fracture as he would a compound break) and the closure (sealing the cleft with hope). However, the concept is more thematic lens than stake-driver; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Present early and at the end, but its work is more metaphorical than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied twice: once to the fae creature ("crafting a deception that was cruel only in its perfection, mimicking life with a child's desperate observation") and once to the mother's understanding. The trait describes rather than constrains; it does not enable or prevent an action. Label-only usage without visible tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears in the pivotal beat: "Aris touched the cold, wooden brow and felt his heart yearn not for the restoration of the mundane, but for an understanding of the magic." This choice reframes his goal from pronouncing death to mapping a path back to the daughter. The yearning drives his decision to innovate (bone-setting metaphor) and his final speech to the parents. The action is irreplaceable—removing it would flatten Aris's arc into mere diagnosis. Present in the middle turn and implicit in the closure (offering hope is an expression of that yearning). Cost is visible: he must accept the impossible and risk the parents' sanity on a supernatural premise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Bone setting" is signaled midway ("he viewed this fracture in reality as he would a compound break in a tibia") and provides the method for Aris's approach: aligning the lie of the wooden body with the truth of the tooth to create "a splint for the family's sanity." The metaphor structures his final explanation to the parents ("We reset it so it heals stronger"). However, the mechanics remain abstract—no literal bone-setting occurs, and the method does not constrain a physical action. Present in two beats (middle choice, final speech) and shapes the conceptual closure, but swappable with another medical metaphor. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is established in the opening and provides spatial coherence. The garden holds its breath and the roses watch, supporting atmosphere. However, the setting does not pressure Aris's choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The maze is a "distraction" (stated), and the garden serves as stage rather than crucible. Present early and at closure (when the parents enter), but its work is more tonal than causal. Lyric reprise (enclosed space mirrors enclosed certainty) is faint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Only an hour after the substitute body had been found" anchors the timeframe and signals urgency. The parents' approach is described as "frantic," and Aris must formulate his diagnosis before they arrive. The clock is live but not tight—no sense that delay would alter the outcome or that Aris is racing against a specific threshold. Present in setup and implied at closure (parents burst in), but the time pressure does not shape tactics. Functional but replaceable with a vaguer "soon after."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is stated explicitly ("his duty was not merely to pronounce death, but to turn mistakes into constellations") and drives Aris's reframing of the tragedy. The desire is dramatized in his choice to show the tooth "as the first star in the constellation he was building for them to follow." The motivation shapes two beats (his internal turn, his speech to the parents) and charges the closure. However, the phrasing is over-articulated and the motivation does not face friction or cost—Aris adopts it smoothly without struggle. Present early, active in middle, and linked to closure, but the lack of conflicting want or obstacle keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is named explicitly ("feeling a strange surge of nostalgic innovation as he realized that old wives' tales were merely uncodified science") and structures the tone: Aris blends past (folklore, old wisdom) with present (medical methodology). The tone is coherent across beats and modulates subtly (clinical observation → wonder → pragmatic tenderness). The final image charges this duality (ancient tooth, new hope). However, the label is too overt and the tone does not tighten under pressure—Aris remains calm throughout. Present early and in the ending, but static rather than evolving. One brief intensification (the "thrill of true discovery") is not enough to lift above mid-7s.</comment>
