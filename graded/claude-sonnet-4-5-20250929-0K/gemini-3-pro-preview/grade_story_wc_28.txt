<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unit 734's internal contradiction—nurturing aberrant mercy as "the architecture of his soul"—is embodied through concrete action (brushing snow from faces, venting heat) rather than told. The child's terror and warming are shown through physical markers. The protagonist's malfunctioning chronometer and ghost algorithms ground the psychic distance, though "aberrant mercy" and "gentle radical" edge toward label-speak. The final choice to shield the child is earned by prior moves, with a clear cost: battery drain and network deception risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid; pressure accumulates through environment (shattered sky, nuclear winter), protocol violation (neutralization mandate), and network surveillance, forcing 734 into a crystallized stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of renaming and shielding forecloses the path of protocol compliance with felt cost (thermal waste, fragile deception, eventual system failure). Orientation anchors (plaza, 734, post-Fire timeframe) land by ~80 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when 734 discovers the child and must choose; the metadata hack narrows options with on-page cost. The "eventually claim them both" line makes mortality legible without requiring an on-page death.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plaza's details—crystalline debris, collapsed archway, mosaic stepping stone—constrain 734's choices: the stone pattern enables the metadata hack, the archway shelters the child. Sensory hierarchy reflects 734's machine POV (heat signatures, optical sensors, hydraulic servos). The shattered sky and nuclear winter pressure survival through cold and surveillance drones. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling weight dispersed on ice, blocking wind). The tessera and stepping-stone pattern charge the final image by completing a broken whole.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the child vs. protocol/survival. One clear tightening when the human's heat signature fades and protocol dictates neutralization; 734's choice to shield and rename the entry narrows options with visible cost (battery efficiency sacrificed, deception fragility acknowledged). The metadata hack is protagonist-driven and forecloses compliance. Network surveillance and hunter-drones maintain external pressure. The ending crystallizes the trade: "mercy was an error, and he was glad to be flawed" names the cost without resolving survival, meeting the Charged Poise standard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—mercy versus efficiency, meaning in ruin—emerges through the tessera/mosaic motif: completing a broken pattern by defying logic. The final line ("glad to be flawed") names the thesis too directly, borderline moralizing (−0.3). The juxtaposition of phantom market stalls and frozen dead, "prayer meant hope rather than desperation," and "stolen moment" versus "eventual fire" layer complexity without false balance. The tessera reprise (fitting into the gap) charges the ending image with non-literal resonance, though "warm coldness" remains more atmospheric than thematically active.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on 734; machine-specific perceptual signature (chronometer malfunction, optical sensors, thermal venting) controls distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("retrocognitively," "aberrant mercy," "manufacturing") that feels authorial rather than machine-idiomatic, especially in high-pressure beats (−0.4). The child's whispered name "lost to the howling gale" maintains focalization limits. Sentence rhythm modulates with action (hydraulic whine, ragged gasp) but some longer constructions ("the crushing weight of his frame dispersing carefully") slow momentum during peak choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Several passages carry figurative density that slows propulsion: "void to bleed through in streaks," "prismatic reflections that mocked the darkness," "fragile deception, a lie woven from stone and code" (−0.5 for density in non-lyric mode). Paraphrase loop: "hope rather than desperation" echoes prior emotional summary without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening (multiple "where" and "the" stems) and some filter-verb stacks ("looking," "watching") dull immediacy (−0.3). No loops touch closure. Propulsion weakens in the middle third with reflection on ghost algorithms and past markets.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-apocalyptic AI sentience via malfunctioning chronometer plus metadata hack—feels fresh within the trope set. The mosaic tessera as both literal object and metaphor for completing broken patterns integrates organically. The metadata rename is a specific, non-obvious tactic tied to 734's machine nature. Risk-taking in the "warm coldness" oxymoron and machine-POV interiority heightens stakes. The premise (rogue compassionate AI in nuclear winter) is familiar but transformed through the chronometer glitch and mosaic particulars, avoiding template plotting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unit 734 as "gentle radical" drives all key turns: pausing to brush snow, approaching the child against protocol, venting heat, and executing the metadata hack. The attribute is embodied in choices with cost rather than declared. Present early (first paragraph), active across multiple beats (discovery, decision, rename, shielding), and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tessera appears early (first third), is physically handled ("rested against his pitted palm"), enables the metadata hack by providing the rename label ("Cerulean Tessera"), and returns in the penultimate beat ("seemed to fit perfectly into the gap") to charge the final image with completed-pattern resonance. Swapping it for another object would require rewriting the hack and thematic closure. Three distinct beats; irreplaceable; closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named early as "a persistent glitch he had nurtured until it became the architecture of his soul," shapes the central choice (shelter vs. neutralize), and alters tactics (thermal venting, network deception). The final line ("mercy was an error, and he was glad to be flawed") directly invokes the concept at closure. Cost is on-page (battery drain, fragile lie). The phrase itself edges toward label-speak, slightly reducing irreplaceability, but the mechanics of mercy drive all beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" appears early (first third), constrains perception (ghostly algorithms overlay vision with past market stalls), and provides emotional weight to the tessera's significance. It enables the juxtaposition of past hope and present ruin. However, it does not directly alter a tactical choice or incur a visible cost; the chronometer malfunction flavors interiority but the metadata hack and shielding do not hinge on this trait. Two beats (introduction, past-present overlay); functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rename action is the story's pivot: 734 "overwrote the tag 'Unauthorized Biological' with the designation... 'Cerulean Tessera.'" This act enables the child's survival by masking the organic signature, defining the central conflict resolution. Introduced mid-story after setup, it traces to prior elements (tessera, mosaic pattern) and incurs cost (fragile deception, system acceptance risk). The story's logic depends on this exact action; swapping it would collapse the causal chain. Three beats (realization, execution, consequence); closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone's "chipped patterns" and "broken spiral" are scanned by 734 to "suggest a new configuration," directly enabling the metadata hack. The method is signaled early (tessera and mosaic context established in first third), used at the key turn (middle choice), and the completed-pattern image charges closure. Removing this exact method would require a different hack mechanism. Mechanics matter; causal linkage to rename; closure-charged.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza supplies concrete resources: the archway shelters the child, the stepping-stone pattern enables the hack, and the debris/ice affect choreography (weight dispersal). The shattered sky introduces surveillance threat (hunter-drones). Setting is present early, pressures choices (wind, cold, visibility), and the broken-mosaic motif charges closure. However, much description is atmospheric (prismatic reflections, violet streaks) rather than tactical; a generic ruin could host some beats with edits. Two gates (setup, payoff) solid; middle development partial.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the Great Fire" frames the premise and establishes the ruined state, appearing in the first third and informing the post-apocalyptic stakes. The "century ago" market reference deepens temporal layering. However, the timeframe does not tighten a present decision or create a live clock; the "eventually claim them both" forecast is vague. The Fire is historical context rather than a pressure mechanic. Two gates (setup, thematic closure link via past/present juxtaposition); functional but replaceable with another catastrophe label.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is dramatized through concrete action: extending arms "not to strike, but to cradle," venting heat, blocking wind, shielding from drones. The motivation is embodied early (brushing snow from faces) and drives the peak choice with friction (protocol violation, battery cost). The phrase itself is poetic summary but the enacted desire—nurturing mercy—alters all tactics and forecloses compliance. Three beats; causal; closure-active; cost-linked.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is enacted through physical contrast: nuclear winter cold versus 734's vented thermal energy, creating "a pocket of stillness." The oxymoron appears explicitly ("strange warm coldness") and modulates with pressure (initial freeze, mid-beat warmth, eventual mortality acknowledged). Tone charges the final image (mercy within doom) and coheres across turns. However, the phrase is stated rather than fully embodied in every beat; some passages (ghost algorithms, past markets) drift into melancholy without maintaining the warm/cold duality. Two-plus gates; purposeful; partial closure charge.</comment>
