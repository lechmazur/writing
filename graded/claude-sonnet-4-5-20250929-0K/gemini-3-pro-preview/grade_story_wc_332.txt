<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior state is well-grounded in embodied sensation ("gnawed at the center of her chest," "sweat prickling her skin") and her choices follow a consistent logic: capture the dawn, paint the dream-city, discharge the longing. The character's professional skills anchor motivation without exposition, and the final unburdening reads earned. However, internal contradiction is limited—she pursues a single vector without competing impulses—and the climactic painting sequence lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the terrace paragraph. The piece accumulates density through imagery and ritual until the light-construct unravels, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cipher solved, pain discharged) with felt cost: the dream is consumed in the act of capturing it. Causality is clean—sunrise enables the harvest, palette stores luminance, stylus constructs the city—and the final emptiness reweights the opening ache. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Whispering Archipelago is vivid and consistent: sentient geology, erosion prophecies, sea-cave syllables. The terrace, camera, palette, and stylus are all handled on the page, and the sun's position governs the sequence. The islands' vocal chorus during the climax charges the moment, and the palette's shift from glowing to dull white anchors the before/after. Micro-setting (palette, stylus, display) constrains the method and shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake: capture the runaway dream to solve the cipher of longing. The piece tightens through urgency ("worked faster, sweat prickling") and the time window (sun fully detaching). The final unraveling forecloses retrieval—the dream is translated and discharged—with visible cost: the glowing charge is spent, the construct scatters. Agency is clear (she paints the vision), and the resolution is earned by her craft. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; however, no live option or trade-off appears on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: longing as cipher, beauty as discharge mechanism, luminous absence as paradox. The final image—dull ceramic after glowing charge—resonates without stating a moral. The light-construct "emphasizes the dark space where a real place should have been" offers non-literal thematic weight. However, lines like "the code of her pain had been translated into beauty" edge toward summary, and the emotional arc resolves tidily without ambiguity or counter-reading. The piece invites reflection but lacks the complexity for higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "odd-hour librarian," "organized the silences," "burning map of her desire." Diction is purposeful and elevated without breaking POV (e.g., "liquid garnet," "viscous potential"). Psychic distance modulates cleanly from external ritual to interior urgency. Register is consistent, though phrases like "luminous absence" and "tone of luminous absence" approach abstract labeling. No head-hopping, dialogue absent. Compression and figurative density are high, voice-motivated, and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences carry momentum, but figurative density is high in nearly every line without pattern-teaching: "fabric of the night began to fray," "photon spill," "viscous potential," "burning map of her desire," "harmless dust motes." Mixed metaphors appear ("cipher of longing" shifts to "emotional code," then "geometric form to the ghost"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("sanctuary she had never visited but loved desperately"). Template cadence in the climax: "She constructed... She dipped... Elara worked..." The cascade of metaphors in peak beats triggers −0.5 for density and −0.3 for coherence under the Overwriting Checks, preventing entry to 8.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—painting with harvested light to vitalize a dream—is fresh and specific, avoiding stock fantasy tropes. The watercolor palette filled with luminance, the glass stylus, and the three-dimensional architecture of brilliance are memorable particulars. However, the emotional problem (runaway dream, aching longing) and resolution (discharge through beauty) follow a familiar therapeutic arc. The transformation test is borderline: swap "light" for "sound" or "memory" and the emotional logic remains unchanged. Risk-taking in imagery and ritual elevates within the band, but the core template is recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices drive all beats: step out, harvest light, paint the vision. Her professional skill (organizing silences) primes the method but does not constrain a choice. The final rest is a consequence of her action. Two gates: setup (first paragraph), payoff (ending rest). Middle development is weak—she executes a plan without friction or trade-off. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but missing middle cap at 4.6 is lifted by causal pressure (+0.8) and specificity (+0.4). Late-arrival and swappability penalties do not apply. Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The watercolor palette appears in three beats: carried out, filled with luminance, emptied at the end. Its shift from dry to glowing to dull white tracks the narrative arc and charges the final image. Setup (terrace), development (harvest), payoff (empty white). All three gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (ceramic wells, no pigment) +0.5, cost connection (emptiness as discharge) +0.4. No major frictions. Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "cipher of longing" frames the problem and reappears at closure: "the cipher was solved; the code of her pain had been translated into beauty." It shapes stakes (must capture the dream) and the final discharge. Setup (early paragraphs), payoff (explicit statement at end). Missing middle development—it is named but does not constrain a mid-sequence choice. Two gates: cap guidance ~6.0. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (motivates ritual) +0.8. Swappability −0.4 (near-synonym "puzzle of yearning"). Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is the method's core. She harvests photon spill, fills palette wells with luminance, strokes air with a glass stylus, and constructs the city. The trait enables every beat and constrains the sequence: sunrise required, camera as harvest mechanism, palette as medium. Setup (palette paragraph), development (harvest and painting), payoff (construct and discharge). All three gates. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (unique method) +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7. No frictions. Score: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears explicitly: "to vitalize the phantom image" and "to vitalize the memory was to grant it a momentary, independent existence." The action defines the climax—she gives the dream geometric form, walks its streets, then it unravels. Setup (stated purpose), development (construction), payoff (the city glimmers, then scatters). All three gates. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6. Swappability −0.3 ("manifest" could substitute). Score: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is the harvest mechanism: "camera... harvest mechanism," "triggered the shutter," "placing her hand over the camera's display to catch the photon spill." Setup (tripod and camera paragraph), development (shutter and harvest), payoff (sun fully detached, construct unravels). All three gates. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables the ritual) +1.0, specificity (tripod, display, photon spill) +0.6. Swappability −0.4 (any light-capture device could work with minor edits). Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Whispering Archipelago is vivid: sentient geology, muttering prophecies, sea-caves chorus. It provides atmosphere and a vocal response during the climax ("raised its voice in chorus"). Setup (early paragraphs), development (background static), payoff (chorus during painting, then silence). All three gates. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource—she could perform the ritual anywhere with sunrise. Ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.5 (any liminal coastal setting). Score: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" and "a time when the laws of reality felt thin and pliable" establish tone and permission for magic. The sunrise window creates urgency ("as the sun fully detached from the water, the light-construct unraveled"). Setup (explicit timeframe paragraph), payoff (sun detaching triggers unraveling). Missing middle development—time is not tracked beat-by-beat. Two gates: cap guidance ~6.0. Early signal +0.6, causal pressure (enables and closes the window) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9. Swappability −0.5 (any liminal time). Summary-only in middle −0.4. Late penalty does not apply. Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To capture a runaway dream" motivates all action: "desperate to capture," "hollow ache," "cipher of longing," "burning map of her desire." Setup (early paragraphs), development (urgency: "worked faster"), payoff (dream captured and discharged, "unburdened"). All three gates. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.1, cost connection (dream consumed in capture) +0.5. However, no friction between wants—she pursues one vector without trade-off. Label-only at times ("gnawed at the center of her chest"). Ornamental −0.4, label-only −0.3. Score: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is stated: "radiating a tone of luminous absence... a paradox of presence... entirely of light that served only to emphasize the dark space." Tone is consistent—elegiac, yearning, charged—and modulates with urgency during the climax. Setup (concept seeded in early mood), development (builds through ritual), payoff (explicit statement and final emptiness). All three gates. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.3, coherence across turns +0.8. However, tone is somewhat static—no sharp modulation—and the phrase is over-articulated rather than earned through image alone. Label-only −0.5, ornamental phrasing −0.3. Score: 6.9.</comment>
