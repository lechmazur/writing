<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas is motivated by clear arrogance and nobility, manipulating radio frequencies to orchestrate revolution through Kael. His realization that "the shadows he had weaponized were not his servants; they were the true masters" shows internal contradiction dramatized through loss of control. However, the interiority leans toward summary rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure; his slumping into the chair and philosophical acceptance feel declared rather than earned through moment-by-moment struggle. The final renunciation reads as Earned Stasis but the emotional progression from satisfaction to defeat lacks granular contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Silas, observatory, tempest outside). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas recognizes his exile from the dawn he sparked, the radio equipment hums abandonment, and he accepts loneliness as "the necessary price." Cost is felt—he remains trapped behind glass while the revolution blooms without him. One meaningful deepening occurs when variant allegiance shifts loyalty from broadcaster to subject, narrowing Silas's options and reweighting his control. The piece holds its lens through image and cadence shift, though the causality of "variant allegiance" as a phenomenon feels asserted rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and purposeful: cobalt glass portico, steam-driven engines, clockwork starlings, rusted audio equipment. The blue glow bathes Silas repeatedly, and the portico rattles "with a sympathetic resonance that felt like the laughter of the storm," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (tower above clouds, valleys below, thermal monitors). The setting subtly mirrors internal loss—glass wall becomes prison, machinery turns against him. Sensory hierarchy fits POV (technical observer noting heat maps, audio signals). The cobalt portico constrains by separating Silas from the world he wants to shape and returns in the ending to underscore his exile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Silas's mission to shape the revolution through controlled signals. One meaningful tightening occurs when variant allegiance transfers loyalty to Kael, forcing Silas to realize his loss of control ("the static in the observatory screamed in agreement, drowning out Silas's attempts to correct the script"). The escalation is dramatized through Silas frantically turning dials and being mocked by his own machinery. Agency is renunciation—he accepts his role as spectator with visible cost (loneliness, exclusion from the dawn). However, the variant allegiance mechanism feels somewhat abstract and asserted rather than built beat-by-beat; the tightening is present but could constrain more concretely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and event: the visionary architect loses control to the living chaos he sparked. "He had forgotten that the dawn is an uncontrollable event, a cosmic inevitability that cannot be choreographed" reframes the premise without moralizing. The cobalt glass portico, ancient shadows, and fragmented frequencies recur and shift meaning—control becomes separation, wisdom becomes weaponized ghosts. Subtext operates in the storm's "laughter," the clockwork birds' "discordant chirps," the dial tone of abandonment. The ending offers a resonant answer (Silas shaped the dawn but cannot walk in it) that arises from the conflict between intellect and organic revolution. Minor reliance on stated insight ("finally understanding") edges toward telling, but the final image charges it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Silas with consistent distance and perceptual signature (technical observer noting "thermal imaging monitors," "brass loupes," "analytical engines"). Voice has texture: "gritty whimsy," "celestial disk jockey," "sympathetic resonance." Diction mostly fits a lonely intellectual, though phrases like "violent and beautiful blooming of fire and liberty" and "cosmic inevitability" drift toward elevated abstraction at peak moments. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during his realization, pulling back for the final paragraph). Filter verbs ("watched," "listened," "realized") appear frequently but are voice-consistent for a reflective observer. One mild register slip: "variant allegiance" and "darker theories of communication" read slightly expository for heated crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("cathedral of gritty whimsy," "fever map," "ghostly will"). Clarity is mostly strong, though density dips in the middle third with synonym loops: "manipulate," "orchestrate," "shape," "manufactured" cluster without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle: "The narrative Silas had so carefully constructed began to unfold... Kael stopped waiting... The prophet shouted..." (three consecutive "The [subject] [verb]" stems). Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors ("ancient shadows," "fragmented frequencies," "wild magic," "cosmic inevitability") without full pattern-teaching. Closure beats are cleaner. Information density is high overall, but scaffold phrases like "with a sinking heart" and "finally understanding" dull immediacy at key moments. No major loops or causality breaks, but mid-story artifacts prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio manipulation, signal allegiance, and prophet-grooming offers a non-obvious angle on creator-versus-creation. "Variant allegiance" as a named phenomenon and the clockwork starlings "singing in binary" bring specificity. The turn (signals develop collective will and transfer loyalty) feels earned in hindsight by the setup of "emotional weight of ancient shadows." Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on the exact mechanism (fragmented radio, static as ghostly will). However, the lonely-visionary-loses-control-of-creation frame echoes Frankenstein and similar templates; the gritty-whimsy steampunk setting adds texture but doesn't fully escape genre familiarity. The story commits fully to its premise and the closing image is memorable, but the core dynamic is recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas (lonely visionary) is present throughout. Early signal: introduced paragraph one. Beat involvement: watches monitors with satisfaction (middle), frantically turns dials when allegiance shifts (late middle), slumps and accepts exile (ending). Causal pressure: his isolation enables the experiment but also his blindness to organic chaos; his loneliness is reframed as "necessary price" at closure. Cost tied to trait: isolation forecloses his participation in the dawn. Closure linkage strong. Swappability low—his arrogance and exile drive the loss of control. Minor penalty for partial summary of key turns rather than full dramatization of micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico appears in opening (Silas stares through it), recurs ("bathed in the blue glow"), and returns at closure (rattles, casts "melancholic shadows"). Setup clear. Development: separates sanctuary from tempest, but does not constrain a middle choice—it remains descriptive backdrop. Payoff: present in final beat, charges the image of Silas trapped behind glass. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (barrier becomes prison). Two touches across beginning and end, but no middle causal use. Irreplaceability moderate—any barrier would work, though cobalt-blue specificity adds texture. Score reflects strong setup and closure linkage but missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Variant allegiance (core concept) is introduced by name midpoint ("a phenomenon known in the darker theories of communication"), shapes the major turn (signals shift loyalty to Kael, forcing Silas's loss of control), and is present at closure (allegiance "fully transferred"). Setup slightly late but explained. Development: directly narrows Silas's options—he cannot correct the script, machinery turns against him. Payoff: "the allegiance of the signal had fully transferred" articulates the final state. Causal pressure strong. Specificity high—this exact mechanism drives the loss. Minor penalty for being named/explained rather than entirely dramatized through prior signal behavior, and for late first appearance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lyrically prophetic (attribute) appears in the setup ("sending signals that were lyrically prophetic, weaving metaphors of iron and light") and is demonstrated in the quoted transmission ("The sky is not empty, but full of gears turning for your salvation"). Development weak: the lyric quality is mentioned but does not constrain a middle choice or create visible tradeoff—Silas's method works until allegiance shifts, which is unrelated to the lyric nature. Payoff: lyric quality is absent from closure image. One beat of use. Swappable—any persuasive rhetoric would serve. No on-page cost tied to this trait. Score reflects functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unfold (action) appears in "the narrative Silas had so carefully constructed began to unfold in erratic, organic patterns that defied his control." Setup: the narrative exists. Development: the unfolding "in erratic patterns" marks the major turn where Silas loses control. Payoff: "He watched the history of the city unfold on his screens" shows him as passive spectator. Two touches. Causal role moderate—the unfolding is the shape of the loss, but does not drive tactics. Swappability moderate; "evolve" or "develop" could substitute with minor edits. Lyric reprise (carefully constructed → erratic unfold → violent/beautiful blooming) reweights. Score reflects solid mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies (method) are signaled early ("manipulate the world below through fragmented radio frequencies," "splicing together the static-laden voices of the past") and appear across beats: nightly transmission, Kael listening, feedback loops noticed, static screaming, radio equipment humming final note. Setup strong. Development: the fragmented nature (emotional weight, ghostly will) enables variant allegiance—the method's mechanics matter to the turn. Payoff: "The radio equipment hummed a final, steady note, a dial tone of abandonment" closes the connection. Three beats. Causal pressure high. Irreplaceability high—"fragmented" carries thematic weight (patchwork authority fractures). Cost present (abandonment).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds (setting) is present throughout: opening establishes "creaking, stormlit observatory above the clouds, where the air was thin and the solitude was absolute," recurs in blue glow and rattling portico, and frames closure ("listening to the wind howl against the observatory"). Setup immediate. Development: the elevation and isolation enable the experiment but do not constrain a middle choice with visible cost—Silas's loss occurs via signal allegiance, not spatial limit. Payoff: the setting charges the final image (trapped in tower, separated by glass). Micro-setting (cobalt portico) does more causal work. Irreplaceability moderate; any isolated high place would serve the theme. Score reflects strong atmospheric presence but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" is stated in setup and frames the scope (Silas has groomed Kael "from afar," "night after night"). Development: "as the movement grew" marks progression, but the timeframe does not tighten a specific decision or create a live clock—the story is retrospective summary until the final crisis. Payoff: the ending acknowledges the prophet's rise is complete, but no deadline pressured Silas's choices. Functional scope marker but does not constrain tactics or alter moves. Swappable with "over months" or similar. No visible cost tied to duration. Score reflects present but replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early and dramatized: Silas splices dead philosophers and martyrs, watches rebellion spread, confronts loss when the dawn unfolds without him. Setup clear. Development: desire drives nightly transmissions and monitoring, but the cost (arrogance vs. nobility) is more told than shown in a middle choice. Payoff strong: "He had wanted to bring the dawn, but he had forgotten that the dawn is an uncontrollable event" and "he would not be invited to walk in its light" articulate the price. Two beats. Causal pressure solid. Irreplaceability moderate—specific phrasing ("ancient shadows") ties to method. Minor penalty for the motivation being more narrated goal than conflicted micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Gritty whimsy (tone) is established early: "cathedral of gritty whimsy," steam engines, clockwork starlings singing binary, rusted audio. The whimsy is present in "celestial disk jockey" and playful metaphors; the grit in "smog-choked valleys," "fever map," storm and decay. Tone modulates under pressure: whimsy darkens when birds chirp "discordant," "mocking his futility"; machinery "turned against him." Closure retains both: melancholic blue shadows (whimsy) and abandonment dial tone (grit). Coherence across turns strong. The tone charges the final image (playful workshop becomes prison). Minor penalty for slight tilt toward elevated lyricism in final third that edges past the established register. Score reflects strong tonal control with minor drift.</comment>
