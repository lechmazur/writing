<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt-driven motivation is consistently embodied through her trembling hands and the tactile work with the stylus-as-tattoo-gun. The backstory moment ("where there should have been a lullaby") is brief but anchors her present desperation. Internal contradiction surfaces when she whispers "Stay with me" while working feverishly—care layered with technical urgency. The final act of holding the warm amber with its constellation-like fractures shows earned change, though the prior causality could be tighter; the guilt transforms into peaceful rest rather than erasure, a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara gives the memory a place to rest rather than erasing it, forecloses resurrection, and the oppressive silence shifts to peaceful. The inferred lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid—boot sequence initiates, waveform destabilizes, she completes the connection, and the amber traps the sound. Orientation anchors by line 2 (Elara, Laboratory, present action). One meaningful tightening: the cry intensifies, threatening overload, forcing her feverish precision under a closing time-loop. Cost is legible on-page: she does not bring the dead back but accepts the difference, and the weight lifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory's "silence...suspended" and "meteor hush" establish atmospheric pressure from the first line. The amber fossil functions as micro-setting, handled twice (arranging components, holding it up to light) and constraining the tethering act. Spatial choreography is clean: console center, screen, speakers, stylus interface. The room's warping geometry and shadow-stretching at the time-fold moment directly pressure Elara's window to act. The final amber-as-constellation image charges closure by making the laboratory's archive function concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: hush the guilt's dissonance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cry intensifies and threatens to shatter the fossil, forcing Elara to work "with feverish precision" in the seconds before the loop snaps shut. Agency is clear: she modifies the stylus, draws the waveform into a stable loop, completes the connection. The time constraint (loop closing) and mechanical constraint (overload risk) are legible. Cost is visible: she accepts that echoes are caught, not erased, and the crushing weight lifts only after she relinquishes resurrection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber's dual function: ancient trap and new archive. The letters' insight—"echoes could be caught, not erased, and that difference was everything"—is earned by Elara's on-page struggle rather than asserted. The constellation image at the end reweights the opening "constellation tattooist" detail, turning mourning-work into fixed-point preservation. The piece resists tidy absolution: Elara does not resurrect but gives memory a resting place, accepting a quiet cost. No overt moralizing; the final image offers a resonant answer to whether guilt can be hushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature is consistent: ink-stained fingers, tactile console work, connecting spikes "just as she used to connect freckles on skin." Diction remains stable, though "visceral ache" and "crushing weight" are near-clichés. The single line of dialogue ("Stay with me") is purpose-driven, goal-oriented whisper under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to shudder," "seemed to warp") appear but are sparing and voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens cleanly during the climax when tears blur her vision and she ignores them. Minor: "recognized with a visceral ache" is slightly over-explained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "rough, unpolished piece of amber" grounds setting, stakes, and machine logic). Two minor loops: "designed to interpret...now specifically translates" feels like a restatement across adjacent beats, and "shifted from oppressive to peaceful" slightly summarizes what the prior line already showed. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed register: "lines of code that wept and stuttered" anthropomorphizes code but is then immediately literalized by "visual representation of a wail," creating mild incoherence. No fatal artifacts, but the density slips slightly in the expository middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, and amber-as-anchor is specific and non-obvious. The premise—translating baby cries into star-system coordinates—avoids generic grief machinery by making the glitch both tragic and functional. The time-fold constraint creates urgency without gimmickry. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on these exact elements; swapping "tattoo artist" or "amber" would break the constellation payoff. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyrical-technical register and delivers a fresh inflection when the amber traps sound alongside the insect, turning archive into constellation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara present throughout; her choices drive all key turns. She arranges components (setup), modifies the stylus and draws the waveform under pressure (development), completes the connection that offloads the firmware burden (closure). Her past as constellation tattooist directly enables the tethering method. Causal and irreplaceable; her specific skill-set makes the climax possible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amber introduced early as "focal point" and "grounding rod." Handled in at least three beats: arranging components, the insect shuddering with phantom life, and the final glow/cooling that traps the sound. Returns at closure with new fractures "like a constellation," reweighting its function from fossil to active archive. Closure would fail without this exact object; it is the physical anchor for the haunted firmware and the final repository.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is named and explained as "corrupted logic core" that translates cries into coordinates. It shapes the central problem: the firmware's ghostly burden must be offloaded. The glitch creates the tragic opportunity for redemption. Directly alters tactics: Elara must tether the signal before the firmware overloads. Payoff: the firmware "settled into a dormant state" after the burden is transferred. Essential to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Translates baby cries into navigational coordinates" is the specific glitch that creates both the problem and the method. Constrains Elara's window: she has seconds as the cry/signal translates and threatens overload. Enables the climax: she forces the waveform into a stable loop by drawing coordinate data. The translation mechanism is causally active at closure when the "agonizing wail softened into a rhythmic, gentle pulse." Cost is visible: the machine's output must be trapped or lost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tether" is the climactic action: "She had to tether the drifting consciousness to the amber, locking the coordinate data into the physical resin before the time loop snapped shut." This exact verb and technique redefine the stakes—she is not resurrecting but anchoring. The stylus-pressing and waveform-drawing are the physical execution of tethering. Without this specific action, the resolution collapses into summary. Swapping "capture" or "save" would weaken the specificity of locking to amber.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Handwritten letters in antique furniture appear in the setup paragraph, motivating Elara's months-long journey and providing the instructions she follows. The letters are credited with the warning about time folding and the final validation ("The letters had been right"). They frame expectation but do not constrain middle choices; the method is applied off-page before the story begins. Present in closure reasoning but not dramatized in the climax beat. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable—instructions could have arrived another way.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Laboratory of Lost Sounds named in the opening line and establishes the subterranean archive where "echoes came to die." The lab's geometry warps during the time fold, creating spatial pressure. The console, resonator, screen, and speakers are all tactile anchor points for Elara's work. The lab's function as an archive for sub-audible frequencies directly enables the machine's purpose. Closure image—amber glowing in "dim light"—uses the lab's atmosphere to charge the final moment. Setting shapes stakes and tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Time-folding is introduced as a phenomenon the letters warned of, "occurring only when time folds in on itself to allow the past to touch the present." This creates the narrow window: Elara has "only seconds to act before the signal dissipated into the void" and "before the time loop snapped shut." The warping and snapping back impose live urgency on her tethering action. The fold is both causal trigger and constraint; without it, the past cry cannot be accessed. Active at closure when "the room ceased...snapping the laboratory back into rigid, linear time."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation—"to hush the dissonance of old guilt that rang in her ears like tinnitus"—is introduced early and embodied through trembling hands and tears blurring her vision. The guilt is specified: "her own negligence had once resulted in a silence where there should have been a lullaby." This creates friction between the want (redemption) and the cost (accepting the dead stay dead). The final beat directly addresses the motivation: "the crushing weight of her past lifting as the silence...shifted from oppressive to peaceful." Desire shapes all choices and is resolved with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush right before impact" tone is established in the opening line and sustained through "suspended" silence, "heavy, breathless quality," and the warping shadows. The tone modulates appropriately: it tightens during the cry intensification ("sharp, frantic cry," "digital scream") and softens at closure ("rhythmic, gentle pulse," "peaceful" silence). The final image—warm amber held up to dim light—resolves the meteor-hush tension into quiet rest. Tone coherence is strong and charges the ending without becoming static.</comment>
