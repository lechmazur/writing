<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's internal life reads concrete and embodied: "told himself he was simply retrieving lost property" shows self-deception shaped by grief. His arc from night-shift hiding to accepting dawn through the violet vow is earned by the descent and release. Interiority remains particular—no therapy-speak—and the final moment forecloses his fear of silence with visible cost (carrying the memory back to the surface). Mild deduction: the secondary character (the woman) exists only in reflection; no on-page pressure tests the relationship except Silas's memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early: lamplighter, pier, harbor, descent. The causal chain is legible: Silas seeks jar 707 → uses key tag → opens cabinet → releases vow → sees violet sound → weeps → ascends carrying the truth. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he returns to his post no longer fearing silence, forecloses his decades-long evasion of dawn, and the cost is felt in "I will wait for you" → sunrise he missed. One tightening (the violet blooming from the jar) reweights the dominant stake. Mild slip: the mechanism of luminous vows is told briefly rather than earned through earlier dramatization of how promises manifest as light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the *Aurelia* anchors every choice: glass jars pulse with bioluminescence, anaerobic gloom preserves the archive, collapsed bulkheads guide his path. The brass key tag functions as lodestone and lock, constraining access. The violet ribbons swirl in murky water, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"low frequency that bypassed his ears and resonated directly in his bones"—and setting shapes both tactic (wandering through debris) and closure (the library's spectral glow frames the revelation). Environment is indispensable to the narrative's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to discover the color of sound / verify the vow's truth. One meaningful tightening: releasing the jar reweights his entire forty-year evasion when violet/gold blooms instead of the red or blue he feared. Agency is present—he chooses to unscrew the lid—and the cost is legible: weeping indistinguishable from the ocean, carrying the memory forward, no longer fearing silence. Escalation reads as accumulative pressure (descent → library → cabinet → release) under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens. Minor note: no on-page antagonist or reversal; pressure comes from internal dread rather than external opposition, which fits but limits band ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth-hiding versus confronting loss emerges from concrete particulars: the key tag, the violet sound, the forty-year descent, "hides behind truth" manifest in night-shift excuses and "simply retrieving lost property." The violet sunrise image reweights the premise without moralizing. "Brighter than any fire in the sky" resonates non-literally. Subtext operates through "tears indistinguishable from the ocean" and the silence "no longer heavy." No prompt labels or thematic echo at closure. The final image offers a resonant answer—grief acknowledged, dawn no longer feared—without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "curated the boundary between the solid earth and the hungry tide," "meteor hush," "ribbons of iridescent violet and gold." Diction elevates without breaking character—lamp lighter filtered through poetic grief. Psychic distance tightens at the jar opening. Mild slip: "hides behind truth" is articulated twice in near-identical phrasing ("allowed him to hide behind truth" / "another instance where he hid behind truth"), a small loop that slightly dulls momentum. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Voice modulates purposefully under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, state, or stakes. Clarity remains strong through complex action (descent, archive navigation, jar release). Minor artifacts: "hides behind truth" template repeats across two beats; "turned to leave the library" / "began his ascent" are slight scaffolding moves. Figurative language mostly coheres ("meteor hush," "violet echoes"), but "wrapped in a silence that felt like a meteor hush" front-loads the metaphor before pressure warrants it. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks. Propulsion is steady; peak beats (jar opening, weeping) remain clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Core premise—luminous vows archived in a sunken ship—offers a fresh synthesis of grief-quest and speculative world-building. "Color of sound" synesthesia anchors the emotional turn in concrete imagery (violet/gold ribbons). The lamplighter/sunken-library pairing feels particular rather than generic. Transformation test passes: the arc depends on this exact combination of archive, key, and vow-as-light. Minor deduction: the frame (night-shift lamplighter as grief avoidance) echoes familiar "character hides from past trauma" templates; specificity of the luminous-vow archive rescues originality, but the surrounding emotional calculus reads more dutiful than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Late-shift pier lamplighter: frames opening (extinguishes lamps, adjusts brass weights), middle (his duty lies beneath), and closure (returns to light lamps, no longer fears silence). Occupation shapes his self-description ("curated the boundary") and the brass-weights detail grounds the dive. His choice to descend, open the jar, and ascend altered drives all three beats. Cost visible: decades of evasion ended, tears, carrying violet memory forward. Early setup, middle constraint (descent is his trade reflex), closure charge (returns to post transformed). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hotel skeleton key tag 707: introduced early (withdrew from pocket), used mid-beat (held against cabinet glass, lock clicks), and present at closure (felt lighter, purpose fulfilled). Acts as lodestone, lock mechanism, and symbolic anchor. Shapes two distinct beats (signifying presence, opening archive) and charges the ending ("lighter in his hand"). Specific properties matter—number 707 guides him to the exact jar. Strong causal pressure; removal would break access logic. Very strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luminous vows: stakes depend entirely on this concept (promises captured as light, archive of the drowned, bioluminescent jars). Shapes tactics—Silas must reach the library, prove authority, release jar 707. Payoff is the violet/gold ribbons blooming from her voice. World rule taught through action (glass jars, spectral glow, essence trapped within). Without this concept, the story has no mechanism for grief resolution. Present in setup (library glows, jars pulse), middle (opens cabinet), closure (violet sound, memory captured). Essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth": trait named twice explicitly ("allowed him to hide behind truth," "another instance where he hid behind truth"). Constrains his framing ("simply retrieving lost property," "night shift because the pay was better"). Shapes his forty-year evasion and the final cost (can no longer hide). Visible tradeoff: decades lost to self-deception. Penalty: label-repetition slightly flattens what could have been shown through choices alone. Causal work is present but articulation undercuts subtlety. Mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signify: key action that enables access. "He needed to signify his presence to the archive, to prove he had the authority." Holds key tag against cabinet, lock clicks. Without this beat, no jar 707, no vow release, no closure. Specific mechanics matter—archive demands proof. Shapes middle turn (access granted) and is irreplaceable (swapping "signify" for "unlock" would lose the thematic resonance of proving authority to witness). Strong causal pressure, early setup, payoff at jar opening. Essential to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By wandering purposefully": method taught early ("did not swim frantically; rather, he moved by wandering purposefully"), explained ("every turn was calculated to navigate collapsed bulkheads and debris fields"). Shapes middle tactic—his path through the *Aurelia* is the descent. Mechanics matter: he avoids obstacles, reaches library. Mild penalty: the phrase appears once and is then glossed; the method itself (calculated navigation) recurs in action but not in charged language. Functional across beats but not indispensable—could describe as "navigated" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Forgotten library inside sunken ship: setup (silted deck of *Aurelia*, promenade, grand double doors), middle (shelves of glass jars, bioluminescence, cabinet 707), closure (replaced lid, turned to leave). Every choice depends on this location: descent, archive access, jar retrieval. Micro-setting (anaerobic gloom preserves the archive) explains world logic. Spatial choreography clear (pressed forward, loomed before him, lifted jar). Without this exact setting, the luminous-vow mechanism and Silas's quest collapse. Indispensable to stakes, tactics, and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sky lantern release: present in opening (thousands ascend, burning orange), bracketing closure (now burning out as he ascends). Time window is implicit—descent during the festival, ascent as lanterns fade. Does not tighten on-page decisions; Silas's moves underwater are not clocked against the lantern burn. Contrast with surface world charges the tone but does not alter tactics. Functional lyric reprise (early seed → final image), but no live pressure. Mid-band: meaningful atmosphere, minimal causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>To discover the color of sound: motivation signaled mid-story ("His motivation was singular and consuming"), dramatized at jar opening (unscrewed lid, hum resonated, ribbons bloomed), and resolved (violet/gold = sunrise). Desire drives descent, archive search, and release. Friction visible: "needed to know if the promise was red with passion or blue with sorrow" → cost of forty years waiting. The violet answer forecloses his evasion and charges the ending. Strong causal pressure, closure payoff, visible cost. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush": tone descriptor introduced early ("silence that felt like a meteor hush, that split-second of absolute stillness before an impact"). Modulates through descent (churning water, spectral glow, low frequency hum) and peaks at jar opening (ribbons spiral, weeping). Coherent: awe, dread, quiet intensity. Final image shifts tone—"silence of the deep was no longer heavy"—reconfiguring the hush from dread to acceptance. Charges closure by transforming the established mood. Strong tonal control under pressure; minor deduction for front-loading the metaphor before the descent earns it.</comment>
