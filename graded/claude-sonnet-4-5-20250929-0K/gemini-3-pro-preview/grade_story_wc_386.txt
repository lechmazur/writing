<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early but remains abstract: "to salvage something pure" exists as thesis rather than embodied conflict. The final move—whispering the boy's name to release his grief—arrives without prior resistance or micro-choices that force her to weigh competing goods. Interior experience leans heavily on exposition ("objects held the psychic resonance," "a cartography of the subconscious") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The boy's heroism is reconstructed off-page through dream analysis; Elara herself never confronts a choice that costs her something visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is legible by the opening paragraph (who, where, what), and the piece holds a single POV throughout. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through dream-shard accretion toward a final reconfiguration (the boy's courage revealed, grief lifted). However, closure cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"the heavy sensation of grief lifted" and "a lightness that felt like forgiveness" tell the transformation without an on-page image or action that makes the price undeniable. The synchronization of dream cameos is summary, not scene, which keeps the decisive reweighting conceptual rather than felt. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the final beat lacks visible friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine anchors the opening vividly and the "candle-lit" detail recurs at closure ("the candles flared"), charging the final image with a sensory callback. Micro-setting details—"pelt of white fur," "borrowed starlight," "cold air"—filter through Elara's professional lens and shape the ritual's atmosphere. However, the shrine itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as stage rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clean, and the melted snow globe's physical properties (tear-drop shape, soot swirl) are specific and handled on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revealing the boy's final act to free his spirit—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains conceptual. The dream-shard pattern accumulates information (florist in Vienna, mechanic in Lagos, pattern of exits/doorways) without on-page resistance or a live trade-off that narrows Elara's options. The final synchronization and whisper occur without friction; no sacrifice, misstep, or competing pressure tests her commitment. The boy's heroism is a discovery, not a choice Elara must force into being with visible cost. One tightening occurs (pattern recognized), but the resolution feels costless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—salvaging truth from tragedy—emerges organically from the wreck-diving premise and the boy's reconstructed heroism. The melted snow globe shifts from "lost innocence" to "testament to endured heat," a purposeful reweighting. However, the final paragraph edges toward articulation: "to salvage something pure from the wreckage, to rescue a single act of courage from a history written in tragedy" states the thesis rather than letting the image do the work. The "windows of connection" concept hovers as metaphor without dramatized friction. Subtext operates in the dream cameos (boy always near exits), but the ending clarity costs resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("borrowed starlight," "cartography of the subconscious"), fitting a reflective wreck-diver's register. However, register drifts into exposition at peak beats: "objects held the psychic resonance of their owners' final moments" and "a cartography of the subconscious" read as narrator convenience rather than Elara's lived idiom. The prose has textural consistency but lacks perceptual signature under stress—Elara's way of noticing does not shift when pressure should tighten focus. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are acceptable but cluster without voice payoff. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not scored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breath. However, mid-story exposition loops conceptually: "objects held the psychic resonance" is restated as "the spirit attached to this relic was elusive," and the dream-tracking method is explained twice (global archives, then "windows of connection"). Template cadence appears in the dream-shard catalog: "He appeared again… standing silently… watching from the shadows." The tense slip "Elara weaves truth carefully" (present tense amid past-tense narration) is minor but noted. Peak beats favor clarity, yet information density sags in the middle third where method is told rather than dramatized. No catastrophic artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—tracking ghosts via strangers' dream cameos—is fresh and the wreck-diver ghost-whisperer pairing feels specific. The melted snow globe's transformation from tragedy symbol to heroism proof offers a non-obvious inflection. However, the emotional arc (reveal hidden courage, lift grief) follows a familiar recovery template, and the dream-shard catalog (Vienna florist, Lagos mechanic) reads as world-building checklist rather than inevitable particulars tied to the boy's psyche. The cryosphere shrine and candle-lit ice offer vivid setting synthesis. Risk is present in the premise but not in execution; the boy's heroism arrives without complication, and Elara's final move lacks stakes that test her method or worldview.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation frames the premise. However, her agency is observational: she accesses archives, filters data, notices patterns, and whispers a name. The final "whispered his name" does not represent a difficult choice that alters her tactics or stance—it is a ritual completion after off-page deduction. She appears in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying two gates, but her decisions do not create key turns; the boy's story unfolds through information reveal rather than protagonist pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe is introduced early (beat 1: "cradled… distorted lump"), described with specificity (tear-drop shape, soot swirl), and returns at closure ("the heavy sensation of grief lifted from the artifact"). It bridges setup and ending, reweighted from symbol of lost innocence to testament of endured heat. However, mid-story development is thin—Elara does not handle or use it in a second distinct beat; it remains static until the final reconfiguration. Two gates (setup, closure) are met; the lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named explicitly mid-story ("These fleeting glimpses were the core concept") and frames the dream-tracking method. It shapes Elara's tactics (analyzing dream archives, synchronizing cameos) and appears in the ending ("The windows of connection closed gently"). However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint—no moment shows a window opening or closing with mechanical friction that narrows Elara's options. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated once mid-story in a tense-shifted aside ("Elara weaves truth carefully, pulling the fragile threads") and immediately qualified: "pulling too hard… could shatter the remnant entirely." The constraint is articulated but never tested—Elara does not pull too hard, make a mistake, or face a trade-off between speed and care. The trait appears in setup (as exposition) but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Label-only mention without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expose" drives the climactic beat: Elara reconstructs the boy's final moments, revealing he held the bulkhead door open rather than hiding. The action redefines the snow globe's meaning and triggers the grief-lift at closure. However, the exposure occurs via summary ("By synchronizing the dream cameos, she reconstructed the scene") rather than dramatized scene, and it could be swapped for "discover" or "reveal" with minimal edits. Present in setup (stated as need), middle (pattern-building), and ending (truth delivered), but causality is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dream-analysis method is introduced early ("by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams"), demonstrated in the middle third (Vienna florist, Lagos mechanic, pattern of exits), and its payoff—synchronizing cameos to reconstruct the boy's final act—shapes the ending. The method is specific, irreplaceable (the story hinges on this exact technique), and appears across three beats. However, its mechanics remain expository; we are told about archive filters and dream-share rather than experiencing a single dream as scene. All three gates met with strong specificity, but summary delivery caps the upper band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly described in the opening (candle-lit ice, pelt, luminescence) and the candles return at closure ("the candles flared"). It anchors spatial identity and charges the final image with sensory callback. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices—she could perform the ritual elsewhere with minimal rewrites. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) are met with atmospheric specificity, but middle development is absent and the shrine supplies mood rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated explicitly late in the story as Elara's "singular and unyielding" motivation. It frames her goal and explains the stakes (why she performs this ritual), and it connects to closure (the boy's courage salvaged, grief lifted). However, the desire is told rather than shown in conflicted micro-choices. No on-page friction tests whether salvaging purity costs Elara something personal—time, safety, emotional exposure. Setup is thin (motivation named only in final third); closure linkage is thematic but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears as metaphor in the opening paragraph ("the delicate, haunting quality of borrowed starlight") and modulates subtly through the piece—dim illumination, candlelight, the shrine's ancient glow. At closure, the candles flare and the "lightness that felt like forgiveness" echoes the opening's stolen luminescence. Tone is coherent, lyric, and melancholy throughout, and the final image recharges the light motif. However, tone does not modulate with pressure; the register remains elegiac even during the dream-shard catalog, which could tighten. Strong early signal and closure reprise with thematic reweighting, but static application in the middle third.</comment>
