<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is embodied through the walnut-stained hands and the ritual's physical precision, and her motivation to preserve "small moments" shapes every choice. The internal contradiction between "haunted euphoria" and grief creates complexity, though the emotion occasionally slips toward label-only ("terrifying presence," "warm, invisible blanket"). The final renunciation—dropping the locket—carries visible cost and forecloses return, satisfying the earned-change requirement. Minor deduction for the therapeutic register in "joy so intense it felt like a ghost passing through her ribs."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes Elara, the jetty, and twilight within the opening lines, passing the Orientation Test. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through ritual steps (cleaning, tilting stone, steeping photo) and the covenant's reknitting until the final act—dropping the locket—reconfigures her from "widow of time" to "guardian." Closure lands on the page with felt cost (the locket is surrendered, her relationship to grief transformed). One meaningful deepening is evident; the piece would benefit from a sharper mid-point tightening to enter the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The jetty's orchids, planks, and tidal pool constrain Elara's ritual: she must tilt a stone to divert seawater, and the flowers "catch the released emotional resonance." Twilight—the interval "between definitions"—enables the magic and anchors the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her archivist's lens (salt, pollen, "dark and briny"). The setting charges the final image when the jetty becomes a permanent archive of laughter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—regenerating the broken covenant to preserve her husband's laughter—is signaled early and tightens through each ritual step. The steep (infusing the photo) narrows options: once the essence is released, the locket's purpose is "fulfilled." The final act of dropping the locket forecloses retrieval and shifts Elara's role, delivering visible cost. Agency is clear (she chooses to complete the ritual and release the object), though a second reversal or complication would strengthen escalation toward the 8.8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual's mechanics: love cycles back into the environment rather than fading, and archival work is a form of guardianship over "precious debris." The final image—walking away as the jetty guards the laughter—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The "regenerated covenant" avoids allegory by remaining grounded in ink, tide, and proximate causes. Minor note: "widow of time" edges toward abstraction, but the image lands with specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is distinct (walnut-ink stains, the archivist's taxonomy of "small moments"). Diction stays elevated but character-appropriate ("proximate causes," "atmospheric shift"). The "haunted euphoria" phrase risks slight overwriting, and "terrifying presence that made her skin prickle" tilts abstract, but voice control under pressure is strong. Psychic distance tightens effectively at the steep, and the final sentences modulate into quiet resolve without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, setting, or interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("bruised into true night," "vibrated in the wooden planks") stays coherent. Minor deductions for a paraphrase loop ("It was a joy so intense it felt like a ghost…" followed by "shivering with a delight that was no longer strictly alive") and the filter-verb stack in paragraph three ("watched," "felt"). No major artifacts touch closure, keeping the piece in the strong band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ritual's proximate-cause mechanism (tilting stone to divert water, not commanding it) offers a fresh angle on grief-magic, avoiding the stock "direct invocation" trope. The archivist's walnut-ink métier and the blooming jetty are specific, non-generic choices. The transformation test passes: swapping names or places would lose the ink-and-tide alchemy. Risk-taking (the quiet, ritual-driven closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a small within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive every beat: she cleans the rim, tilts the stone, steeps the photo, and drops the locket. Setup in paragraph one, development through the ritual, payoff in the closure act. Her role as archivist shapes her method (proximate causes, preservation). Causal pressure is strong, and the final act forecloses return. Scores high for beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The locket appears in paragraph one (setup), is opened and handled in paragraph two, the photo is removed and steeped in paragraph three (development), and the empty locket is dropped in the final beat (payoff, reweighted as "purpose fulfilled"). Three distinct beats, causal enablement, and closure linkage. High irreplaceability: the silver container and faded image are essential to the steep's chemistry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is introduced in paragraph one (broken by grief), dramatized in paragraph three (the ink and tide knit it back together), and resolved in the closure (Elara becomes "guardian" rather than "widow"). It shapes stakes (to restore the pact) and tactics (respecting cause-and-effect chains). Scores solidly for setup, development, and payoff, though deeper mid-scene friction would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is embodied in Elara's actions: she cleans the silver rim so "no grit would interrupt the delicate chemistry," works through "proximate causes" rather than forcing, and respects "the chain of cause and effect." Setup is implicit in paragraph one, development spans paragraphs two and three, and the trait enables the ritual's success. Cost is present (patience and precision are required), though the label is stated once rather than shown in a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The steep (infusing the photo in the ink-and-seawater pool) is introduced in paragraph two, executed in paragraph three, and completes in paragraph four ("The steep was complete"). It redefines options: the essence is extracted, the locket's purpose fulfilled, and Elara's role transformed. Three beats, high causal necessity, and closure linkage. Irreplaceability is strong; no other action would release the "emotional resonance."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is introduced in paragraph two ("she worked through proximate causes, tilting a loose stone to divert a trickle"), shapes the ritual's execution (no commanding, only "small physical nudges"), and underpins the covenant's success. Setup, development, and payoff are present. The method constrains her approach and charges the theme (respecting causality to "trick the universe"). High integration with slight room for deeper friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty anchors every beat: orchids catch released resonance, planks house the tidal pool, and the location becomes the permanent archive of laughter. Setup in the opening line, development through spatial choreography (kneeling, tilting stone), and payoff when Elara walks away leaving "the twilight to guard the laughter." The setting supplies resources (seawater, wood depression) and charges the closure image. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight—"the precise interval when context changes"—is introduced as the enabling condition in paragraph one, governs the ritual's timing ("Only in this shift…could the old magic take hold"), and anchors the closure image ("leaving the twilight to guard"). The timeframe tightens decisions (she must act during this fleeting window) and shapes tactics. Three gates met, strong causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to preserve the weight of small moments" is stated in paragraph one and dramatized through the ritual: cleaning, steeping, and anchoring the laughter. Friction is present (grief, the "haunted" quality, the physical cost of dropping the locket), though the motivation could be tested more sharply in a mid-scene complication. Setup, development, and payoff are clear; scores solidly for integration with room for deeper conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is introduced in paragraph one ("a joy so intense it felt like a ghost"), modulates through the ritual ("melancholic longing to a vibrant, terrifying presence"), and charges the final image ("warm, invisible blanket"). Tone is coherent, emotionally specific, and tracks with pressure. The phrase risks slight abstraction, but the embodied details (skin prickle, breath hitched, slow heartbeat) ground it. High integration across all three gates.</comment>
