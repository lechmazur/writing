<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation and internal conflict are clear—she rejects her father's violence for pacifism—but the character relies heavily on abstract interiority ("hyper-awareness," "chaotic vibrations") rather than embodied contradictory impulses. The sheathing choice reads as inevitable from her established stance rather than a struggle between competing desires in the moment. The stranger's presence triggers memory of "old instinct" but this phantom inheritance dissolves without genuine friction, reducing the final turn to confirmation rather than cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara's back-turning and return to the roses forecloses engagement with the intruder, and the stranger's slump suggests her cultivated peace has begun its work. The cost is visible—she accepts vulnerability and trusts her method over direct defense—but the final beat ("the work had begun") tilts toward thematic summary rather than a charged image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, nutrient-rich loam, and grow lights establish a vivid micro-setting. The ballast sandbag's "ozone and altitude" scent and the "sky-touched sand" anchor sensory detail in purpose. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Elara's choice at the perimeter alarm—she can refuse entry because the dome is a controlled sanctuary—and the final paragraph's "density of peace" directly charges the stranger's reaction, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival through cultivating peace rather than hunting men—is signaled early and remains coherent. The perimeter alarm provides one meaningful tightening: Elara faces the choice to defend or trust her method. However, the intruder applies no active pressure; he simply watches and then slumps, reducing the escalation to a test Elara passes without trade-off. The cost (turning her back on fear) is stated but not dramatized as a gamble with stakes, and the resolution hinges on the roses' ambient effect rather than a protagonist action that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme—pacifism and cultivating moral order from chaos—emerges through Elara's ritual and contrasts with her father's creed. The ballast sand and whispered values provide concrete particulars. However, the final paragraphs shift into direct thematic statement: "she was growing a new kind of law," "Her father had hunted men to stop them; she would grow a world that didn't need stopping." These replace scene pressure with thesis, and the closing "Even through the glass, the work had begun" reads as moralizing summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct elevated register ("verdant sanctuary," "monolithic shadow," "raveled edges of time"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the alarm intrusion. However, the prose leans into filter verbs and abstract constructions ("feel the chaotic vibrations," "visualizing the concept flowing") that dilate immediacy. The narrative voice remains consistent but the diction ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") occasionally tips into ornamental phrasing that prioritizes texture over clarity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but overwriting clusters in key beats. "Senselessly perceptive" contradicts itself; "engraved quiet…physically carved" is mixed metaphor; "radiant orange-red that burned without consuming…tranquil blaze" stacks contradictory images without clarifying the effect. The phrase "phantom inheritance that urged violence" and "density of the peace she cultivated" rely on abstraction where concrete action would sharpen. Paraphrase appears: the opening "fragile membrane" and later "vacuum of authority" both describe loss without added pressure. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, applying −0.6 within Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter uses forbidden plant-inculcation science in a post-Tower wasteland—synthesizes multiple tropes into a specific scenario. The ballast sand's dual function (weighted war vessels, now grounding moral soil) and the spore-of-calm mechanism offer fresh details. However, the core emotional arc (rejecting inherited violence for nurture) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (her method proves effective without confrontation) avoids risk. The worldbuilding particulars elevate but do not fully transform the predictable turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as bounty hunter's pacifist daughter frames the opening and drives the sheathing decision at the alarm. Her rejection of her father's creed shapes tactics (whispering to plants vs. drawing a pistol). Present in setup, middle choice, and ending reflection. The final image includes her but she is observing the stranger's reaction rather than making a new decision, limiting closure participation to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ballast sandbag appears in two beats: pouring sky-touched sand into soil (mid-scene) and its conceptual weight anchoring the closing meditation ("ballast sand provided the weight of memory"). Setup and payoff are clear, but middle development is thin—Elara uses it once without constraint or complication. The object's properties (static charge, altitude scent) are vivid but the sand does not narrow her options or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is introduced early ("possessed of an engraved quiet that seemed physically carved") and recurs at closure ("The quiet…deepened, settling into the grooves…becoming permanent"). However, it functions as atmosphere and thematic label rather than shaping on-page choices. Elara does not navigate or weaponize the quiet; it exists as backdrop. The concept echoes in the ending but does not reweight prior stakes with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is named once in the opening ("Her eyes, senselessly perceptive, darted…catching the microscopic tremble of a leaf"). The trait enables her to anticipate irrigation but does not constrain a later choice or impose visible cost. No tradeoff, no second beat where hyper-awareness complicates tactics. The phrase itself is contradictory (senseless = perceptive?) and reads as label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sheathing action is the story's pivot: "With a deliberate, fluid motion, she chose to sheathe the blade…It was a declaration of intent, a refusal to add to the entropy." Setup (knife glints under grow lights), middle (she holds it as threat), and payoff (sheathing redefines her stance toward the intruder). The act forecloses violence and trusts her cultivated method, altering the stranger's reaction. Causal pressure is clear and the action charges the ending, though the stranger's passivity reduces the gamble's felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inculcating plants appears in setup ("the delicate work of inculcating plants with values…the art of whispering morality into cellular structures"), drives the middle ritual beats (whispering "Patience," "Mercy"), and delivers closure (the final rose releases spores that alter temperament, influencing the stranger). Present across all three gates. The method's mechanics (ballast sand charges, whispers encode values, spores transmit calm) shape her entire approach. However, the method succeeds without complication or cost; she performs the ritual and it works, reducing causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome frames every beat: the opening hum, the mid-scene perimeter alarm, and the closing pane through which peace transmits. It constrains Elara's choice—she can refuse the intruder entry because the enclosure is controlled space—and the dome's atmosphere (humidity, artificial light, ventilation) supplies the mechanism for spore dispersal. Setup, development (alarm intrusion tests the boundary), and payoff (stranger slumps against glass, affected by interior calm). The dome is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" anchors the timeframe early and contextualizes the wasteland setting and warlord economy. The Tower's fall creates the vacuum Elara seeks to fill with grown law. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions; no clock pressures her ritual, and the post-collapse era is backdrop rather than active constraint. Setup and thematic payoff are present, but middle development (time narrowing choices) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is stated as Elara's "only ambition" early and recurs at closure ("a new kind of law, one rooted in the earth"). The motivation drives her pacifist vow and plant-inculcation method. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; she never hesitates or weighs a competing need. Setup and payoff are clear, but the middle lacks friction between this want and a cost that would test it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears explicitly in the final rose description ("a radiant orange-red that burned without consuming…a tranquil blaze, a manifestation of passionate peace"). The tone is sustained through contrasts (violence vs. pacifism, chaos vs. order, storm vs. sanctuary) and modulates subtly as the alarm intrudes. However, the phrase is ornamental in the opening, gains definition mid-scene, and charges the ending image, meeting setup and payoff. The tone supports the closure but does not constrain a choice, placing it in the mid-band.</comment>
