<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior state is vividly embodied through "furiously tranquil" and physical anchors (trembling needle, steady hands), but his choices are largely predetermined by the resistance's map rather than meaningful dilemmas he navigates on the page. The final shift from fear to "storm-kissed wonder" reads as emotional declaration rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Backstory (wife, manuscript, friends) primes the map's emotional weight but does not alter present tactics. The renunciation of fear feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The story follows a single continuous scene with one dominant stake (revealing the map) and a causal arc: timer governs the chemical process, storm reaches zenith, solvent applied, map revealed. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (wonder replaces fear; the map validates memory), and the final image reweights the premise with felt emotional cost. The lens is Causal with lyric texture. Deduction: the protagonist's agency is passive—he executes a predetermined procedure rather than making a choice that narrows options; the map's revelation changes his emotional state but does not alter future tactics on the page, leaving cost implied rather than legible in a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is anchored early and consistently pressures the scene: glass floor over churning clouds, lightning flashes, battering fury, barometric pressure drop that enables the chemical reveal. Sensory detail (ozone, alcohol fumes, toxic green dial, cold air fogging breath) is filtered through Elias's urgency and supports the storm/censorship metaphor without becoming ornamental. The darkroom timer and chemical setup function as micro-setting tools that constrain the procedure's timing. The observatory's isolation and storm condition directly enable the climactic act, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrains choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reveal the hidden map to validate memory and suffering) is signaled early and pressure coheres: timer countdown, storm zenith, chemical application, lines blooming. One meaningful tightening occurs when the solvent dissolves the lacquer, revealing the scarred geography. Agency is procedural rather than decisional—Elias follows the resistance's instructions rather than navigating a dilemma. The cost is emotional validation rather than a tactical trade-off or foreclosed option. The story sits in the 7.0–8.4 band because escalation is driven by atmospheric and chemical progression under a causal lens, but protagonist agency does not force a higher-stakes choice that narrows options with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth surviving censorship, memory versus erasure) emerges organically from the storm/ink dissolution imagery and the map as "cartography of scars." The final image—"the storm and the poet had washed it clean"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "furiously tranquil," "the hour when masks slip," and the map as validation rather than discovery. Minor issue: "storm-kissed wonder" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward label-only emotion, and the final sentence risks thematic echo by articulating the premise explicitly rather than letting the image carry it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance remains close to Elias throughout. Voice has distinct texture ("metaphorically severed tongue," "violently bruised ocean," "toxic green," "ghost through the paper") and diction is elevated but mostly coherent with a poet's lexicon. Weakness: some phrasing ("dangerous resonance of unwritten words," "the sheer scale of the truth that had survived the darkness") drifts into abstract elevation that feels ornamental rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final paragraph's "storm-kissed wonder" and "washed it clean" risk poeticizing the closure rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("violently bruised ocean," "rejected god," "ghost through the paper," "fresh wounds reopening"). Clarity holds and no paraphrase loops appear. Overwriting penalty: metaphoric density appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching, and some vehicles mix registers ("dangerous resonance," "ghost through," "barometric trench," "marrying the smell") in ways that occasionally blur rather than sharpen. "Storm-kissed wonder" in the penultimate paragraph and "washed it clean" in the final line are stock poetic gestures that dull the closure image's specificity. Apply −0.5 for density without payoff and −0.3 for figurative muddle touching the closure beat, total −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (poet uses storm-pressure chemistry to reveal a resistance map) offers a fresh synthesis of censorship, invisibility, and atmospheric science. The storm/ink metaphor and "furiously tranquil" are specific inflections. Weakness: the emotional arc (fear → wonder via validation) follows a familiar redemptive template, and the final image's "washed it clean" echoes stock catharsis language. The dead-drop timetable and darkroom-timer mechanics feel researched but not transformed into surprising causality; the procedure unfolds as expected. Sits mid-band because the concept is non-obvious but the execution does not take bold risks that heighten stakes beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role (censored poet performing reclamation) frames the stakes. His "choices" are procedural: he prepares chemicals and pours solvent as instructed. No on-page decision alters tactics or creates a turn; the map reveal is predetermined by the resistance's method. Present in setup, middle (chemical prep), and ending (map revealed, emotional shift), but observation and execution dominate over agency-driven turns. Functional but replaceable with another operator.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears early (brass console, phosphorescent dial), governs the vigil/chemical timing in the middle, and buzzes to signal reaction complete at closure. It is handled across three beats and its mechanics (measuring pause between lightning and thunder) matter to the procedure. The timer's buzz "snaps the vigil" and marks completion, contributing to closure participation. Score: setup (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), specificity (+0.4) = ~6.6 baseline; slight lift for charged reprise at the climactic moment rounds to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is stated explicitly in paragraph 5 and embodied by the timer measuring the interval between lightning and thunder. It shapes the procedure's timing and the protagonist's "furiously tranquil" stance. The concept constrains the chemical reveal to the barometric window ("hour when masks slip") and charges the final image's suspension. Present in setup (timer introduced), middle (vigil described), and ending (timer buzzes, vigil completes). Causal pressure: the pause window enables the reveal. Closure linkage: the vigil's end marks emotional shift. Score: setup (+0.5), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.9) = ~5.2 baseline; lyric resonance lifts to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is stated in paragraph 6 and embodied (hands steady, violent exertion of will). It colors Elias's interior state but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; the attribute describes rather than drives. Present in setup (mid-scene) and thematically in the ending's shift to wonder, but no tactical tradeoff tied to this trait. Lyric reprise without middle development caps at ~4.6; slight lift for embodied description reaches 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rarefy" (thin the dense lacquer to reveal invisible ink) is introduced in paragraph 14 and executed in paragraphs 18–20 as the core action. The solvent application is the climactic turn: black suppression dissolves, red lines bloom, map revealed. The action is causally necessary and its mechanics (volatile ether, atmospheric pressure window) are specific. Present in middle (method explained) and ending (executed, map revealed). Causal pressure: the rarefaction enables closure. Irreplaceability: high; the specific chemistry matters. Score: one key beat (+0.4), causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (+0.6) = ~7.7; minor late signal (paragraph 14 of 29) applies −0.4, landing at 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sealed envelope in the bus timetable is introduced in paragraph 8 as the dead-drop contraband, explained in paragraphs 9–11 (timetable hidden in terminal lavatory, envelope holds the map), and its contents are revealed in the ending (the map itself). The method shapes the stakes (resistance communication, mundane hiding spot) and the envelope's document is the object of the entire procedure. Present in setup (paragraph 8), middle (backstory context), and ending (contents revealed). Causal: the envelope's map is the procedure's target. Score: setup (+0.5), causal pressure (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0) = ~6.4; summary-only middle use applies −0.3, landing at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is anchored in the opening line and sustained throughout: glass floor, clouds, lightning, atmospheric pressure, isolation. It enables the chemical reveal (barometric window), pressures the scene (storm battering glass), and charges the final image (storm illuminates scars, sky and paper). Present in setup (paragraph 1), middle (storm reaches zenith), and ending (lightning/tempest frame emotional shift). Causal pressure: the setting's barometric drop is required for ink stability failure. Closure linkage: the storm reappears in the final lines to frame the metaphor. Score: setup (+0.7), beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.6), specificity (+0.5) = ~8.1; minor decorative postcard risk in opening applies −0.3, landing at 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"The hour when masks slip" is introduced in paragraph 16 as the barometric trench when atmospheric pressure drops and ink stability falters. The timeframe governs the procedure's window and is marked by the timer countdown and storm zenith. Present in middle (explained) and ending (timer buzzes, window closes). The time constraint tightens the procedure but is not dramatized as a live clock that alters tactics under pressure—Elias proceeds smoothly. Score: middle signal (+0.4), causal pressure (+0.7), closure participation (+0.7) = ~5.8; late introduction (paragraph 16) applies −0.3; thematic naming without tactical friction nudges down, landing at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is stated in paragraph 12 and embodied throughout: the map plots detention centers and unmarked graves, validating Elias's memory of friends, manuscript, wife. The motivation drives the entire procedure and is fulfilled in the ending when the map blooms and Elias feels validation. Present in setup (envelope/map purpose explained), middle (map as validation of suffering), and ending (lines reopen wounds, memory validated, fear replaced by wonder). Causal pressure: the desire to see the suppressed geography drives every beat. Closure linkage: the map's reveal satisfies the motivation and shifts his emotional state. Score: setup (+0.6), beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.3), closure linkage (+1.4) = ~7.2; minor penalty for emotional declaration ("profound wonder") rather than fully dramatized friction applies −0.1, landing at 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears explicitly in paragraph 28 at the ending and is prepared by the storm imagery throughout (violently bruised ocean, rejected god, raw electricity). Tone modulates from exile/dread (censorship, metaphorical severing) through procedural focus to awe. The storm charges the final image (lightning illuminates scars) and the tone shift to wonder marks the closure's emotional repricing. Present thematically in setup (storm), middle (furious tranquility), and ending (explicit "storm-kissed wonder"). Coherence across turns: tone tightens with storm escalation. Closure charge: the phrase and image crystallize the emotional shift. Score: setup (+0.5), modulation (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.2) = ~6.3; explicit label "storm-kissed wonder" risks telling rather than showing, but the storm image supports it; minor lift for final-image coherence reaches 6.7.</comment>
