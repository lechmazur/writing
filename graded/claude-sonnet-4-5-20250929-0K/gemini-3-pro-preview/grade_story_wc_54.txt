<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is consistent and particular: he reads buildings as "a maze of intentions" and treats structures like patients. His motivation—to prove decline is not irreversible—drives the central action clearly. However, the character remains somewhat static; the final moment offers observation ("He had proven…") rather than a felt transformation or visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece presents competence without genuine struggle or contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture: Elias's problem-solving steps link clearly (pressure valves → pneumatic lines → sextant lens → hologram ignition). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image crystallizes his theorem of restoration with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual and somewhat oblique—he has proven a point but lingers alone in carnival trash—yet the stakes and meaning reweight. Orientation is clean. One meaningful tightening occurs when the missing crystal is solved by the sextant piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vivid and purposeful: terrazzo floor, confetti, gantry, and sub-flooring all constrain and enable Elias's moves. The sextant piece—a physical object—functions as micro-setting, its refractive properties shaping the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective (hissing air, ionized bloom, blue light over grime) and filtered through an engineer's priorities. The carnival detritus versus grand arches contrast charges the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrect the hologram to prove reversibility—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias lacks the crystal and must improvise with the sextant. Agency is decision-driven under the Causal lens; the piece delivers one meaningful pressure point. However, escalation is modest: no live opposition or visible loss alters tactics en route. The resolution is earned by Elias's ingenuity, yet the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—restoration versus decay, vision versus entropy—emerges from concrete action: redirecting flows, repurposing a prop into a functional tool, transforming carnival trash into stardust. The closing image ("the only real ship in the city") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing. The sextant's shift from fake to functional charges the concept without forced recurrence. Minor deduction: "maze of intentions" is stated rather than fully dramatized through conflicting choices, tilting slightly toward thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (engineer's lens: "circulatory systems," "vein that still carried blood"). Diction remains apt for the focalizer except for occasional drift into elevated abstraction ("society that had traded exploration for cheap entertainment"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor slip: "stoic wonder" is asserted rather than embodied at the peak beat, and the final paragraph edges toward expository summary ("He had proven…") instead of sustained image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with purposeful technical specificity ("refractive index," "micro-turbine," "ionized"). Rhythm supports the moment: short beats during ignition, longer reflection at closure. However, paragraph three contains paraphrase loops ("The building still had a pulse; it was just buried") and scaffold phrasing ("He knew he could achieve ignition"). Template cadence appears in the setup ("he channeled…He treated…It was…"). These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—using carnival refuse to unlock a past vision—is specific and earned in hindsight. The engineer-as-restorer frame offers a fresh angle on ruin exploration. However, the setup tracks a familiar template: lone explorer in abandoned venue discovers object, solves technical puzzle, achieves symbolic victory. Transformation test: swap names/place and the emotional arc remains largely unchanged. The sextant's dual role (fake prop → real lens) adds local ingenuity but does not fully escape derivative scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's curiosity drives discovery of the sextant (beat one), his engineering lens diagnoses the building's systems (beat two), and his decision to improvise with the lens creates the climactic turn (beat three). His choices are causally active across the arc and shape closure directly. Present early, involved in all key beats, and indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sextant appears in beat one (discovery), is examined and valued for its precision (beat two), and becomes the enabling component at closure (wedged into the focal array). Its specific curvature and refractive property are irreplaceable; a generic lens would not carry the thematic charge of fake-to-real transformation. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" is named explicitly in paragraph two and shapes Elias's perception of the building's conflicting designs (efficient transit versus carnival loops). It informs his diagnostic stance but does not constrain a specific on-page choice or reweight tactics. The concept enriches theme and setting yet remains more interpretive frame than active stake. Present early and tied to worldview, but swappable with similar metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is demonstrated on the page: Elias redirects pneumatic flows and improvises the sextant as a lens component. The trait enables the climactic action with visible ingenuity. However, the label is also stated outright ("Elias possessed a mind that was functionally creative"), reducing irreplaceability. The attribute drives one major beat and supports closure, but the telling alongside showing lowers integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the protagonist's explicit goal, signaled early ("decided to resurrect the main departure hologram") and drives the entire causal chain: pressure-valve manipulation, pneumatic redirection, sextant insertion, and final ignition. The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the plot. It appears in setup, development, and payoff, with all major beats tracing to this verb. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" is signaled early ("redirected flows"), executed on the page ("manipulating the pressure valves…channeled the kinetic energy"), and shapes the mechanics of success. The method is specific to the setting's infrastructure and demonstrates Elias's engineering skill. It participates in two beats (diagnosis and ignition) and the particularity matters. Swappable with another technical workaround only at cost to thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport supplies resources (sub-flooring valves, pneumatic lines, gantry, focal array) and pressures choices through its decay and detritus. Elias navigates the space physically and the architecture's dual designs (linear transit versus carnival loops) inform his worldview. The setting participates in setup, development, and payoff, enabling tactics and charging the final image. Removing the specific venue would break the mechanical logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" anchors the opening and explains the debris field. It sets an initial condition but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Elias works at his own pace with no urgency or deadline. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup, absent from development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated explicitly ("deep, internalized motivation to puzzle out new equations for hope") and drives Elias's decision to resurrect the hologram. The desire is consistent and shapes the climactic action. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. The motivation informs two beats (decision and closure reflection) but lacks embodied cost or contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is sustained across the arc: Elias observes quietly, works methodically, and responds to success with restraint ("did not cheer; he simply noted"). The tone modulates appropriately—technical focus during problem-solving, awed reflection at ignition ("observing the result with stoic wonder")—and charges the final image without breaking into sentimentality. Coherent through turns, voice-consistent, and integral to the closing beat's resonance.</comment>
