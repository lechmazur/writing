<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas is given distinct, embodied traits—his "abrasive calm," obsessive filing, self-proclaimed intellectualism—that drive micro-choices (filing burrs, cleaning spectacles) and shape his rebellion through mechanical precision rather than violence. Internal contradiction appears in his rare biological rhythm when his heart hammers, contrasting with his calculated demeanor. The final choice to wind the clock is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of passive acceptance, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("agonize over") that slightly softens the otherwise sharp characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: Silas's weeks of excavation lead to finding the cog, which enables the clock repair, which produces the ticking—a clean because/therefore chain. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ticking is a "rhythmic heresy" that crystallizes his rebellion and reconfigures the narrative contest between priest and philosopher, with the conceptual cost (starting a war) made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors emerge within the first 120 words (sunken city, sewers, post-plague). One meaningful tightening occurs when the cog snaps into place and the escapement kicks, narrowing options from search to actualization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sewer alcove, workshop floor, and sedimentary layers are vividly rendered ("geological excavation," "heavy clay," "brackish water") and constrain Silas's search through physical resistance—mud pushes back "with the weight of the ocean." The chronometer cog's uncorroded state matters causally, and the ticking travels up ventilation shafts to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dull glint of brass, damp brickwork), filtered through Silas's mechanical priorities. The post-plague ruins supply both obstacle (silt, trash, bone) and resource (the preserved cog), meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving objective time against priestly mysticism—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas finds the cog and faces the micro-obsessive task of filing burrs; the escalation is causal (dust could "disrupt the frequency, rendering his counter-narrative invalid") and tightens options under the lens. The final act is driven by Silas's agency (winding the mainspring), and the cost is conceptual but legible: "started a war without saying a word." No violent antagonist or multiple reversals, but the persistent constraint (precision required) shapes tactics and the closure image carries undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contest between mechanical veracity and mystical narrative, never stated as a moral. The cog returns with reweighted meaning: first a missing piece, then the instrument of rebellion, finally a "heartbeat of pure logic" that charges the ending without overt symbolism. Subtext operates in the physical struggle—"mud pushed back...a physical manifestation of the competing narratives"—and the final image (ticking echoing upward) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether time can be reclaimed from priesthood. The story invites reflection on authority and epistemology without explaining itself, and the ending reweights prior material (the excavation, the silent war) with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and precise, with narrative certainty calibrated to Silas's knowledge (he cannot calculate emotion, so he "chose to agonize"). Diction is character-particular: "logically offensive," "rationally rebellious," "variable he could not calculate." Perceptual signature is consistent—mechanical priorities dominate (dimensions, frequencies, burrs)—and psychic distance tightens at the climax (heart hammering, "rare display of biological rhythm"). Minor deduction for filter verbs in a few lines ("feeling the satisfying snap") that slightly dull immediacy, but overall the prose reflects the mind of the focalizer under pressure and the voice remains distinct and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentences carry high information density (most lines advance character, conflict, or atmosphere), and no loops or paraphrase artifacts are present. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("geological excavation of the recent past," "heartbeat of pure logic"). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the immediate register in peak beats: "a subtle, rhythmic heresy" and "irritating, abrasive calm" feel slightly crafted rather than urgent. "Agonize" appears twice in quick succession, creating minor synonym proximity. These issues do not touch the closure beat but accumulate to −0.6 in Q7, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher in sewers vs. priests above—offers a fresh spatial inversion of the truth-seeker archetype, and the chronometer cog as rebellion instrument is specific and non-obvious. Silas's rejection of emotion as "a variable he could not calculate" and his silent war via mechanism feel earned and particular. However, the post-apocalyptic struggle between reason and mysticism is a familiar template, and while the execution is strong, the core conflict does not fully transform the archetype into something indispensable. The ticking-as-heresy image is memorable but not so singular that it transcends proximity to other time-versus-faith narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas, the wannabe philosopher in the sewer, is signaled in the opening, drives two major beats (the excavation choice and the clock repair), and his choices create the key turn at closure when he winds the mainspring and "started a war without saying a word." His decisions alter tactics (obsessive filing, retreating to his alcove) and the ending would fail without his agency. The cost—conceptual but legible—ties directly to his character. All three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met, with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The seafarer's chronometer cog appears in at least three beats: the search framing, the discovery and rinsing, the filing and installation, and the final ticking. It is irreplaceable—its "exacting specifications" and uncorroded state are essential—and its presence in the closure unit (the snap, the kick, the ticking) charges the final image. The cog's transformation from missing piece to rebellion instrument reweights prior material with visible cost. All gates met, high specificity, strong closure linkage, and visible cost connection elevate the score to near-indispensable range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives (priests' mysticism vs. Silas's mechanics) shape stakes explicitly: "If the priests were right, the gears were irrelevant; if Silas was right, the gears were the only things that mattered." This concept drives Silas's excavation choice, constrains his tactics (obsessive precision to validate his counter-narrative), and the closure image—ticking as "rhythmic heresy"—crystallizes the contest on the page. The cost (starting a war) is tied directly to this conceptual frame. All gates met, strong causal pressure, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is signaled early ("his rebellion was not violent, but rationally rebellious") and constrains his method: he refuses mysticism, chooses mechanical proof, and agonizes over precision rather than emotion. The trait enables the final action (winding the clock as silent insurrection) and the cost—starting a war "without saying a word"—ties to this attribute. However, the phrase appears only once as a label and is not dramatized in multiple distinct beats beyond the general arc. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is implicit rather than distinct.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears twice in distinct contexts: first over "the precise dimensions of a missing brass fragment," then over "the friction, filing the microscopic burrs." Both instances drive key beats (search framing, precision work) and the closure turn depends on this action—the obsessive care ensures the cog's fit and the clock's validation. The action is irreplaceable (casual effort would not prove his counter-narrative) and the cost (starting a war) traces to this meticulous struggle. All gates met, strong causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—working "through sedimentary layers of silt and trash"—is signaled early and frames the excavation as "a geological excavation of the recent past, slicing through strata." The mechanics matter: the layers resist ("heavy clay," "mud pushed back") and the cog is buried "deep beneath a petrified ledger," requiring the method to succeed. The ticking later rises "through the sedimentary layers to the surface," charging the final image. All gates met (setup, middle obstacle, closure reprise), with solid causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins and sewer setting are signaled in the opening and pressure choices throughout: the mud resists, the workshop floor must be sifted, the ventilation shafts carry the ticking upward. The environment supplies the resource (the preserved cog) and the constraint (sediment, darkness, isolation). The ruins are essential to the closure image—the ticking "echoed up...to the surface"—and removing the setting would break the spatial logic of Silas's rebellion. All gates met, strong constraint on tactics, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the plague ends—is established in the opening ("The plague had finally burned itself out") and frames the priests' claim that "the plague had stopped time itself." This stakes the conflict (restore time vs. eternal mercy) and the final ticking directly answers the timeframe premise. However, the "weeks" of excavation and the urgency of proving time remain abstract; no live clock tightens decisions on the page. Two gates met (setup, payoff) with thematic resonance but limited mid-scene tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to preserve ancient methods—is dramatized early ("he sought the hard, cold veracity of ancient methods") and drives the excavation, the search for the cog, and the clock repair. The desire conflicts with the priests' mysticism and the cost (starting a war) ties directly to this motivation. The choice to wind the clock is the actualization of this want, and the final image (mechanical ticking vs. prayer) charges the motivation with conceptual cost. All gates met, strong friction between want and cost, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is signaled in the opening ("an irritating, abrasive calm") and sustained through the beats: Silas lectures rats, works with "obsessive, painful slowness," and maintains "steady, unhurried demeanor that belied the urgency." The tone modulates subtly at closure (heart hammering as "rare display") before returning to calm satisfaction ("cleaning his spectacles"). The tone charges the final image—silent war declared without emotion—and remains coherent under pressure. Strong setup and closure linkage, with purposeful modulation that supports rather than disrupts pressure.</comment>
