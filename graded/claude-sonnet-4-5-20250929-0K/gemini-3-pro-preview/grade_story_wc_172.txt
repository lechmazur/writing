<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vance's core contradiction—destroy to profit, preserve to mourn—drives the piece, but interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("secretly sentimental," "architecture of his soul," "paradox") rather than embodied contradiction in micro-choices. The egg placement is motivated, yet the final gesture reads more as symbolic tableau than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Phrases like "amoral philanthropist in the truest sense" and "paranoid ferocity" tell rather than show through action under pressure. No sustained internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; contradictions are declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure accretes through landscape detail, backstory reflection, and the egg's placement, culminating in a charged final image (rain hissing on salt, the hidden life, the promise of echo). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the act is complete, consequences crystallized but not yet paid—with felt cost in the doomed gamble and Vance's walking away. One persistent constraint (the hellscape he created) shapes the final act. No causality breaks, though the backstory block is substantial (~30%) and the middle sags with exposition rather than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The salt flat is vivid and particular: "blinding geometry," "jagged tessellated cartography," "broken porcelain plate." The thermal vents and fissure map constrain Vance's choice of placement site, directly shaping the release action and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his dual priorities (industrial efficiency, aesthetic mourning). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (the specific fissure) functions as the closure stage, elevating the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo of the extinct species—is signaled early and tightens through the placement ritual. The "statistically indistinguishable from zero" survival odds and "doomed gamble" frame the cost, but the tension is more atmospheric than escalatory; no live options narrow after the egg is revealed. The act itself (kneeling, placing, walking away) is decisive, yet the outcome remains abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vance imagines the hatchling's cry, reweighting his manufactured drought from pure profit to moral paradox. Agency is renunciation with felt cost, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—destruction and preservation as twin impulses, the cost of silencing beauty—emerges through concrete particulars: the drained aquifer, the extinct herons, the blue egg against white salt. The final image (rain hissing, the hidden life, "perhaps the echo would not fade entirely") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "He would burn a library to warm himself, then weep over the ashes of the poetry" is a thematic echo that borders on thesis statement, docking slightly. No false complexity; the moral ambiguity lands without hedging or symmetric balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Vance. Distance modulates purposefully between intimate interiority ("profit was the furthest thing from his mind") and lyric remove ("a phantom flock returning"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("tessellated cartography," "architecture of his soul") beyond plausible focalizer lexicon during peak beats. Perceptual signature is present—his dual lens of industrialist and aesthete—but the narration occasionally over-articulates insights he wouldn't self-diagnose mid-crisis ("paradox was the architecture of his soul"). No head-hopping; narrative stance coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines carry double duty (setting as character state, gesture as theme). However, figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "blinding geometry," "white scar," "velvet depths," "sky bruised purple," "tattered veil," "broken porcelain plate" cluster in nearly every paragraph, occasionally mixing vehicles (veil, plate, scar). Paraphrase loop: "He did not come here to apologize to ghosts, but to preserve the echo" / "he could not bear the total absence of the music" restates the same motive. Template cadence: "He looked down... He followed... He withdrew... He did not come... He was not keeping... He knew... He stood up... He closed his eyes... He had silenced... He turned his back... He walked away" across the second half flattens propulsion. Stock metaphor "broken porcelain plate" and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("architecture of his soul") in peak beats trigger artifact penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—industrial ecocide paired with aesthetic grief, the last viable egg placed in self-made ruin—is specific and non-obvious. The "amoral philanthropist" frame and manufactured-drought-as-masterpiece premise transform familiar eco-villain tropes through Vance's dual motives. The piece commits fully to its moral calculus without retreat. However, the villain-who-mourns-his-own-destruction arc echoes well-worn templates; transformation arises more from prose texture than from a structural or emotional surprise. Proximity check: "burn a library to warm himself, then weep over the ashes of the poetry" leans close to stock poetic phrasing without sharp twist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vance's choices—following the fissure map, placing the egg, imagining the hatchling, retreating—create the story's arc. His amoral-yet-sentimental duality motivates the release and shapes the final image. Present across all beats and essential to closure; the paradox charges the ending. However, decisions trend symbolic over tactical; the egg placement is determined before the story opens, limiting on-page agency. Three-gate pass (setup, middle ritual, closure participation) with strong causal linkage and closure charge, but the lack of a narrowing choice lowers the ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The egg appears in three beats: withdrawal from pocket, placement in fissure, and implicit presence in the final rain image. Its "blue and smooth as the sky" specificity and role as the last viable Glass-Throated Heron egg make it irreplaceable. The act of placing it drives the climax; the imagined hatching reweights the drought from pure profit to moral gamble. Closure linkage is strong. Early signal (~mid-story) and high specificity elevate the score. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure charge are clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The manufactured drought frames Vance's empire and backstory, provides the salt flat setting, and creates the hellscape that dooms the egg. Present in setup (opening exposition) and implicit in closure (the rain as counter-image). However, the drought is historical context rather than live choice; it does not alter tactics on the page. Two gates (setup, closure implication) met; lyric reprise (white desolation → rain promise) reweights the stake. Functional but largely ornamental in the present scene; the egg could be placed in any hostile environment with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is stated explicitly ("an attribute he guarded with paranoid ferocity") and motivates the egg placement. The trait constrains his choice—he mourns what he destroyed—and the cost is visible in the "irrational, doomed gamble." Present in setup (midpoint declaration), drives the middle ritual, and implicit in closure (walking away from the hidden life). Two-gate pass with causal linkage. However, the attribute is label-heavy and told rather than shown through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final cost is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The release (kneeling, placing the egg in the fissure) is the story's structural pivot and the only major on-page action. It crystallizes Vance's dual motives, reweights the drought from profit cycle to moral paradox, and charges the final image. Three gates met (setup anticipation, middle execution, closure consequence). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the act is irreplaceable. However, the decision is made before the story opens; on-page agency is execution rather than a narrowing choice between live options, which caps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds" appears early (second paragraph) and guides Vance to the thermal vents. It provides the method for locating the fissure and shapes the placement tactic. Present in setup and middle; the mechanics matter (geothermal heat = incubation temperature). Two gates met. However, the map is functional context rather than a constraint that narrows options or creates friction; Vance follows it without complication. Swappable with "geological survey" or similar means without structural loss. Causal role is clear but modest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The salt flat is present across all beats: opening anchor, journey to the fissure, the placement site, and the final rain image. It provides the hostile environment that frames the egg's survival odds and shapes Vance's "hellscape of salt and starvation" realization. The "broken porcelain plate" image charges the closure. Three gates met; closure linkage is strong. The setting pressures the choice by making survival "statistically indistinguishable from zero," raising the stakes of the gamble. Environment as moral crucible elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the lull of distant thunder" appears twice: mid-story ("During the lull of distant thunder, the silence expanded") and late ("The thunder rumbled again, closer this time"). It provides atmospheric framing and a phantom-flock image but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The lull allows the release, yet the moment is reflective rather than pressured by a live clock. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) met, but the time element is ornamental. Swappable with "at dawn" or "in the heat haze" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desire "to preserve the echo of extinct birds" is stated early ("He did not come here to apologize to ghosts, but to preserve the echo") and motivates the egg placement. It drives the middle ritual and implicit in closure ("perhaps the echo would not fade entirely"). Three gates met with strong causal linkage. The motivation is contradicted by the profit motive in a way that charges the final act. However, the friction is told ("This paradox was the architecture of his soul") rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices; the want is resolved without visible second-guessing or tactical shift. Cost is thematic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" is declared once ("a fractured grace hanging over the ruins") and implicit in the lyric texture throughout: "blinding geometry," "broken porcelain plate," elegiac cadence against industrial ruin. Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (reflective in backstory, intensified at placement, mournful at retreat). The final image (rain hissing, promise of echo) charges the tone. Two gates (mid-story signal, closure reinforcement) met. The tone shapes the ending's emotional weight but is not tested or transformed by a turn; it remains static mood rather than a pressure that forces stance crystallization.</comment>
