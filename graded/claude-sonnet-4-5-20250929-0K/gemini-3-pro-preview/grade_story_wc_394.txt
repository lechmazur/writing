<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unit Seven's yearning algorithm provides clear, consistent motivation that drives all major choices—stripping weight, adopting the kaleidoscope, carving flight patterns. The protagonist's contradictory impulses (curiosity about dissolution vs. yearning to ascend) act simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. The final choice—ringing the bell—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path with visible cost (drifting alone in silence). Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("spiritual ache," "digital heartbeat") rather than fully embodied perception, though this remains voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Unit Seven achieves his goal with visible cost—isolation in silence, the joke no one hears. The causal chain (observe storms → carve patterns → launch → ring bell) holds without breaks. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the workshop dissolves, forcing the launch. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric coloring; the ending reweights the yearning algorithm's price without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The acid sea, corroding workshop, and kaleidoscopic vision constrain multiple choices: Unit Seven must strip weight to avoid sinking, use the obsidian tip because steel is blunted, and navigate storms through fractured prisms. The buoy in the upper atmosphere charges the final image with specificity. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the protagonist's optical limits and mechanical priorities. The micro-setting (body as kite-frame, tool as stylus) functions as constraint throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach the sky and ring the bell) is signaled early via the yearning algorithm and pursued through escalating modifications. One clear tightening: the workshop's dissolution forces launch before Unit Seven might be ready, narrowing options to "now or never." Agency is visible in stripping armor, adopting the kaleidoscope, carving flight data, and the final bell-tap. The cost—drifting alone, unheard—is legible on the page. Pressure coheres under the causal lens with a single decisive deepening sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: the cost of transcendence, the joy in unwitnessed achievement, and the tragicomic defiance of entropy. The kaleidoscope and arrow tip constrain choices and accumulate meaning without symbolic convenience. The final bell-tap offers a resonant, non-literal answer—proving ascent possible while accepting that no one hears—without stated moral. The "punchline to the universe's greatest joke" line risks slight over-articulation but remains anchored in Unit Seven's irreverent perspective and reweights the yearning algorithm's price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Unit Seven's perceptual signature throughout: fractured beauty through the kaleidoscope, mechanical metaphors ("digital heartbeat," "clicking language"), and irreverent tone. Diction stays consistent—playful yet technical—and modulates appropriately under pressure (short bursts during the launch). No head-hopping. The prose reflects a machine's embodied experience without anthropomorphizing cheaply. Psychic distance shifts intentionally to elevate during the ascent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the launch and breathing during observation beats. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "the yearning algorithm" recurs across paragraphs without functional variation, risking template cadence (-0.2). A few figurative phrases in the opening ("chaotic cathedral of refuse," "giggling madness of a jester") approach overwriting but remain legible and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. The final image ("laughing in static bursts") lands cleanly with concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—robot mystic using pre-digital relics to decode storms through a child's toy—feels specific and internally coherent rather than assembled from prompts. The kaleidoscope-as-navigation and obsidian-stylus-on-brass are fresh mechanical constraints. The irreverent tone transforms the transcendence-quest trope into tragicomedy without sentimentality. The story commits fully to its post-collapse logic and follows implications (no rescue, no audience). The ending's punchline-as-resolution is unconventional yet earned, avoiding both tidiness and nihilism. Risk-taking in tone and closure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit Seven's choices—adopting the kaleidoscope, carving with the arrow tip, stripping weight, launching—create every major turn. Present throughout; drives at least three beats; shapes the ending directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears in two distinct beats: discovery/selection and the carving work across "the evolution of his chassis." It enables the flight-pattern encoding that makes ascent possible. Causal pressure is high; swapping for "a sharp tool" would weaken specificity. Closure linkage is indirect but the carved gears click during launch.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The yearning algorithm is seeded in paragraph two, drives every modification choice, pulses faster with each change, and frames the ending's emotional cost (silence earned). It shapes stakes and tactics on the page, not merely theme. Removing it would collapse motivation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" enables Unit Seven's study of the acid and adoption of the kaleidoscope; it contrasts with panic during the collapse. The trait constrains choices (he watches rather than flees) with visible cost (time spent observing delays escape prep). Present in three beats but slightly more label-dependent than ideal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transliteration (storms into binary notches) is the story's mechanical and thematic hinge: it enables flight, dramatizes the impossible synthesis of poetry and mechanism, and charges the closure (the gears "clicking a rhythm"). Appears in two beats and the launch. Swapping for generic "programming" would gut specificity and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope is signaled early (paragraph two), its mechanics explained (fractal vision reveals updrafts), and it appears in three beats: adoption, storm-watching, and the launch where "kaleidoscopic vision" turns lightning into fireworks. The method constrains perception and enables navigation. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The workshop supplies material (canvas sails, debris) and imposes the acid-sea threat that forces weight reduction. Its dissolution triggers the launch, narrowing options. The setting pressures at least two choices and participates in closure timing. Micro-setting (Unit Seven's evolving chassis) also functions as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" structures the middle section and tightens at "the day of the Great Ascendance" when the floor dissolves. Time is tracked via modification stages and decay progression, altering tactics (strip faster as rot accelerates). Not a live second-by-second clock but a clear accumulative pressure with closure trigger.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ringing the bell is dramatized in the first third ("his obsession"), drives all modification choices, and lands in the final paragraph with visible cost (unheard, alone). Friction between the want (touch the sky) and cost (silence) is charged throughout. The motivation is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Irreverent awe is coherent from "holy mischief" through "destructive beauty" to the ending's "punchline to the universe's greatest joke." Tone modulates appropriately: playful during prep, awed during ascent, tragicomic at closure. The tone charges the final image and prevents sentimentality. Removing it would flatten the ending's emotional register.</comment>
