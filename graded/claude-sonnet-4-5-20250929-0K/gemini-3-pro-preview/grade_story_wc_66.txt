<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's interior life is specific and embodied—"thistled calm" and the physicality of transcribing under threat show a character under pressure. His motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" drives micro-choices (smothering the glow, planning the paper's release), though the final beat leans more toward satisfaction than a contradictory impulse that would elevate tension. The copyist role and underground resistance are clear, but the ending settles into resolved purpose rather than foreclosing a path with visible cost or presenting a harder trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The accumulative lens holds: dust particles magnetized by narrative weight, the violet glow as physical manifestation, and the planned dispersal into citizens' lungs all deepen the dominant stake (ending the story famine through infection of wonder). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian's satisfaction and readiness for the next song crystallize his stance with the cost implied in "quiet rebellion" and the risk just evaded. The cost feels more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page, which keeps this from the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove, shortwave radio, coat, and glowing manuscript all constrain choices (smothering the light to avoid patrols) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: orange geothermal light, damp air thick with memory fog, violet phosphorescence. The micro-setting of the desk and the mist outside shape tactics and the ending beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: the aqueducts and drones are mentioned but not fully integrated into spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation of narrative against the Silence Brigades) is signaled early and tightens when the patrol approaches, forcing the cloaking action. Agency is clear: Elian's decision to smother the glow and his planned dispersal method foreclose safer paths. The accumulative design provides one meaningful pressure point (the violet light threatening discovery), though the resolution leans toward Elian's practiced response rather than a harder trade-off. Cost is legible but not as sharp as it could be—no live option is visibly abandoned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (narrative as contagion, memory reclaiming form) emerges organically from the dust-magnetization mechanics and the planned "infection of wonder." The final image—watching the dial, heart beating against silence—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "The story famine would end, not with a shout, but with an infection of wonder" is slightly on-the-nose but functions more as a charged summation than a thesis statement. The Garden of Keys motif and the psychic weight of fiction deepen thematic layers without becoming allegorical stand-ins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "thistled calm," "gardener of ash," "memory fog" carry a poetic specificity that fits the reverent, subversive tone. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Minor: a few phrases ("the heavy atmosphere," "the living rhythm of the song") approach generic register, and "secretly luminous" as a descriptor slightly elevates diction during a peak beat without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting: "the detritus of the past, microscopic flecks of burned books and forgotten love letters suspended in the damp air like a memory fog" and "a physical manifestation of the narrative reclaiming its right to exist in a tangible form" both stretch figurative language in adjacent beats without a taught pattern. "Thistled calm" is fresh, but "memory fog" and "spiritual fire" cluster metaphorically. No loops or scaffolding, and the final line propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (dust as narrative carrier, song lyrics as coded history) is specific and non-obvious, and the mechanics (violet phosphorescence, chemical absorption, airborne dispersal) ground the concept in lived detail. The ending image—waiting for the next song, infection spreading—feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor: the "story famine" frame and oppressive regime evoke familiar dystopian templates, though the dust-transmission method and the specificities of the ember alcove transform the setup enough to avoid derivative scoring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's role as copyist is established early and contrasts with his night work, but the copyist skill (steady hand, notation eye) does not constrain or enable a key turn. His choices (transcribing, cloaking, planning dispersal) drive the story, but the "diligent orchestra copyist" trait itself remains background color rather than a tactical necessity at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in multiple beats: as hearth and compass, during transcription, and in the final line ("watched him like a conspirator"). It enables the core action (receiving the pirate broadcast) and charges the ending image. The amber glow contrasts with the violet manuscript light, and its persistence after the cloaking shapes the closure tableau. Irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is introduced early, shapes the entire middle (transmitting via song lyrics, shifting frequencies nightly), and drives Elian's transcription action. It enables the narrative seed that will disperse into citizens' lungs. The broadcast's mechanics (illegal signal, lyric coding, coordinates) constrain tactics and charge the stakes. Strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" manifests as the violet phosphorescence on the manuscript, introduced mid-story. It creates immediate cost: the glow threatens discovery, forcing the cloaking action. The luminosity is causally tied to the dust-magnetization concept and reappears in the ending ("under the coat, however, the chemical reaction continued in secret"). The trait enables a turn and participates in closure, though it arrives after setup.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cloaking action is the story's primary turn: Elian smothers the violet light with his coat to evade the patrol. This decision is prepared (he knows the patrols' habits, his movements are "precise and practiced") and shapes the ending (darkness returns, the reaction continues hidden). The action is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it would require structural rewrite. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Via elusive song lyrics" is signaled early (resistance transmits histories through lullabies and ballads) and shapes the core action: Elian transcribes the Garden of Keys song, capturing allegory woven into rhyme. The method's mechanics (meter, stanza breaks, hidden allegory) matter on the page and enable the dust-magnetization effect. The method participates in closure (waiting for the next song) and could not be swapped without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove is introduced early and provides resources (warmth, orange light, refuge) and constraints (heat signature risk, proximity to aqueducts). The setting shapes the cloaking choice (mist swirls, patrol approach) and charges the final image (shadows, wool-covered desk, amber dial). The alcove's specific qualities (geothermal vents, damp stone, memory fog) alter tactics and mood. Strong integration, though the aqueducts remain under-used.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the story famine" frames the entire premise and stakes (humanity starved of imagination, legends extinct). The timeframe is evoked throughout (the grey epoch, State conditioning, Silence Brigades) and motivates Elian's rebellion. However, it functions more as thematic backdrop than a live clock that tightens decisions beat-to-beat. The famine shapes why Elian acts but does not alter his tactics within the story window. Present and purposeful, but not irreplaceable as a specific constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is dramatized through Elian's transcription, his satisfaction with the magnetization effect, and his planned dispersal. The phrase itself appears on the page and drives the core action. The motivation is conflicted (risk of death vs. quiet rebellion) and shapes the ending choice (continuing the work). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the conflict leans more toward acceptance of risk than internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is introduced mid-story as "a specific kind of peace that was sharp, resilient, and guarded, ready to draw blood if disturbed." The tone coheres through the story's reverent-but-vigilant mood and modulates with pressure (the patrol approach tightens, the ending settles into slow rhythm). The phrase charges the final beat (Elian's protective hand, slow heartbeat against silence). The tone is distinct and purposeful, though the descriptor itself is more poetic gloss than a constraint on action.</comment>
