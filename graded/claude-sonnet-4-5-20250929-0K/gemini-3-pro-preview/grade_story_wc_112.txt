<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's internal contradiction—obliging mechanic masking radical obsession—is embodied through concrete choices (jury-rigged array, salvaged capacitors) and the closing decision to withhold his discovery while performing compliance. His motivation to prove sideways time is grounded in observed geometry and drives the central action. The impulse to "step sideways with them" and the final return to the wrench show contradictory pulls acting simultaneously. Minor slip: the phrase "optional at this length" from the rubric signals some relationship depth is absent, but the solo POV justifies this.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (research station, Elian, twilight storm) arrive within the first 100 words. The drive lens is Causal: Elian's preparation (weeks of waiting, device assembly) → lever pull → holographic manifestation → closure choice to withhold proof. Closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost: he returns to the "obliging" mechanic role, foreclosing the radical leap, holding the warmth of secret truth against the cold. The cost—remaining trapped in his linear life—is felt in the final image of the wrench and his planned complicity tomorrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gantry, magnetic nexus, and over-clocked capacitors constrain Elian's attempt and provide the means for his breakthrough. Sensory details—"bruise of indigo and violet," "icy warmth," "gossamer light"—are filtered through his professional and obsessive lens. The device's "mechanically warm" heat anchors the climax physically and charges the final contrast with biting cold. Micro-setting (the lever, the prism lenses) drives the key choice and the closing image (wrench in hand) reconfigures his stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled in paragraph two and sustained through the device activation. One meaningful tightening: the lever pull narrows Elian's options from hope to proof, then the magnetic drift collapses the window, forcing the choice to keep the secret or reveal it. His agency at closure (releasing the lever, picking up the wrench, planning tomorrow's compliance) forecloses the traveler path with visible cost. The temptation to step sideways with the Weavers adds moral weight to his renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—entrapment in linear time versus radical escape—emerges from concrete actions (device assembly, lever pull, return to wrench) without overt statement. The final image of holding "the warmth of the secret truth close to his chest against the biting cold" reweights the opening "obliging" stance as a chosen mask with ongoing cost. The Weavers' dual existence (dormant bodies, active projections) parallels Elian's split self. Minor slip: "time moves sideways" and "stack of infinite pages" veer slightly toward abstraction, though grounded in his obsession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance throughout. Elian's perceptual signature—mechanic's eye for rivets, salvaged capacitors, alignment checks—is character-specific and consistent. Diction ("duralumin," "over-clocked," "jury-rigged") fits his technical background. Under peak stress (holographic manifestation), syntax compresses appropriately: "First... Then... He saw... Another slid..." Micro filter-verb usage ("felt mechanically warm," "watched") is voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats during lever pull, longer accumulative sentences in the opening. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Minor paraphrase loop: "The scientists claimed... vanished" and "when the scientists panicked... he would offer" revisit the same contrast without escalating pressure. Stock metaphor "sky a bruise" is serviceable but not fresh. Figurative language in the climax ("gossamer light," "phantom fluttering") supports the moment without overwriting. Zero grammar or tense errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—mechanic obsessed with lateral time via holographic refraction of magnetic distortion—is specific and non-obvious. The Weavers' dual existence (dormant/active in alternate timelines) is a fresh inflection on migration mystery. Elian's closing choice to remain "obliging" while harboring proof avoids the predictable reveal-and-vindicate arc. Minor derivative element: the lonely research station and unappreciated genius trope are familiar, though executed with specificity (trash-compactor capacitors, tightened rivets). Risk-taking in the subdued climax (no explosion, phantom sensations) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's "obliging" trait is established early (fixes heaters, tightens rivets) and drives the closure: he returns to that mask, planning to "offer to check perimeter sensors" while concealing his discovery. His compliance enables the secret work and shapes the final renunciation—foreclosing the traveler path to remain in his service role. Present in setup, middle (device work), and payoff (wrench, tomorrow's plan). Choices create key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in setup (paragraph five), enables the holographic window (middle), and its drift out of alignment triggers closure (collapse of window, forcing Elian's choice). Used in two distinct beats: alignment check and final collapse. However, it functions more as a timer/constraint than an object handled or reweighted in meaning. Causal role is clear but not irreplaceable—another natural phenomenon could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" shapes stakes and tactics directly: Elian's device reveals the Weavers' lateral existence as "gossamer light" and "phantom fluttering," not explosive flash. The concept constrains his breakthrough's nature and charges the closure—he awakens to proof but chooses dormancy in his linear role. Present in setup (sleeping Weavers), middle (holographic ghosts detach), and payoff (returns to slumber/compliance). Reprise reweights the opening stillness as ongoing dual existence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" appears in setup (over-clocked capacitors), anchors the climax physically ("heat seeping into his gloves"), and contrasts with the final "biting cold." The warmth signals the device's readiness and embodies the "icy warmth" duality. Present in three beats but constrain/enable role is modest—the warmth marks operational state without altering tactics. The closure contrast (warmth of secret vs. cold) elevates it. Visible in setup, middle, payoff; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lever pull is the story's hinge: Elian's weeks of preparation converge in "a decisive clank," triggering the holographic manifestation and redefining his options from hypothesis to proof. Major turn traces directly to this action. Releasing the lever closes the window and forces the choice to conceal. Specific mechanics (heavy steel bar, archaic amidst digital) are irreplaceable. Present in setup (alignment prep), middle (pull), and payoff (release). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Holographic principles" are signaled in setup ("refracting ambient light through magnetic distortion... three-dimensional interference pattern"), shape the middle attempt (prism lenses, interference pattern), and deliver the closure proof (holographic ghosts). The method matters—it's not radar or sonar, but light refraction. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; more tactile handling would strengthen. Present in setup, middle (flickering projection), and payoff (collapse). Moderate causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The research station provides the platform (gantries, external access) and social context (ungrateful researchers, Elian's service role). The stratosphere location and glass spire anchor the isolation. However, the station itself is more backdrop than active constraint—the magnetic nexus and device drive tactics. The closing plan (tomorrow's sensor check) uses the station's social structure. Present in setup, minor middle pressure, modest payoff role. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" frames the opening and closing (return to "slumbering, frozen forms"). The timeframe—twilight alignment, Weavers' slumber—constrains when Elian can act and creates urgency (magnetic drift forces closure). However, the hush is more atmospheric than a live clock that alters moves beat by beat. Present in setup and payoff reprise; moderate constraint in middle (alignment window). Lyric resonance but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to prove sideways time is dramatized through concrete actions (device assembly, weeks of waiting, lever pull) and conflicted in the climax (urge to step sideways vs. return to wrench). The desire drives setup, middle, and closure choice. Friction between want (proof, escape) and cost (remaining obliging, holding the secret) is visible on the page. The final image of warmth vs. cold embodies the ongoing tension. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is coherent throughout: "duality in the air" (setup), "mechanically warm" device amid "biting cold" wind (middle), and the final contrast—warmth of secret truth held "against the biting cold" (payoff). The tone charges the closure image and reflects Elian's paradox (radical obsession in compliant mask). Modulates with pressure: pervasive atmosphere in setup, physical duality at climax, emotional duality at end. Distinct perceptual signature and purposeful recurrence.</comment>
