<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias exhibits silent empathy through embodied action—angling the dental mirror, manipulating cranks—but his interior remains opaque; we observe purpose without internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The woman's grief is sketched through physical cues (white knuckles, trembling, sharp breath), yet her arc compresses into passive reception rather than choice. The motivation to "teach darkness the value of stars" reads as authorial overlay rather than emerging from dramatized fear or want. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; the ending reconfigures the woman's stance without her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (storm aftermath, canal dock, two figures). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the woman's breath and realization crystallize a shift in stance—her secret no longer festers, "woven into the night"—with conceptual cost implicit in her acceptance of darkness as necessary canvas. The lantern sequence accumulates density through mechanical specificity and the final starburst image reweights the premise. One deduction: the woman's internal arc (festering guilt → quiet acceptance) is told rather than traced through her own choices, weakening closure agency slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, wet timber, ozone scent, and shipping-crane shadows anchor early and coherently. The antique lantern mechanism—brass gears, adjustable louvers, ventilation grate—constrains Elias's method: the dental mirror becomes necessary to navigate "narrow, angular recesses." The created light-pattern on black canal water charges the final image, making setting indispensable to closure. Micro-setting (dental mirror, louvers, industrial channel) functions as pressure and resource. Minor slip: "spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" tilt toward abstract mood-setting in places rather than filtering through tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the woman's need to unburden crushing guilt. Elias's silent demonstration tightens pressure by redirecting her attention from internal abyss to external pattern, narrowing options from confession to acceptance. The louver manipulation deepens meaning—strips of light intersecting with shadows—culminating in her released breath and realization. Cost is conceptual (the secret remains unspoken but no longer festers), legible in the final image. Escalation, however, is driven entirely by Elias's action; the woman's agency is absent, limiting the felt price of her shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: "light without shadow has no depth," "darkness the value of stars," the geometric starburst as answer to her guilt. The final tableau—her looking at dark spaces between beams—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: secrets as necessary background for redemption. No overt moralizing. One weakness: "teach darkness the value of stars" is stated as Elias's motivation rather than arising purely from concrete action, and the woman's epiphany ("understood that her own secrets were merely the background required for her redemption to shine") edges toward articulation that could trust image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to a stable, elevated register filtering the scene through external observation and Elias's tactile focus. Diction remains controlled: "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "lattice that moved with the gentle undulation of the tide." Perceptual signature is present in the mechanical specificity (dental mirror, tumblers, louvers). Two frictions: the phrase "core concept of silent empathy" reads as authorial gloss rather than POV-rooted perception, and the woman's final understanding is told with clarity she likely wouldn't articulate mid-crisis. No dialogue present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift from subject-verb to participial and prepositional phrases. Information density is high in the lantern-manipulation sequence. Three artifact clusters lower the score: elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "tapestry of luminescence") stacks without pattern-teaching in a brief window; the phrase "a core concept of silent empathy" is abstract meta-commentary; and "the crushing weight of her guilt" + "her internal abyss" paraphrase the same state across adjacent beats. Template cadence appears in "He knew... so he turned... He began..." Minor clarity slip: "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" as timeframe remains vague throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—canal guardian using a dental mirror to operate an antique signal lantern, transforming light into silent counsel—is specific and non-obvious. The element combination (industrial harbor, dental instrument, pattern-weaving) avoids template tropes. Risk-taking in the premise (wholly silent intervention, no dialogue) heightens conceptual stakes. The transformation test passes: swap Elias and the lantern for a different setting/method, and the emotional arc would require fundamental rewrites. One friction: the "silent empathy" + "teach darkness the value of stars" frame echoes familiar wisdom-figure templates; execution through concrete action (mirror, louvers, starburst) elevates it into fresh territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias present from paragraph 3; his choices (retrieve mirror, angle it, manipulate cranks, withdraw mirror, nod) drive the lantern sequence and create the pattern that reframes the woman's guilt. He appears in the closure beat (nod, gaze back to canal). Two beats: mirror insertion/manipulation and final acknowledgment. Cost connection: his silent method forecloses verbal comfort. Swappability friction: a different silent guide with a different skill could serve; the "guardian" role is more label than causal constraint. Score ~6.7: essential across two beats, shapes ending, but not indispensable—another skillful operator could achieve similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dental mirror introduced paragraph 10; used in two distinct beats (insertion/angling to see tumblers, checking alignment during manipulation, withdrawal/wiping condensation). Its narrow precision enables navigation of the lantern's "narrow, angular recesses," a unique property. Present in closure zone (withdrawal, pocket). Causal pressure: without it, Elias cannot execute the hidden-mechanism method. Specificity high: "slender instrument that glinted sharply," "small glass disc." Minor friction: it could be replaced by another precision tool (jeweler's loupe, mechanic's scope) with scene edits, preventing indispensability. Score ~7.8: drives two beats, shapes ending, high specificity, narrowly misses indispensable due to swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" stated paragraph 7 ("his existence was defined by a core concept of silent empathy") but remains label-only until demonstrated through the lantern action. It constrains Elias's method (he does not speak, turns from her grief to the mechanism) and shapes the ending's wordless nod. Present across the lantern sequence as tactic-driver. Cost: verbal comfort is foreclosed. Friction: the concept is told as thesis rather than emerging through choice; it could be renamed "wordless compassion" or "mute care" without structural change. Score ~5.2: shapes one key turn (lantern demonstration) and ending gesture, but swappable phrasing and label-heavy introduction limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears paragraph 12 as descriptive label ("a demeanor that was spiralingly calm, possessing a center of gravity..."). It characterizes Elias's state during the lantern work but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—his fluid manipulation would read identically if described as "steady" or "focused." No beats where the spiral quality alters a tactic. Late signal (second half). Ornamental: vivid diction without causal work. Score ~4.8: functional descriptor present during key beat, but replaceable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Weave" signaled paragraph 16 ("He began to weave it"); the action structures the entire lantern sequence (shifting louvers, fracturing beam into tapestry, creating lattice, stabilizing starburst). Major turn: the woman's trembling stops, eyes drawn to the display, breath released. Present in closure beat ("woven into the night"). Causal: the weaving creates the pattern that reframes her guilt. Specificity: "ribbons," "tapestry of luminescence," "lattice," "geometric starburst." Cost: Elias's labor and silence are required. Minor friction: the weaving is one method among possible light-demonstrations; a different pattern could serve similar thematic work. Score ~8.1: drives escalation and ending, high specificity, narrowly misses indispensable due to alternate-method plausibility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Creating patterns with shutters" signaled paragraph 14 ("a method of creating patterns with shutters that few living operators understood"); mechanics matter throughout the sequence (louvers shift degrees, beam fractures into ribbons, strips intersect, aperture alignment checked). Shapes two beats: initial manipulation and final starburst stabilization. Present in closure image (the artificial stars drifting). Causal: the method enables the silent demonstration. Specificity: louvers, cranks, tumblers, ventilation grate. Friction: the method is introduced mid-scene (~40% mark) and could be simplified to "signal-light operation" without total collapse. Score ~7.4: essential across two beats and ending, but late signal and moderate swappability prevent indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cobalt dock after rain" anchored paragraph 2 ("bruised sky above the cobalt dock after rain"); wet timber, ozone, glossy dark water recur. The dock setting supplies the lantern (resource) and the canal water (surface for the light-pattern display). Present in closure beat (canal, water carrying stars toward sea). Two beats: initial mood-setting and final image. Causal: without the water surface, the lattice/starburst cannot be projected. Specificity: industrial channel, shipping cranes, wooden pilings. Friction: "cobalt" is decorative color; the dock could be gray, iron, or stone without altering tactics. Score ~6.3: purposeful early/final reprise, supplies key resource, but color and some detail are replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears paragraph 6 as abstract frame ("a confession that hovered dangerously within the edge of a half-spoken secret"); time remains vague throughout—no clock, no tracking of minutes, no pressure from an approaching deadline. The woman's confession never materializes, so the "edge" is metaphorical duration rather than a live constraint. No beats where time tightens a decision. Ornamental: poetic phrasing without tactical pressure. Score ~3.1: present as thematic frame, but does not alter choices or momentum.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" stated paragraph 23 ("His driving motivation was to teach darkness the value of stars"); it constrains Elias's method (he does not banish night, he weaves light and shadow together). Present in two beats: the lantern manipulation and the woman's realization. Cost: Elias's silence and labor are spent to demonstrate rather than explain. Friction: the motivation is told rather than emerging through conflicted choice (want versus fear absent); it could be paraphrased as "illuminate without erasing shadow" with minor edits. Score ~6.9: shapes escalation and ending, but told-only and moderate swappability prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" introduced paragraph 5 ("The atmosphere vibrated with a stillwater tension, a physical weight..."); the tone holds through the woman's trembling, Elias's calm, the lantern sequence, and the final "quiet acceptance that mirrored the calm water below." It modulates: initial oppressive weight → fluid manipulation → dissipated tension replaced by acceptance. Coherent through turns; charges the final image (stillwater → calm water, tension resolved). Present across all beats. Friction: "stillwater" is vivid but slightly abstract; the tone could be described as "suspended" or "held" without structural change. Score ~7.2: essential across beats and ending, coherent modulation, but moderate replaceability in phrasing prevents indispensability.</comment>
