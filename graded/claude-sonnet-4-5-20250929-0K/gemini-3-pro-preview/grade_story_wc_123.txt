<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as storm recorder is established early and her micro-choices under pressure—climbing laterally, pocketing the tube—are concretely embodied. Internal contradiction is present (scientific curiosity vs. survival caution) but remains somewhat schematic; the final stance of "strange detachment" arrives without sufficient on-page earned cost to feel inevitable. Embodied emotion ("fingers finding a solid grip," "pressed herself flat") works well in the physical beats, but interiority occasionally drifts toward declaration ("feeling a strange detachment") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows a causal lens: Elara is followed → retreats → gate breaks → escapes laterally, and the carrier pigeon message introduces a meaningful complication. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she has lost her station but preserved independence and the secret message—with conceptual cost visible ("they could not reach the data she carried"). One meaningful tightening (the gate break forcing the lateral climb) is present, though the final image's cost could be more sharply felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is vivid and purposeful: "purple shadows," "overgrown garden," "rust patterns and the grip of the vines" all filter through Elara's professional eye and guide her escape route. The aged iron and decorative ridge constrain her lateral traverse, satisfying the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography during the climb is clear and the environment charges the final image (mossy tiles, abandoned terrace). Minor: the "rogue quarantine zone" context remains somewhat abstract rather than pressing choices on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve records and escape pursuit—is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the causal lens: bolt the gate → gate breaks → climb laterally → reach safety while instruments are destroyed. The lateral traverse is a protagonist-driven choice with visible cost (loss of her station, her life's work smashed below). One meaningful tightening forecloses the straight-up climb option, and the final cost is legible: she has traded her physical sanctuary for the data she carries. Agency is present throughout, and coincidence (the pigeon's arrival) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—integrity vs. survival, truth under siege—emerges from concrete choices (keeping records pure, pocketing the tube, enduring the destruction below) rather than assertion. The final image offers a resonant answer: "she would guard it with the same rigor she applied to her charts." However, the last line ("The storm was here, and she was ready to record it") edges toward thematic statement rather than earned image, and the pigeon/message as symbolic vehicle arrives late without sufficient prior grounding to fully charge the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; third-limited focalization remains tight to Elara's perception throughout. Diction is controlled and matches her professional idiom ("load-bearing capacity," "evaporation pan," "rust patterns"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices equipment, atmospheric pressure, structural detail. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the climb to heighten urgency. Minor: a few lines drift slightly elevated ("possessed of a scientific mind that compelled her to investigate every anomaly") but remain voice-plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the gate-break and climb ("she shuffled sideways," "hand over hand"). Information density is high in the physical beats. Two minor loops appear: "the air felt heavy with unspoken threats" / "atmosphere possessed a layered tranquility" restate similar content, and "moved toward her equipment" is followed immediately by describing the equipment without advancing pressure (−0.2 paraphrase loop, −0.3 scaffold). No figurative muddle or template cadence in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion are strong; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone and analog storm-recording premise offer a fresh angle on surveillance-state tropes, and the lateral escape is a non-obvious spatial solution. However, the carrier pigeon arrives late and feels somewhat ornamental—a generic "message from the resistance" device that does not transform the emotional or thematic arc in a surprising way. The final image ("she was ready to record it") is earnest but predictable. Transformation test: the plot could function with a different message-delivery mechanism and similar emotional stakes, suggesting mid-band freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's identity as storm recorder shapes her perceptual filter (rust patterns, atmospheric pressure, equipment handling) and her final stance ("guard it with the same rigor she applied to her charts"). Present in setup, middle (handling equipment, professional caution), and closure. The trait enables her lateral escape by providing spatial observation skills, and the final cost—losing her station but preserving her records—is tied to this identity. However, the character could function as any detail-oriented professional without fundamental breakage; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The message tube appears in two beats: arrival (unclipping the cylinder) and final paragraph (fingering the tube, vowing to guard its truth). It introduces a complication but does not constrain the escape or alter tactics—Elara pockets it and proceeds with the same plan. No reweighted meaning at closure; it remains a static MacGuffin. Introduced past the one-third mark and used ornamentally in the ending without causal pressure. Cap 4.6 (late intro) applies; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone context is established early (government cutoff, ideological contagion) and explains why Elara works alone and why digital communication is unavailable, motivating the carrier pigeon. It shapes the antagonist's hazmat gear and the siege atmosphere. However, on-page it functions mainly as backstory; the specific mechanics of the quarantine do not constrain Elara's choices during the escape sequence. Present in setup and thematically relevant, but middle development is thin—no live choice turns on quarantine rules.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is shown when Elara extends her hand to unclip the message tube despite danger, and the narration states "she was credibly curious, possessed of a scientific mind that compelled her to investigate every anomaly." The trait enables one mid-scene action (taking the tube) with immediate cost (delay as the gate breaks). However, the phrasing is slightly label-heavy and the trait does not constrain the escape itself—she could have ignored the pigeon without altering the lateral climb. Present in setup (signal) and middle (one choice), but not in closure; tradeoff is visible but modest.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Intuit the safest path" is signaled explicitly ("she had to intuit the safest path based on the rust patterns and the grip of the vines") and drives the major turn: rejecting the straight-up climb, choosing the lateral traverse. The action is irreplaceable—removing "intuit" and replacing it with calculation or guesswork would require structural edits to her professional identity and the time pressure. It shapes two beats (decision, execution) and is causally linked to the escape's success. Present across setup (skill established), middle (decision), and implicitly in closure (she succeeded because she intuited correctly).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Progressing laterally" is signaled in setup ("she decided to escape by progressing laterally"), executed in detail across multiple beats ("shuffled sideways," "hand over hand, moving away from her home while keeping her elevation constant"), and the method's mechanics matter—it avoids silhouetting her and allows passage to the neighbor's balcony. Removing this exact method would break the escape logic; vertical or ground-level alternatives were foreclosed by the text. The specificity (horizontal decorative ridge, balcony railing) ties the method to setting. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored early ("quiet courtyard at dusk," "purple shadows stretched long," "overgrown garden") and provides concrete resources for the escape (stone planter, decorative ridge, ivy cover). It supplies the stage for the destruction of her instruments, charging the loss with spatial specificity. The courtyard's layout constrains the lateral path and the "mossy tiles" in the final image provide tactile closure. Present in setup, middle (enables escape choices), and closure (final vantage point). Could still function with a generic "enclosed space," but the overgrown, aged details add modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After being followed home" is the inciting pressure, established in the second sentence and driving immediate stakes (bolt the gate, listen for footsteps). The timeframe tightens decisions throughout: "she did not have time to calculate," gate "finally splintered," she must move before being seen. The clock is implicit rather than counted, but urgency is felt. Present in setup (followed home triggers retreat), middle (time pressure forces intuition over calculation), and implicitly in closure (she escaped before capture). The phrase itself is less a constraint than a mood anchor; the pressure is real but the timeframe could be described more generically without breakage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Nurture integrity in solitude" is stated explicitly ("a disciplined practice that allowed her to nurture integrity in solitude") and dramatized through her choice to keep records "pure and uncorrupted" and her final vow to "guard it with the same rigor she applied to her charts." The motivation drives the setup (why she records) and closure (why she values the message despite losing her station). However, the desire is told more than shown in friction—there is no on-page moment where integrity conflicts sharply with survival during the escape itself; the choices align smoothly. Present in all three gates but with modest dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" is explicitly named ("The atmosphere possessed a layered tranquility, a surface-level calm that barely concealed the humming tension") and the tone modulates across the piece: dusk quiet → gate-break violence → suspended stillness during the climb → "strange detachment" at the end. The tone charges the final image (silence of the abandoned terrace after destruction). However, the phrase "layered tranquility" is somewhat abstract and the modulation is gentle rather than sharp; the ending's tranquility feels asserted ("she was ready to record it") rather than fully embodied in image. Present in setup and closure with modest reweighting; middle beats shift toward action urgency.</comment>
