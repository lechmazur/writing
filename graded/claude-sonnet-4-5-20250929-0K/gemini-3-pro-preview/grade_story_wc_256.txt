<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" is articulated but remains abstract; her mid-scene realization ("What if the light generated by the prism-song could be given physical mass?") feels slightly abrupt rather than earned by prior embodied contradiction. Kael's grief is told more than shown through micro-choices, and his disappointment crumples without layered internal resistance. The final moment succeeds emotionally, but the path there lacks the embodied, contradictory impulses that would lift this into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens and delivers an on-page closure with visible cost: Elara breaks her trade's rules and finds the texture she sought, while Kael receives physical contact from memory. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two). The turn—focusing light through the salvaged lens—narrows options and changes the outcome, though the realization arrives quickly without intermediate failure or constraint that would tighten pressure further. Cost is legible in "breaking the rules of her trade," satisfying the closure requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly anchored with clerestory windows, glass canisters, acoustic damping, and golden shadows. The miner's carbide lamp lens is a concrete, salvaged object whose concave glass properties matter causally at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (dais, workbench, distance across the room), and the lens focuses dispersed energy into a tangible beam, directly shaping the final image and constraining Elara's solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's search for connection beyond performance—is signaled early. Kael's failed pilgrimage provides immediate external pressure. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when Elara stops mid-strike and improvises with the lens, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off (breaking established protocol). The cost is visible: she abandons the "rigid laws of the new world" and risks her professional standing. No intermediate reversals deepen the escalation, keeping this in the solid mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: the inadequacy of digital restoration, the gap between data and felt memory, and the possibility of sensory translation. The final image—light made tactile, past reaching out to hold the living—resonates without stated moral. The phrase "texture of connection" risks abstraction but is anchored by the physical sensation Kael receives. No heavy-handed moralizing; the piece trusts its particulars to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV through Elara is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the setting's slightly archaic formality ("prism-song bell ringer," "artificial pilgrimage"). Kael's whispered line and Elara's command are goal-driven and naturalistic. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's focus on acoustic and optical phenomena. Minor register elevation ("fabricated rituals," "acoustic damping") fits the Laboratory's scholarly air without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are strong overall, but several lines carry slight overwriting: "vast, vaulted chamber," "deep, golden shadows," "heavy, rumbling embrace" lean on paired modifiers. The phrase "the sensation that was powerfully gentle" directly echoes the required attribute, reading slightly template-planted rather than organic. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in the opening third ("flickering chaos," "sanctuary for the obsolete," "hollow ache") slightly slows momentum. Propulsion recovers at the turn and sustains through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—translating audio frequencies into visible spectra, then focusing light to create physical touch—offers a fresh synthesis of sensory translation and memory. The miner's carbide lamp lens as the solution is specific and non-obvious. However, the "artificial pilgrimage" concept and the broad frame (post-crisis world, lost analog textures, fabricated mourning rituals) echo familiar speculative-fiction templates. The emotional core (grandson seeking grandfather's laugh) is archetypal but executed with enough specificity to avoid pure derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara as prism-song bell ringer shapes the story's logic and closure: her instrument enables the experiment, her dissatisfaction drives the search, and her mid-scene decision to mount the lens creates the final breakthrough. She appears in setup, drives the middle turn, and executes the closure beat. Her role is irreplaceable; no other character could perform this function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens is introduced at the turn ("cluttered workbench," "salvaged from the ruins"), mounted hastily, and its concave properties focus the light into a tangible beam at closure. It appears in two distinct beats (selection and use) and its specific function—intensifying weak flame into piercing beam—directly enables the outcome. The lens is causally indispensable and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage frames Kael's visit and the story's thematic question (mourning losses never experienced), shaping the dominant stake. It appears in setup and informs the ending's emotional payoff, but does not constrain middle choices or alter tactics. The concept provides context and resonance but remains more thematic scaffold than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is realized on the page when the focused beam hits Kael: "not a violent blow, but a sensation that was powerfully gentle, like a heavy blanket dropped suddenly onto shivering shoulders." The phrase constrains the closure effect (the touch must comfort, not harm) and is embodied in action. It shapes the final beat and could not be easily swapped without altering the story's emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Propel drives the climax: Elara uses the lens to "propel the physical sensation of the sound across the room, bridging the distance instantly." The action is causally central—without it, no closure occurs—and is prepared by the lens's salvaged properties. The verb captures both the physical mechanism and the emotional breakthrough, making it indispensable to the story's final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is signaled when Elara realizes she "had been operating under the rigid laws of the new world: that sound was for hearing and light was for seeing." This insight drives her decision to mount the lens and attempt a new solution. The method appears at the turn and shapes the climax, though it arrives as a single realization rather than a sustained process across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds provides the glass canisters, acoustic damping, clerestory windows, workbench with salvaged lens, and the dais. The setting supplies the necessary tool (carbide lamp lens) and frames the dominant conflict (analog loss, digital inadequacy). It is established early, pressures Elara's choices, and remains integral to the closure beat. The setting is not swappable without losing causal coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the power grid stabilizes" (the Great Stabilization) provides backstory context and establishes the "new era of constant, unwavering electricity" that contrasts with the Laboratory's archive. It shapes the thematic premise but does not constrain choices or create urgency within the scene. The element is present in setup but remains decorative at the closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to discover the texture of connection—is stated early ("despite the beauty… Elara felt a hollow ache") and drives her dissatisfaction with "simple performance." The motivation is tested when Kael's pilgrimage fails, prompting her improvisation. It is realized at closure when she "had finally found the texture she sought." The desire is dramatized through action and resolved with visible cost (breaking trade rules).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Golden shadows appear in the opening ("late afternoon sun… deep, golden shadows") and return at closure ("the golden shadows of the laboratory seemed to solidify around them"). The tone modulates from melancholy and failure (Kael's disappointment, indigo/violet light as "cold") to warmth and contact (amber light, solidified shadows). The reprise reweights the opening image, though the phrase itself is more atmospheric anchor than causal force.</comment>
