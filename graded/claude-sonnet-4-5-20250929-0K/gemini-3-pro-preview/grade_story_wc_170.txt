<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her magic system creates concrete choices, but her interiority remains thin—she's more archetype than individual. The man in the chair is entirely passive, a prop for her work rather than a character with agency. The "perceptively calm" attribute appears as a label without embodied contradiction or cost. Elara's alteration of the reflection demonstrates competence but lacks genuine struggle or foreclosed options that would earn higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elara needs water droplets, sound, and a borrowed heartbeat to complete her mirage before the bells ring. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The closure unit—the man standing with purpose after seeing the mirage—lands on the page as a Decisive Change, though the cost is felt only obliquely (Elara dissolves, the spell ends). The ticking clock creates genuine pressure, and the magic system's mechanics drive escalation cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism parapet after rain functions as both setting and tool, constraining Elara's method and timing. Spatial choreography (terrace, balcony doors, oval mirror, sleeping dog) remains coherent throughout. Sensory detail—wet stone, lilac scent, violet sky—filters through the moment without tourist-catalog excess. The terrace as micro-setting charges the final image when Elara dissolves into the damp evening air, though the high city itself remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the mirage before the bells ring—is signaled early and tightens through a clear sequence: locate heartbeat, hum lullaby, guide light, maintain alignment. The bell's toll provides a concrete ticking-clock reversal that shatters the spell at the moment of completion. Elara's agency drives each turn (choosing the dog's pulse, weaving the illusion), and the cost is visible: her form dissolves, the alignment breaks. The man's passivity keeps this from higher bands, but the escalation under a causal lens is solid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of showing possibilities versus accepting broken reality emerges through image and action rather than statement. The mirage-as-redemption concept integrates with Elara's method, and the final image of the man moving toward his desk provides a non-literal answer. However, the theme edges toward sentimentality—the "seed of the future" phrase in the closing lines flirts with moralizing. The recurring motif of light/refraction charges the closure, but the ending narration ("The possibilities had been shown") risks over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with focalization cleanly on Elara throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("elusive mirage painter," "acoustic suspension," "ethereal colors"), though some phrases ("fever dream on the edge of vision," "crushing failure") drift toward stock lyricism. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn't tested. The phrase "perceptively calm" as external description creates a minor distance wobble—it reads as narrator judgment rather than Elara's self-perception. Psychic distance is otherwise controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately from setup to climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle beats (lullaby mechanics, light weaving). However, several lines carry decorative weight without advancing pressure: "a weaver of light whom few had ever seen" adds mystique but no stakes; "settling over the spires in a dusky harmony that blurred the sharp edges of the world" is pretty but static. The phrase "heavy with the weight of regret and a singular, crushing failure" stacks near-synonyms. Minor template cadence in the opening (multiple sentences beginning with setting description). No loops or causality breaks, but figurative density in non-peak beats reduces propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives, and the borrowed-heartbeat mechanic is inventive. The coded-lullaby method and prism-parapet tool show specific imagination. However, the emotional arc—artist helps despairing man see hope—trends toward familiar territory, and the high-fantasy diction ("elusive mirage painter," "weaver of light") leans on archetype rather than lived-in specificity. The "seeing potential for redemption in a mirror" core reads close to widely used "show them their better self" templates. Transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (the elusive mirage painter) is present throughout and drives every key turn: selecting the dog's heartbeat, humming the lullaby, guiding the light, watching the man respond. Her choices create the escalation and the closure. Introduced in paragraph one, active in the middle (weaving the illusion), and present at closure (dissolving after the spell breaks). The role is indispensable—without her agency, no story exists.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet after rain appears in paragraph two as the tool Elara needs ("water droplets...acting as a thousand tiny lenses"), is actively used in paragraph five ("the water droplets on the parapet began to vibrate"), and is destroyed at closure when the bell "scattering the droplets on the parapet" breaks the spell. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (the prism effect enables the mirage), and closure linkage. The exact object—wet carved railing—cannot be swapped without breaking the magic system.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is signaled in paragraph five ("she reached out...and seized upon a borrowed heartbeat"), provides the anchor that grounds the mirage ("grounding the ethereal colors with earthly blood"), and shapes the magic's mechanics (Elara cannot use her own life force). It enables the key tactic and alters the rules of the magic system. Removal would break the logic. The concept is specific—using a sleeping dog's pulse—and causally active, though it does not return or reweight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears once in paragraph two as a label describing Elara's expression. It does not constrain an on-page choice, create friction, or visibly trade off against another impulse. The trait is consistent with her actions (she does not rush, she waits for the right moment), but it remains ornamental—a quality that could be removed or swapped (e.g., "focused," "serene") without structural impact. No middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Grace" appears in paragraph six ("With fluid grace, Elara swept her hands forward") as a descriptor of her physical action while guiding the light. The gesture is part of the spell's execution, but "grace" itself is not load-bearing—"precision," "care," or "intent" could replace it with minor edits. The action (sweeping hands to guide light) is essential; the attribute "grace" is not. No setup, no closure charge, and swappable within the same beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coded lullabies in children's songs are introduced in paragraph four ("She channeled her magic through coded lullabies in children's songs"), the specific song ("The Skylark's Return") is named and its mechanics explained ("mathematical frequencies required to bend reality"), and the lullaby is actively used in paragraph five to make the droplets vibrate. The method reappears at closure: "The lullaby faded into the boom of the bronze." Three beats, causal pressure (the spell requires this method), and closure linkage (its fading marks the spell's end). The exact method—nursery rhyme with hidden frequencies—cannot be swapped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring is introduced in paragraph one, provides the physical stage for all action (wet tiles, open balcony doors, parapet, space for the sleeping dog), and supplies the moisture Elara needs (rain-wet droplets). The terrace's specific features (prism parapet, overhang sheltering the dog) enable tactics. At closure, Elara dissolves "into the damp evening air" of the terrace, charging the final image. Setup, middle constraint (the location supplies necessary resources), and closure participation. The exact setting—post-rain terrace—is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Over the hush before bells ring" is signaled in paragraph two ("her window of opportunity was perilously narrow...over the hush before bells ring"), creates live pressure throughout the middle beats (Elara must complete the spell before the acoustic suspension shatters), and lands decisively at closure when "the first heavy toll of the hour struck...breaking the alignment of the light." The timeframe drives pacing, narrows tactics, and provides the reversal that ends the spell. The exact constraint—acoustic silence before bells—cannot be removed without collapsing the tension.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to persuade mirrors to show possibilities" is stated in paragraph three ("Her motivation was strictly to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"), dramatized through Elara's actions (humming, weaving light, anchoring with heartbeat), and pays off at closure when the man sees his potential and stands. The desire drives every choice and shapes the magic's goal. Friction exists between the difficulty of the task (narrow window, complex requirements) and the stakes (the man's redemption). Setup, middle pursuit, and closure payoff all present, with visible cost (Elara dissolves).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears in paragraph one ("the twilight deepened, settling over the spires in a dusky harmony") as the opening tone. The tone is soft, contemplative, and slightly melancholy throughout—matching Elara's calm focus and the man's quiet despair. At closure, the tone shifts slightly when the bell's "boom" intrudes, but the final image returns to muted lyricism ("dissolving into the damp evening air," "lingering scent of rain"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (quiet → intrusion → quiet), and the "dusky" palette charges the final image of Elara dissolving into evening air. Not indispensable but purposeful.</comment>
