<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas shows clear motivation and embodied purpose through his practiced observation of the crows and the tactile handling of the arrowhead. His decades-long entrapment and the anchoring detail of dust at his ankles ground his stakes. The final choice to walk "guided by the memory of the echo" demonstrates earned agency, though the interiority remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "his consciousness tethered to the reverberations" border on telling rather than showing the shift. Internal contradiction is muted; we see resolve more than genuine struggle against doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure lands cleanly: Silas achieves sensory displacement, maps the exit through acoustic projection, and begins to walk with earned knowledge—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to decisive movement) with visible cost (decades spent listening, the shattered arrowhead). The piece operates under a Causal lens with acoustic logic threading cause to effect: crow observation → trajectory calculation → harmonic intersection with the ancient scream → route revelation. Orientation anchors (who, where, what) appear by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fresh tone intersects the ancient pulse, crystallizing the geography of his trap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ossified canyon, calcified ribs, and layered dust form a vivid, oppressive micro-world that directly constrains Silas's movement (ankles buried) and enables his method (hollow calcium structures as resonators). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the "vicious hum" of obsidian, the "sharp, resonant *clack*," and the visual map traced by crow flight. The setting charges the final image—"where the birds would refuse to fly" becomes navigational proof. Spatial choreography (tower, canyon walls, exit) tracks cleanly across the acoustic journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving, to escape decades of entrapment—is signaled early and pursued with clear agency. Pressure tightens when the arrowhead's fresh tone intersects the ancient scream, creating the "interference pattern" that illuminates the trap's geometry. The escalation is causal (observation → throw → harmonic convergence → sensory displacement → discovery) and the cost is legible: the shattered arrowhead, decades of failed attempts, the physical toll of standing motionless. A secondary ethical or moral calculus is absent, keeping the stakes largely technical and spatial rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: sound as memory, entrapment as both spatial and temporal, mastery requiring surrender of the body. The intersection of past scream and present throw offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to escape) without moralizing. However, the piece leans toward conceptual architecture—"harmonic stone skimmer," "acoustic projection"—that occasionally abstracts the human struggle. The final image ("knowing exactly where the birds would refuse to fly") reweights prior material with poetic specificity, though the emotional aftereffect remains more cerebral than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Silas's expertise and sensory apparatus. Perceptual signature is distinct: he reads air density through bird patterns, feels texture through sound, experiences the canyon as an acoustic instrument. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though phrases like "theoretically impossible" and "acoustic chamber" occasionally drift toward technical register without full immersion in Silas's lived idiom. Psychic distance narrows cleanly during the throw sequence. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the prose propels forward with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "coiled his body with the tension of a tightly wound spring," "rode the sound wave." Two mild artifacts: "He was no longer the old man standing in the dust; he was the sound itself" edges toward explicit telling of transformation, and repeated constructions like "He [verb]" appear in adjacent beats without taught pattern. Sentence openings vary well. No paraphrase loops or template cadence that touches closure. Clarity remains strong under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic navigation, fossilized canyon-as-instrument, and temporal layering (ancient scream still wandering) feels specific and non-obvious. The crow-based air-density reading and harmonic stone-skimming method avoid generic mystic tropes through technical specificity. Risk-taking is evident in the conceptual density and the choice to make the climax a sensory rather than physical breakthrough. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. One proximity caution: the "sound itself" phrasing and echo-as-memory motif echo existing speculative fiction beats, though the acoustic skimming method transforms them sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas as "harmonic stone skimmer" is introduced in paragraph three, drives all major beats (observing crows, launching the arrowhead, riding the sound wave), and his mastery enables the climactic intersection with the ancient scream. His decision to walk at the end demonstrates agency earned by prior skill. The character is essential; the story fails without this exact expertise. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian arrowhead appears early (paragraph six), is handled with tactile reverence ("ran his thumb over the serrated edge"), serves as the acoustic projectile across multiple beats (launch, ricochets, harmonic convergence), and shatters at the climax—its destruction marking the completion of the sensory map. The object is causally indispensable and its specific properties (serrated, knapped, volcanic glass) matter to the acoustic function. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A pulse left wandering" (the ancient scream) is introduced in paragraph twenty-four, functions as the key to unlocking the trap when intersected by the fresh tone, and directly shapes the climax. However, its late first appearance (well past the first third) and single-beat payoff limit integration. The concept is essential to closure but does not constrain earlier choices or enable multiple tactics. Functional with strong closure linkage but introduced too late for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears once in paragraph seven as Silas handles the arrowhead. The trait colors his relationship to the tool but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost—he throws the arrowhead regardless of reverence. The attribute reads more as atmospheric character shading than as a lever that alters tactics or outcome. Present and logically consistent but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Appraise" structures the crow-observation beat (paragraphs ten–thirteen), enabling Silas to identify the path of least acoustic resistance before launching the arrowhead. The action is signaled, executed on the page, and causally necessary—without it, the throw would lack precision. It drives one major turn (preparation for the throw) and indirectly shapes the climax by ensuring the trajectory intersects the ancient pulse. Essential but not closure-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight" is introduced early (paragraph ten), its mechanics explained across three paragraphs (banking, diving, mapping resistance), and the method directly enables the throw's success. Silas's expertise in reading avian motion is irreplaceable; swapping in wind or dust would require structural rewrites. Strong setup and development, though the method does not reappear in the closure image itself. High causal pressure and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes" anchor the opening line, constrain Silas's movement (dust burying his ankles), supply the resonant surfaces for acoustic projection, and shape the climactic sensory map. The setting is causally indispensable: the hollow calcium structures produce the tones, the canyon geometry traps the ancient scream, and the exit location is revealed through spatial acoustics. High irreplaceability, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" appears in paragraph two, grounds Silas's entrapment in deep time, and the decades-long scale sharpens the stakes of his breakthrough. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics—Silas could have made this attempt yesterday or tomorrow with the same mechanics. The element charges backstory and thematic weight but does not pressure the present-tense arc. Setup and closure resonance present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is named as Silas's goal in paragraph five, structures all subsequent action (the throw is an attempt to achieve sensory displacement), and is fulfilled at closure when he traverses the labyrinth "in an instant" without taking a step. The motivation is dramatized through concrete choices (handling the arrowhead, reading the crows, launching) and the final walk demonstrates earned success with visible cost (the shattered tool). High causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is established in paragraph four ("etched into the deep, leathered lines of his face") and sustained across all beats: patient crow observation, deliberate coiling before the throw, controlled sensory expansion, and the "slow, creaking stiffness" of the final walk. Tone modulates subtly—tightening during the throw, expanding during acoustic projection—without breaking coherence. The tone charges the final image of earned, aged persistence. Strong consistency and closure linkage.</comment>
