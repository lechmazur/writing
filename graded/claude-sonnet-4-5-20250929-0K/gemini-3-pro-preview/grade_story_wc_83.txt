<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied through his physical interaction with the Geode and his visceral reactions ("tears floated from his eyes," "the exhilaration lingered, a toxic hope"). The wedding survivor backstory anchors his obsession effectively, though the moment when he "saw the timeline branch" leans slightly toward declared interiority rather than fully dramatized perception. His final choice to "trip the system again" demonstrates clear agency with visible cost—he knows he's choosing ruin over acceptance. Internal contradiction is present: he seeks connection with the dead while knowing the vision is "mathematical waste product," creating authentic tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal lens: overload → darkness → opportunity to hunt → perturbation → vision → breakers reset → collapse → decision to repeat. Orientation anchors (Elias, floating observatory, zero-gravity, circuit breaker cooldown) arrive within the first few lines. The closure is a Charged Poise with visible cost: Elias reaches for the override knowing he must "break the world just to see the beautiful ruins," crystallizing his commitment to destructive repetition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the breakers threaten to snap back, forcing his desperate attempt to touch the viewport before reality returns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The zero-gravity environment actively constrains action: tears suspend, he drifts rather than walks, objects float. The viewport and Geode function as tools that shape his method. The cooling breakers create a ticking time pressure that narrows his window. The "suffocating darkness" and "heavy silence" are filtered through his professional hunter's perspective as necessary conditions rather than obstacles. The final image of him gripping the "dull and inert" Geode against the bulkhead charges the object with the cost of his failure, and his hand closing on the override key makes the setting's systems integral to his next destructive choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the "unfiltered awakening" to connect with his lost family—is signaled early and tightens through a single decisive pressure arc. The breakers cooling create genuine time constraint that forces urgency. Agency drives the escalation: he actively taps the Geode, pushes the perturbation deeper "aggressively," and reaches to touch the vision. The cost is unmistakable and lands on the page: when the breakers reset, he loses the connection and collapses, yet the "toxic hope" compels him toward another destructive cycle. The final choice to override again demonstrates that the hunt has foreclosed the path of acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the physics-of-grief premise: the survivor seeks validation in "mathematical waste product," and the story never states this moral directly. The final image—reaching for the override to "break the world just to see the beautiful ruins"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether grief's momentum can be recovered or only repeated. The Geode's shift from active amplifier to "dull and inert" object mirrors his emotional cycle without symbolic overstatement. "Intangibly tangible" and "the embrace of his bride, yet consisted only of cold radiation and math" fuse the scientific and emotional registers into genuine complexity rather than convenient metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and close, filtering all perception through Elias's technical vocabulary ("perturbation theory," "ionosphere," "lattice of chaotic variables") while allowing emotional intensity. Purposeful compression in the scientific explanations supports his obsessive precision without becoming expository. One slip: "a color the human eye was never meant to process" momentarily elevates register beyond his immediate experience, though it recovers quickly. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the vision sequence, and the final paragraph's shift to plain declaratives ("He was alone again") effectively conveys emotional collapse without filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and conflict simultaneously. Rhythm accelerates during the perturbation sequence and slows for the collapse. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "He saw the timeline branch. / In the perturbation patterns, the wedding continued" could compress. The phrase "a man carved out of the negative space left by the sudden erasure" exhibits slight overwriting, and "intangibly tangible" in the required attribute creates a paradox that strains clarity. No major loops or template cadence, and the technical vocabulary remains precise throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard-SF perturbation theory with grief's "physics of the unhappened" feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, anchored by the specific detail of the Geode as chaotic-variable anchor. The survivor-hunting-lost-futures premise transforms the "scientist contacts the dead" trope through Elias's technical methodology and the story's commitment to treating potential energy as literal, recoverable substance. Risk-taking in the bleak cycle ending—he will repeat this destruction—avoids redemptive safety. The wedding-massacre backstory is widely used, but the story transforms it through the specific mechanism of "arrested possibility" pools and mathematical ghosts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias as drone-strike survivor frames expectation in paragraph four and drives all major choices: his method selection, his interpretation of the vision, and his final decision to override again. His trauma directly enables the obsession and constrains his perception of the scientific data. Present in setup, middle hunt sequence, and closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Geode appears in beat one (hand closing around it), beat two (tapping to send perturbation), beat three (amplifying resonance), and closure (dull and inert in his grip, then implied as he reaches for override). Its crystal structure organizing chaos is causally necessary for the vision. Removing it would break the amplification mechanism and the final tactile marker of failure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unfiltered awakening is named and described in paragraph fifteen ("This was the unfiltered awakening he had chased for a decade"), shapes his decade-long obsession, and the story dramatizes one attempt to achieve it. It drives the hunt action but the phrase itself functions more as thematic label than a constraint that alters tactics beat-by-beat. Present in setup (implied by his method), middle (named), and closure (collapsed but still pursued).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" appears once in paragraph sixteen as a descriptor of the sensation during the vision: "a pressure against his chest that felt like the embrace of his bride, yet consisted only of cold radiation and math." It characterizes the experience but does not constrain a subsequent choice or alter his tactics. The paradox enriches the moment but remains descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hunt is signaled in paragraph three ("the only environment where the hunt could truly begin"), drives the perturbation method in the middle beats, structures his engagement with the Geode and viewport, and culminates in paragraph twenty ("He was hunting the moment of divergence"). The final choice to override is framed as continuing the hunt. Removing "hunt" and substituting "search" or "experiment" would require rewriting the predatory urgency and the survivor's active pursuit framing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is introduced in paragraph ten, explained in eleven ("one solves a complex problem by starting with a simple system and adding small disturbances"), and applied in twelve when he taps the Geode to send "a deliberate perturbation—out into the silent ionosphere." The method enables the vision and differentiates his approach from passive observation. Present in setup explanation and middle application; the ending references his "method" without naming perturbation again, but the mechanics shaped the key action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Floating Observatory's zero-gravity allows the drifting and suspended tears, the darkness from tripped safeties creates the necessary silence, and the viewport provides the interface for his reaching gesture. The cooling breakers impose the time limit that pressures his attempt. The observatory's systems are integral to his method and constrain the window of opportunity. Present in setup, active in middle beats, and the override key at closure ties the setting's mechanics to his final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The circuit-breaker cooling window is established in paragraph two, referenced in paragraph twenty-five ("the cooling breakers nearing their reset point, threatening to shatter the connection"), and pays off when "the breakers snapped back" in twenty-eight, collapsing the vision. The time constraint tightens his actions during the perturbation and creates the cost when the clock runs out. Removing this timeframe would eliminate the urgent pressure and the mechanical cause of his failure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "find where unused potential pools" is established in paragraph eight, operationalized through his perturbation method, dramatized in the vision sequence where he sees "the reservoir of energy left behind when a future is violently amputated," and drives his choice to repeat the cycle at closure. The motivation is conflicted: he knows the vision is "mathematical waste product" yet cannot stop. Visible cost appears when the connection collapses and he still reaches for the override.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bleak exhilaration is embodied throughout: "shiver of bleak exhilaration" (paragraph fourteen), "The joy was caustic, burning through him" (twenty-two), "exhilaration lingered, a toxic hope" (thirty-three). The tone modulates from methodical coldness in the setup to frantic intensity during the vision to exhausted determination at closure, always balancing technical precision with emotional charge. The final image—"preparing to break the world just to see the beautiful ruins"—crystallizes the tone's paradox and charges the ending.</comment>
