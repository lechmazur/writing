<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and his interiority is reasonably specific ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned"), but his interior contradictions remain mostly told rather than enacted in scene. The students are undifferentiated—twelve "wary souls" who move in unison without individual friction or micro-choices. The final moment of accidental beauty and Elian's sad dismissal gesture toward earned stasis, but the choice to return to the window reads more as tableau than as a foreclosing decision with visible cost tied to prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers description, reflection, and a single extended beat toward a climactic convergence. Orientation anchors (Velvet Library, autumn, Elian as teacher) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the chord forms, breaks, and Elian returns to the window with "traveled stillness," crystallizing the paradox that harmony is possible yet unsustainable. Cost is felt—he has shown them beauty they cannot sustain—but the on-page action of the final paragraph is minimal, which mutes the charge slightly under accumulative expectations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Velvet Library is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: heavy curtains, amber dusk, plush aisles, velvet linings that "vibrate" during the climax. The zither rosette functions as a micro-object that constrains and charges the final convergence (peering through it to mark the "focal point," then placing it on the podium as echo dies). Autumn leaves and falling motifs subtly mirror the theme of vanishing. The library's acoustic properties and velvet texture serve the method (subtracting noise) and shape the climactic beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: braid diverse voices before resonance fades entirely. One meaningful tightening occurs when the students hum involuntarily after Elian subtracts noise, then the focus breaks. The climax demonstrates the possibility of harmony and its fragility, but Elian's agency in the ending is passive observation rather than a choice that narrows options or incurs a trade-off. The cost—art vanishing, students unable to sustain—is conceptually present but not tied to a protagonist decision that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the paradox of beauty amid erasure, harmony through subtraction) emerges organically from image and event without sermonizing. The zither rosette, the hum, the velvet linings, and the autumn leaves all recur with reweighted meaning. The final image—Elian at the window "waiting for the winter"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: he has demonstrated possibility and accepted its impermanence. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity, though the students' lack of individuation slightly flattens the emotional calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and perceptual signature is distinct: Elian's lens emphasizes dust, distance, acoustic geometry, and "traveled stillness." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("chaotic hum," "vibrating potential," "ghost of the music"). The one line of dialogue—"We create music not by accumulation, but by subtracting noise"—is slightly on-the-nose thematically but fits the didactic moment. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority, then wider observation of the group), and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The heavy curtains… drank the light… casting the room in… amber-hued dusk" fuses setting, tone, and atmosphere). However, template cadence appears in several places: "He looked down… He turned to face… He raised… He used… He urged…" clusters filter verbs and identical stems across the middle third, dulling immediacy (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "braiding" voices, "physics of empathy," "tide" of art—vehicles drift without coherent tenor (−0.3). One paraphrase loop: "suppress… chatter… fear… urge" and "subtracting noise… shuffling feet… nervous coughs… internal monologues" restate the same action across adjacent lines (−0.2). Information density is high elsewhere, and figurative language generally clarifies rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of vanishing-arts premise with the method of "subtracting noise" (rather than adding song) and the use of a soundhole rosette as focal aperture is specific and non-obvious. The "timeframe across unlearning hatred" (post-conflict generation that has forgotten how to feel) offers a fresh inflection on familiar dystopian-arts material. Elian's "expectantly resigned" stance and the ephemeral chord avoid sentimental triumph. Risk-taking in structure (single extended beat, high reflection density) heightens thematic pressure without obscuring clarity. The piece feels purposeful rather than templated, though the core arc (teacher demonstrates fleeting beauty to apathetic students) has familiar contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian (harmonious choir teacher) is present throughout and makes several choices: to instruct listening, to conduct subtraction, to peer through the rosette, to place it on the podium, to dismiss the students. These choices frame and guide the climactic beat. However, his decisions are more facilitating actions than turning points that alter his own stakes or tactics; the students' accidental hum drives the climax, and his final return to the window is observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weaker because Elian's role is primarily to enable rather than to confront a dilemma of his own.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in paragraph 5 (setup), is handled and used in paragraph 14 (Elian raises it to his eye, uses it to "denote the invisible intersection," marks the focal point), trembles sympathetically in paragraph 22, and is placed on the podium in paragraph 28 as the echo dies (payoff). It is irreplaceable: its "intricate geometric gaps" and function as acoustic aperture tie directly to the method (subtracting noise, marking convergence). The rosette charges the climax and closure, meeting all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is signaled early (paragraph 6: "tangible relic of the vanishing arts"; paragraph 8: "timeframe across unlearning hatred"; paragraph 9: "capacity for resonance faded from the human throat entirely") and shapes Elian's motivation and the story's dominant stake. It pressures the middle beat (students have "no melodies left") and reappears at closure (paragraph 29: "The art was vanishing, indeed"). However, the concept functions more as thematic backdrop than as an on-page constraint that alters tactics; Elian's method (subtracting noise) is enabled by the concept but not materially blocked or redirected by it. Setup, development as ambient pressure, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is introduced in paragraph 21 ("his face expectantly resigned") at the climax and recurs implicitly in paragraph 29 ("his expression remained unchanged, marked by the sorrow of a guardian"). The trait colors Elian's final stance—he has achieved the impossible yet accepts its impermanence—but it does not constrain or enable a specific earlier action with visible cost. It arrives late (second half) and functions more as tonal label than as a choice-shaping attribute. Setup is weak (late first signal); closure participation is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Denote" appears explicitly in paragraph 15: Elian "used the carved aperture to denote the invisible intersection of acoustics within the room, marking the precise focal point where their energy must converge." This action sets up the climactic convergence and is causally necessary—the rosette's use as sighting tool enables the subsequent hum. However, "denote" could be replaced with "mark," "indicate," or "identify" with minimal structural change; the specificity of the verb does not itself create the turn. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is indirect (the convergence follows from the marking). Mid-band: causal role in one major beat, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is signaled in paragraph 13 ("We create music not by accumulation, but by subtracting noise"), enacted in paragraphs 16–19 (Elian conducts, urges suppression of chatter/fear/isolation, room grows heavy), and validated at climax (paragraph 19: "By subtracting noise… a pure, underlying tone began to emerge"). The method shapes Elian's tactics throughout the middle and is indispensable to the ending's logic: the hum arises because interference is stripped away. Setup, development (drives multiple beats), and payoff are strong. Causal pressure and closure linkage are high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Velvet Library is anchored in paragraph 1 and its acoustic properties (thick velvet walls, plush aisles, vibrating linings) enable the climax. Autumn is present in paragraphs 2 and 29, framing the timeframe and supplying the falling-leaves motif that mirrors vanishing arts. The library's velvet linings "vibrate" at the climax (paragraph 24), a purposeful interaction. Setup, development (library's acoustics matter for the hum), and payoff (vibration, return to window overlooking autumn) are met. The setting pressures choices (students gathered in this space, Elian uses its acoustics) and charges the final image, though it does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is introduced in paragraph 8 ("timeframe across unlearning hatred, a long and weary era where a generation had ceased fighting only to forget how to feel") and recurs implicitly in the ending (students "stunned by the beauty they had accidentally allowed" but lack "the will to sustain it"). The timeframe supplies context and ambient pressure but does not function as a live clock or tighten decisions on the page. It shapes motivation and stakes thematically but remains background rather than a constraint that alters tactics beat-to-beat. Setup is present; development and payoff are weak because the timeframe is not tracked or tested in scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is explicit in paragraph 9 and drives every beat: Elian instructs listening, conducts subtraction, uses the rosette to mark convergence, and achieves a brief chord. The final paragraph acknowledges he has "shown them that harmony was still possible" yet they lack the will to sustain it—a direct test of the motivation with cost (the art is vanishing despite his effort). Setup, development (all middle actions pursue this goal), and payoff are strong. However, the motivation is more pursued than conflicted; Elian's internal friction (desire vs. resignation) is told more than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is introduced in paragraph 3 ("embodying a traveled stillness that seemed to have absorbed the dust and distance of a thousand roads") and returns in the final sentence ("settling back into his traveled stillness, waiting for the winter to come"). The tone is coherent throughout: contemplative, elegiac, weary yet purposeful. It modulates slightly during the climax (paragraph 24: "transcendent minute," "rich and tragic") then returns to stillness. The tone charges the final image by bookending the piece with the same signature phrase, reweighted by the intervening beauty and its collapse. Setup and payoff are strong; middle modulation is present but subtle.</comment>
