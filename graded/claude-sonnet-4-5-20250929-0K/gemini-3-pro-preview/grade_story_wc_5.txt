<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation—translating heartbeats into maps—is coherent and shapes his ritual choices, but his interior remains descriptive rather than contradictory. The piece never tests his commitment under duress; no alternate option is foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied detail is present (frost accumulating, breath pluming), yet the character reads more as a vessel for atmospheric procedure than a mind in friction. The final pocket-and-depart feels inevitable from the outset, rendering endurance more ornamental than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by paragraph one; drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a single continuous ritual escalating toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the completed map hums with the orchard's pulse). The flash-paper incineration visibly fuses starlight into copper, altering the object's state and charging the final image. Cost is conceptual—the orchard's ephemeral heartbeat is now fixed in metal—but the cost proof test is borderline: no sentence shows what Silas relinquishes or what option this forecloses for him. One tightening deepens stakes; the second-to-last beat lands the transformation, then the seal gesture closes without additional complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The subarctic crater and withered orchard supply vivid, selective detail filtered through alchemical purpose: skeletal geometry, frozen slush, dead root hollow. Setting constrains choice by temperature and materiality (frost accumulates, vial shielded from cold) and charges the final image through the contrast of glowing copper in returned dark. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—knee-deep snow, kneeling workspace, pocketing the plate. The micro-setting of the root hollow functions as workbench, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake—preserve the orchard's pulse before it vanishes—is signaled early and sustained. The synchronization moment when Silas waits for heartbeat alignment provides a single tightening, but no reversal or complication tests his agency; the flash succeeds on first attempt. Agency is present in the spark-strike, yet no live option is foreclosed with visible price. The ritual unfolds as procedure rather than struggle, leaving escalation felt but not dramatized through trade-offs or adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ephemerality captured, residual memory preserved—emerges organically from the alchemical act without thesis statement. The copper plate's transformation from "cold and lifeless" printing tool to humming artifact and the contrast between instant flash and patient preparation resonate beyond plot. The final image of carrying the heartbeat "safely against his chest" offers a non-literal answer to the central question of preservation with emotional weight. Subtext operates in gesture (signet seal as signature, discarded items left behind) and the piece resists moralizing, though the emotional cost remains oblique rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance; diction is elevated and consistent ("skeletal geometry," "flash-paper alchemist," "sympathetic vibration"). Perceptual signature is alchemically filtered—attending to vibration, grooves, adherence—creating a distinct texture. Filter verbs ("believed," "waited for," "tuning his senses") cluster but read voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external description to close interior at the spark moment. No head-hopping; narration remains within Silas's plausible knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density; most sentences advance ritual mechanics or atmosphere. Rhythm varies sentence length and structure without template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "creating patterns with discarded items" echoed in "These refusals of the earth were necessary anchors" within adjacent paragraphs, but the second adds causal function (−0.2). Figurative language is dense ("flash-paper alchemist," "skeletal geometry," "moving stillness") yet coherent and grounded in the alchemical frame. No scaffold sentences, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks that obscure. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—flash-paper alchemy fusing starlight into copper to map a dead orchard's heartbeat—is a specific, non-obvious synthesis combining printmaking, transmutation, and preservation lore. Execution avoids stock fantasy tropes through procedural specificity (nitrocellulose, vacuum-sealed lunar reflection, signet seal). The "translate heartbeats into maps" conceit and the ritual's instant-yet-patient duality offer fresh angles. No close echoes of famous scenes detected. Risk is present in the elevated register and conceptual density, though the one-attempt success and lack of complication keep it from full boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Silas's choices drive setup (clearing workspace, arranging materials), middle ritual execution (pouring starlight, laying paper), and closure (striking spark, sealing plate). His decision to wait for synchronization creates one key turn, and the spark-strike is the climactic agency moment. Present in all three beats with causal pressure, but no visible trade-off or alternative foreclosed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The copper plate appears in paragraph two (setup), is prepared and transformed in paragraphs four–six (two distinct beats: starlight pour, flash fusion), and is sealed and pocketed in the final paragraph (closure). It evolves from "cold and lifeless" to glowing to "hummed with a warm, rhythmic vibration," driving the ritual's success. Irreplaceable: its etched relief holds the starlight and the heartbeat map. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; visible cost is that the orchard's ephemeral pulse is now fixed, though the personal cost to Silas remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Safekept starlight is introduced in paragraph three, used in paragraph four (adheres to grooves, illuminates the plate), and fused into the copper in paragraph five (driven deep by the flash), shaping the map's creation. It is irreplaceable—ordinary ink would not suffice—and its harvesting backstory (solstice moon, glacial lake, vacuum preservation) adds specificity. Present in setup, development, and closure with strong causal pressure. Cost is implicit: a precious, harvested resource is expended irrevocably.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Demonstrates patience physically" is shown in paragraph one: Silas kneels motionless in frost, allowing accumulation on his coat without shudder. This patience contrasts his "velocity and transience" craft, foregrounding the paradox. It enables the later synchronization beat ("waiting for the heartbeat of the orchard to align") but does not constrain a later choice with visible cost. Setup and middle development present; no closure participation. Swappable with another ascetic trait; cost is discomfort, not tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seal action appears in the final paragraph: melting red wax, pressing signet ring. It completes the ritual and closes the artifact, preventing further alteration. This beat depends on prior causality (the map must exist to be sealed) and appears in the closure unit, charging the final gesture. Early setup is absent, but the act is irreplaceable—sealing signifies ownership and finality in alchemical tradition—and it reweights the plate from active tool to finished artifact. Two beats (melt, press) with closure linkage; cost is finality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Creating patterns with discarded items is described in paragraph two: fractured bird bone, frozen berry husk, gray bark in "precise triangulation" around the plate. These anchors hold "sympathetic vibration of the land," shaping the ritual's preparation. The method appears once (setup), does not return in middle beats, and is not mentioned at closure. Functional and specific to alchemical practice, but swappable with other ritual prep gestures. No direct causal pressure on the flash or final map; it primes rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is established in paragraph one and supplies the residual pulse Silas seeks. The environment constrains choice: knee-deep snow and frost pressure embodiment (kneel motionless, shield vial), and the dead root system provides the workspace hollow. The orchard's "dying energy" is the map's content, making setting integral to stakes and closure. Present in setup, shapes middle tactics (workspace, vibration), and charges the final image ("leaving the discarded items and the withered orchard behind"). Strong causal and thematic linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"that precise, fragile moment when the world holds its breath, suspended between twilight and obsidian"—is signaled in paragraph one and again in paragraph four ("the air in the crater grew heavy… It was time"). This window tightens the ritual's timing, implying the alignment is ephemeral. The clock is implicit rather than tracked beat-by-beat, and the flash occurs "instantly," so urgency is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup and middle signal present; closure does not emphasize the timeframe expiring. Cost is conceptual: missing the window would forfeit the map.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to translate heartbeats into maps"—is stated in paragraph three and drives every beat: arranging anchors, pouring starlight, synchronizing, striking spark, sealing. It is "specific and sorrowful," rooted in the belief that the orchard's residual pulse will vanish. Friction is minimal: no competing want or obstacle tests this desire. Setup, development, and closure all serve this single goal with strong causal pressure. Cost is effort and resource expenditure, but no path is foreclosed; Silas achieves exactly what he intends without complication.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone—"moving stillness"—is established in paragraph one ("that precise, fragile moment when the world holds its breath") and sustained through paradoxes: patient immobility before instant flash, "soundless flare," "warm, rhythmic vibration" in "returned dark." It modulates from suspended anticipation to kinetic release to quiet closure, charging the final image of silence with the pocket-carried heartbeat. Coherent across beats and integral to the alchemical frame. No tonal rupture; the oxymoron is purposeful and embodied in the ritual's structure.</comment>
