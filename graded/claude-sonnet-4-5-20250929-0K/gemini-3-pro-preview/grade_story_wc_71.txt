<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand "why some houses feel alive" is dramatized through the orris-root placement and creates a clear through-line. His interiority shows embodied perception ("salt air stinging his eyes," the violet scent "rising from the floorboards") and a perceptual signature (the "creeping normality noticer" who tallies ambient volume). However, the epiphany—"a house feels alive when it holds a contradiction"—arrives as a stated insight rather than emerging from a visible cost or foreclosed path, weakening the earned-change requirement. The drunk fisherman's line provides external catalyst rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and the final understanding feels more contemplative than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece is single-POV, one continuous scene at the bay, with clear spatial anchors (Victorian home, porch, road below). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the placement ritual, and the "shard of hush" crystallization. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final image reweights the house, root, and silence motif, and the felt cost is present in "surrendered to the encroaching gray of dawn." However, the fisherman's shout supplies the key insight rather than protagonist action, and the conceptual cost (recognizing decay as a form of sanctification) remains more cerebral than visceral, preventing entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quiet bay, mossy stones, basalt rocks, weathered porch planks, and violet scent create vivid, purposeful anchors filtered through Elias's perception. The orris root functions as micro-setting: it constrains his ritual choice and charges the final image when "violet scent rising from the floorboards" confirms the sanctification. Spatial choreography is clear (water's edge → Victorian home → porch stairs → top step → road below), and the spring cold sharpens at closure. The sodium bulbs "daydreaming" and the "drift-line accumulated the ocean's rejections" show specificity and perceptual bias, meeting the 9+ test for environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what sparks a house's soul—is signaled early and drives the placement experiment. The orris-root placement is one meaningful tightening: Elias moves from observation to ritual action, and the atmosphere shifts ("window rattle ceased," "foundation paused"). However, the escalation is primarily contemplative; the fisherman's shout provides the key turn rather than Elias's agency, and the cost (leaving the root, accepting the house's decay) is more symbolic than felt. The piece reaches the lower threshold for one meaningful pressure point but lacks the visible price and protagonist-driven escalation for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: the orris root (grown underground, aged in brine, smelling of violets) embodies the contradiction Elias seeks, and the "shard of hush" becomes a charged symbol of stillness as presence rather than absence. The final image—root as sentinel, streetlights surrendering—offers a resonant answer to "why some houses feel alive" without stating a moral. The phrase "hushed blaze" recurs purposefully, and "You can't bury what's already grown" reweights prior material. However, the thematic articulation ("a house feels alive when it holds a contradiction") borders on explicit statement, and the conceptual repricing, while legible, feels more intellectual than emotionally urgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyric texture: "cursed to be a creeping normality noticer," "hushed blaze," "timber and stone." Perceptual signature is strong (Elias notices "decibel by unperceived decibel," "cold violets and ancient earth"), and psychic distance remains stable. The fisherman's slurred warning contrasts with Elias's elevated register, though brief. However, some diction edges toward overwriting without clear payoff: "hollow masonry cadavers," "sanctify the rotting threshold" feel elevated for the sake of texture rather than voice-motivated necessity. Free indirect style is clean, and the final sentence's rhythm ("their daydream ending as the world's true heaviness returned") modulates aptly with closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high, and most sentences advance atmosphere or concept. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "He needed to know what sparked the soul of a structure" restates the prior sentence's idea, and "The house seemed to react" followed by listing reactions (window rattle, groans) could compress. "Hushed blaze" appears three times, with the third use ("peaked, burning in his ears") adding intensity but risking decorative recurrence. The phrase "a fire burning without crackle or smoke that consumed the noise of living things" stacks metaphor without clear propulsion. Figurative density in the opening and middle paragraphs ("creeping normality noticer," "daydreaming streetlights," "calcified knot of scent") is high but remains legible; applying the overwriting check, density is elevated but does not obscure causality, warranting −0.5 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of orris root (perfumer's ingredient, driftwood simulacrum, symbol of hidden growth) with the house-waking premise is specific and non-obvious. The "shard of hush" as a jagged fragment of stillness rather than mere silence offers a fresh inflection. However, the core premise—man performing ritual to wake dormant spaces—echoes familiar liminal-magic templates, and the transformation depends on contemplation rather than high-stakes choice. The drunk fisherman's inadvertently profound line feels convenient, and the final epiphany ("a house feels alive when it holds a contradiction") resolves into abstraction. Specificity of the orris root and bay setting prevents lower bands, but the piece does not take bold structural risks or force a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias as "creeping normality noticer" is present throughout and frames his motivation. He makes one key choice: placing the orris root on the porch. However, his noticing is largely passive observation until that single act, and the final understanding comes from the fisherman's words rather than a second decision. The trait enables the setup and middle but does not constrain a later choice with cost. Present in closure (he "finally understood") but not causally active there. Early signal +0.5, one beat (placement) +0.4, closure presence (understanding) +0.4, but observation-heavy and swappable with "sensitive observer" −0.6, late first decisive action (past 40%) −0.3. Total neighborhood ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orris root is found at the drift-line, pressed to his nose (scent detail), placed on the porch (sanctification beat), and its violet scent "rising from the floorboards" confirms the house's response at closure. Three distinct beats (discovery, placement, closure confirmation), and its specific properties (perfumer's ingredient, cured in brine, smells of violets) are irreplaceable. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables the ritual) +1.0, closure linkage (scent confirms sanctification) +1.2, specificity +0.6. Total ~7.6, capped slightly below 8.5 because the root's role in the climax is sensory confirmation rather than a visible trade-off or cost the protagonist pays.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is named and described vividly in one paragraph: "a jagged fragment of stillness that pierced the mundane reality of the street." It shapes Elias's understanding and charges the thematic question, but it does not alter his tactics or force a choice; it is the result of the root's placement, not a constraint he works with. Present in middle (conceptual crystallization) and echoed at closure ("left the shard of hush on the porch"), but primarily thematic rather than operational. Setup (implicit early) +0.3, middle conceptual beat +0.4, closure reprise +0.4, but ornamental and swappable with "moment of silence" −0.7. Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drunk fisherman delivers an "inadvertently profound" line that supplies Elias's key insight. The attribute is present and functional (turns the plot conceptually), but it is applied to a secondary character who appears for one beat, and the profundity is told rather than dramatized through cost or trade-off. The attribute enables closure but does not constrain Elias's action. Late first appearance (final third) −0.8, one beat +0.4, closure linkage (provides insight) +0.9, but label-only (told "inadvertently profound") −0.5, secondary character without cost −0.4. Total ~5.1, capped at mid-band because the trait is ascribed rather than embodied with price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is named explicitly ("With the solemnity of a priest at an altar, he prepared to sanctify the rotting threshold") and executed through the root placement. The action drives the middle beat and is confirmed at closure ("He had managed to sanctify the space, blessing it with the recognition of its own decay"). Two beats (preparation and confirmation), and the word's religious connotation charges the ritual. Early framing +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (the act triggers the house's response) +1.1, closure linkage +1.0, but the action itself is brief and contemplative rather than high-cost, and "sanctify" as a verb could swap with "bless" or "consecrate" without major loss −0.5. Total ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method—"through displaced objects"—is signaled early ("His method for waking these buildings was unconventional, operating through displaced objects that forced a disruption in the scenery") and executed with the orris root. The mechanics are clear: introducing something foreign interrupts entropy. Two beats (explanation and placement), and the method is irreplaceable to the premise. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (the method enables the experiment) +1.2, specificity +0.5, but the method is told in exposition rather than discovered through failed attempts, and it does not face resistance or cost −0.6. Total ~7.2, mid-high band because the method is both setup and payoff but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is established in the opening line and provides the orris root (ocean debris), the Victorian home, and the sensory details (salt air, mossy stones, cold). The setting supplies the key resource (root) and frames the atmosphere. Early signal +0.7, supplies resource (root) +0.6, closure (spring air grows colder) +0.5, sensory detail +0.4, but "quiet bay in spring" as a phrase is generic and swappable with "calm shore" without loss −0.5, and the spring season itself does not pressure choices −0.3. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" is vivid ("amber sodium bulbs hummed with a distraction that suggested the streetlights were daydreaming") and returns at closure ("the streetlights flickered once, then surrendered to the encroaching gray of dawn, their daydream ending"). The timeframe is atmospheric but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; night provides cover but is not a clock. Early signal +0.6, closure reprise +0.7, lyric quality +0.3, but time is static (no countdown or deadline) and swappable with "at night" −0.7, ornamental rather than pressure-building −0.5. Total ~3.8, capped because time is present but not operational.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to understand why some houses feel alive"—is stated early, drives his nightly pilgrimage and the root-placement experiment, and is answered at closure ("Elias finally understood that a house feels alive when it holds a contradiction"). Three beats (setup, experiment, resolution), and the desire is specific and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (drives the experiment) +1.2, closure linkage (answered) +1.1, but the motivation is contemplative rather than urgent, and the answer comes from the fisherman's prompt rather than Elias's friction between wants and costs −0.9. Total ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is named in the opening ("This slow suffocation of sound felt like a hushed blaze, a fire burning without crackle or smoke"), recurs at the climax ("The hushed blaze of the moment peaked, burning in his ears"), and shapes the final image (silence as presence, streetlights surrendering). The tone is coherent, paradoxical (quiet intensity), and modulates with pressure. Early signal +0.7, two beats (setup and climax) +0.9, closure charge (final image embodies the tone) +1.2, specificity (oxymoron creates distinct texture) +0.6, but the phrase risks decorative recurrence and the tone does not shift dynamically across turns −0.4. Total ~7.1.</comment>
