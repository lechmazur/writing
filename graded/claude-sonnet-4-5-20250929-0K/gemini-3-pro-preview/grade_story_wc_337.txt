<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is concrete and embodied—his guilt over stealing the net from a protected grave anchors his interiority with visible cost. The micro-choices (needle insertions, threading silence into the crack) are purposeful and reflect professional competence balanced by trembling hands. The brother-spirit revelation lands without diagnosis but could benefit from more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the climax; the guilt-as-adhesive metaphor veers close to summary. The final touch to the mask's cheek earns the renunciation, but internal contradiction remains slightly under-developed during peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, what) arrive cleanly within the first 100 words. The story accumulates pressure through each knot unraveled, building density and reweighting the mask's silence with conceptual cost. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elian seals the mask but his own unrest remains, forecloses peace, and the final image ("prisoner in a cage of light and quiet") charges prior material with undeniable cost. Causality is clean; no retroactive patches. One tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is established early and constrains action—the glass walls dissect starlight, creating the optical cage that reflects Elian's entrapment. The tapestry needle, hemp net, and mask function as micro-setting anchors; the net's brine and age are handled tactilely across beats. Sensory hierarchy (starlight, silence weight, heart-as-war-drum) modulates with urgency. The final image of "cold, unmoving light of distant suns" directly charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding the brother-spirit to prevent escape) is signaled early and tightens through each knot unraveled. Agency is consistent: Elian's choice to steal the net and dissect it drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. The mask's scream choked by exhumed silence is a clear reversal that narrows options. Cost is legible on the page—the mask is sealed but "his own unrest would never settle," forecloses peace with felt price. No coincidental resolution; the final stasis is earned by prior accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete work of unraveling knots and the metaphor of accumulated silence as both restorative material and entombment. The brother-spirit reveal reweights guilt and restoration without moralizing. The final image—"silence so profound it felt violent"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: peace is burial, not healing. Subtext operates in the gesture of touching the mask's cheek and the implicit trade (dead brother sleeps, living brother guards). No thematic echo or prompt-like articulation mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—professional focus on tools and materials, colored by grief. Diction ("fractured porcelain," "psychic shriek," "interlaced hush") is elevated but voice-motivated and character-particular for a restorer of haunted artifacts. Compression at peak beats ("The mask shuddered") maintains rhythm without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs are minimal. No dialogue; not required. Distance control is tight; the narrative certainty matches what Elian plausibly knows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance action, atmosphere, or interiority. Minor overwriting in the opening ("cold needles of luminescence," "fractured porcelain of a Nö-mask") borders on algorithmic density without pattern-teaching, though it does not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("thick, invisible syrup," "pale fish darting") is coherent but slightly stacked in mid-beats. Proofreading is clean; grammar and tense are consistent. The final line recharges the cage motif effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—unraveling silence from a net to seal a ghost—is specific and non-obvious. The brother-spirit twist earns hindsight inevitability through the theft-guilt throughline. Sensory particulars (brine, whale-bone needle, starlight dissection) anchor universals without becoming ornamental. The emotional calculus (entombing the brother to protect the world) resists tidy resolution. Risk is present in the metaphysical logic and the quiet, renunciatory ending. Slight proximity to "silence as weight" tropes, but the fisherman's-net mechanism and restoration-trade specificity transform the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's choices (selecting the needle, unraveling each knot, threading silence into the crack) create every key turn. His professional focus and guilt drive escalation. His final touch to the mask's cheek closes the arc. Removing him dismantles the entire causal chain and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tapestry needle is signaled early, used in at least three beats (inserting into knot, twisting, flashing like a fish, final twist, slipping from fingers), and its whale-bone materiality adds specificity. Its use enables the unraveling action and shapes tactics under stress. Removing it would require a substitute tool and weaken the craft-specific resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" governs the entire plot mechanism—Elian exhumes silence to fill the mask's cracks. It shapes stakes (the mask screams; silence chokes it) and tactics (each knot releases pressurized quiet). The concept reweights at closure: the silence is "so profound it felt violent," transforming peace into burial. Swapping it for generic "magic material" collapses the story's metaphysical logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The net's attribute ("accumulates silence") is established early and constrains every action—each knot unraveled releases a century of quiet. This trait enables the sealing tactic and imposes the central cost: the silence entombs rather than heals. The attribute is irreplaceable; without it, the net becomes an ordinary object and the closure loses its conceptual charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Exhume" is the spine verb of the story. Elian exhumes silence from the net across every beat; the word choice connotes grave-robbing and links to his theft confession. The action redefines the restoration from mending to extraction and burial. Every major turn (knot unraveling, silence expanding, mask sealing) traces to this verb. Replacing it with "extract" or "release" weakens the thematic grave/guilt resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The method (unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net) is signaled in paragraph two, mechanics matter across four beats (inserting needle, prying fibers, twisting, final unspooling), and the net's age/brine history adds irreplaceable specificity. The method shapes all attempts and the final threading. Without this exact mechanism, the silence-accumulation logic collapses and the ocean/drowning/brother thematic layer disappears.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is established in the opening line and its glass walls supply a visual-conceptual cage motif that returns in the final image ("prisoner in a cage of light and quiet"). The starlight dissection creates atmosphere and charges the ending. The setting does not constrain a middle choice as strongly as other elements but does frame the work spatially and thematically. Removing it weakens the optical/refraction metaphor and the entrapment resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" is present as a narrative frame ("The narrative of this night unfolds across sharing a secret") and the confession (theft from a protected grave) is revealed mid-story. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; it functions more as a tonal overlay than a mechanical pressure. The secret matters thematically but the "across" duration remains vague and does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to ground restless spirits") is dramatized early and drives every choice—needle insertion, knot dissection, silence threading. The friction between duty and guilt (the spirit is his brother) creates visible cost. The motivation persists to closure where grounding succeeds but leaves Elian's own unrest unresolved. Removing this exact motivation collapses the stakes and the brother reveal loses its weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is coherent from the opening ("high and thin, a psychic shriek") through escalation ("trembling of his hands," "war drum in a valley") and modulates at closure into "terrifyingly empty" placidity over "profound" silence that "felt violent." The tone charges the final image and supports the thematic inversion of peace into entombment. The diction and rhythm maintain controlled clarity under pressure without flattening into static dread.</comment>
