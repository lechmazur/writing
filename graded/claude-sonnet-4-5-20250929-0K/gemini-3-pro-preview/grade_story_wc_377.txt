<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory or embodied. The seasonal muteness functions as a label rather than creating genuine on-page struggle—it forecloses voice but doesn't generate visible micro-choices under pressure. The final hand-on-brass moment gestures toward embodied emotion, yet the piece tells us she "imagined" the impact rather than showing internal conflict or cost in her stance. No secondary character pressure tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara completes her act, the sound cascades, and the final image crystallizes her defiant stance against consensus society. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered description of the sculpture's mechanics and the iceberg's thermodynamic trigger, culminating in a cadence shift at "engineered a shout." Cost is conceptual (the ephemeral nature of the act, the iceberg's sacrifice) but felt on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly (bluff, dawn, Elara's trade) within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs as the ice melts and the sculpture activates, reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment all constrain Elara's tactics and charge the final image—she must work at dawn, at altitude, with finite ancient ice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "prismatic intensity," "breath pluming," "resonance travel through her bones." Spatial choreography remains coherent across the sculpture's mechanics. The micro-setting (body, tool, ice) drives the closure beat when her hand touches the vibrating frame, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a telepathic monoculture—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the iceberg begins to melt and upsets the sculpture's equilibrium, forcing the sound into existence. Agency reads as preparation and execution rather than a choice under competing pressure; no on-page reversal narrows her options. The cost is visible (the ice sacrifices itself, the song is brief) but the escalation is more thermodynamic inevitability than protagonist-driven deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—reality as "loud, messy, beautiful collision" versus telepathic consensus—emerges through action and image rather than assertion. The iceberg as archive, sound as "mathematical inevitability," and the final "engineered shout" offer a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between her seasonal muteness and the auditory revelation. The closing image reweights prior material (silence, consensus, vibration) with conceptual cost: the act is fleeting, the impact endures only as disruption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalizer remains stable; psychic distance appropriate. Diction is elevated and consistent ("thermodynamics of the sunrise," "elemental power") but occasionally drifts into semi-academic register ("mathematical inevitability," "seamless flow of shared thought") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature—tuner of resonance, custodian—colors her attention to vibration and sound physics, yet the voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm under peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose texture is controlled but lacks sharp individuation in syntax or micro-cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in the opening exposition: "In the centuries… after words… the world settled… High above… Elara prepared…" echoes an outline structure. Paraphrase loop: "The sound was not a melody… but a roar… These were the symphonies of truth, notes that did not lie…" restates the same claim across adjacent lines. Register drift into academic phrasing ("thermodynamics," "mathematical inevitability") clashes with the embodied stakes. Figurative language is dense ("jagged and unpredictable," "indigo and crimson," "loud, messy, beautiful collision") but mostly coherent. Applying −0.8 for template cadence and paraphrase issues; no closure-beat artifact observed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of kinetic sculpture, seasonal muteness, and post-verbal society offers a fresh angle on sensory deprivation themes. The iceberg as catalyst—ancient, compressed, self-sacrificing—feels specific and purposeful. The "symphonies of truth" concept and the final "engineered shout" image avoid cliché. However, the post-telepathy monoculture and the lone artist resisting consensus echo familiar SF templates without deep transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking is present (the elemental physicality, the mute protagonist) but does not fundamentally subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup (opening paragraph), drives the middle action (hoisting ice, watching the sculpture activate), and is present at closure (hand on brass, imagining impact). Her choices—tightening cables, placing the ice, stepping back—enable the sound but read as execution of a pre-formed plan rather than decisions that create key turns. No on-page reversal or fork where her agency narrows options. Setup +0.5, development +0.4 (one beat), closure +0.7 (present, observing), causal pressure +0.3 (moderate), specificity +0.3 (tuner role colors perception). Swappability −0.5 (another artist could execute the plan). Total anchors near functional necessity without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment appears in setup (withdrawn from chest), development (hoisted into cradle, begins to melt, upsets equilibrium), and closure (sacrifices itself, "last drop of ancient water"). Three distinct beats. The object's thermodynamic properties and ancient provenance drive the sculpture's activation and constrain the song's brevity—removing it breaks the mechanism. Setup +0.6, beat involvement +1.4 (three beats), causal pressure +1.2 (enables and limits), closure linkage +1.3 (final sentence), specificity +0.6 (compressed archive, polar origin), cost +0.5 (ephemeral sacrifice). No major frictions. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept appears thematically throughout: "audible art," "notes that did not lie," "mathematical inevitability of ice turning to water," "symphonies of truth." It frames the stakes (truth versus consensus manipulation) and colors Elara's motivation, but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page—she does not choose *how* to embody truth under competing options. Setup +0.5 (implicit in premise), closure linkage +0.9 (final paragraph asserts the idea), cost connection +0.4 (conceptual). Ornamental −0.6 (mostly thematic claim), swappability −0.5 (another high-minded concept could substitute). Lyric resonance present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is introduced early ("depths of the winter solstice") and reappears at closure ("Because she was seasonally mute, Elara could not add her own voice"). It motivates her reliance on kinetic sculpture and is labeled as "not a hindrance but a focusing lens," yet no on-page moment shows it enabling or constraining a choice with visible cost—she would build the sculpture identically if vocal. Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.4, specificity +0.3 (genetic quirk). Label-only −0.7, swappability −0.6 (deafness or another sensory limit could serve the same thematic function). Cap 4.6 for minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears twice: when the sun strikes the ice ("began to glisten with a blinding, prismatic intensity") and implicitly as "visual brilliance" precedes the auditory climax. The action triggers the thermodynamic cascade and signals the sculpture's activation. Setup +0.5, development +0.6 (one causal beat: sunlight → melt → sound), closure linkage +1.0 (the dawn is the engine), causal pressure +0.9 (enables the turn), specificity +0.5 (prismatic refraction). Swappability −0.4 (another solar effect could trigger melting). Strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is signaled in setup (paragraph 2: "towering skeleton of hollow brass tubes"), developed in the middle (Elara tightens cables, hoists ice, the sculpture's mechanics drive sound), and active at closure (spins faster, vibrating frame). Three beats. The method defines how sound is produced and constrains the tactics (altitude, dawn, counterweights). Setup +0.7, beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.3 (the sculpture's mechanics are the story's engine), closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7 (tuned plates, fulcrum, wind-catchers). No major frictions. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Whispering bluff above the clouds frames the entire scene, constrains Elara's environment (high altitude, biting wind, clouds below), and enables the sound to "bombard the silent cities in the valley." Setup +0.7, development +0.5 (wind affects her conserving warmth, altitude matters for sound propagation), closure linkage +0.8 (sound dives off the bluff), causal pressure +0.6 (position above the cities is necessary), specificity +0.4 (bluff's edge, jagged). Swappability −0.5 (another elevated platform could serve). Strong but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" anchors the premise (telepathic consensus society) and motivates Elara's defiance, but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no countdown, no immediate consequence of timing. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure. Setup +0.6 (opening sentence), thematic presence throughout, closure linkage +0.4 (the disruption of telepathy is felt). Ornamental −0.6 (does not alter on-page moves), swappability −0.5 (another post-historical setting could work). Lyric reprise lifts slightly but insufficient causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation appears in setup (implied by her trade and the sculpture's purpose), is declared mid-story ("to preserve the color of wonder"), and reappears at closure ("reminded the world that reality was not just a quiet agreement"). It frames her goal but is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between cost and desire. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, cost connection +0.4 (conceptual—ephemeral impact). Told-only −0.7, swappability −0.4 (another idealistic motive could substitute). No on-page micro-choice where the desire competes with another want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates appropriately: "muted vigor" in her precise, forceful actions; compression under altitude and cold; the final acceleration as the sculpture spins. Diction choices ("jagged," "roar," "chaotic rhythm") support the vigor; restraint in voice and observation supports the muted quality. The tone charges the final image of hand on brass and imagined colors. Setup +0.6 (established early in her movements), development +0.5 (maintained through action), closure +1.0 (crystallized in the ending beat), coherence +0.8. Single static mood −0.3 (the tone is consistent but does not shift dramatically under peak pressure). Strong modulation lifts the score.</comment>
