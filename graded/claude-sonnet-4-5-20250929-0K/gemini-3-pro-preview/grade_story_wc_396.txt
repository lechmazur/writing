<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation ("map empathy onto action") is declared but remains abstract; the internal conflict is told rather than felt in embodied terms. The protagonist's decisive action—reconstituting the memory—proceeds without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. The shadows on his skin function as thematic decoration rather than a visible cost tied to micro-choices. Interiority leans toward elevated summary ("calmly intuitive," "metaphysical alignment") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with symbolic/lyric architecture: the lighthouse repository, the vintage mirrors, and the crystal fragment build a pattern that culminates in projection. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (orchard, cliff, council), though the metaphysical detour inside the lighthouse introduces mild spatial ambiguity. Closure lands on the page—council sees the projected mercy, ice stops grinding—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or price paid by Kaelen himself. The final paragraph's "for the first time in an age" claim exceeds POV scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes are vivid in the opening, but once Kaelen retreats into the metaphysical lighthouse interior the spatial grounding becomes abstract (dusty antique shop, curved walls, baroque frames). The crystal fragment and cheval mirror are handled across multiple beats and charge the closure image, qualifying as micro-setting that drives the reconstitution action. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but leans decorative rather than constraining choice at peak moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the prisoner via council persuasion—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The reconstitution sequence inside the lighthouse accumulates texture and mystery, but escalation remains flat: Kaelen searches, finds, aligns, and succeeds without a meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. The council's shift at the end is reported ("washing away their grim resolve") rather than dramatized in resistant action or dialogue. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening is sufficient, but the final projection solves the declared problem without visible trade-off or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-as-proof-of-strength emerges through the soldier-lowering-rifle anomaly and Kaelen's determination to preserve it. The crystal fragment and mirror sequence function as purposeful metaphor for reconstituting lost truth. However, the final beat edges toward overt statement: "to serve as proof that peace was not a weakness" tells rather than images the earned wisdom. The thematic question is legible and the closure reconfigures material, but lacks the non-literal indirection that would elevate it into high resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains third-limited throughout with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("tectonic complaints," "weighted breath before reply") but at times drifts into abstract register that exceeds POV justification ("metaphysical structure," "integrate"). The final paragraph's certainty about the ice stopping "for the first time in an age" exceeds what Kaelen can know. No dialogue appears on the page; the single spoken line at the end ("There is another way") is functional but not tested for subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. A few figurative phrases veer into density without clear payoff: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "crushing expanse," "weighted breath before reply" cluster in the opening without constraining later action. The reconstitution sequence ("stitching the reflection and the object together with the force of his will") abstracts the peak beat rather than grounding it in sensory particulars. Minor template phrasing: "It was a…" constructions recur. No loops or major scaffolding; information density is adequate but leans expository in the lighthouse search.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-repository-of-timelines conceit and the crystal-fragment reconstitution offer a specific symbolic architecture, but the core premise (protagonist retrieves alternate-history proof to sway tribunal) follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "courageous anomaly" labels read as ornamental rather than lived specifics. The emotional arc—calm search, successful retrieval, council persuasion—proceeds without surprising inflection or earned moral calculus that would distinguish it from adjacent fantasy-tribunal plots. The final image (projected mercy, stopping ice) gestures at resonance but the hinge feels convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and makes the central decision to search, retrieve, and present the crystal. However, the role functions more as conduit than as a character whose peacekeeper identity constrains or complicates the action. The shadows on his skin are mentioned but do not force a tactical choice or visible cost. Two beats: the opening council stance and the final presentation; both involve Kaelen but neither tests his peacekeeper contradiction in embodied terms.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal fragment is handled across three beats: hidden in cloak, held up to the mirror during reconstitution, and placed on the table to project the scene. Its jagged edge ("sharp enough to draw blood") is noted but not used to impose cost. The fragment shapes the central action (reconstitution) and charges the closure image, making it essential to the arc. Early signal in paragraph two and causal work across the lighthouse search and final projection elevate the score; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "courageous anomaly" is defined on the page as "a deviation in the causal chain, a moment where a single soldier had lowered a rifle instead of firing." It functions as the content Kaelen seeks and finds, shaping the middle search beat and the ending projection. However, the concept itself does not constrain Kaelen's choices or impose a visible cost; it serves as plot object rather than a stake that alters tactics. Present in setup (implied in the opening motivation), middle (mirror search), and payoff (projection), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is declared twice ("Kaelen was calmly intuitive") but functions as label rather than dramatized trait. The lighthouse search proceeds methodically without a moment where intuition enables a risky leap or calm restraint prevents a costly mistake. The trait is ornamental, mentioned to satisfy the prompt but not woven into the action with visible trade-off or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" anchors the central action: Kaelen works to reconstitute the whole from the part, aligning crystal and mirror to lock the soldier's mercy into solid form. The verb appears in both the opening goal statement and the climactic lighthouse beat, driving the middle sequence and enabling the final projection. Swappability is low—"restore" or "retrieve" would not capture the fragment-to-whole mechanic. However, the reconstitution itself proceeds without resistance or cost, limiting causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are signaled early in the lighthouse interior ("seeking the necessary timeline via glimpses in vintage store mirrors") and supply the method for the reconstitution: Kaelen uses the cheval mirror to reflect the anomaly and refract it into the crystal. The mirrors shape the middle search beat and enable the climactic alignment. Late first appearance (second third of the story) and the method's mechanics are told rather than tested under resistance, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes frame the opening and closing, supplying vivid atmosphere. The orchard itself does not constrain Kaelen's action; the metaphysical lighthouse interior (repository of histories) provides the search space but functions more as symbolic backdrop than as a resource or obstacle that alters tactics. The ice floes return in the final line ("seemed to stop its grinding"), charging the closure image with lyric weight. Present in setup and payoff, but middle pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the weighted breath before reply" is declared in the opening and closed in paragraph six ("The weighted breath before reply ended"). The pause creates a structural pocket for the lighthouse detour but does not impose live urgency or narrow Kaelen's choices; time dilates into "a private eternity" without cost. The frame is present and symmetrical but does not tighten decisions or escalate pressure in a way that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation "to map empathy onto action" is stated early and pursued throughout: he seeks to make mercy tangible via the crystal projection. The motivation shapes the goal and the final beat, but it is told in abstract terms rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The ending fulfills the declared desire without visible friction between cost and want. Present in setup, implied in middle search, and realized in payoff, but lacks on-page struggle that would elevate causal weight.</comment>
