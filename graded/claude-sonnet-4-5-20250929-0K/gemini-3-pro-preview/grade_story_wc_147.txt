<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied: "lungs burned with the stale, recycled air," "black edges of hypoxia began to creep." The choice to stay and complete transmission is well-motivated by her role and values, and the final renunciation—accepting death to preserve the message—is earned through prior pressure. Internal conflict between survival instinct and mission is dramatized through physical struggle ("Every biological impulse screamed at her to abandon") rather than merely told. Minor: the psychic artifact's effects could be more specifically grounded in her personal experience rather than generic flashes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/sacrifice)—Elara's refusal to abandon the task forecloses survival with visible cost: "closed her eyes, content to become part of the signal." Orientation is immediate (who, where, stakes). The transmission success → acceptance of death linkage is clean. Cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs through oxygen depletion forcing the peak choice. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting constrains every choice: water density slows movement, oxygen scarcity creates urgency, coral-choked machinery forces manual labor. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "bioluminescent algae painted...in strokes of teal and violet," "low frequency vibration that resonated through the water." The altar functions as both setting and tool, its mechanical state directly shaping the climactic action. The final image of "lonesome splendor" charges closure by making the tomb welcoming. Strong micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the psychic archive) is signaled immediately and sustained. Oxygen depletion creates escalating pressure that narrows options beat by beat. The coral-choked interface forces a meaningful tightening: she must work slowly despite the clock, a trade-off with visible cost. Elara's agency drives resolution—her refusal to inflate the vest and her manual unsnarling of cables. The final act (pouring the vial) is protagonist-driven. Cost is unmistakable: hypoxia → unconsciousness → death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: what is worth dying for, the weight of history against individual survival. The crystal vial and transmission beam function as charged images that embody the question without stating it. "This history was more important than her heartbeat" avoids platitude by being earned through prior physical struggle. The ending offers resonant closure—becoming "part of the signal, drifting endlessly in the dark"—that reweights the opening's "eternal twilight" without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermon; the tomb's transformation from threatening to "welcoming" carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization. Narrative voice remains consistent: formal register suits the temple's grandeur and Elara's technical role. Perceptual signature is clear—she notices mission-critical details (cables, oxygen readout) and filters the sublime through tactical awareness. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the end as hypoxia blurs perception. Minor issue: "steel-willed discipline" and "cold...precision" edge toward stock phrasing in a peak beat, though they remain functional. Diction stays within her lexicon throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: long, layered sentences open and close the piece, while short urgent beats ("Her lungs burned") drive the middle. Information density is high; most lines advance pressure or setting. Minor loop: "forcing her trembling fingers to move with slow, deliberate precision despite the fear clawing at her throat" restates the override concept already established. "Sealing the forgotten underwater temple in a tomb of eternal twilight" front-loads weight but remains clear. Figurative language occasionally clusters ("crushing weight," "heavy velvet curtain") without obscuring causality. Zero critical artifacts at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination—psychic archive technology in a flooded temple, protagonist choosing historical preservation over escape—feels specific and non-obvious. The crystal vial as data-storage medium avoids generic "ancient artifact" tropes through concrete function (intake chamber, coherent beam). Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the underwater pressure and the particular texture of bioluminescent decay. Minor: the self-sacrifice ending, while earned, follows a recognizable template; the piece elevates through specificity rather than structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara as distress-signal sender drives every beat: her retrieval of the vial, manual repair of the altar, and final choice to complete transmission despite oxygen failure. Her decisions create the key turn (staying vs. fleeing) and enable closure. The irony—she sends not a plea for rescue but a historical testament—is signaled early and charges the ending. Role is causal, not observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in beat one (retrieved from priest's quarters), activates psychic interference in beat two ("touches memories which were not her own"), and is poured into the altar in the climactic beat, enabling transmission. Its fragility contrasts with engineered function. The vial's dual nature (ornamental yet functional) and psychic payload are irreplaceable; no generic data device would carry the same weight. Removal would break closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is introduced as the altar hums to life: "The chaotic noise of the ocean currents faded abruptly, replaced by a gathered hush that fell over the sanctuary." It constrains the moment—silence creates "sacred anticipation" and amplifies the transmission's significance. The concept shapes the ending's tone and reweights the ocean's threat. Not merely thematic; the hush changes the sensory field at closure. Strong but not indispensable—story logic would survive without the specific phrase.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is introduced early and dramatized: psychic flashes ("golden sunlight, the taste of ceremonial wine, and the terror of rising tides") threaten to "overwhelm her focus." This creates an on-page obstacle she must resist, adding cost to handling the vial. The attribute returns implicitly at closure when she becomes "part of the signal," suggesting merger with those memories. Constrains action and charges the ending with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is the pivotal action: "manually unsnarl the delicate transmission cables from the organic debris without severing the brittle connections." The entire middle escalation hinges on this task—slow precision against hypoxia. The final wire freed triggers closure: "she freed the final copper wire...and slotted the connector into its port." Swapping for another verb (e.g., "clear," "repair") would lose the specific tactile and temporal constraint. Removal breaks the causal chain to transmission success.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled and dramatized: "She fought the panic by overriding instinct with cold, steel-willed discipline, forcing her trembling fingers to move with slow, deliberate precision." The method is shown in action (staying vs. fleeing, manual cable work vs. abort) and shapes multiple attempts. It appears again implicitly at closure when she accepts death rather than inflate the vest. The mechanics—rational control vs. biological panic—matter throughout and enable the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple provides the premise, constrains all movement (water density, depth pressure, oxygen limits), supplies the broadcast hub that enables the mission, and houses the psychic vial. The coral-choked altar creates the climactic obstacle. The setting's "lonesome splendor" transforms at closure from threat to welcome. Every beat depends on temple-specific conditions (depth, decay, bioluminescence). No other setting could support this exact story logic or ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is tracked concretely: "sharp, rhythmic beep from her wrist computer...oxygen reserves were critical," "lungs burned with the stale, recycled air," "black edges of hypoxia began to creep," "carbon dioxide levels in her helmet peaked." The live clock tightens every tactic—she must work slowly on cables despite urgency—and forces the final trade-off. Time pressure is causal, not atmospheric. The ending depends on the clock running out.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" (psychic residue) is dramatized through the vial's function and Elara's mission. The motivation is clear—preserve what would otherwise be lost—and tested when survival conflicts with completion. The artifact's psychic payload (ephemeral memories) is central to the transmission. Minor: the motivation could face more internal friction; Elara's commitment is solid from the start, so the desire's friction is more external (oxygen) than conflicted. Still, the ending's conceptual repricing (she becomes ephemeral, part of the signal) charges the motivation retroactively.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is established in the opening ("bioluminescent algae painted the decaying stonework...illuminating a scene of lonesome splendor") and recurs with variation: "abyss itself was holding its breath," "beauty of the room...felt suddenly welcoming, a glorious tomb." Tone modulates under pressure—formal reverence → clinical urgency → elegiac acceptance—and charges the final image where the tomb becomes desirable. The tone is integral to closure's emotional weight and thematic resonance.</comment>
