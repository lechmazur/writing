<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and well-embodied through physical sensation ("screaming tenderness...felt like a physical wound"). Internal conflict between his silent method and the head keeper's doctrine is dramatized rather than told. The passage "his chest heaving, satisfied that the quietest force had screamed the loudest" effectively shows the cost of his effort. Minor slip: the head keeper remains entirely passive, reducing potential relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elias's physical exhaustion ("his whole body shaking," "chest heaving") after projecting his will demonstrates the price paid. The causal lens holds throughout—storm breaks foghorn, Elias chooses silent method, ship responds—with clean because/therefore linkage. Orientation is swift (lighthouse, post-storm, two keepers). One meaningful tightening occurs when the ship drifts toward the Teeth and Elias must act immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt tiles and "deep, bruised cobalt" light create a charged atmosphere that mirrors Elias's emotional state. The gallery walkway provides the necessary platform for the beckoning action. Sensory contrast between harsh brine/diesel and impossible night-garden scent is vivid and purposeful. The Teeth as hidden threat adds spatial stakes, though the lighthouse interior could be more tactilely grounded in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the ship without causing panic) is clear early and tightens when "the wind smelled of forgiveness and rest" guides the captain. Agency is Elias's choice to use the silent method despite the head keeper's doctrine. The escalation from broken foghorn to drifting ship to Elias's physical projection narrows options effectively. Visible cost appears in his shaking body and exhaustion, though the ship's response happens off-stage, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whispers-versus-shouts premise tested in action rather than stated. The final image—"the quietest force had screamed the loudest"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The night-garden scent as carrier wave for intent is a specific, non-obvious embodiment of the concept. The head keeper's obliviousness adds ironic weight, underscoring that validation isn't required for success.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited focused on Elias throughout. Voice is controlled with purposeful elevated diction ("turbulent distance," "beckon the lost souls") that fits the lighthouse-keeper register. The phrase "screaming tenderness" and "clawing solicitude" show distinct perceptual signature. Minor register slip: "spiritual filter, stripping away the selfish fear" reads slightly explanatory during a peak moment when embodied sensation would sustain better.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with longer contemplative beats contrasting shorter action moments. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. Two minor issues: "a man who worshipped the authority of loud noises and rigid protocols" is tell-heavy where a concrete behavior would be sharper, and "the impossible scent of a garden at night spilled out" + immediate catalog risks slight overwriting. The figurative language in "bruised cobalt" and "agonizing care...like a physical wound" is coherent and voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse keeper uses scent and intention rather than sound to guide ships) offers a fresh synthesis of the magical-realism lighthouse story. The guild cork as "spiritual filter" and "core vibrations of intent" create a coherent fantastical system rather than arbitrary magic. "Screaming tenderness" as oxymoronic emotional state is memorable and specific. The whispers-versus-shouts moral question avoids the safety middle by committing fully to the silent method's efficacy with physical cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias drives every major turn: he chooses to use the cork, projects his will, and successfully guides the ship. His decisions alter tactics (silent beckoning versus the broken foghorn) and his final satisfaction closes the arc. Present throughout and causally active in setup, middle struggle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cork appears in setup (retrieved from pocket), is used actively in the middle beat (absorbs and transmutes vibrations), and returns at closure (recorked). Its specific function—purifying intentions—enables Elias's method. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; stronger physical or tactical constraint would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" shapes Elias's entire approach and is explained as "the universe was built upon core vibrations." It changes his options by offering an alternative to the foghorn. The concept appears in setup, drives middle action (projecting refined will), and is implicit in closure. Slightly abstract; more on-page friction or visible cost tied to the vibration mechanics would strengthen.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cork's ability to purify intentions enables the central action by "stripping away the selfish fear of failure." This constraint appears in the middle beat and is necessary for Elias's method to work. However, it's primarily told rather than dramatized through visible tradeoff or cost, and the exact mechanics remain vague.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Beckoning is the climactic action: Elias steps onto the gallery, opens the vial, and projects presence through scent. This action is prepared (he must retrieve the cork, fill it with emotion) and executes at the peak pressure moment. The ship's course correction is the direct result. Swapping "beckon" for another term would require rewriting the core magical method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Garden-at-night scent is signaled early as impossible on the barren ocean, described in specific detail (jasmine, loam, roses), and used as the "carrier wave" for Elias's will. It appears in the climactic beat and directly causes the captain's calm response. The improbable sensory contrast (garden versus brine/diesel) creates the method's core tension.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse is visually charged and the tower's lantern room/gallery provide the necessary platform for projection. Dawn timing and post-storm atmosphere create urgency. The setting enables the beckoning action but doesn't constrain it strongly; Elias could theoretically project from elsewhere. The blue-tinted glass creates mood but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Post-heat-wave timing is mentioned early ("the oppressive heat wave had finally broken hours ago") and the dawn context frames the misty visibility problem. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions materially—the story's urgency comes from the drifting ship, not the specific post-storm window. The broken heat wave is more atmospheric than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is established early, tested against the head keeper's doctrine, and drives Elias's choice to use the silent method. It creates internal friction (his "secret motivation" versus established protocol) and is validated in closure without being overtly stated. The physical cost of projection dramatizes his commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" is introduced explicitly ("a feeling of screaming tenderness") and embodied through oxymoronic imagery: "fierce, clawing solicitude" and "agonizing care...like a physical wound." The tone charges the final image when "the quietest force had screamed the loudest" resolves the paradox. Modulates effectively from contemplative opening to intense middle to satisfied closure.</comment>
