<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is specific and her eccentric organizing principle (books by heartbreak gravity) embodies character through action. The decision to attempt the portal is legible, and the final return to stamping books reads as Earned Stasis—she validates her belief and resumes her role with visible cost (the failed breach). Interiority occasionally drifts toward exposition ("She believed this location existed...") rather than dramatized perception, and the young patron remains inert, but the core arc holds with embodied choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accretes through ritual manipulation until the silk cannot sustain the geometry, then collapses back to ordinary reality. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara fails to enter fully but validates the realm's existence, stamping books "merely inches away from the screaming source." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scarf's geometry bends the library's atmosphere, raising stakes before the snap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rotunda with double-helix frescoes and mahogany desk anchor setting early, and the library hums as a sensory environment. The silk scarf functions as micro-setting: its hyperbolic folds constrain Elara's attempt and charge the closure when it slips, sealing the breach. Sensory detail (ozone tang, dust, shimmer) modulates with pressure. The young patron in tweed coat and thermodynamical limericks supplies texture without disrupting spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source-realm of stories—is signaled in paragraph ten and tested on the page when Elara's manipulation opens a shimmer, then fails. The tension in the silk becomes "too great to sustain" and the snap forecloses full entry with visible cost: the vision collapses and she returns to mundane tasks. Agency is renunciation with undeniable consequence. One meaningful tightening (the scarf's geometry bending reality) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, and the final "merely inches away" line reweights prior material with felt proximity to the unreachable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (the gap between creation's raw source and its domesticated echoes) emerges through the hyperbolic-geometry ritual and the contrast between analog memory and digital archives. The final image—Elara stamping books "merely inches away from the screaming source"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The scarf's collapse reweights the premise: validation coexists with exclusion. Minor drag from semi-expository lines ("She believed this location existed...") that nudge theme toward statement, but the closure image rescues specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with a consistent intellectual-poetic register ("cathedral of contradictions," "somnambulists," "observed solitude"). Perceptual signature is selective: she sees books by heartbreak gravity, not Dewey Decimal. Some diction ("sanely eccentric," "screaming source") verges on authorial rather than character-bound, and filter verbs ("appeared merely fastidious") occasionally dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates appropriately when she gazes into the void, and the young patron's mild confusion contrasts her perception cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with vivid specifics ("saddle shapes," "liquid mercury," "ozone tang"), and rhythm varies across beats. Two issues prevent higher scoring: minor scaffold phrases ("It was an object of intense fragility, its hem unraveling like a forgotten thought, yet it vibrated...") stack modifiers without propulsion, and a paraphrase loop appears when "analog memories" and "residual heat of a moment" restate the same idea across adjacent sentences. The closure image is clean, but these artifacts in the middle third reduce density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as portal mechanism and "negative spaces of the universe" as story-source is specific and non-obvious. The analog/digital contrast and the library's scientific-poetry duality feel purposeful rather than decorative. The premise transforms a familiar "librarian discovers magic" template through mathematical rigor and a conceptual rather than emotional climax. The young patron's thermodynamical limericks and the curator organizing by heartbreak gravity add lived-in texture that resists generic anywhere/anytime settings.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, makes the choice to manipulate the scarf (middle turn), and returns to stamping books at closure. Her archival worldview (organizing by heartbreak gravity) frames the attempt. She drives two beats—setup and the hyperbolic folding—and participates in the ending by resuming work with validated belief. Not indispensable (another custodian could perform the ritual), but specific enough that removal would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The scarf is handled in at least three beats: initial description on the blotter, the hyperbolic folding sequence, and the final snap/unfurl that seals closure. Its worn warp and weft trap analog memories, its geometry constrains Elara's attempt, and its failure forecloses entry. The object's physical state (tattered, unraveling) and its collapse drive causality. Swapping for another fabric would require rewriting the portal mechanism and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Analog memories" are contrasted with digital archives early, and the scarf's embedded rain/train/goodbye sensations bleed into the library's atmosphere during the ritual. The concept shapes tactics: Elara must use physical matter to access the source-realm. It reappears at closure when the library returns to "dusty stillness" versus the "ozone tang of the void." Not indispensable—another metaphysical property could serve—but the concept enables the portal logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is stated early ("her behavior was sanely eccentric") and embodied in her organizing principle (books by heartbreak gravity) and the hyperbolic-folding method. The trait enables the attempt but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; her eccentricity is validated rather than penalized. The young patron's confusion registers the trait on the page. Present across beats but more illustrative than causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" anchors the middle action: Elara lifts the scarf to "reawaken the dormant narrative trapped in the fiber" and twists it "to reawaken the past." The act produces the shimmer, the atmosphere bleed, and the vision of the source-realm. The verb recurs and the action's failure defines closure (the snap that seals the breach). Swapping "reawaken" for "activate" or "release" would dilute specificity but not break structure; strong integration, not quite indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early ("the method was strictly mathematical") and detailed on the page: Elara pinches curves that flare like saddle shapes, forcing exponential surface area within finite boundary. The non-Euclidean folds cause the shimmer and stress reality. The method is irreplaceable—Euclidean folding would not produce the effect—and its failure (tension too great) drives closure. The specificity of saddle geometry versus generic "magic folding" makes the element indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Scientific Poetry Library is described vividly (rotunda, double-helix frescoes, mahogany desk) and supplies the books Elara stamps at closure. The stacks and circulation desk anchor spatial choreography. However, the library does not constrain choice or alter tactics; the ritual could occur in another occult space with minor edits. The setting charges atmosphere and the final contrast (dusty stillness vs. void), but does not pressure the outcome. Solid presence across beats, modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Three in the morning" and "odd-hour" frame the opening, and "tonight" recurs, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. Patrons browse throughout without urgency, and no countdown or shift in browsing behavior pressures Elara's attempt. The graveyard-shift context adds tone but remains static; removing the time anchor would not alter causality. Present in setup, absent from escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "find the place where stories live before they are written down" is stated early and dramatized through the scarf ritual. Her belief that the location exists in negative spaces drives the hyperbolic folding and frames the closure: she fails to enter fully but validates its existence. The motivation coheres across beats and charges the final "merely inches away" image. Not swappable with a generic quest; the specific metaphysical goal shapes tactics and the Earned Stasis resolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" appears in the opening sentence and recurs when Elara is a "fixture of this graveyard shift" and patrons drift "like somnambulists." The tone modulates subtly during the ritual (shadows deepen, ozone tang) and returns to "dusty stillness" at closure. The observer/observed dynamic (young patron watches, uncomprehending) charges the final contrast. Tone is coherent and supports the ending's resonance, but does not constrain choice. Present across structure with modest thematic weight.</comment>
