<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (outwit cosmic tricksters) is signaled early and drives his peak choice. His embodied stress ("trembling hands," "sweat dripped") supports the action beats, but internal contradiction is thin—he works frantically yet remains functionally competent throughout without visible failure or genuine doubt. The final micro-choice (cigarette) feels token rather than earned by prior contradiction. "Cautiously hopeful" is labeled in exposition but not dramatized through a foregrounded cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, university radio booth, riots outside) land by the first beat. Drive lens reads Causal: Elias traces the signal, prepares counter-frequency, executes, observes reversal of mob behavior. Closure is a Decisive Change (mobs slow, lethargy replaces aggression) with visible effect on the page. Cost is implied (the tricksters will adjust) but conceptual rather than felt; no forfeited option or visible price is legible in the final image, which softens the closure unit slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio booth (cigarette-scarred, mixing board, VU meters, oscilloscope) is vivid and grounds the technical action. The station's location on a ley line supplies the pivotal constraint. Spatial choreography is clear across desk, console, and window sightline. The booth's sensory specificity (stale coffee, ozone, dust) is filtered through urgency and charges the final cigarette-smoke image, which reweights "dust of the universe" thematically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop the riots by countering the signal) is signaled early and tightens once: Elias diagnoses perigee → prepares counter-frequency → executes. One meaningful escalation (screams penetrate studio, driving frantic precision) raises urgency. Agency is clear (inject destructive interference), and the reversal (mobs slow) is earned by his choice. Cost is implied future threat ("try again, perhaps in another town") but not a forfeited present option; no visible price alters Elias's situation on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (cosmic manipulation versus human ingenuity, autonomy bought at provisional cost) emerges through particulars: ley line weapon, subsonic interference, one night's reprieve. The final cigarette image ("dust of the universe") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Yet "cautiously hopeful" is told rather than earned through a concrete renunciation or ambivalent choice, and the ending tilts toward competence-satisfaction rather than irreducible complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-close POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("ethereal grit," "invisible architects of chaos," "poison pill," "shadow-broadcast") is consistent and voice-specific, blending pulp urgency with technical idiom. Perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, oscilloscope fixation) anchors Elias's expertise. Dialogue is absent. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he saw") cluster lightly but remain voice-motivated. The prose modulates rhythm under peak pressure ("sharp intake of breath, he slammed the master fader up") without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Figurative language ("engine of complex power plays," "strings cut by a localized burst of low-end audio") is dense in exposition beats but avoids muddle in the peak technical sequence. Minor paraphrase loop: "cosmic tricksters" / "entities" / "tricksters" across adjacent paragraphs without pressure gain. Template cadence is minimal. Information density is high in the counter-frequency procedure; no loops or scaffold obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The celestial-signal manipulation premise is executed with technical specificity (subsonic destructive interference, ley-line transmitter), lifting it above stock alien-influence templates. The radio-station setting and geomagnetic weapon are concrete. Yet the core emotional arc (competent loner foils cosmic threat, retains hope) follows a familiar underdog-wins path without moral ambiguity or a costly trade-off that complicates victory. Proximity to "lone expert versus insidious broadcast" pulp tropes is high; transformation is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (celestial signal interpreter) appears immediately, interprets the charts in beat one, diagnoses perigee, decides to counter-broadcast, executes the interference, and observes the outcome. His choices drive all major turns. Setup, development, payoff all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The role's specificity (tracking dark sectors, subsonic counter-frequency) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in beat one ("hand-drawn maps"), Elias smooths and traces declination to confirm perigee, shaping his counter-move. Two beats: initial diagnosis, mid-scene confirmation. Setup and development present; no reweighted reprise at closure. Swappable with generic star map or computer readout with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Power plays (cosmic entities destabilize hierarchy to feed on kinetic energy) are explained in exposition, frame the antagonist's method, and Elias counters by severing "strings" of control. Setup present; the concept shapes tactics (inject poison pill, cut command waves). Appears in closure image ("strings cut"). Yet the mechanics remain told; no on-page dramatization of a power-play exchange or visible cost tied to this framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled in the penultimate paragraph ("felt cautiously hopeful") and restated in the final line. It does not constrain an earlier choice or enable a visible action with cost. Setup absent (appears only at closure). The trait is summarized rather than enacted through a foregrounded tradeoff or renunciation. Lyric reprise without mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interfere: Elias's decision to "interfere with the transmission" anchors beat three, the subsonic injection is the climax, and the outcome (mobs slow) traces directly to this action. Setup (preparation), development (execution under screams), payoff (reversal). Two beats plus closure. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability strong. Cost is future-implied ("tricksters will adjust") rather than a forfeited present option, capping score slightly below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled mid-story ("below the threshold of human hearing"), explained with destructive-interference mechanics, executed in the climax (master fader slam, VU meters red), and produce the visible outcome. Setup slightly late (~40% mark) but development and payoff strong. Causal pressure and specificity high. The method is irreplaceable; generic "broadcast" would not carry technical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>University radio station frames the opening, supplies the ley-line weapon (sole tool Elias has), houses the mixing board and transmitter, and the booth's window delivers the sightline for outcome observation. Setup, development, payoff all present across three beats. The station's geomagnetic resonance is a non-swappable constraint. Spatial micro-setting (console, oscilloscope, VU meters) alters tactics under pressure. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "as the community divides" is visible on-page (marching Ascended vs. Silencers, screams growing louder) and tightens urgency mid-scene ("screams from the quad grew louder, penetrating…driving him to work with frantic precision"). Setup present (riots outside), development (escalating noise pressures execution), payoff (fires dwindle). Live ticking clock, but no explicit countdown or final-second cost. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to outwit cosmic tricksters" is stated early, frames Elias's diagnosis (entities in perigee, arrogant broadcast), drives his counter-move (poison pill, destructive interference), and recurs at closure ("tricksters would eventually adjust"). Setup, development, payoff present. Causal pressure clear. Minor friction: the motivation is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted want-versus-cost choice, capping score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone "ethereal grit" is coherent from opening ("stale coffee and ozone, perfect distillation of ethereal grit") through technical urgency (cigarette-scarred booth, ink-stained fingers, dust of the universe) to the quiet final image (smoke curling toward ventilation ducts). Setup explicit, development sustained, payoff charged. The tone modulates with pressure (frantic precision, "terrifying silence," lethargy) without breaking. Strong closure linkage; specificity high.</comment>
