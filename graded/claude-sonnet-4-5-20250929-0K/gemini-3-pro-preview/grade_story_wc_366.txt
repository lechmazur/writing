<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is strongly characterized through action and embodied observation—his reticent nature shapes every move, and the sea-glass gesture earns the final shift in Thomas. The micro-choices (hoisting crate, striking match, placing glass) all reflect his singular drive to "bottle safety," and Thomas's terror is embodied (gripping railing, hollow eyes, tremor). Minor deduction: Thomas's interiority remains thin; we see fear but not the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and Elias's warm observation is more told than dramatized through specific perceptual filters under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sea-glass addition transforms the cairn from distress signal to endurance declaration, and the match-lit glow shatters the oppressive atmosphere, allowing Thomas to find footing—visible cost is Elias's deliberate exposure to the haunted dark and his departure into it. The piece teaches a Causal lens (supply arrival → lamp failure → Thomas's breakdown → Elias's stone-and-light intervention → Thomas stabilizes) with clear because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. One meaningful tightening: the cairn's instability signals distress, Elias's addition locks it, and the flame behind glass charges the final image with palpable relief. The inferred lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lantern room is not postcard décor—it constrains choice (glass-walled trap, pressing shadows) and charges the climax (amber glow defies gray hostility). Micro-setting (stone cairn on windowsill, Fresnel lens, spiral stairs) all shape tactics: Elias climbs deliberately, finds the cairn, completes it. Sensory detail is selective and filtered (metal ringing like tolling bell, sea-floor hum through bones, soft radiating bloom). Minor slip: "haunted by accumulated psychic weight" risks abstraction, but the shadows "pressing against glass" and the oppressive atmosphere that "shatters" anchor it in embodied perception. The sea glass and cairn function as micro-setting and constrain the final act, pushing the score toward the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightly: protect Thomas's fragile mind, not machinery. One meaningful tightening: Thomas declares "I can't fix it," Elias reads the unstable cairn as distress, and the "unseen presence" closes in—pressure coheres under the Causal lens. Agency is clear: Elias's choice to place sea glass and light the match forecloses passivity and shifts the room's charge. The cost is embodied (Elias descends into dark, leaving behind only an ember) and the resolution is earned by protagonist decision. No coincidence resolves; the lamp stays dark. Minor point: the haunted atmosphere serves mood but its mechanics remain abstract; the "psychic weight" and "shadows eager to reclaim" intensify but don't materially narrow Elias's options beyond mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (isolation, silent care, safety as collaborative endurance) emerges from stone-stacking vernacular, sea glass worn smooth, and the "luminescent ache" final image—no thesis statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: darkness cannot be defeated but can be held at bay by small acts that acknowledge without surrendering. Subtext operates in Elias's silence, the cairn's coded distress, and the match's "condensed warmth." The sea glass bridges beach find (weeks prior) and present need, reweighting solitude as shared survival. Minor deduction: "bottle the feeling of safety and decant it" skirts the edge of thematic echo but stays concrete enough through the enacted gesture. No moralizing in the final paragraph; the "glowing ember" image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited POV on Elias is stable and controlled—psychic distance stays consistent, diction matches his reticent, observant character ("honesty of the waves," "human erosion"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: he catalogs shifts, reads the cairn's message, and acts with deliberate slowness. The single line of dialogue ("I can't fix it") is purposeful and advances plot. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: long, atmospheric sentences ("glass-walled chamber that felt less like a shelter and more like a trap") tighten to short declaratives at the climax ("Elias struck a match"). Minor slip: "warmly observant" is asserted in paragraph three but not fully dramatized through POV-filtered perception under stress; the trait functions more as authorial label than embodied lens shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density, strong rhythm control, and vivid figurative language ("rhythmic rotation, plunging the ocean into abrupt, suffocating blindness"; "silence like a heavy coat"). Syntax varies purposefully, and the final line ("leaving behind a single, glowing ember of safety") delivers resonant closure. Minor deductions: "human erosion" and "accumulated psychic weight" risk abstraction; "luminescent ache" in the climax is evocative but borders on purple. Template cadence in paragraphs 2–3 (repeated "He was…" stems) costs clarity. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold, but the stacked metaphors in the haunted-room description (shadows not empty but heavy, eager to reclaim) slightly blur focus. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stone-cairn messaging system and sea-glass-as-safety-ember offer fresh, specific synthesis—not a stock lighthouse-keeper rescue. The premise (anonymous coastal survival guide via stacked stones) is non-obvious and the transformation of found object into light source feels earned in hindsight. Emotional truth (solitude, silent care) avoids template sentimentality. Minor friction: the haunted-lantern trope and the "psychological barriers crumble before mechanical ones" setup echo familiar isolation-horror beats. The story transforms through specificity (granite pebbles, frosted amber, match behind glass) but the core frame (experienced rescuer saves fragile novice at edge of world) is recognizable. Risk-taking in the non-verbal climax and the elliptical closure elevate within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias (reticent supply skipper) drives all major beats: climbs stairs, reads cairn, places sea glass, lights match, departs—each decision alters tactics and charges closure. His silence and observation enable the non-verbal intervention; removing him breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in beat one (found weeks ago), beat two (withdrawn from pocket, placed atop cairn to balance structure), and beat three (match lit behind it, creating glow that shatters oppressive atmosphere). Its transformation from found shard to safety-beacon is irreplaceable and charges the final image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain (stone-stacking messages) is seeded early, drives middle beat (Elias reads unstable cairn as distress), and participates in closure (addition changes sentence from cry to endurance). The concept shapes Elias's tactic and reweights solitude as collaborative survival; swapping it weakens the ending's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is asserted in paragraph three and enables Elias to catalog Thomas's terror and read the cairn, but the trait is more label than dramatized constraint. It colors perception but does not force a visible tradeoff or cost on the page; mid-band lyric reprise without middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Protect" is signaled early ("true purpose tonight was to protect…the fragile mind"), drives the middle beat (reading distress in cairn and Thomas's posture), and defines the climax (placing glass, lighting match). Swapping "protect" for "assist" or "comfort" would require rewriting the core motivation and final departure; the action is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stone-stacking method is introduced early (paragraph 14), its mechanics matter (unstable formation signals distress, Elias's addition locks pebbles into fortified whole, changing the message), and it participates directly in closure. The method's specificity (messages from solitary souls) is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the silent communication that enables the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room pressures Thomas (glass-walled trap, shadows pressing, oppressive atmosphere) and supplies the crisis that Elias's intervention resolves. The setting constrains choice (Thomas can't escape, Elias must act within) and the final image (glow defies gray hostility) transforms the space from trap to held ground. Minor deduction: "haunted" functions more as mood intensifier than causal constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe (after lamp flickers out) is signaled in the opening line, tightens stakes ("moments after the lamp flickers out are dangerous"), and frames the urgency of Elias's climb and intervention. The darkness persists through closure (lamp stays dark, Elias leaves "into the dark"), shaping the entire window. Solid integration; no live countdown but the post-failure frame is essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation ("to bottle the feeling of safety and decant it") is dramatized in Elias's deliberate climb, pocket withdrawal, cairn completion, and match-lit glow—each beat enacts the desire with visible cost (exposure to haunted dark, departure into it). The friction between Thomas's terror and Elias's mission creates the story's core tension; removing this motivation leaves no coherent through-line.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tone (luminescent ache) is coherent from opening (suffocating blindness, heavy silence) through climax ("soft, radiating bloom…beautiful, melancholy glow that acknowledged the darkness without surrendering") and charges the final image ("glowing ember of safety to hold the night at bay"). The tone modulates with pressure (oppressive → warm/aching → resolute) and the ending distills it perfectly; swapping tone would break the piece's emotional logic.</comment>
