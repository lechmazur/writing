<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—drowning in past lives versus forging autonomous selfhood—operates consistently throughout, and the final stance (witness rather than graveyard) is earned by the stone circle sequence. Embodied details are present (cold stone, teeth vibrating, breath seizing) but lean toward generic sensory catalog rather than character-particular perception. The shift from "suffocating isolation" to "autonomy" feels stated more than dramatized through micro-choices; the circuit through memory → terror → resolve reads clean but arrives via reflection rather than on-page friction with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when promptly (Elara, Tidal Library terrace, post-waking) and builds pressure through memory assault → physical grounding → stone-circle resonance → closure stance. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts coexistence with ghosts, forecloses erasure of past, visible cost = enduring grief). The tightening is legible—one meaningful shift from victim to witness—but escalation relies on lyric accumulation and internal reweighting rather than a causal turn that narrows options. Cost is felt but oblique; the final image ("ready to curate the endless volumes of the sky") charges prior material without a sharp on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Tidal Library, brass sundial, obsidian disc, and stone circle constrain Elara's ritual and charge the closure image. The atomically reflective surface functions as micro-setting that forces confrontation ("absolute truth of her physical form"), and the rising cloud-tide supplies temporal pressure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (cold stone, humming granite, blinding sunlight) and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across terrace → stacks → summit path → monolith ring → disc → return descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate isolation into independence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the obsidian reflection strips away past selves and the stone-circle hum crystallizes her stance from survivor to witness. Agency is attention and endurance under the Accumulative lens; no external antagonist appears. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing; the cost (accepting perpetual grief, relinquishing erasure) is felt but not concretely traded on the page. The resolution is earned by her ritual passage, but coincidence (the cloud-tide rising at the exact moment) supplies atmospheric closure rather than protagonist-driven consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as archive versus burden, autonomy amid loss—emerges through the library setting, extinct Sun-Drinkers, and the shift from "graveyard" to "witness." The obsidian disc and stone-circle resonance function as concrete particulars that avoid abstraction. The ending offers a resonant answer (coexistence without erasure) without moralizing, and the final image ("curate the endless volumes of the sky") reweights prior material. Subtext operates in silence, vibration, and the cloud-tide's encroachment. Minor slip: "translate isolation into independence" is stated early and echoed at closure, edging toward thematic echo rather than purely emergent insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature (memory-haunted, grief-laden) colors every observation. Diction is elevated and consistent ("gnomon pierced the sunlight," "tensile strength") with no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses during memory assault, longer during resolution). Minor register drift: "atomically reflective" and "quantum perfection" introduce technical vocabulary not clearly anchored in Elara's expertise, and "sovereign entity" at the closure beat leans abstract where a concrete image would sharpen voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high, and propulsion is maintained through the ritual sequence. Minor overwriting: "fluid, chaotic recollections," "vast and empty," and "endless volumes of the sky" stack modifiers without sharpening sense. Figurative language appears frequently ("shell of her present self," "graveyard for the Sun-Drinkers," "ocean that left the peak in brilliant, blinding sunlight") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. One scaffold moment: "The goal was not to forget… The goal was to coexist" repeats the stem without added pressure, costing ~−0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of reincarnation memory, high-altitude library, and quantum-reflective ritual device is specific and non-obvious; the emotional arc (isolation → autonomy via confrontation with past) feels earned in hindsight. The stone-circle mechanism and atomically reflective disc are fresh inflections on the memory-processing premise. Risk-taking is evident in the lyric-accumulative design and technical vocabulary, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. The Sun-Drinkers and cloud-tide imagery create a distinct sense of place. Transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is established as "a contemporary of extinct species" and her reincarnation memory drives her to seek the stone circle; the choice to step onto the disc and accept witnessing (rather than forgetting) alters her stance at closure. Present in setup, middle ritual choice, and ending. Two beats of involvement; causal pressure is present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in three mentions: terrace description (first paragraph), "bypassed the stacks" transit, and final sympathetic resonance check. It measures mist depth and vibrates sympathetically with the stone circle but is never handled or used in a choice. Its function is atmospheric rather than tactically constraining; swappable with another altitude/pressure instrument.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" frames the opening ("another of her brittle awakenings") and transforms at closure ("The brittleness was gone, replaced by a tensile strength"). The concept shapes her goal (stabilize fragmented mind) and tactics (seek the stone circle). Present in setup and payoff; middle development is implicit in the ritual sequence. Cost is visible (enduring grief) and the concept reweights at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "atomically reflective" obsidian disc constrains Elara's confrontation by returning "the absolute truth of her physical form, unburdened by the shadows of the past." This property enables the key middle beat where she sees herself "distinct and sharp, stripped of the Sun-Drinkers' memory." Present in setup (stone circle construction), middle (observation on disc), and closure linkage (resolve hardens). Specificity matters; a normal mirror would not achieve quantum-level stripping of psychic overlay. Cost is conceptual (forced boundary acknowledgment).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Coexist" is named explicitly as the goal midway ("The goal was to coexist") and achieved at closure ("allow the past to inhabit the library of her mind without letting it dictate the architecture of her future"). The action defines her shift from attempting erasure to accepting dual presence (past + present). Present in setup (implicit problem), middle articulation, and ending stance. Irreplaceable; "forget," "suppress," or "integrate" would alter the moral calculus and closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "hum of an ancient stone circle" is signaled early ("mechanism for clarity") and its mechanics matter: vibration starts in teeth, rattles bones, creates sympathetic resonance across the mountain, and enables the reflective-disc confrontation. The method shapes two beats (arrival at circle, peak vibration) and is causally necessary for her resolve to harden. Present in setup, middle use, and closure contribution (vibration peaks as cloud-tide rises). Swappability test: another ritual would require different physical mechanics and spatial staging.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Tidal Library supplies the obsidian disc, stone circle, and brass sundial; its high altitude and cloud-tide rhythm tighten the temporal frame and charge the ending image ("cloud-tide began to rise, lapping against the lower steps"). The setting pressures her choice (isolation without exit) and provides the ritual tools. Present across all three gates and integral to two beats (terrace grounding, summit ritual). Micro-setting (cold stone floor, polished obsidian) alters tactics by forcing embodied confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" anchors the story's present (she wakes from a memory assault) and the timeframe spans morning ritual through cloud-tide onset. The "weeks" of grief mentioned in backstory contextualizes urgency but does not create a live countdown. Time progression is legible (morning → climb → ritual → descent) but does not sharply constrain decisions; the cloud-tide arrival is atmospheric rather than a hard deadline that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Translate isolation into independence" is stated early, dramatized through the stone-circle sequence (she seeks external mechanism to stabilize self), and achieved at closure (shift from graveyard to witness, vacuum filling with autonomy). Friction is present: isolation feels like suffocation, independence requires enduring grief rather than erasing it. Present in setup, middle pursuit, and ending fulfillment. Cost is conceptual (perpetual coexistence with loss) and legible in the final stance.</comment>
