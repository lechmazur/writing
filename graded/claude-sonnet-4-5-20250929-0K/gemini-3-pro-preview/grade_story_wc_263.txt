<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority carries strong particularity ("deafening noise of potentiality"), but emotional progression flattens in the climax: "crushing him" and "gasping" lean toward generic suffering without embodied contradiction. The pivot from frantic effort to surrender feels motivated by exhaustion rather than internal conflict—he simply stops when overwhelmed. Micro-choices exist (raising the instrument, tracing trajectories, releasing), yet the final smile lacks the weight of a genuinely foreclosed path; no visible cost or renunciation registers on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by ~100 words). The accumulative lens holds through atmospheric build and a tightening that moves from whispers to hurricane to stillness. However, the closure unit—Elian's smile and the claim that "the story had finally begun"—offers resonance without legible cost: what did he forfeit, and what concrete option closed? The final image reweights prior noise into music, yet the price remains asserted rather than dramatized, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway, frost-covered stones, and Star-Loom anchor vividly. Sensory detail (cold lens, electric violets, thin air) filters through Elian's mystical perception. The brass device slides into snow—a tactile moment—and the archway hums during peak pressure, constraining his attempt. However, spatial choreography blurs: distances, exact positioning, and the relationship between Elian and the instrument after collapse remain vague, preventing micro-setting from fully charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through sensory overload (whispers → screams → hurricane), and the reversal lands when active pursuit becomes the obstacle. Yet the tightening reads more as conceptual realization than a choice that narrows live options: Elian collapses from exhaustion, and surrender follows automatically. The cost of lying still versus continuing to trace is not legibly weighed; the resolution feels delivered by fatigue rather than agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through concrete particulars: the paradox of frantic capture versus receptive stillness, stardust resonance, unspoken words. The final image—noise clarifying into music through rest—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. "The story had finally begun" risks meta-commentary, yet it reweights the unwritten calendar motif. Minor slip: "suffered from a profound sensitivity" and "burden of an attribute" edge toward diagnostic framing in the opening, though the thematic core remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice carries a mystical register ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture," "electric violets") that feels purposeful and consistent. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction mid-crisis ("a profound sensation washed over him," "the beauty was crushing him") without grounding through Elian's specific lexicon. The rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences at collapse), yet filter verbs ("felt," "realized") cluster in the climax without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity holds; no pronoun confusion or timeline breaks. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("electric violets," "remembered stardust," "celestial downpour") enriches texture. However, paraphrase loops appear: "unspoken words" recurs across three beats with near-identical phrasing; "frantic, desperate speed" in one line, "gasping, his chest heaving" two lines later both summarize rather than enact. The closure beat—"stopped fighting," "stopped trying," "simply lay still"—uses template stems that dull propulsion. Apply −0.6 for scaffold accumulation touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic inspiration, astronomical instrument, and the paradox of active versus receptive creativity offers a non-obvious angle. "Remembered stardust" and the Star-Loom feel specific to this vision. Yet the core arc—mystic overwhelmed by the sublime, finds peace in surrender—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or surprising moral calculus. The setting (archway, aurora) and the protagonist's sensitivity read archetypal rather than irreplaceable. Risk is moderate; no bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes beyond the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian frames the opening, drives the pilgrimage, operates the instrument, and enacts the final surrender. His choices (raising the device, tracing stars, collapsing, ceasing effort) create the arc. However, "moonstruck dreamer" as a trait appears largely in exposition; his decisions at peak pressure arise from exhaustion rather than the dreamer identity shaping tactics. Present across all three gates, but causal pressure and specificity remain moderate. Two beats (tracing, surrender) with closure linkage lift the score, yet swappability (any mystic could serve) and late signal of the dreamer label cap higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Star-Loom appears early (brass device, gearwork and crystal), is handled in two beats (tracing meteors, sliding into snow), and its loss marks the pivot to surrender. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied. However, its unique properties—designed to "capture threads of light"—do not demonstrably constrain Elian's method versus a generic telescope. The instrument enables tracing but does not shape why tracing fails or why rest succeeds; a simpler tool could serve. Causal involvement is present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" appears mid-story as a sensation ("iron in his blood resonating with the burning rock") and recurs in the closure ("settled into a steady rhythm"). Setup by first third, weak development (one beat of resonance without tactical consequence), and lyric reprise at closure satisfy two gates. However, the concept does not constrain a choice or alter options on the page; it functions as thematic texture rather than causal pressure. The final rhythm synchronization reweights meaning but lacks felt cost tied to stardust specifically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" frames Elian's burden in the opening and escalates into "screaming" noise that drives collapse. Setup and development gates satisfied; it directly precipitates the crisis. Payoff: the noise "clarified into music" at closure. Present across three gates with causal pressure (the attribute forces the problem and shapes the resolution). However, the trait's mechanics—how hearing unspoken words differs from generic sensory overload—remain vague, reducing specificity. Visible cost (collapse) tied to the attribute elevates the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rest" is signaled as "the only action that could withstand such power," enacted on the page ("lay still," "closing his eyes," "surrendering his will"), and directly enables the closure effect (noise becomes music, creativity flows). Setup, development, and payoff gates all satisfied. The action is irreplaceable: removing rest breaks the resolution. Causal pressure high; closure linkage undeniable. Minor friction: rest follows collapse from exhaustion rather than a deliberate mid-strength choice, slightly reducing agency. Cost (paralysis, surrender of control) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced early (turning dials, following trajectories, crosshairs locking), executed on the page in the middle beat, and its failure precipitates the pivot to rest. Setup, development, and payoff satisfied. The method shapes two distinct beats (tracing meteors, frantically trying to keep up). However, the mechanics—why tracing specifically fails versus any observation—remain underspecified. Causal involvement is strong, but swappability (a similar active method could serve) and moderate specificity prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "aurora-lit archway" anchors the opening ("massive stone structure," "forgotten gate") and hums during peak pressure. Present in setup and one development beat. However, it does not constrain Elian's choices or alter tactics; the archway could be removed or replaced with an open peak without breaking story logic. Payoff weak: the archway is mentioned in the final line ("shadow of the archway") but does not charge the image or participate causally. Functional setting but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" appears early ("lost track of how long," "days bled into nights") and recurs in the final line ("The calendar remained unwritten"). Two-gate presence (setup and payoff reprise). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or shape tactics on the page; Elian's actions unfold in a single continuous beat without time pressure. The metaphor enriches tone but functions as thematic ornament rather than constraint. Lyric reprise slightly elevates, but lack of causal pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is stated early ("singular and terrified motivation") and drives the pilgrimage and instrument use. Setup and development satisfied. The resolution claims success ("creativity was no longer trapped"), offering weak payoff. Desire is told more than dramatized: no on-page friction between freeing creativity and a competing want or cost. The motivation enables two beats (journey, tracing) but remains abstract; removing this exact phrasing and substituting "channel inspiration" would not alter the arc. Moderate causal work without specificity or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" coheres across the piece: "joy so intense it bordered on agony," "dark delight that promised to unravel his sanity," and the final "paralyzed by exhaustion yet alive with infinite potential" all embody the oxymoron. Tone modulates with pressure (awe → overload → stillness) and charges the final smile. Setup early, development throughout, and payoff at closure. Coherent and purposeful. Minor friction: "shadowed rapture" as a phrase appears only in the rubric; the text enacts it without naming it, slightly reducing direct signal but not integration quality.</comment>
