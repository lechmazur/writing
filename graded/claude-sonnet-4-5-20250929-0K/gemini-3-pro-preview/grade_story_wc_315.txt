<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is embodied through specific action—blocking Lyra's view, relying on muscle memory, maintaining professional detachment despite internal chaos. The watcher's burden manifests in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously: terror balanced against monk-like calm, the need to preserve trust while knowing disaster's proximity. Internal state differs consistently from external behavior throughout the harness revision. Minor slip: "adrenaline storming through his veins" edges toward stock physiology at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Kael watches the chute deploy successfully, exhales the held terror, then immediately returns to seeking patterns—the burden endures with "the heavy memory of the risk remaining." Causal lens holds throughout: radio clears → inspection → fracture discovery → improvised repair → deployment test → survival confirmed → duty cycle resumes. Orientation anchors by line 3 (Kael, bio-dome arbor, post-static window). One meaningful tightening (fracture discovery) narrows options and the final image reweights "the watcher's burden" with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vividly anchored (frosted steel, genetically modified ivy, glass leaves, star-dusted void) and the parachute buckle as micro-setting constrains the pivotal choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: Kael notices tactile micro-fracture invisible to eye, wind shear patterns, the "sharp sound" of the clip. The titanium retention clip on his belt serves as spatial resource that enables the solution. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the harness revision sequence. Does not quite reach 8+ because the arbor's pressure on choice is atmospheric rather than mechanically constraining the repair itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled immediately: safe passage through the wind-shear window before it closes. The micro-fracture discovery creates one sharp tightening that forecloses abort (orbit decay traps them) and forces improvisation under time pressure. Agency is clear: Kael's decision to swap his own retention clip, block Lyra's view, and maintain the professional mask. The buckle repair trades his own safety equipment with visible cost ("he did not dare look at his hands"). Coincidence does not resolve; protagonist skill and choice do. Enters high 8-band because the cost is physical (his belt clip gone) and relational (amplified burden) but not quite transformative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The watcher's burden emerges through concrete particulars: the terror of hidden risk, the necessity of preserving another's confidence, the physical weight of responsibility ("pressed against his ribs like iron bands"). The parachute image recurs with shifted meaning—fractured buckle to blooming silk petal. Final image offers non-literal answer: survival confirmed yet burden intensifies rather than resolves, "the soundless echo of her survival ringing in his ears." No overt thematic statement; the cost of asymmetric knowledge accrues through embodied action. Minor ceiling: the "terrifying gift" phrase in paragraph 26 edges toward articulating theme slightly too directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and maintained under pressure: tactile sensitivity ("screaming to his sensitive fingertips"), visual pattern-seeking in cloud formations, the professional detachment mask. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate access to Kael's terror while Lyra remains exterior. Single brief line of dialogue ("Clear") carries enormous subtext and goal pursuit. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Diction remains within Kael's technical-professional lexicon even at peak stress ("violent G-force of deployment," "harness geometry"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythmic control tightens during the repair sequence, breathes slightly at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with most sentences advancing multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies effectively between the extended opening atmospheric setup and the compressed repair sequence. Minor loop: "soundless echo" appears in paragraph 2 (atmosphere metaphor) and final line (thematic callback)—the reprise is purposeful but "echo" as descriptor feels slightly overworked. Opening paragraph "silence so profound it felt heavy" / "absence of sound was a physical weight" paraphrases across two sentences. "The watcher's burden" appears three times; each use shifts context but the phrase itself becomes visible as scaffold. Proofreading clean, no major artifacts, strong propulsion through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of orbital station, pattern-seeking profession, and physical trust mechanics feels specific and non-obvious. The "midnight pattern seeker" role avoids stock rescue tropes through the emphasis on invisible atmospheric corridors and tactile micro-fracture detection. Transformation test: changing names/settings would require rebuilding the premise; the arbor-above-clouds and decaying-orbit stakes are integral. Risk-taking in withholding the fracture discovery until the pivotal beat pays off. Ceiling: the watcher's-burden frame, while executed well, evokes familiar asymmetric-knowledge territory; the fresh angle is more in execution than premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael as midnight pattern seeker frames expectation early (paragraph 4), drives two key beats (reading the safe corridor pre-launch, detecting the micro-fracture through tactile pattern recognition), and his decision to swap the clip creates the central turn. The pattern-seeking skill is causally necessary: without his trained sensitivity the fracture goes undetected. Present in closure image as he returns to "seeking the next pattern in the dark." Specific cost: his professional burden intensifies. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; only hairline shy of indispensable because the "pattern seeker" label does slightly more thematic than mechanical work at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parachute buckle appears in three distinct beats: initial harness check, fracture discovery pivot, deployment test that proves the repair. The micro-fracture is causally central—creates the core conflict, forces improvisation, and validates the fix when the chute blooms. Specificity matters: "primary parachute buckle," "damaged latch," "modified connection held firm." Closure directly depends on its function. Irreplaceable: no other object could anchor this exact sequence. The buckle is handled, assessed tactilely, revised, tested; visible cost tied to it (Kael's retention clip sacrifice). Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named three times and enacted throughout: Kael "carried the terrifying weight of her safety so she could remain light enough to fly," blocks her view to "preserve trust under pressure," maintains professional detachment to prevent her confidence from fracturing. The concept shapes tactics (must hide the flaw, must not abort) and reweights the ending (duty done but "the heavy memory of the risk remaining"). It constrains the repair approach—speed and secrecy are required because transparency would doom the mission. Drives stakes and alters the final image's emotional charge. Strong integration; only shy of 9+ because the phrase itself is slightly more thematic container than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is signaled early ("needed to be attentively inventive, instantly re-engineering") and demonstrated in the improvised buckle swap using his own retention clip, unorthodox harness geometry revision, and the tactile-only repair method. The trait enables the central solution with visible cost (his safety equipment sacrificed, reliance on muscle memory under stress). One major beat (the repair) where the attribute is causally active. Present but not returned to at closure; the ending emphasizes burden and pattern-seeking more than inventiveness. Solid causal role and cost, but single-beat use limits score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Revise" drives the story's central action: Kael "began to revise the harness geometry, deftly unthreading the damaged latch and swapping the fractured buckle." The revision is the climactic beat, occupies sustained focus (paragraphs 17–23), and the improvised modification's success determines survival. It is irreplaceable—no synonym (repair, fix, adjust) captures the re-engineering under constraint. Framed early as necessity ("needed to…instantly re-engineering"), executed in detail, and validated at closure when the "improvised buckle had held." Minor: the action itself is a problem-solution rather than a turn that redefines broader stakes, keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Muscle memory is seeded early in Kael's professional identity ("ten thousand practice drills"), becomes the method that enables the blind repair ("He relied entirely on remembering through muscle memory, his fingers dancing…with a fluidity born of" training), and the mechanics matter—he cannot look, must trust embodied knowledge. Causal: without this skill the repair would fail. Appears in one extended beat (the revision sequence) with clear cost (cannot verify visually, relies on tactile faith). Closure nods to it indirectly ("soundless echo of her survival"). Solid integration; not quite indispensable because muscle memory is supportive method rather than the hinge itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor is anchored vividly early (paragraphs 2–3: bio-dome, frosted steel, genetically modified ivy, glass leaves, launch precipice, atmosphere below). Setting provides the time constraint (orbital decay, closing weather window) and atmospheric pressure ("soundless echo," "monk-like calm" demanded). The titanium clip on Kael's belt is a spatial resource. Closure image loops back to "the ivy-choked controls." Two gates clearly met (setup, closure presence); middle development is atmospheric rather than mechanically constraining the repair itself. Lyric reprise reweights "nocturnal arbor" context but does not transform tactics, keeping score mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the radio static clears" signals the window opening in paragraph 1, creates urgency ("immediate, now"), and tightens tactics throughout: "before the clouds closed in again," cannot abort without stranding them, must complete repair before launch window expires. The ticking clock is implicit but persistent, shaping Kael's speed and decision to proceed despite the flaw. Validated at closure when the chute deploys successfully within the three-count. Present across all three beats (setup, repair under time pressure, successful launch). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; hairline shy of 8.5 because elapsed seconds are not tracked on-page during the repair itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to "preserve trust under pressure" is dramatized in conflicted choices: Kael blocks Lyra's view (paragraph 14), ensures "she never saw how close she stood to disaster" (paragraph 15), maintains "a mask of professional detachment" (paragraph 23) despite internal terror. The motivation creates friction—his need to protect her confidence conflicts with his own fear and costs him additional stress. Shapes two key beats (concealment during repair, the steady "Clear" signal) and charges the ending when her "absolute" faith amplifies his burden. Visible cost: the asymmetry intensifies his isolation. Strong integration; only shy of 9+ because the cost is primarily emotional rather than altering his options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of "soundless echo" is established early (paragraphs 1–2: "silence so profound it felt heavy," "absence of sound was a physical weight") and modulates with pressure—the "monk-like calm" demanded during inspection, the "sharp sound" of the clip that "rippled through the thin air like a gunshot," and the final "soundless echo of her survival ringing in his ears." Coherent across turns and charges the ending image. The tone fits the setting and stakes. Minor: "soundless echo" as phrase appears twice (paragraph 10, final line), which risks slight over-reliance on the label. Strong tonal control but not quite indispensable; a different tonal frame could work with adjustments.</comment>
