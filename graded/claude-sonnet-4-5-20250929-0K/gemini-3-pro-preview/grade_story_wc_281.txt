<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is embodied through the shaking hands "attuned to a frequency" and the physical weight shifts during the exposure. The somatic guidance method shows embodied emotion without therapy-speak. Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—proving beauty within chaos—and the final spine-straightening registers her shift credibly. Minor slip: "willowglass hope" in the final beat flirts with ornamental metaphor, but the posture change grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Elias's choice to tape the geode and use breath-guided movement directly enables the final image, which reweights Mara's perception of her neural static with visible cost (her tears, the fragile hope). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lattice image crystallizes a new stance toward the noise, the cost felt in "brittle, translucent." Orientation anchors quickly: Mara, studio, post-recall timeframe established by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening through the shared-breath exposure that narrows options from paralysis to navigation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The studio's "velvet darkness" and "pitch black" constrain the light-painting method and enable the geode's refractive work. The red standby light and monitor anchor spatial choreography. The geode sliver is handled twice (taping, swinging) and its layered structure charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy fits: Mara notices "jagged" noise, Elias notices her tremor rhythm. Minor: occupational detail (aperture, shutter, long exposure) is present but not stressed under conflict; acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: externalizing Mara's chaos to help her navigate it. One meaningful tightening: Elias devises the somatic method when verbal instructions won't work, narrowing options and forcing physical trust. The three-minute exposure is the pressure point; the resulting image forecloses despair with visible cost (tears, fragile hope). Agency is Elias's throughout; Mara's participation is passive, which slightly lowers band entry but fits her fractured state. Escalation is causal and the cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: communion's failure, beauty within chaos, the possibility of navigation rather than cure. The geode's fractal output answers the central question (can order emerge from static?) without stating a moral. "Willowglass hope" as metaphor for fragile resilience is slightly ornamental but does not force a thesis. The ending reweights prior material—the tremors and noise become structure—without explaining everything. The neural dissonance remains; only the stance shifts, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV (Elias) is stable; no head-hopping. His perceptual signature favors visual and somatic cues (aperture, breath, chest expansion). Diction is controlled: "somatic markers," "fractally precise" fit his artistic-skeptic register. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven ("Then we don't force the focus. We paint the noise"). Minor register slip: "willowglass hope" in narration feels slightly elevated for the established voice, though the metaphor's precision keeps it legible. Psychic distance is close-third and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high: most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph: "brittle, translucent, and incredibly precious" stacks modifiers where one stronger choice would suffice, and "willowglass hope" leans decorative. The geode's "ghosting echo of rainbows" is vivid but borders purple. Clarity and propulsion remain intact; the slips do not touch the closure beat's core mechanics (the lattice image).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy-pill recall, light painting, somatic guidance, and geode refraction is specific and non-obvious. The fractally precise output arising from tremor + geode is a fresh inflection that feels earned in hindsight. The piece avoids stock "hive-mind collapse" tropes by focusing on aftermath and embodied recovery. Minor swappability: the geode could be replaced by another refractive material with modest edits, slightly lowering irreplaceability. The emotional arc (fractured perception → fragile navigation) is particular to this premise and execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (affectionate skeptic) drives all major turns: selecting the geode, devising the somatic method, guiding the exposure. His refusal to partake in the pills establishes his skeptic trait; his hand-holding and temple kiss embody affection. His choices alter tactics (bypassing cognitive centers) and enable the closure image. Present early, active in middle, shapes ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Muscovite geode sliver is introduced early (paragraph 3), handled in two beats (taping, swinging during exposure), and its refractive property directly generates the fractally precise lattice that charges the closure. Removing it would collapse the story's logic: no geode, no "parallel ribbons of luminance," no cathedral of geometry. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Telepathy pill recall frames the inciting problem (Mara's neural dissonance, phantom voices) and constrains her state throughout. It shapes stakes (recovery, navigation of noise) and appears in exposition early. Does not directly participate in the climax action but underwrites the entire conflict. Middle development is implicit (her tremor, inability to focus). Solid setup and payoff, lighter middle touch.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes the resulting image, which reweights Mara's chaos into navigable structure. The attribute is specific and irreplaceable: the self-similar complexity is the story's thematic payoff. It appears at closure and carries conceptual cost (the hope is fragile, not a cure). Not signaled early or developed mid-scene, but the closure linkage is strong and the attribute's precision charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Devise" is Elias's key action: he devises the somatic method when verbal instructions fail. This choice redefines options (bypassing cognitive centers) and enables the entire exposure sequence. Present by midpoint, drives the climax, and without it the story collapses to static description. High causal pressure and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled ("relying on the visceral, physical feedback of breath and pulse"), mechanics are shown (hand on diaphragm, breath synchronization, weight shifts), and the method shapes the entire exposure sequence. Removing it would eliminate the story's core tactic. The method's success generates the closure image. Indispensable across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Light painting studio provides the darkness necessary for long exposure, the red standby light, and the monitor that reveals the result. The setting constrains the method (requires pitch black) and supplies the tools (camera, backdrop). Present early, enables middle action, houses closure. Micro-setting (studio as controlled sanctuary) alters Mara's ability to attempt the work. Solid integration with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the timeframe early and establishes urgency (Mara is still recovering, voices screaming). The recall's recency motivates Elias's intervention. Does not create a live ticking clock within the scene, but the aftermath state shapes Mara's limitations and the stakes. Present in setup, implicit pressure in middle, closure reflects ongoing recovery. Functional but not irreplaceable; a generic "post-crisis" frame would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways within her fractured perception" is Elias's stated motivation, dramatized through his choice of geode and somatic guidance. The desire is conflicted (he can't cure her, only externalize) and drives the plot. The closure image directly fulfills the goal: pathways are no longer dark. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Visible cost in his desperation and her tears.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" appears as the final tonal marker ("brittle, translucent, and incredibly precious") and coheres with the story's accumulation: darkness, fragility, tentative light. Tone modulates from "terrible, screeching feedback" to the "breathtaking" lattice without false resolution. The metaphor charges the final image and resists tidy closure. Present implicitly earlier (cool silence, the sanctuary), crystallizes at ending. Strong closure participation and specificity.</comment>
