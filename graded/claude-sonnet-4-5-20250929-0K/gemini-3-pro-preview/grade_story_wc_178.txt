<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bel-ibni is well-drawn through his parsimony (extinguishing torches, saving chalk for three years) and the central contradiction between his skepticism and empirical discovery of the divine is embodied in action. The forty-year arc of debunking myths only to find proof of sentience gives weight to his final ritual. Internal conflict operates concretely: he hides reverence inside dry charts, practices "encrypted devotion," and allows himself only "a single, brief nod" of satisfaction. Minor weakness: the astronomer's emotional register remains so tightly controlled that some peak beats (the rift opening, the covenant sealing) lack embodied contradiction or visible cost in his physical reactions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately (Babylon, between regimes, Bel-ibni). The causal lens holds: astronomer's lifetime measurements → proof of sentience → urgent ritual to preserve knowledge before invasion → covenant sealed in ether. One meaningful tightening occurs when the schematic diagrams lift into light and the rift opens, narrowing his options to the transaction. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—blowing out the candle, knowledge hidden in the dark—crystallizes the cost (truth inaccessible to conquerors) and reconfigures the opening urgency into earned stasis. The "efficient execution of a final, desperate duty" resolves with visible cost: the tile is "inert but forever changed," and the astronomer accepts isolation of the truth as the price of preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: blue-glazed brick corridors, obsidian floor inlaid with silver dust, brass gears and clockwork astrolabes. The high observatory dome both isolates Bel-ibni from the invasion below and provides the celestial access his ritual requires. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his utilitarian perspective (sacred oil conservation, threadbare robe, ozone and ancient dust). The magic square tile and chalk function as micro-setting objects that constrain action: he taps the tile three times to initiate the mechanism, draws schematics for three years' saved chalk. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The ziggurat's vertical structure—gates crashing below, quiet order above—charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: seal the covenant before the "crude superstitions of the new regime" erase the science. The tightening is causal: he ascends, produces the tile, draws diagrams, taps three times, and the rift opens—each step narrows options under the invasion's pressure. The transaction is protagonist-driven: he offers the tile as "formalized contract," and the presence "acknowledged him" by locking the pattern into stasis, ensuring preservation. One visible cost: the knowledge is now "inaccessible to the burning torches of the invading army," isolated in the ether. Minor limitation: the ritual proceeds without complication or reversal; his agency is decision and execution, but no live alternative or trade-off is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: a lifetime of empirical rigor yields proof of the divine, but preservation requires isolating truth from those who would burn it. The magic square tile—logic mistaken for sorcery—embodies the tension between mysticism and science. "Encrypted devotion" and hiding reverence "inside dry charts" operate as subtext throughout. The final image answers the thematic question without moralizing: he blows out the candle, "content in the knowledge that the most important truth was now safely hidden in the dark." Empirical irony is woven into causality (forty years debunking myths → proof of sentience) rather than asserted. The piece resists binaries: science and mysticism converge, and preservation costs accessibility. No explicit theme statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; all knowledge remains within Bel-ibni's perceptual frame. Voice is distinct and consistent: formal, precise diction ("efficient execution," "formalized contract," "permanent stasis") mirrors his character. Psychic distance is close enough to register his interior calculations ("he did not chant or prostrate himself; instead...") yet maintains narrative composure that reflects his parsimony of emotion. Perceptual signature is selective and utilitarian: he notices oil waste, thread condition, chalk saved for three years. Syntax modulates purposefully: longer, layered sentences during the ritual's unfolding contract to terse action at closure ("He blew out the final candle"). No dialogue; not required. One minor register drift: "dusky harmony" reads slightly elevated for the POV's empirical lexicon, though it could be voice-motivated given his astronomer's ear for celestial patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory detail and purposeful diction. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, character trait, or ritual mechanics. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several loops and synonym cycles accumulate: "efficient execution" / "absolute efficiency"; "secured" knowledge / "safely hidden"; "narrow corridors" and "labyrinthine corridors" in close proximity. Stock phrases appear: "the flight of the last...monarch and the encroaching thunder of...drums," "the suspended silence." Template cadence is detectable in paired "he did not...instead, he..." constructions. These artifacts cluster in the opening third and middle, not the closure beat, limiting deduction under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, but they prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian astronomer, magic square tile as mathematical artifact rather than sorcery trinket, and empirical proof of the divine offers a fresh angle on preservation-under-conquest plots. The framing—rigorous skeptic discovers sentience through data—is non-obvious and earned through specific detail (clockwork astrolabes, azimuth calculations, cuneiform grid). The final image (truth hidden in the dark, torches extinguished) reweights the opening's conservation motif with thematic resonance. Emotional truth and character complexity matter more than surface novelty, and the piece commits fully to its premise. Minor limitation: the ritual's uncontested success and lack of complication or risk within the sequence itself keeps the ingenuity in the solid rather than exceptional band. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this specific character and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bel-ibni's frugality is signaled early (extinguishing torches, threadbare robe, three-year-saved chalk) and constrains his choices throughout: he practices "encrypted devotion" hidden in dry charts, he "did not chant or prostrate himself" (efficiency over ritual excess), and allows himself only "a single, brief nod" at closure. His parsimony shapes the ritual's method—pure geometry rather than mysticism—and his final action (blowing out the candle) mirrors the opening's conservation motif with reweighted meaning. Setup, middle choices, and closure participation all present. The frugal trait enables his scientific approach and charges the ending's quiet economy of gesture. Causal pressure is visible: his lifetime of data collection provides "the only tangible proof" that drives the covenant. Cost is present: knowledge preserved but isolated. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for essentiality across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magic square tile is introduced early ("heavy object wrapped in linen"), handled in multiple beats (unwrapped, placed on the floor, tapped three times to initiate the mechanism, offered to the rift, acknowledged by the presence, retrieved and observed as "inert but forever changed"), and its properties matter: the cuneiform grid's cosmic constant links to star azimuth and initiates the ritual "through pure geometry rather than mysticism." It reappears at closure with reweighted state (fulfillment). Setup, development (tapping and offering constrain the ritual's method), and payoff all present. Specificity is high: its "masterpiece of logic" status differentiates it from sorcery trinkets and drives Bel-ibni's empirical approach. Cost connection: its use seals the knowledge in the ether, inaccessible to invaders. Irreplaceable: no generic artifact could perform this function. Scores solidly in the 7.0–8.4 band for driving multiple beats and contributing to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion is seeded early ("he had practiced an encrypted devotion, hiding his profound reverence for the cosmos inside dry charts and star tables that the priests ignored") and shapes his tactics: he does not chant or prostrate, but draws schematics and uses geometry. The concept governs his lifetime approach (forty years debunking myths while secretly measuring proof of sentience) and the ritual's method (mathematical rather than mystical). It appears in the closure frame: the final candlelit darkness mirrors the hiding motif. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is thematic rather than a distinct choice that the concept forces. The concept constrains method but does not generate a specific turn or trade-off on the page. Lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) is present and reweights the stake, qualifying for mid-6s under the allowance. Cost is conceptual: the truth is encrypted/hidden permanently.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Empirically ironic is both labeled ("It was empirically ironic") and dramatized: Bel-ibni's "lifetime of rigid skepticism and data collection had provided the only tangible proof of a higher power," and he "spent forty years debunking the myths of the temples, only to find that his empirical measurements pointed unequivocally to a sentient presence." This contradiction motivates the ritual's urgency and method—he must preserve the proof his skepticism accidentally yielded. The irony enables his encrypted devotion (he practices science that becomes religion) and charges the final image (knowledge hidden from superstition). Setup clear, middle development present (his measurements drive the ritual), closure linkage indirect but felt. One friction: the irony is explicitly named mid-text rather than left implicit, lowering irreplaceability slightly. Visible cost: his empirical findings become inaccessible. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn (the ritual's necessity) and reweighting the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Uncloak appears explicitly ("His intent was to uncloak the entity that dwelt between the constellations, stripping away the camouflage of distance and dark matter") and governs the ritual's purpose and method: the schematic diagrams, the tapping, and the rift's opening all serve to "strip away" concealment. The action is signaled in setup ("to seal a covenant with the unknown") and executed in the middle beat when "the air above the magic square tile distorted...revealing a glimpse of the infinite." The presence "acknowledged him" by locking the pattern, completing the uncloaking. Payoff is clear: the knowledge is now "preserved in the ether," no longer camouflaged. The action is specific and drives the climactic beat. One friction: the uncloaking itself does not generate a complication or cost beyond the transaction's success, and the term is somewhat swappable with "reveal" or "manifest." Scores in 7.0–8.4 band for driving the key turn and shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Schematic representations are introduced in the middle beat: Bel-ibni "began to draw schematic representations around the tile using a piece of white chalk," linking "the mathematical properties of the magic square to the specific azimuth of the unseen stars overhead." The method matters: the diagrams "lifted from the stone, manifesting as glowing vectors of light that rotated in the air," initiating the rift. The ritual's success depends on "pure geometry rather than mysticism," and the schematics embody that distinction. Setup is implicit (his lifetime of charts and measurements), development is on the page (drawing and activating), payoff is the covenant's sealing. One friction: the method is introduced and used within a single continuous sequence rather than seeded earlier or revisited, and the mechanics (how diagrams link to azimuth) remain somewhat abstract. Scores in 5.0–6.9 band for shaping the key turn but arriving late for full integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ancient Babylonian palace is signaled immediately ("reimagined palace of Babylon") and detailed throughout: blue-glazed brick corridors, high observatory dome, obsidian floor with silver-dust star inlay, brass gears and clockwork astrolabes. The setting provides the celestial access the ritual requires (high dome, star visibility) and isolates Bel-ibni from the invasion below (ziggurat structure). The "between regimes" timeframe charges the setting: gates crash open below while "up here, there was only the quiet order of the stars." The palace's verticality and the observatory's ancient-meets-clockwork design shape the ritual's staging. Setup, development (navigating corridors, ascending to observatory), and closure participation (final candle, darkness) all present. The "reimagined" detail (clockwork astrolabes of his design) differentiates it from a static historical postcard. Scores in 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn (isolation enables the ritual) and contributing to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Between regimes is signaled in the opening line ("between the flight of the last Chaldean monarch and the encroaching thunder of Persian drums") and sustained as urgent pressure: "Tonight, the city below awaited its conquerors in terror," "to seal a covenant with the unknown before the crude superstitions of the new regime erased the delicate science of the old," and the gates crash open at closure. The timeframe tightens his decision (now or never) and charges the final image: the old knowledge is hidden just as the new era begins. Setup, development (urgency drives the ritual's "efficient execution"), and payoff (gates open, knowledge secured) all present. One friction: the invasion itself remains off-page background pressure rather than a live countdown or complication that alters his tactics mid-ritual. The timeframe is essential for motivation and closure resonance but does not constrain specific beats within the sequence. Scores in 5.0–6.9 band approaching 7.0 for driving the dominant stake and shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seal a covenant with the unknown is the stated motivation ("urgent yet precise: to seal a covenant with the unknown") and drives the entire ritual sequence. Bel-ibni's forty years of empirical work have "pointed unequivocally to a sentient presence in the void," and the covenant preserves that knowledge before the invasion erases it. The motivation is dramatized through action: producing the tile, drawing schematics, tapping to initiate, offering the tile as "formalized contract," and the presence locking the pattern into "permanent stasis." The transaction is completed on the page with visible cost: the knowledge is now "inaccessible to the burning torches of the invading army." Setup (urgent duty), development (ritual execution), and payoff (covenant sealed, candle extinguished) all present. The motivation is specific, irreplaceable, and causally drives every beat. Scores in 7.0–8.4 band for essentiality across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears explicitly once: "The lines on the floor began to hum with a low resonance, vibrating in a dusky harmony that matched the darkening atmosphere of the room." The phrase captures the ritual's tonal quality—muted, twilight, orderly yet charged—and the "darkening atmosphere" links to the piece's pervasive dusk/darkness imagery (suspended silence, night sky, ozone, final candle). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly: formal and precise in setup, intensifying quietly during the rift's opening, returning to controlled stasis at closure. The "dusky" modifier reappears implicitly in the final darkness ("plunging the observatory into darkness," "safely hidden in the dark"). One friction: the phrase is used once mid-text and is somewhat ornamental; it does not constrain a choice or force a tonal shift that alters tactics. Lyric reprise is present (darkness → final darkness) and charges the ending. Scores in 5.0–6.9 band for shaping tonal coherence and contributing to the final image's charge.</comment>
