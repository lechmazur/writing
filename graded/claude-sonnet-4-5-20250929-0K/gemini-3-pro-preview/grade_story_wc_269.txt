<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation (discovering why paths disappear) is clear and embodied through his tapping practice and workspace arrangement. His memory of coral bleaching provides concrete interior detail that drives present investigation. The final realization—road consumed by super-coral—arrives via sustained data work rather than convenience, though the emotional response to the discovery remains understated. Minor deduction: the character's voice in reflection occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("visceral smell of the rot," "gnawing motivation") that edges past what feels strictly character-bound under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (data assembly → composite image → realization). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—road encased in mutated super-coral—constitutes a Decisive Change in knowledge with conceptual cost: the civilization's ruin now serves as substrate for adapted life. The "periodically eternal" phrase introduced mid-story pays off in the final beat when Elian understands the reef's rebirth cycle. One meaningful tightening occurs when months of sensor confusion resolves into "chaotic, towering mountain range," narrowing options from erasure to transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The monitoring station is grounded early (metallic buoy, cramped control room, lower bulkhead, swaying with currents) and constrains Elian's investigation to sonar/acoustic tools within the confined space. The drowned world context (swollen oceans, cleared skies, stabilized weather post-ban) frames stakes without catalog excess. The torn atlas page functions as micro-setting object, anchoring the lost coastline physically on his console. The holographic projector's "three-dimensional topography" directly enables the climactic discovery, making setting instrumental rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some paths disappear from sonar while others remain—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation arrives when Elian assembles weeks of data into composite image, a protagonist-driven action that narrows mystery to specific answer. The reversal (flat void becomes mountain range) is earned by prior setup: months of confusing sensor reports, his rhythmic tapping practice, the station's hydrophones. Cost is conceptual but legible: the road he watched die has been reclaimed by the life civilization nearly destroyed, foreclosing nostalgia for the original landscape. No forced antagonist; pressure coheres through investigative tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the "periodically eternal" reef concept introduced as archive text, initially dismissed by Elian as "poetic optimism," then validated when super-coral anchors to concrete substrate. The final image—path "claimed by the life that refused to end"—reweights the opening bleaching memory without moralizing. The atlas page's "phantom line" traced against glowing resurrection offers non-literal answer: destruction and rebirth intertwine without tidy resolution. Subtext operates through Elian's physical practice (tapping as echolocation) mirroring the story's method of revealing hidden structure beneath apparent emptiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Elian's perceptual signature—listening through steel, feeling vibrations, interpreting sonic echoes—is consistent and character-specific. The prose modulates appropriately from procedural focus ("fingers flew across the terminal") to charged realization ("hit him with the force of a rogue wave"). Minor slip: "drifting moored" as opening descriptor and "sensation of being drifting moored" later create slight redundancy. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance narrows effectively at the discovery moment without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at discovery: "The path hadn't disappeared because of erosion or burial; it had disappeared because it had been consumed"). Information density is high; most lines advance situation or character understanding. Minor loop: "the fossil fuel ban" appears twice in close proximity without variation. The phrase "a way to feel the vibrations" and later "feel the vibrations of the deep" recycles construction. Figurative language ("rogue wave," "skeletal remains stretching endlessly") remains coherent and voice-appropriate. Opening and closing lines effectively frame the revelation arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—drowned-world monitoring station investigating vanished coastal features—feels fresh through specific synthesis: super-coral mutating to anchor on calcium-rich concrete rather than generic reef recovery. The "periodically eternal" concept transforms familiar climate-fiction tropes by literalizing regeneration through the ruins themselves. Elian's tapping-as-echolocation practice provides distinctive investigative method beyond standard sensor arrays. The inversion (life consuming infrastructure rather than infrastructure destroying life) offers non-obvious moral calculus. Risk: the story commits to procedural revelation over dramatic confrontation, trusting data assembly to carry emotional weight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian as "coral bleaching witness" appears in setup (childhood memory of rot and white skeletal reefs) and shapes his dismissal of "periodically eternal" optimism, creating friction that the ending resolves. His witnessing directly motivates present investigation. The trait enables the final realization's emotional charge: he can recognize rebirth because he saw death. Two beats (memory reflection, closure reweighting) plus causal pressure on interpretation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atlas page introduced early ("jagged paper edge bisecting a coastline that no longer existed physically"), handled mid-story when Elian works at console "where...the atlas page torn out from a grandfather's library" lies, and returns at closure when he "traced the phantom line of the road on the torn atlas page, then looked up at the glowing resurrection." Three distinct beats; the paper's physical presence anchors lost geography against discovered transformation. The torn edge detail and "grandfather's library" provenance add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" structures the entire narrative: months of sensor confusion precede Elian's decision to assemble composite data tonight, weeks of gathered material converge in the holographic image, and the realization hits "with the force of a rogue wave" only after adjustment and sharpening. The concept shapes tactics (manual echolocation, hydrophone layering to "penetrate the silt layers") and defines closure as knowledge transformation. The delay creates earned cost: Elian's assumptions about erasure persist until visual proof forces reinterpretation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears in the middle third as archive phrase Elian reads, enabling his initial dismissal ("always dismissed it as poetic optimism"), then directly articulates the closure mechanism: "The 'periodically eternal' nature of the ocean had triggered a cycle he hadn't predicted." The attribute enables the super-coral explanation and charges the final image of resurrection. Two beats (introduction with stance, payoff at revelation) plus clear causal role, though late first appearance limits higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Assemble" governs the climactic beat: "Tonight, Elian intended to finally assemble the weeks of seismic and acoustic data" initiates action; "His fingers flew across the terminal, weaving the sonic echoes into a visual mesh" dramatizes the process; the holographic image "coalescing into a three-dimensional topography" delivers result. The action is irreplaceable—no substitute method would preserve the procedural texture or the progression from confusion to clarity. Setup, execution, and payoff all present; the assembly directly produces the mountain-range discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tapping practice appears in opening beat ("maintained a disciplined practice of tapping rhythms on surfaces, his knuckles rapping out a complex, syncopated code") as "manual form of echolocation" and contributes to data assembly ("weeks of seismic and acoustic data he had gathered through his rhythmic tapping and the station's hydrophones"). Setup and development present, but the method's specific contribution remains general; the hydrophones could plausibly achieve the same result. The practice characterizes Elian but doesn't constrain or enable a unique choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Monitoring station grounded immediately ("groaned in the twilight, a solitary metallic buoy tethered to a drowned world") and supplies essential resources: the control room's bulkhead for listening, the workstation with holographic projector, the station's hydrophones and scanners. The setting's function—sea level monitoring in post-ban stabilized climate—frames the investigation's legitimacy. The confined space ("cramped control room") and isolation pressure Elian's solo data work. Station enables discovery method and shapes closure by providing the technical apparatus for revelation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" establishes timeframe in paragraph two, creating context for "skies clearing and the chaotic weather patterns stabilizing" while "oceans had retained their swollen, heavy mass." The ban's timing—late enough that warming persisted—enables the super-coral mutation narrative. The post-ban world constrains explanation options: the reef adapted "to conditions the ban had come too late to prevent." Present in setup and closure reasoning, though not actively tracked as ticking pressure during the investigation itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover why some paths disappear entirely from the modern sonar charts while others remain as ghostly outlines" is explicit and drives present action: months of sensor monitoring, tonight's assembly decision, adjustment of resolution to sharpen structures. The coastal road "should have been visible...but for months, the sensors reported only a flat, confusing void" creates friction between expectation and data. Discovery answers the question with reweighted stakes: paths don't disappear through erasure but through transformation. Desire dramatized through sustained investigation with visible cost (isolation, months of work).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" opens the story ("His existence here felt defined by the sensation of being drifting moored, secured by heavy chains to the seabed yet forever swaying") and modulates through procedural focus to discovery wonder. The tone—suspension between past loss and uncertain present—charges the final image when fixed certainty (road gone) transforms into dynamic vitality (coral fortress). Coherent through turns; the contradictory stability/motion mirrors the "periodically eternal" concept and Elian's shift from expecting emptiness to recognizing eruption.</comment>
