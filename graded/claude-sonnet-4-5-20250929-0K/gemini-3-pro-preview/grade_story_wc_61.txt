<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Xylos is established early as a sentimentalist who mourns particles and names dying stars, providing clear interior texture. The motivation to fix the machine and break the burning pattern drives the action coherently. However, interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("sorrow vast enough to fill the void") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, and the final loneliness feels asserted more than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sonar navigation, the gear's fractal properties, and the garden's phosphorescent transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Xylos achieves his goal yet realizes he has rendered his own purpose obsolete, a felt cost visible in "profound, unexpected loneliness" and "the end of his purpose." Orientation anchors who/where/what by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gear catches and the garden glows cold instead of burning, reweighting the ancestral burning pattern with a visible alternative and a conceptual price (obsolescence of mourning).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and purposeful: "ribboned expanse," "violet dark," "freezing plasma drifting," all filtered through Xylos's sentimental lens. Sonar pinging and the crystallized hydrogen stalks constrain navigation choices. The rusted axle and the gear's fractal edge charge the closure image by enabling cold light. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the transit and installation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and tightens through the perilous transit and gear installation. The fit is "visibly imperfect," raising doubt before the gear catches, a micro-turn that narrows options. The garden's glow represents a meaningful choice-driven outcome, and the cost (Xylos's obsolescence) is legible on the page. One substantive pressure point is present; escalation is modest but sufficient under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—breaking destructive generational cycles—emerges organically from the gear, the Ancestors' burning, and Xylos's alternative method. The cold light answers the central question (light without fire) through a non-literal image rather than a thesis statement. The final loneliness complicates the resolution: success renders mourning obsolete, a resonant ambiguity. "Troubling serenity" brackets the piece and reweights at closure ("now illuminated in pale blue"), charging the ending without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Xylos mourns atoms, assigns names to stars, views the gear as a parent's heart. Diction is elevated and poetic ("ribboned expanse," "mournful note," "bioluminescent phosphorescence"), matching the cosmic scope and sentimentalist lens. No dialogue. Register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("inescapable weight of generational patterns") but remains within the focalizer's idiom. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but density suffers from synonym loops and near-paraphrase: "beautiful but terrifyingly silent" / "absolute stillness created a troubling serenity"; "heavy, brass calculating machine gear" / "the heart of a parent that had stopped beating too soon" restates burden as metaphor without adding causal pressure. Template openings recur ("He had reached," "He had finally broken"). Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching, trending toward overwriting in the middle third. Clarity remains high, but propulsion lags under decorative load. Baseline artifact penalty −0.6 for loops and stem repetition; additional −0.3 for figurative saturation in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic scale, fractal mechanics, and generational repair is specific and coherent. "Cold light" as mathematical friction rather than combustion offers a fresh inflection on creation myths. The protagonist's obsolescence after achieving his goal is non-obvious and earned. However, the "Ancestors as cold logicians who forgot to wind the clockwork" and "children repairing fathers' errors" are recognizable templates, mitigated but not fully transformed by the fractal-gear detail and phosphorescent outcome.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Xylos (otherworldly sentimentalist) is present from the opening, mourns particles and names stars, and makes the key choice to install the gear. His sentimental stance drives the entire transit and shapes the closure (mourning rendered obsolete). The trait is causally active across beats and charges the ending's loneliness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The calculating machine gear is clutched at the start, described as relic and heart, aligned with the axle in the climax, and its fractal edge enables the final transformation. It appears in three distinct beats (carry, alignment, turn) and is indispensable to closure. The gear's fractal property bridges finite/infinite, a specific irreplaceable mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generational patterns (children repairing fathers' catastrophic errors) are stated early, frame the motivation, and resolve when Xylos breaks the burning cycle. The concept shapes the dominant stake and is visible in the closure (ending the Ancestors' method). However, it is told more than dramatized; no on-page friction between inherited method and new choice beyond the stated contrast.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" (fractal edge spiraling inward beyond microscopic sight) is signaled when Xylos aligns the gear and is causally essential: it bridges the gap between finite machine and endless garden, enabling energy multiplication. The attribute constrains the fit ("visibly imperfect") and enables the phosphorescent outcome. Present in two beats (alignment, energy transfer) with clear mechanical payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transit structures the entire narrative: Xylos floats through the garden, navigates debris, reaches the axle, installs the gear. Every major turn (sonar mapping, shedding petals, gear installation, glow spreading) occurs during or as a result of this action. Removing transit would eliminate the story's arc. The perilous nature and "long" duration tighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced early ("rhythmic, low-frequency"), used to map the path ("sound returned...as complex geometric shapes"), and returns as "sharp, metallic reverence" at the axle. The method constrains navigation through blinding fog and is specific to Xylos's non-burning approach. Present in two navigation beats and essential to reaching the closure site.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The nebula garden is the frame, obstacle, and beneficiary: ionized clouds obscure vision, crystallized hydrogen stalks constrain the path, shedding plasma marks time, and the garden's transformation to cold glow is the climax. Setting pressures every choice and supplies the closure image. Micro-setting (body in vacuum, sonar reliance) also constrains tactics. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is poetic but vague; elapsed time is not tracked in a way that tightens decisions. The timeframe evokes drift and decay, supporting tone, but does not create urgency or alter tactics. Present as atmosphere in the transit middle section and the ending, but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation (share light without fire) is stated early, dramatized through the gear installation, tested against the imperfect fit, and resolved when cold light spreads. It drives every beat and the closure cost (obsolescence). The friction between achieving the goal and losing purpose is visible on the page. Causally indispensable and charged at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" is introduced in paragraph three ("absolute stillness created a troubling serenity, a peace that felt closer to a tomb"), modulates through the quiet transit and cosmic decay, and returns charged in the final line ("troubling serenity returned, now illuminated in pale blue"). Tone supports the sentimentalist lens, contrasts with violent burning, and reweights at closure when serenity becomes the product of success rather than decay. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
