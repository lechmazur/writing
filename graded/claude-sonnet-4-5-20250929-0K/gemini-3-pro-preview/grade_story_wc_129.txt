<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to join the community is clear and sustained, and her sympathetic response to the injured boy creates a credible turning point. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract emotional labels—"luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final grafting feels more asserted than earned through visible internal struggle; we see the gesture but not the cost of what she surrenders or risks in wrapping her fragile art around their permanence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a single-POV accumulative structure: Elara's search culminates in the woven-reed offering that secures communal acceptance. Orientation anchors (post-verbal world, crystalline orchard, crater's edge) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—kinship thread wrapping her heart—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The phrase "she was finally home" tells rather than shows the reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and marsh reeds supply vivid sensory contrast (translucent chimes vs. light-drinking glass vs. organic decay). Spatial choreography is coherent across the crater's lip, the fracture, and the arbor. The reeds constrain Elara's final choice—she must use her softer medium to bridge the gap—and the arbor becomes the canvas for closure, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Minor descriptor recycling ("glimmering," "shimmering") and the vague timeframe slightly dilute specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (grafting onto community) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Elara's compassionate intervention with the boy is a meaningful micro-turn that softens the group, and her woven offering at the arbor tightens the bond. Yet the escalation is linear without a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative: no tactic fails, no resource is spent that alters later moves. The final acceptance feels awarded rather than fought for, lowering the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—integration through contrast, softness wrapping hardness—emerges organically from the marsh-reed/obsidian juxtaposition and avoids overt moralizing. The final image of woven grass coating volcanic glass is resonant and non-literal. However, phrases like "bridge between the soft and the hard, the fleeting and the eternal" risk abstraction, and the thematic question is answered cleanly without ambiguity or counter-reading, resulting in satisfying but somewhat tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register appropriate to the post-verbal setting. Diction is consistent—"faceted bark," "razor-dust," "tactile communion"—but leans toward poetic abstraction rather than Elara's embodied perceptual signature. Sentence stems show some template cadence ("She was," "She did," "She took"), and the phrase "boldly sympathetic" reads as external characterization rather than an interior contradiction she navigates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong visual imagery (quartz trees, obsidian arbor, dried stalks). However, figurative density peaks in exposition—"luminescent ache," "invisible, impenetrable webs," "vibrated, extending a thread"—where metaphor stacks without concrete action anchors. Paraphrase appears: "not by mimicking their hardness, but by wrapping it in her own bold sympathy" restates the prior image. Light template cadence and modifier stacks ("soft, organic decay"; "tight-knit group of locals") reduce propulsion in high-concept beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-verbal world premise is distinctive, and the marsh-reed sculptor grafting onto a crystalline society offers a fresh symbolic synthesis. The street-artist tag hidden in volcanic glass layers archaeological rebellion into the ritual, avoiding generic belonging plots. The ending image—organic reeds caging ancient vandalism—feels purposeful rather than assembled. Minor template elements (the injured child as entry point, the tactile communion sequence) slightly dilute originality, but the conceptual fusion remains specific and memorable.</comment>
