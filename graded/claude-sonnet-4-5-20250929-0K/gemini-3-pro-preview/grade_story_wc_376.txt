<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's somatic wilting attribute is embodied concretely and drives two key beats (the Governor's broadcast, the clerk's lie), forcing micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to find lost conversations is established early and sustained through action. The clerk's shift from deception to candor feels earned by witnessing her physical distress, though his interior remains thin. The final turn—using gold ink to circulate truth on leaves—arrives as declaration rather than a choice tested under competing pressures, limiting felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Causal: map → descent → clerk's lie → plate reveal → decision to repurpose her craft. Orientation anchors quickly (Veridium, workbench, Elara's role). The closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (beauty to resistance), visible on the page when she "looked at the clerk, then down at the plate, knowing that her gold ink would no longer be used for decoration." One meaningful tightening occurs when the clerk's candor unlocks the plate. The ending choice feels inevitable in hindsight but is told rather than dramatized as a live decision under competing pulls, capping the band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, hydroponic lines, and sub-basement are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mildew, old ink, mossy wall). The zinc plate's tactile weight and raised backward text ground the climax. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (workbench → streets → service entrance → caged counter). The plate constrains Elara's reading (she must "focus intensely" and reread), directly shaping the closure beat and charging the final image of leaves as carriers—an elegant micro-setting payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the repository of silence—is signaled early and sustained. The Governor's broadcast and clerk's deception provide two pressure points that test Elara's wilting attribute, narrowing her options and confirming systemic betrayal. The plate revelation escalates stakes from personal quest to systemic exposure. However, the final decision to "slip this truth onto the leaves" lacks on-page cost legibility: no hesitation, tradeoff, or visible price is dramatized, only asserted. The tightening is present but the closure cost remains conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth's physical cost and the permanence of lies—emerges through the wilting attribute, the zinc plate as material evidence, and the choice to repurpose beauty for resistance. The plate's backward raised text requiring rereading is a purposeful non-literal answer to "where lost conversations go": they are etched, inverted, awaiting legibility. Subtext operates in the clerk's horror and Elara's immediate bodily grammar of dishonesty. The ending image of natural circulation vs. erasure reweights the opening's decorative gilding without moralizing. Minor slip: "candor in small moments that turned the tide" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature (gilding metaphors, attention to shimmer and permanence) is present but underdeveloped. The clerk's brief dialogue ("There is nothing here but dust" / "I am guarding the plates") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Register remains clean except for one late slip: "systemic erasures carved into zinc" reads as retrospective summary rather than Elara's immediate thought under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Diction is purposeful, though some figurative language ("bruise-colored haze," "overgrave streets") trends decorative without tightening pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is mostly strong. Information density is high in the plate-reading beat. However, the final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "lost conversations were not just whispers; they were systemic erasures" restates the plate's content without advancing pressure, and "knowing that her gold ink would no longer be used for decoration" summarizes the choice rather than dramatizing it. "Overgrave" (paragraph 3) reads as a typo or neologism without context. Minor figurative muddle: "sickening drain in her chest" followed by "knees buckling" and "edges of her vision grayed" stacks bodily metaphors without fresh specificity. No major loops elsewhere; clarity is maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The somatic wilting attribute is a fresh, non-obvious mechanic that externalizes dishonesty's cost and drives two key beats. The zinc postal plate as material evidence of systemic erasure offers a specific synthesis of archive horror and bureaucratic suppression. The notion of circulating truth on plant leaves via gold ink is imaginative and rooted in Elara's craft. However, the greenhouse city under toxic sky and the "lost conversations" repository lean toward familiar dystopian templates (water scarcity, sealed archives, silenced warnings). The ending choice, while thematically coherent, is declared rather than earned through a dramatized risk or tradeoff, limiting ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, driving the descent and confrontation. Her choices (piecing the map, demanding access, interpreting the plate) create key turns. The final decision to repurpose her ink is a meaningful alteration of her role, though it is declared rather than tested under competing pressures. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage are all strong; the score reflects that the ending choice lacks visible on-page cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The zinc plate fragment is introduced at the structural midpoint (the clerk's drawer), handled concretely ("cold metal in her hands, tilting it to catch the dim light"), and its raised backward text constrains Elara's reading, forcing her to "focus intensely" and reread—two distinct on-page beats. Its content (the evacuation order) drives the final choice. Strong causal pressure, specificity (zinc-etched, jagged, ink-stained), and closure linkage. The plate's mechanics matter and its revelation reweights the premise. Minor gap: it appears late (second half) rather than seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept—"candor in small moments"—is dramatized in the clerk's shift from deception to truth after witnessing Elara's physical collapse. That beat is the story's pivot and is rendered concretely on the page. However, the phrase "candor in small moments that turned the tide" appears as an authorial summary rather than emerging purely from scene pressure, and the concept is not signaled or explored earlier. It shapes one key turn but does not recur or accumulate pressure across multiple beats, limiting integration depth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wilting-near-dishonesty attribute is introduced early (Governor's broadcast, paragraph 3), constrains two on-page actions with visible bodily cost (buckling, bruising, wheeze, color drain), and enables the clerk's candor by forcing him to witness her deterioration. It is causally active, specific, and shapes both escalation and the plate's revelation. The attribute is indispensable: without it, the clerk has no reason to drop his pretense. Strong setup, development, and payoff with felt cost at each appearance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The reread occurs on-page in the plate-reading beat: "She read the message once, her heart pounding, and then, unable to believe the magnitude of the revelation, she was forced to reread the metal script." It serves a causal function (confirming the evacuation order's enormity) and is tied to the plate's backward raised text. However, the action is brief, does not recur, and could be replaced with "studied closely" or "absorbed the full meaning" without major structural loss. It charges one moment but does not shape multiple beats or the final image directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shredded treasure map is mentioned in the opening as backstory ("spent weeks painstakingly working by piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards") and reappears once as "the patchwork map" when Elara reaches the service entrance. It enables the descent but its mechanics (how she pieced it, what it looked like, how floorboards mattered) are told rather than shown. The method does not constrain any on-page choice or recur with reweighted meaning; it functions as a static enabler. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is signaled early with vivid detail (bruise-colored haze, sickly yellow light, hydroponic lines failing, mossy wall) and establishes the dying-world stakes. The sub-basement setting (mildew, old ink, caged counter) grounds the confrontation. The humid overgrave streets provide context for the Governor's broadcast. However, setting does not directly alter Elara's tactics or choices; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The final image of leaves as carriers of truth links setting to closure conceptually but does not constrain the decision. Two-gate presence (setup, closure accent) with causal involvement at one beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the oasis dries"—is established in the opening and provides the premise (water vanished, city withering, three-month-old evacuation order). It shapes stakes (dying world) but does not function as a live clock or tighten decisions on the page. Elara's journey from workbench to sub-basement feels untracked in elapsed time, and the ending choice carries no temporal pressure. The timeframe is context rather than constraint, present in setup and closure framing but not development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find where lost conversations go"—is signaled early, framed as a "desperate, private mission," and sustained through her map work, descent, and confrontation with the clerk. The plate revelation directly answers her question (conversations are etched postal warnings), and her final choice repurposes her craft to restore them. The motivation drives all major beats and is tied to closure. Minor friction: it is somewhat abstract and lacks on-page conflict with a competing desire (e.g., safety, compliance), limiting felt cost at the ending.</comment>
