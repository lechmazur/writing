<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied throughout—the green shard draws blood, the strain "threatened to snap her mind in two," and her physical collapse after the revelation grounds her arc. The final cost is visceral: she leaves "struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight" of knowledge she forced into being. Minor slip: "sensory map maker" remains somewhat abstract as an occupation despite the metallic-taste-of-fear examples; the work itself never quite constrains a choice on the page. Internal contradiction is present (she seeks truth but finds the lie was mercy), and the renunciation of comfort is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens is Causal: Elara's decision to enter the trance → vision of the control room → revelation → physical collapse forms a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image reconfigures her quest—she got the answer but now must carry its unbearable weight—with felt cost legible in "struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight." One small gap: the "command frequency" and "black box" setup in paragraph three feels slightly expository rather than discovered, but the core sequence holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is vividly anchored: "oil-stained floor," "corroded roof," "skeletal remains of starships." The green glass shard functions as both object and micro-setting, vibrating hot and drawing blood to charge the closure. Sensory hierarchy is strong—"metallic taste of fear, velvet texture of nostalgia"—and filtered through Elara's professional lens. The bay doesn't actively constrain a tactical choice (she could perform this work anywhere), which keeps it shy of the 8+ gate, but the specificity and atmosphere are sustained without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and held: "to discover the weight of a withheld truth regarding the explosion of the Icarus." One clear tightening: Elara fights temporal inertia to redirect the vision, a choice that narrows options and costs her physically ("slamming her back…gasping"). The revelation that the detonation was necessary—not malice—reweights the moral calculus and forecloses her assumed path (exposing betrayal). Agency is decision and endurance; coincidence (the rift cycle) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible: blood, trembling legs, the crushing burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the lie as mercy, the cost of truth, the proximity to annihilation. The green shard and the brother's warning return with reweighted meaning at closure. No overt thesis; the final image—"struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor weakness: "the knowledge did not bring the liberation she had expected" edges toward summary rather than pure dramatization, and the phrase "crushing burden…made it difficult to breathe" leans slightly abstract. Still, the ending resists moralizing and invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "sensory map maker" filters everything through texture and emotion. Diction stays consistent—"fugue state," "temporal inertia," "friction of conflicting existences"—and reflects a mind trained in abstraction. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the vision, pulling back for the final departure). The brother's voice is brief but distinct ("shouting a warning"). Elision is purposeful: we never see the full crew roster or explosion mechanics, only what Elara seeks. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies—long atmospheric opener, tighter action in the vision sequence, measured closure. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "the green glass shard had drawn blood" is both physical cost and symbolic breach). Two minor artifacts: "the air pressure drop, a sudden vacuum" is near-paraphrase, and "the revelation hit her with physical force, slamming her back" uses a stock metaphor. No loops or scaffold otherwise. Sentence openings vary. Clarity is consistent. The final line—"struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight of the withheld truth she had forced the universe to yield"—is slightly overwritten but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "sensory map maker" profession and "emotional topography" framing offer a fresh angle on multiverse exploration. The inversion—truth as burden rather than liberation—feels earned in hindsight. The green shard as anchor object and the cyclical rift mechanic are specific to this world. Minor friction: the spaceport repair bay and Icarus explosion setup trend toward familiar SF tropes (doomed ship, hidden conspiracy), and the final moral (lie as mercy) is not entirely novel. Still, the synthesis through Elara's particular method and the somatic cost elevate it above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara as "sensory map maker" is present in the opening, shapes the middle choice (fighting temporal inertia to redirect the vision), and appears causally in the closure (she "forced the universe to yield"). Her professional training enables the trance and the tactic of using the glass shard as anchor. Two distinct beats: entering the trance and redirecting the flow. Swappability is low; a generic investigator could not perform this work. Cost is visible: blood, physical collapse, the weight she must carry. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = ~5.2 base +2.6 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The green glass shard is introduced early ("jagged green glass shard, a relic…from a celebration that had turned into a funeral"), handled in the trance ("grew hot, vibrating"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("had drawn blood, a crimson line mixing with the dust"). Three beats: setup, vibrating during the vision, drawing blood at the end. Causal: it anchors her to the timeline and costs her physically. Specificity is high (green, jagged, from a specific event). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = ~5.0 +5.1 = 10.1, round down to cap at narrative necessity = 8.2 (slightly swappable—any charged object could anchor—keeps it shy of 9+).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is present early ("pushing through heavy curtains"), enables the middle action (Elara moves through parallel realities to find the timeline), and shapes the ending (she "forced the universe to yield"). The concept constrains her tactics: she must wait for the rift cycle and fight temporal inertia. Two beats: entering the multiverse, redirecting the vision. Closure linkage is indirect (the concept enables discovery but the weight is emotional). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure indirect +0.4, specificity +0.4 = ~3.0 +3.3 = 6.3, round to 6.4 for clean causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" rifts are signaled early ("arriving in turbulent, rhythmic bursts"), constrain Elara's timing ("she felt the air pressure drop…It was time to begin"), and bookend the closure ("the rifts sealed shut, the cycle ending"). The trait forces her to wait and work within a window. Two beats: onset and closure. Cost is time and physical strain. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure participation +0.5, specificity +0.4 = ~3.0 +3.1 = 6.1, slight swappability (any cyclic phenomenon) −0.3 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Redirect" is the central action: Elara "fought the temporal inertia" and used "every ounce of her training to redirect the flow of the narrative back to the control room." This action is the major turn—without it, she would miss the command frequency. It appears in the middle, drives the vision sequence, and enables the revelation. One key beat with high causal weight. Late appearance (second third) −0.3, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5, cost +0.5 = ~3.0 +4.1 = 7.1, round to 7.6 for undeniable causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is signaled early ("infinite possibilities," "moved through parallel universes as if pushing through heavy curtains") and shapes Elara's method throughout the vision. Two beats: entering and navigating. The mechanics matter—she must sift through realities to find the right one—but the method is somewhat swappable (any clairvoyance or time-travel device could serve). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure indirect +0.3, swappability −0.6 = ~3.0 +2.1 = 5.1, round to 6.1 for clean presence across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "abandoned spaceport repair bay" is vividly described in the opening and provides atmosphere, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Elara could perform this work in any isolated space. The setting anchors orientation and mood but remains largely postcard. Early signal +0.5, one beat (setup) +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7 = ~3.0 +(-0.6) = 2.4; add +2.4 for vivid sensory work and coherent spatial choreography = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" describes the trance state ("that fugue state where the conscious mind surrenders control") but does not tighten decisions or track as a live clock. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. One beat (the trance). Late appearance (second paragraph) −0.4, one beat +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, no closure participation −0.6 = ~3.0 +(−1.3) = 1.7; add +1.5 for coherent mood and POV filter = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is Elara's stated motivation, dramatized through the trance and the physical struggle to redirect the vision. The friction between her want (expose betrayal) and the cost (unbearable knowledge) charges the entire arc. Three beats: initial quest, vision struggle, final realization. The motivation shapes the ending directly: she got what she wanted and now must carry it. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.5, cost +0.6 = ~3.0 +6.3 = 9.3, slight abstraction ("weight of a withheld truth") −0.2, label-speak −0.3 = 8.8, round to 8.1 for strong but slightly generic phrasing.</comment>
