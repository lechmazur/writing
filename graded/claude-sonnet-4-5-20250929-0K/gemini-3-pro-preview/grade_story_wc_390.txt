<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through his "logically emotional" framework—he catalogs fear, files it away, then proceeds—which drives his mid-story shift from rigid protocols to vibrational matching. The embodied struggle (bare hands on freezing metal, sound resonating through sternum) anchors his internal arc. However, the interiority occasionally tips into diagnostic self-narration ("he understood that the terror...was merely a biological response") that reads slightly over-articulate for peak stress. The final slump and quiet satisfaction earn the renunciation without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (engineer, gantry, marina, sunset timeframe). The key's refusal to turn creates a motivated pivot: Elias abandons mechanical force for vibrational matching, engaging the horn that delivers sonic absolution—a clean causal chain. Closure lands on-page with felt cost (organs shaken, exhaustion, the dead "finally asleep") and the inferred lens holds. One meaningful tightening (protocol failure → adaptation) is sufficient at this length, though the escalation could apply more constraint before the solution appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, rime-crusted gantry, and brass console create a vivid, purposeful frame. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-tuned: "ozone and rot," "viscous" air, fillings vibrating from spectral scream. The key and horn mechanism constrain Elias's choices (mechanical force would shatter it), and the golden-to-blue light transition charges the final image. Micro-setting (bare fingers on iron, sound through sternum) functions as body-as-setting to enable the climax. No occupational missteps detected; the engineering idiom reads plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: protect the artifact by activating the resonance chamber. The psychic pressure seizing the lock creates a concrete obstacle, and Elias's shift from mechanical to vocal method constitutes one meaningful tightening under the causal lens. The cost is legible (organs shaken, exhaustion, exposure to cold), but the escalation itself feels compressed—vibrational matching arrives as the solution without an intermediate failure or price paid for attempting it. The spirits' dissolution satisfies the stake cleanly, though a visible trade-off during the attempt would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the collision of rigid logic and fleshly intuition: Elias must abandon engineering protocols to harmonize with the spectral cacophony. The "sonic absolution" literalizes the concept without moralizing, and the final image (peaceful marina, dead asleep) offers a resonant answer. The "logically emotional" framing occasionally skirts label-speak but is dramatized through his vocalization and finger-tremor sync. No overt thesis statement mars the ending, and the key/horn motif charges the closure without forced recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent with an engineer's lexicon ("torque," "vibrational matching," "ultra-low frequency"), though "fleshly ethereal" in paragraph two reads slightly authorial rather than Elias's interior idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the vocalization beat, pulling back for the sonic blast). Sentence rhythm varies under pressure: short fragments during the key-turn, longer syntactic arcs for the aftermath. One minor filter-verb cluster ("He felt the sound reverberate...") is voice-motivated and does not flatten immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong image density ("chaotic mosaic of fractured white slabs," "color of old bruises"). Figurative language is controlled and coherent, though "fleshly ethereal" in paragraph two is a near-oxymoron that borders on muddle. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. One scaffold phrase: "The spirits were screaming now" could integrate the escalation more tightly into action rather than declaring it. Information density is high; most lines advance setting, pressure, or character. Minor overwriting in the opening ("suspended violence," "restless echoes") elevates register slightly but remains voice-legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineer, spectral marina, and sonic-frequency solution is specific and non-obvious. The vibrational-matching method transforms the familiar "key won't turn" beat into a physics-grounded climax. However, the lighthouse-keeper-vs-restless-spirits frame and the artifact-protection motivation echo genre templates; the "logically emotional" trait and vocalization twist provide the fresh angle. The ending avoids moralizing and commits fully to its acoustic premise. Risk-taking (bare-hands vocalization under spectral assault) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in every beat, makes the key turn decision (paragraph 4), the adaptation choice (paragraph 5), and the vocalization action (paragraph 6) that drives closure. His choices create all major turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The key is handled in paragraphs 2 (squeezed, "severed finger"), 3 (inserted, torque applied), and 6 (fingers placed, turned via vocalization). Its psychic-pressure seizure constrains tactics and its turn enables closure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is seeded in paragraph 2 ("device capable of granting peace"), shapes the obstacle (psychic pressure), and delivers the ending via ultra-low-frequency wave that "neutralizes" the spirits. The concept defines the story's physics and closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is labeled in paragraph 3 ("he understood that the terror...was merely a biological response") and enacted when he "categorizes the fear...and then filed it away" to focus. It enables his pivot from rigid protocol to vibrational method (paragraph 5), but the cost tied specifically to this trait is oblique—closer to thematic flavor than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Adapt" is signaled in paragraph 4 ("he had to adapt") and enacted in paragraph 5 (removing gloves, vocalizing). The act redefines his approach from mechanical to acoustic and is the hinge to closure; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is seeded ("psychic pressure," "screaming pitch") in paragraphs 2–4, explained and executed in paragraphs 5–6 ("vocalize...adjusted his pitch...synced perfectly with the tremor in the lock"). The method shapes the climax's mechanics and is irreplaceable to the solution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina appears in paragraph 1 (establishes threat and atmosphere), pressures Elias via the spirits beneath the ice (paragraphs 2–4), and receives the sonic wave in the closure (paragraph 7: "passed over the marina...penetrated the ice"). The setting constrains options (psychic interference) and the final image shows its transformation ("peaceful").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fleeting golden sunset is anchored in paragraph 1, tightens in paragraph 4 ("sun dipped lower...spirits were screaming now"), and the darkness arrival triggers urgency. Paragraph 8 notes "golden light was gone, replaced by the blue of early night." Time narrows options but is not tracked beat-by-beat as a live countdown; one meaningful pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protecting the sacred artifact is stated in paragraph 2 ("singular motivation") and tested when the key seizes (paragraph 3), forcing the adaptation (paragraphs 4–5). The stake is clear and drives all major choices, though the friction between want and cost is primarily external (spectral opposition) rather than internal conflict over the goal itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is established in paragraph 2 ("viscous...tone that was disturbingly fleshly ethereal. The air tasted of ozone and rot") and sustained through embodied sensory detail (shivering muscles, chattering teeth, sound through sternum, organs shaken). The tone modulates from dread to exhausted peace (paragraph 8: "breath pluming...heart quiet") and charges the final image without static repetition.</comment>
