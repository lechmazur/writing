<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is consistently drawn through concrete interiority: his motives ("understand the architecture of lies") drive salvage choices, the winch work shows training embodied, and the final choice to lower evidence back down forecloses the public-exposure path with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when he possesses truth yet releases it, a renunciation that feels earned. Minor weaknesses: some descriptors veer toward label-speak ("errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval"), and his operational capability is never tested by failure—he executes flawlessly, which slightly flattens stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texturing. The salvage anchors early, escalates through winch tension and radio silence, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias lowers the evidence, foreclosing the exposure path with visible cost (he "possessed the truth now, and that was enough"). The sundial/hull-plate logic chains causally, and the radio-silence deadline tightens the window. One minor gap: the sundial's rust-fused angle and gnomon mechanics are asserted more than demonstrated—by what exact process does a bent gnomon at the "mark he had calculated" prove noon sinking?—but the closure reconfigures his relationship to the city's lies with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anchors who/where/when by line two (Elias, stern, twilight canal). The canal's oily water, brick embankments, and industrial skyline supply spatial coherence. The sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining the noon-proof choice and charging the final image when the shadow confirms his calculation. Sensory hierarchy is strong: mist "smelled of wet iron and ancient stagnation," cascading water "remarkably loud in the stillness." One missed constraint: the winch and cable tension shape tactics but the canal depth, current, or silt resistance never complicates salvage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove the *Saint Jude* sank at noon to expose the mayor's cover-up. Pressure coheres through the radio-silence deadline and the winch pull; the hull plate bent outward delivers the crucial narrowing (explosion from inside). The final choice—lowering evidence back—forecloses exposure with on-page cost: "Some legends were better left as ghosts, provided one man understood the lie." One limitation: no on-page complication tests Elias; the winch groans but never jams, the evidence surfaces cleanly, the sundial confirms exactly what he expected—escalation is psychological rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus the architecture of lies—emerges through the hull plate, sundial, and layered metaphor ("the rum was the facade, the accident was the mortar, but the murder was the foundation"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: possession without exposure, an earned refusal that makes "the magic of the history creates only nausea." Minor slip: "serene upheaval" and "thoughtfully clear" feel like prompt echoes, and the "burden of his profession" line edges toward articulated thesis. Still, the final image (lowering evidence, "enough" to know) reweights the premise without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated diction ("specific weight," "hindsight clarity is a lens") coheres with Elias's archival obsession, and the prose texture remains stable under pressure. POV is clean single-third with no head-hopping. Two frictions lower the band: (a) some constructions veer literary-performative ("a mood of serene upheaval where the physical world was hushed, but the historical narrative he was about to unearth would scream"), and (b) filter verbs cluster in early beats ("feeling the specific weight," "understood the mechanics")—acceptable for voice but slightly dulling immediacy at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, and information density is high (each paragraph advances salvage or proof). Two artifact patterns lower the score: (a) Multiple abstract intensifiers front-load early paragraphs ("specific weight," "errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear"), creating a template cadence; (b) mild paraphrase loop between "The lies were architectural in nature, layered like bricks" and the rum/mortar/foundation metaphor two lines later. The closure beat itself is clean ("He released the winch brake, lowering the evidence"), so deductions remain non-closure. No loops touch the ending, but the early template stems and synonym churn prevent entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—salvage diver exposes municipal cover-up via forensic detail—is familiar, but the sundial-as-timestamp proof and the renunciation ending (lowering evidence back) add fresh synthesis. The noon-versus-midnight reversal and the "architecture of lies" frame feel specific, and the final choice (possession without exposure) inverts typical whistleblower arcs. Minor deduction: the "errant legend seeker" and "architecture of lies" phrases read slightly prompt-derived rather than emergent from scene pressure, and the flawless execution (no failed salvage, no complication) reduces risk. Still, the ending's refusal is non-obvious and earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices create all key turns: he checks the winch, aligns the sundial, wipes the hull plate, and lowers the evidence back. Decision to salvage and decision to suppress both alter tactics and foreclose paths with visible cost. Early signal, beat involvement across salvage and climax, and closure linkage (his renunciation is the ending). Irreplaceability is moderate—another investigator could occupy the role—but his specific knowledge quest shapes the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sundial appears in three beats: introduction (paragraph 10), the rust-fused gnomon study (paragraph 14), and the climactic sun-alignment proof (paragraphs 32–34). It drives the causal chain (noon proof depends on the sundial's mark) and charges the final image ("the shadow fell across the dial's face, striking the mark he had calculated"). High irreplaceability: no other object could perform this timestamp function. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity shapes the premise ("hindsight clarity is a lens that sharpens only when one is willing to look at the darkness") and the narrative's detective structure: past evidence (sundial, hull plate) yields present proof. It constrains Elias's method (forensic reconstruction) and the ending reweights it (possession of truth is enough). Moderate causal pressure—more thematic frame than tactical engine—but it does alter options (he understands, therefore releases). Present in setup, development, and payoff, but not as muscular as object or action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once as a descriptor ("the evidence before him was thoughtfully clear, stripped of the ambiguity") and echoes in the sundial calculation, but it reads more as narrative label than a trait that constrains on-page choices. Elias's clarity enables the hull-plate interpretation, yet the attribute itself is told rather than embodied in a visible tradeoff. Present at closure but functionally passive; swappable with "methodical" or "precise" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Salvage is the story's spine: the winch pull occupies beats 16–19, the hull-plate reveal is the proof (paragraph 22), and the final lowering (paragraph 36) is the closure act. All major turns trace to salvage; removing it collapses the plot. Early signal, causal pressure across three beats, and closure linkage (the release is the renunciation). High irreplaceability and visible cost (physical labor, deadline pressure, the choice to suppress). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is signaled early (paragraph 8: "operating the controls not by the rusted digital gauges, but by training instincts that allowed him to feel the tension in the cable like a nerve ending") and recurs implicitly in the winch work and sundial alignment. It enables the salvage and shapes his method, though the mechanics remain slightly abstract—what specific training allows cable-tension reading?—so causal pressure is moderate. Present in setup and development, participates in closure via the sundial calculation. Functional but not as muscular as object or action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal anchors every beat: the mist and oily water frame the salvage, the brick embankments echo the winch groan, and the canal's stillness contrasts the rising debris. The setting supplies the wreck's location and the radio silence's relevance (localized transmitter), thus pressuring the deadline. The industrial skyline marks the sunrise that triggers the sundial proof. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage (sun angle depends on canal geography). Could be more muscular—depth or current never complicates salvage—but it shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The radio-silence deadline appears in paragraph 19 ("marked not by a ticking clock, but by the silence of morning radio") and triggers the mid-beat urgency (paragraph 21: "his window for illicit discovery was closing"). The silence arrives on-page (paragraph 30: "The static on the radio abruptly cut out"), tightening the final moves and forcing the sundial proof before daylight exposes him. Early signal, causal pressure (narrows window), and closure participation (the sunrise marks the proof moment). High specificity—swapping to a watch would lose the localized-transmitter flavor—and visible cost (exposure risk).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to understand the architecture of lies" is declared early (paragraph 3) and drives all choices: salvage, forensic proof, and the final renunciation. Friction appears in the ending: possessing truth conflicts with exposing it, and he chooses suppression with visible cost ("Some legends were better left as ghosts, provided one man understood the lie"). The motivation is dramatized in the hull-plate wipe and sundial alignment, and the cost is legible in the final image (lowering evidence back). Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is introduced explicitly (paragraph 7: "The atmosphere on the deck felt contradictory, a mood of serene upheaval") and recurs at the climax (paragraph 35: "The serene upheaval peaked within him; the water remained glass-smooth, but the accepted history of the city had just been inverted in his mind"). The tone modulates with pressure: stillness frames rising tension, then the radio silence creates suspension. It charges the final image (calm water, submerged evidence, internal inversion). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage all present, though the label-phrase itself reads slightly externalized rather than fully embodied in syntax and rhythm.</comment>
