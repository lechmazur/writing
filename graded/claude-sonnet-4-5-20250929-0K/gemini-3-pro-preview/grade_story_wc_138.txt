<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation—"a desperate, clawing need to discover what happens after goodbye"—is clear and intensifies toward the ritual. Interiority carries conceptual weight ("bored immortal," "eroded by...memories") but leans toward abstraction; embodied contradictions are present in his welcoming of hostility yet remain largely told. The final renunciation (stepping into dissolution) is earned by prior setup, though the arc privileges philosophical stance over micro-choices under pressure. Internal voice is consistent but elevated throughout, lacking friction or degradation under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through density and conceptual layering (pocket dimension rejection, magnetic drilling, artifact weeping) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian's realization that "the 'after' was not a place...but a frequency" and his step into dissolution. Closure lands with felt cost (physical dissolution, consciousness fraying) and reweights the opening boredom. Orientation anchors (cross-legged, prismatic escondite, solar storm) arrive early. One meaningful deepening (the fissure opening, revealing cessation of geometry) narrows options and charges the final act. Causality remains motivated under accumulative logic; no breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite—kaleidoscope of refracted light, walls warping, floor becoming rolling glass—constrains Elian's action by rejecting his presence (spatial mutiny) and supplies the metaphysical walls he breaches. The solar storm functions as both timeframe and environmental pressure, bathing the exterior in lethal radiation and forcing the breach. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (suppressed resonance, hushed thunder, black smoke) and filtered through dimensional awareness. The fragment's physical dissolution and the fissure's "cessation of geometry" charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting actively shapes the ritual and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering what happens after goodbye. The spatial mutiny and solar storm apply external pressure; Elian's agency drives escalation by dragging magnetic fields through the shielding, applying torque, and cracking the fragment. The ritual constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options (the dimension tries to eject him; he persists) and a decisive deepening when the fissure opens, revealing "cessation of geometry" rather than a landscape. The final step into dissolution forecloses the observer stance with visible cost (atom-by-atom unraveling). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the cost is unmistakable. One credible reversal (fragment cracks, fissure opens) alters tactics and leads to resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—what lies beyond farewell, the nature of endings—emerges through the ritual and the realization that goodbye is "reintegration into raw energy." The fragment, fissure, and final dissolution function as concrete anchors. However, several lines approach direct statement: "the 'after' was not a place...but a frequency"; "The goodbye was not an exit, but a reintegration"; "he finally understood the terrible beauty of the finale." These quasi-epiphanic declarations reduce subtext and edge toward moralizing. The final image (stepping into silence) carries resonance, but the prior articulation undercuts interpretive openness. Theme is coherent but partially overwritten.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and conceptual ("impossible geometry," "metaphysical walls," "cessation of geometry"), fitting an immortal's register but uniform across emotional peaks—no degradation or compression under stress. Perceptual signature (dimensional awareness, seeing fourth and fifth planes) is specific. Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects the mind of the focalizer but does not modulate rhythmically with rising pressure; syntactic patterns remain steady. Purposeful elision (e.g., "he realized then") is taught by the reflective mode, though some filter verbs ("recognized," "welcomed," "realized") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is high; no causality breaks. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, several template stems recur: "He [verb]" in sequential lines (paragraphs 14–16: "He reached out," "He worked," "He applied," "He looked," "He realized"). Figurative density is heavy throughout ("kaleidoscope of refracted light," "rolling sea of glass," "layers of wet silk") without pattern-teaching or payoff that differentiates peak from setup. Stock metaphor ("cancer of this forbidden ritual") and filter verbs ("recognized," "welcomed," "realized") in mid-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs on spatial mutiny repeat the rejection concept. Artifact spread touches multiple beats; apply −1.0 and disallow 9+ globally per the tightened Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of bored immortal, pocket dimension rejection, and solar-storm-assisted breach is specific and non-obvious. The realization that goodbye is "reintegration into raw energy" reframes the opening ennui. However, the immortal-seeks-death-or-transcendence arc is a familiar template, and the transformation relies heavily on told insight rather than embodied discovery. The "cessation of geometry" image is fresh; the magnetic-field method and dimensional awareness add texture. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, reflective) is present but does not fundamentally alter stakes. Proximity to philosophical SF tropes (transcendence, voluntary dissolution) is close. Apply derivative-premise adjustment −0.6 within band; strong specificity prevents deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bored immortal: present in opening ("bored immortal, spirit eroded"), motivates the ritual (discover what happens after goodbye), and drives all middle beats (dragging magnetic fields, applying torque, stepping into fissure). His choice to welcome hostility and step into dissolution creates the key turn and closure. Causal pressure, beat involvement (setup, middle agency, closure), and cost connection all present. Irreplaceable: the immortal's unending life is the anomaly the dimension rejects, anchoring the spatial mutiny. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, cost. No frictions beyond minor late-paragraph summary of realization. Score: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cursed amulet fragment: introduced early (paragraph 9), used in two beats (weeping black smoke under magnetic pressure, cracking with emotional sound), and dissolves at closure ("purpose fulfilled, leaving his hand empty"). The fragment anchors souls and functions as "a handle to a door"; Elian applies magnetic torque to it, forcing the breach. Causal pressure and closure linkage present. However, the fragment's dissolution is summary-only in one line, and its cursed properties (anchoring souls) are mentioned but not directly tested. Beat involvement: two distinct uses. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage. Minor summary-only penalty −0.3. Score: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny: introduced early (paragraph 6, "early symptoms"), sustained through middle beats (dimension rejecting presence, coordinates trying to eject, floor becoming rolling sea, walls shattering), and reaches crescendo at closure as the universe tries to excise the ritual. The mutiny provides necessary pressure for Elian's intrigue and shapes his tactics (he uses the instability to force the breach). Causal pressure across three beats, closure linkage, cost connection (the dimension's hostility charges the final collapse). Early signal, irreplaceability (the mutiny is the mechanism for the apocalypse trick), cost tied to element. Score: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware: mentioned in paragraph 17 ("Because he was dimensionally aware, he could see the fabric of space...perceiving the fourth and fifth planes"). Enables one on-page action (seeing the spatial resistance and adjusting the drill) and informs his method. However, the trait is label-only in that single paragraph; no earlier signal, no visible tradeoff or cost tied to the awareness itself. It functions as a capability rather than a constraint. One beat, causal enablement, but late first appearance (past midpoint) and no cost. Late penalty −0.4, label-only −0.3. Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Intrigue: stated as "his intrigue" (paragraph 8), explained as "tricking the universe into thinking the apocalypse had arrived" (paragraph 20), and drives the entire ritual sequence. Major turns trace to this action: dragging magnetic fields, drilling through walls, cracking the fragment, opening the fissure. The intrigue is the plan that structures all middle beats and leads to closure. Early signal (paragraph 8, though the word "intrigue" is somewhat abstract), three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Minor abstraction in labeling the action as "intrigue" rather than a concrete verb; otherwise irreplaceable. Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Through magnetic fields: introduced in paragraph 15 ("dragging the invisible lines of the solar storm"), sustained in paragraph 16 ("twisting the torrents of charged particles"), paragraph 19 ("driving the magnetic pressure into the cursed amulet fragment"), paragraph 22 ("ripping the electrons from the air"), and paragraph 32 ("allowing the magnetic fields to unravel his physical form"). The method shapes all middle attempts and the final dissolution. Early signal, three distinct beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability (the solar storm's magnetic fields are the force he uses). Cost tied to method (unraveling). Score: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite: present in opening (paragraph 1, "impossible geometry," "kaleidoscope of refracted light"), described as "a prison" (paragraph 3), supplies the metaphysical walls Elian breaches (paragraph 15), undergoes spatial mutiny (paragraphs 6, 18, 25), and shatters at closure (paragraph 25, "prismatic walls shattering into dust"). The escondite pressures Elian's choices by rejecting his presence and supplies the resource (fold between seconds, shielding) he must breach. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, cost (destruction). Irreplaceable. Score: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>During a solar storm: present in opening (paragraph 4, "solar storm of historic magnitude...bathing the exterior...in lethal radiation"), sustained through middle (paragraph 15, dragging storm lines; paragraph 31, "The solar storm breached the final layer"), and provides the force Elian uses. The storm tightens decisions by supplying necessary magnitude and constrains tactics (he must work within the pocket dimension, using the storm's external energy). Early signal, two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. However, the storm is somewhat passive (Elian acts on it rather than it imposing a ticking clock on him). Cost connection present (breach at closure). Score: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>To discover what happens after goodbye: stated in paragraph 11 ("desperate, clawing need"), explained in paragraph 12 (bid farewell to lovers, enemies, empires; the destination "remained the only secret"), drives the ritual, and is answered at closure (paragraphs 28–29: goodbye is reintegration; paragraph 34: understanding the finale). The motivation is dramatized through the entire ritual sequence, conflicted by the spatial mutiny and the price (dissolution), and shapes the final choice. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, cost tied to desire (he must dissolve to learn). Slight penalty for told-only articulation of the insight at closure −0.2. Score: 7.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Hushed thunder: introduced in paragraph 5 ("pervasive tone of hushed thunder...the sky was holding its breath before a scream"), recurs in paragraph 22 ("suppression of sound grew heavier...hushed thunder pulsing"), and resolves in paragraph 35 ("The hush broke, the thunder arrived"). The tone modulates with pressure (suppression intensifies, then breaks) and charges the final image. However, "hushed thunder" is somewhat static as a descriptor; the tonal shift is present but not as dynamic as the escalation demands. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage. Coherent but mid-range modulation. Score: 6.6.</comment>
