<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (truth-seeking archivist) is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads generic at key beats—"suffocating weight of forgotten injustices" and "tears evaporating instantly" are stock gestures. The negotiation with the Scribe through debris arrangement shows agency, but the emotional arc lacks contradiction or lived-in embodiment; she moves from determined to relieved without internal friction. The final choice (preserving his legacy) feels inevitable rather than earned through competing impulses, and the diary's stakes remain abstract throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is solid (who/where/when by paragraph one). The closure unit—Elara transcribes the cipher, the Scire dissolves, lagoon solidifies—is on-page and constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (she must witness and preserve his story). However, escalation is thin: she descends, arranges symbols, he responds, she transcribes. No meaningful reversal tightens options; the Scribe's cooperation arrives without complication. The causal lens holds but the single tightening (his demand for legacy preservation) lacks friction or price that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, scorched equator, and zeppelin frame are vivid and specific. Sensory detail is purposeful: "dry heat striking her face with the force of an open oven," "viscous black fluid," "bleached ribs from long-dead beasts." The debris—bone, oxidized metal, stones—constrains Elara's solution (she cannot speak, must use physical symbols) and charges the final beat when the lagoon solidifies. Spatial choreography (gantry → surface → shoreline → extraction) tracks cleanly. The floating library, while evocative, functions only as extraction anchor and lacks pressure on her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decrypt the diary to expose the regime—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs: the Scribe demands legacy preservation in exchange for the cipher. However, this reversal lacks on-page friction; Elara nods immediately with no competing cost or moral calculus. The psychic static that prevents speech creates a problem but solving it (arranging debris) feels straightforward rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path. Escalation exists but the visible price at closure is minimal; the diary's weight is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—witness as contract, memory as justice—emerges through the debris glyphs (TRUTH, RELEASE, WITNESS) and the Scribe's dissolution after being seen. The final image (diary "heavier with the promise of justice") gestures toward thematic resonance but edges into assertion. The story resists moralizing, yet the negotiation across time is more conceptual decoration than lived ambiguity; the Scribe's cooperation is frictionless once Elara offers witness. The retrocognitive trap and obsidian lagoon carry symbolic weight but lack the particularity that would anchor theme in felt experience rather than premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Voice is consistent—elevated, archival, somber—though diction occasionally drifts into stock register: "infinite relief," "the story it had hidden was finally loud enough to be heard." No dialogue, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is present (she notices resistance symbols, debris as tools) but not character-particular; any archivist might notice these. Psychic distance holds without leaps. Free indirect style is clean, though peak beats ("tears evaporating instantly") rely on external gesture rather than interior texture under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are adequate; no major loops or causality breaks. However, several lines carry overwriting: "a searing reverie that distorted the air like a mirage" stacks metaphor without added precision; "the deafening psychic static of the loop rendered her voice useless, tearing spoken words into unintelligible shreds" paraphrases itself. Template cadence appears in the debris-arrangement sequence: "She gathered… she formed… she added…" Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching ("wrought-iron gantry," "oval shadow," "psychic resonance," "shimmering light") and some vehicles are generic ("like a physical stone," "like an open oven"). No filter-verb stacks or profound artifacts, but rhythm does not modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—retrocognitive trap + silent negotiation via symbolic arrangement—is inventive on paper, but execution leans on familiar beats: haunted place, archivist recovers lost truth, ghost trades secret for remembrance. The floating library and obsidian lagoon offer surface novelty yet function as backdrop rather than constraints that deepen the premise. The Scribe's cooperation is too smooth; no friction tests the originality of the parley. The emotional arc (determined → witnessing → extraction) tracks a template rather than transforming it through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The ending ("loud enough to be heard") is a stock closure for silenced-voices narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present in every beat and her choices (descent, debris arrangement, transcription, extraction signal) create the story's turns. However, many moves are reactive or procedural; the Scribe's demand drives the key turn, not her internal conflict. She is introduced early, involved across beats, and shapes closure by transcribing the cipher, but the role is more observer-executor than agent whose competing impulses narrow options. Present in three beats with closure linkage, but swappable with another archivist archetype without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is introduced early (paragraph one), used in three beats (descent approach, Scribe's waist-deep stance, solidification at closure), and its transformation (liquid heat → cold lifeless rock) marks the story's decisive change. Its volcanic-glass nature and viscous black fluid are specific and irreplaceable; the lagoon's boiling reaction to the Scribe's agitation and final solidification directly signal the retrocognitive trap's release. The lagoon pressures Elara's approach (she must negotiate at its edge) and its final state change charges the closure image. Strong causal and closure linkage; the element could not be swapped without breaking the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early (paragraph two: "encrypted diary discovery"), carried by Elara to the lagoon, and directly involved at closure when she transcribes the cipher onto its leather cover. It frames the journey's purpose and the final line ("heavier with the promise of justice") reprises its weight. However, the diary itself remains passive; it is the object of the quest but does not constrain her tactics or choices on-page. The cipher is the true active element, and the diary is its container. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but functionally a receptacle rather than a pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap is introduced early (paragraph three: "retrocognitively trapped in the final seconds of his life"), drives the central problem (the Scribe cannot communicate normally, his loop must be broken), and is resolved at closure when "the retrocognitive trap released its hold" and he dissolves. The attribute constrains Elara's method (she cannot simply ask; she must use symbols) and the trap's mechanics (psychic static, visual loop) shape two beats. The trap's release is the story's hinge; without this exact trait, the parley structure collapses. Indispensable to both escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Parley is signaled early ("she had to negotiate for it… initiate a parley across the barrier of time and death"), structures the middle beat (arranging debris as a negotiation language), and directly produces the closure (the Scribe mouthing the cipher in exchange for witness). The action is irreplaceable; a simple extraction or discovery would bypass the story's central tension. However, the parley itself is frictionless—one offer, one acceptance—so the dramatic cost is muted. Present across all three gates with strong causal and closure linkage, but the lack of complication within the parley caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arranging debris as messages is introduced early (paragraph five: "she began the slow, deliberate process"), used in one extended middle beat (TRUTH, RELEASE, WITNESS glyphs), and enables the Scribe's cooperation that leads to closure. The method is specific and irreplaceable (speech fails, writing on sand would not carry symbolic weight, only resistance-language symbols work). It constrains her solution and the Scribe's response. However, the method appears in only one functional beat (the arrangement sequence) and is summarized rather than dramatically tested. Strong closure linkage and specificity, but limited beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The floating library zeppelin (*Mnemosyne*) is introduced early (paragraph one) and used for extraction at closure ("signaled the *Mnemosyne* for extraction"). The setting provides framing atmosphere but does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; the library itself never appears on-page, and the zeppelin functions as transport. The descent and extraction are enabled by the airship, but any aerial or ground vehicle could serve the same purpose with minor edits. Present in setup and closure but ornamental to the story's pressure and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("immediately after the letters were found," "weeks ago") is signaled early but does not tighten decisions or tactics on-page. The journey's duration and the urgency to expose the regime are asserted, but no live clock pressures Elara's moves at the lagoon. The timeframe contextualizes her motivation but remains static backdrop; the parley unfolds without temporal constraint. Present in setup, mentioned at closure ("finally decrypt the pages"), but does not shape escalation or choices. Functional but replaceable with any post-discovery window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to uncover truth and expose the regime—is introduced early ("the view below pressed upon her chest," "encrypted diary discovery that promised to topple the current regime's sanitized narrative") and frames every choice (descent, negotiation, transcription). The motivation is dramatized through her actions and the final line ("the weight of the diary now heavier with the promise of justice"). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested; no competing desire or cost forces friction. It drives the plot but lacks internal tension or visible sacrifice that would elevate it beyond functional. Present across all gates with closure linkage but no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone—searing reverie—is established early ("the atmosphere… was thick, vibrating with a searing reverie that distorted the air like a mirage," "haunted by the psychic resonance of a massacre") and sustained through elevated diction, dream-like imagery (shimmering light, obsidian fluid, dissolving figure), and heat-as-haunting motif. The tone modulates slightly at closure (heat cools, relief replaces dread) and charges the final image. However, the reverie quality is more asserted through description than embodied in rhythm or Elara's degraded perception under stress. Coherent and purposeful, but the tone does not deepen pressure or constrain her choices; it provides atmosphere. Present across beats with closure participation but not indispensable.</comment>
