<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's professional competence is credible and her motivation is clear: to prevent future crashes through mapping invisible hazards. However, she functions primarily as an observer-documenter rather than facing contradictory impulses or making choices under pressure. The patch discovery provides a moment of embodied reflection, but no on-page dilemma forces a trade-off or forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal experience remains controlled and professional throughout, lacking the friction that would lift characterization into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation cleanly (investigator, Stacks, post-evacuation) and sustains a coherent accumulative lens: data collection intensifies understanding until the final synthesis. The closure operates as Conceptual Repricing—Elara's accumulated sensor readings transform hindsight into predictive foresight, reweighting the investigative mission with a preemptive purpose. Cost is conceptual rather than felt: the weight of future responsibility and the ghosts of past failure. The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image ("calculated near miss") recharges the opening stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Stacks are vividly rendered through rust, corrugated steel, shifting mud, and narrow slit-sky, grounding the aerodynamic volatility in tactile detail. The setting supplies real constraints: anemometer placement, ladder climb to impact zone, buckling hinges that wedge the patch. The fog and "labored breathing of a dying giant" establish tone and pressure without ornament. The environment shapes Elara's tactical choices (sensor placement at critical junctions) and charges the final image (descending into gloom), meeting the 9+ gate for setting-driven constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping invisible wind hazards to prevent future crashes—is signaled early and tightens through sensor data that narrows causality from "pilot fatigue or sudden gust" to "singular convergence." The patch discovery deepens emotional weight without reversing pressure. However, Elara faces no on-page dilemma or trade-off; her data collection proceeds unimpeded. The escalation is conceptual (understanding deepens) rather than a choice that forecloses options. Cost is implied in her responsibility for future lives but not viscerally felt on the page, limiting entry to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: invisible forces, chaotic architecture as trap, hindsight converted to foresight. The flight engineer's patch anchors abstract physics in human loss without stating a moral. The final image—"turning a destined crash into a calculated near miss"—reweights the investigative mission as preemptive strike against probability, offering a resonant non-literal answer to the central question (how to prevent future tragedy). The conceptual cost is undeniable: carrying the knowledge means bearing responsibility for every future convergence. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: technical precision tempered by lyric register ("ghostly, indistinct walls," "song of warning"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from investigator idiom—"cultivation of foresight in action" and "preemptive strike against future probability" read writerly rather than character-particular at peak moments. The perceptual signature (aerodynamic focus, sensor readings) is consistent. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph serves closure, but the register fluctuation in high-pressure beats prevents entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, and information density is high. However, several figurative constructions in high-pressure beats risk overwriting: "predatory vortices," "chaotic geology," "singing a song of warning." The phrase "rapidly adapting to the slightest structural change" is told rather than shown through sensor feedback. Paragraph five contains mild paraphrase loop: "invisible hazards" and "predictive models" restate the foresight mission without added pressure. Template cadence appears in "She pulled out... She wanted... She descended..." No scaffolding obscures causality, but the density of metaphor and summary moments in technical beats caps the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of accident investigation, wind-pattern mapping in an abandoned shipping-container maze, and the flight engineer's patch is specific and non-generic. The "singular convergence" concept—multiple vectors arriving at one catastrophic point—feels fresh when applied to aerodynamic failure. However, the investigator-as-observer frame and the posthumous-analysis structure are familiar; emotional arc and stakes follow predictable paths. The piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks, and the final insight (turning hindsight into foresight) is conceptually satisfying but not startling. Solid synthesis without the transformation or daring that would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her investigative choices (planting anemometers, climbing to impact zone, logging wind shear vector) drive the narrative arc. However, her actions are observational and documentary rather than decision-under-pressure; no key turn requires a trade-off or forecloses an option. She shapes the story's progression but does not face a dilemma that alters tactics. Setup early, involved across beats, present at closure, but lacking the causal pressure and visible cost that would lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The patch appears at the primary impact zone, is worked loose with care, grounds abstract physics in human loss, and is secured in the evidence bag at closure. Two distinct beats (discovery and logging). However, its meaning does not reweight between appearances; it functions as emotional anchor rather than evolving constraint. Present in closure but not causally active there—cameo rather than transformation. Early signal absent (arrives mid-story), lyric reprise incomplete. Solid functional integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" frames Elara's investigative conclusion: "the precise moment where rapidly shifting wind tunnel effect met exact structural weakness... multiple independent vectors of failure... at the same point in space and time." This concept shapes her final mission (preventing future convergences) and charges the closure image ("turning a destined crash into a calculated near miss"). Setup late (paragraph four), but it reweights all prior data collection retroactively and dictates the story's thematic and tactical resolution. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage elevate despite delayed introduction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" is told ("local atmosphere was rapidly adapting to the slightest structural change, twisting into new, predatory vortices") but not dramatized through sensor feedback or altered tactics. It justifies the aerodynamic hazard conceptually but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Present in setup and middle exposition, but largely ornamental—the story would function identically if the environment were static with known vortices. Label-only mention without tradeoff caps the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Survey action structures every beat: planting anemometers, climbing to impact zone, checking handheld sensor, logging vector data. The story's escalation is the deepening of survey findings toward causal synthesis. The action is irreplaceable—removing "survey" would collapse the narrative into abstract reflection. However, survey itself does not create a reversal or face opposition; it proceeds smoothly to conclusion. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage, but lack of friction or visible cost limits entry to high-7s rather than 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Wind-pattern documentation is signaled early ("documenting wind patterns between buildings") and executed through anemometer placement, handheld sensor checks, and vector logging. The method shapes every tactical move and produces the singular-convergence insight at closure. However, the mechanics remain generic—sensor placement and data logging could apply to many investigative scenarios. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); middle development is implicit rather than shown through a constrained choice. Solid functional integration without irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Stacks supply persistent constraints: "chaotic geology of corrugated steel" creates shearing forces, buckling hinges wedge the patch, rusted ladder enables the climb to impact zone, narrow slit of sky frames the final image. The labyrinth's aerodynamic volatility is the enemy Elara maps, and the "towering walls of the maze" shape her descent at closure. Setup immediate, beats throughout, closure charged by spatial metaphor. The setting is indispensable—story logic and final image would fail without this exact environment. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" anchors the timeframe in paragraph one and recurs as "the silence of the town was heavy" near closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Elara's survey proceeds without clock pressure or urgency tied to the silence. The post-evacuation setting enables solitary investigation but does not constrain choices with temporal cost. Setup present, thematic echo at closure, but no middle development or causal force. Functional atmospheric frame without pressure, mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to cultivate foresight in action"—is stated explicitly in paragraph five and dramatized through her decision to build predictive models that will guide future rescue drones. The motivation shapes her final tactical choice (logging data for future use) and charges the closure image ("turning hindsight into survival"). However, the desire faces no friction or competing want on the page; it is pursued without internal conflict or visible trade-off. Setup delayed (second half), closure participation strong, but lack of dramatized friction limits score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" is embodied throughout: fog + goggles cutting gloom, "deliberate steps... with exact, practiced care," sensors beeping rhythmic confirmation. The tone modulates with Elara's shifting focus (lyric description → technical data → human loss → conceptual synthesis) and charges the final image ("descended the ladder into the gloom, leaving the ghosts of the air currents to swirl harmlessly"). Coherent through turns, pressure-responsive, and integral to voice. Strong tonal control with purposeful register shifts elevates toward high-7s, though occasional diction drift (noted in Q6) prevents 8+.</comment>
