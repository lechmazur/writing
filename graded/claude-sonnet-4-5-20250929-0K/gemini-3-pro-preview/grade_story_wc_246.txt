<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior voice shows purposeful contradiction ("confidently uncertain," "arrogant flourish of a god" while "guessing"), and his embodied actions (unbending the nib, gripping the pen) reveal tactile engagement. However, motivation remains abstract: "thresh meaning from experience" and "editing history" are told stakes without visible personal cost or renunciation. The final satisfaction ("finally readable") reads as comfort rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elian), where (octagonal chamber, gravitational anomaly), and when (after planting wrong seeds) early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered metaphor (threshing, unbending, editing contingencies) toward the final reweighted image of "readable" history. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the text settles, history rewritten), but cost remains conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible consequence that narrows Elian's future options, only asserted satisfaction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly enables floating and channels distortion into the pen's work, constraining Elian's method. The library shelves, books, and exotic nib are handled across multiple beats (floating, unbending, tracing, glowing), and the nib's twisted then straightened state tracks cleanly. The ozone scent at the end registers environmental change. The anomaly charges the closure image (the hum, the lightened atmosphere) and makes the editing plausible within the established world logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: fix the past to prevent war and famine. Elian's unbending of the nib is a micro turn that enables the editing, and the tracing actions tighten pressure by linking distant events (supernova, dictator's wake, moth's wing). However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is one-directional—layering without reversal—and cost remains diffuse: no visible forfeiture, tactical shift, or moment where Elian must choose between competing goods. The ending lands as relief, not a price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of causality, contingency, and the arrogance of rewriting history emerges through concrete images: twisted seeds, threshing grain from chaff, editing dependency chains, impostor syndrome. The final line ("finally readable") offers a resonant, non-literal answer—order imposed on chaos—without moralizing. The pen as conduit and the gravitational anomaly as metaphor for disrupted consequence work in service of the central question: can intention redeem disaster? No prompt-echo or thematic shortcut in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and metaphor-dense ("sweet, heavy pressure," "wind that blew only from the deep past," "darkness from the room laid down as law"), creating a lyric register that matches the cosmic scale. No dialogue to judge. The perceptual signature (seeing bullets as trajectories, linking supernova to dictator) is character-specific. However, register remains uniformly high without modulation under pressure, and some filter verbs ("felt," "knew") could tighten in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent (DNA helices, threshing, spear point, purring cat). However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "sweet, heavy pressure," "fluttering their pages in a wind," "shimmered like vellum," and "ambient distortion into the narrative structure of the cosmos" stack metaphors without earned pattern. Minor paraphrase loop: "he was editing the causal chain" followed by "forcing the universe to reinterpret" restates the same action. No template cadence or loops at closure, so accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for density and coherence issues in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of history-editing-as-rewriting, gravitational anomaly as tool, and fountain pen as literal/metaphorical instrument feels specific and non-obvious. The contingent-relationships method (linking moth wing to bullet) transforms causal intervention from time-travel cliché into narrative physics. Elian's impostor stance and the threshing metaphor add fresh texture. Risk-taking in metaphor density and cosmic scale is purposeful, though the ending's comfort undercuts full boldness. The transformation test passes: plot and arc require these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout, interpreting cosmic signals (setup), unbending the pen and tracing causal lines (middle beats), and capping the pen satisfied at closure. His choices (unbend, trace, sever connections) drive the editing process and the final reweighting of history. However, his role as "signal interpreter" is asserted more than dramatized through distinct interpretive moves; the editing beats are more prominent than signal-reading. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle development is implicit. Causal pressure and closure linkage present, but swappability moderate—another cosmic role could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pen appears early (dried-up, exotic nib, twisted hook), is unbent in a key beat with tactile detail (callous of thumb, microscopic sigh), used to trace causal lines (scratching air, glowing faintly), and capped at closure. Three gates met; beat involvement across setup, middle, and payoff. The nib's material (fallen satellite casing) and state changes (twisted → straightened → glowing) are specific and irreplaceable. Causal pressure: the pen channels the anomaly and enables the editing. Minor friction: the "no ink" detail is asserted but not functionally exploited—the pen works via distortion, not traditional writing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Editing history is the dominant action from midpoint onward: Elian unbends causality, severs famine-revolution links, alters bullet trajectories, and rewrites the library shelves. Setup is early (rewrite what happened), middle beats demonstrate the method (tracing lines, drafting contingencies), and closure confirms success (text rewritten, world readable). The concept shapes stakes (fix past mistakes) and tactics (contingent linkage, not direct intervention). Cost is conceptual—impostor doubt, risk of "damning it further"—but felt cost on the page is thin. Strong integration across all three gates and high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is signaled early ("posture that was confidently uncertain") and embodied in Elian's self-doubt ("merely guessing," "imposter in his own life") while he acts with "absolute precision" and "arrogant flourish." The trait constrains his emotional stance and adds tension to his god-like actions. However, it does not visibly alter a tactical choice or impose a felt cost—he proceeds with the same confidence regardless of doubt. Setup and middle development present; closure participation is thematic only. Functional but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unbend" drives a key turn: the nib must be straightened before Elian can edit history. The action is embodied (slow pressure, callous of thumb, microscopic sigh, yields into spear point) and causally necessary—without it, the conduit remains broken. Setup is implicit (nib twisted by frustration), middle beat dramatizes the unbending, and the straightened pen enables all subsequent editing beats. The physical act of unbending mirrors the conceptual work of unbending causality. High irreplaceability and causal pressure; closure linkage indirect but structural.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" is signaled early ("web of dependencies") and demonstrated in middle beats: severing famine-revolution link, connecting supernova to dictator, linking bullet to moth wing. The method shapes Elian's tactics—he edits connections, not events—and is integral to the concept. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the reader sees the method asserted more than felt as a constraint. Setup, middle development, and closure participation all present. Specificity moderate; "causal editing" could substitute with minor rewording. Functional across beats but not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly enables Elian's floating, provides the "sweet, heavy pressure" that swaddles him, and channels distortion through the pen into the editing process. It is present in setup (floats cross-legged), middle beats (hums, vibrates against bones), and closure (lightened atmosphere, ozone scent). The anomaly constrains method (retrocausality requires it) and charges the final image (room lightens, shelves settle). High irreplaceability and causal pressure. The setting is not merely postcard; it is the enabling condition for the entire action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" frames the inciting wound and motivates the repair. The timeframe is signaled early (wars sprouted, harvest failed) and provides emotional weight (terrible silence, disaster). However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—Elian's editing proceeds without visible urgency or deadline. Setup is clear, but middle development and closure participation are thematic only; time does not narrow options or alter tactics on the page. Functional framing but not a driving pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is stated early and metaphorically developed (separating grain from chaff, processing bitter crop into nutrition of wisdom). The motivation drives Elian's editing actions and the final satisfaction ("readable"). However, the desire is abstract and uncontested—no moment where he must choose between meaning and another want, or where threshing costs him something immediate. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic rather than dramatized as conflicted choice. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but no visible friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" is established early (swaddled in disruption, safe from linear consequences) and modulates across beats: comfort → frustration (twisted nib) → thrill of impostor doubt → satisfaction and lightened atmosphere at closure. Tone is coherent and charges the final image: Elian floats in "quiet aftermath," achieving readable order from chaos. The paradox of comfort-in-disruption matches the character's confidently uncertain stance. No static mood; tone tightens and releases with pressure. Strong closure linkage and purposeful modulation, though the ending leans toward resolution rather than sustained tension.</comment>
