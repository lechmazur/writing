<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and task-focused, with embodied detail (hydraulic grease, rose-colored luminescence). Her motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" shapes her final stance and reframes the data collection as birth rather than obituary. The professional competence is balanced by genuine struggle with the lunar interference, and the micro-choices (closing eyes, listening for gaps) reveal a hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the internal contradiction could be sharper—her shift from standard protocols to negative-space listening feels more like procedure than genuine risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, climber's harness, Aeros towers, lunar perigee). The piece follows a causal lens: psi-gauge check → ladder climb → observation deck → relic insertion → signal attempt → protocol failure → paradigm shift → success. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she secures the transmission and reframes extinction as recipe for nursery, with the cost legible in "just another night shift"—normalization after existential labor. The link from "trying to isolate a sound" to "listening for gaps" is motivated and narrows her method decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The suspended city over the Great Gorge is vivid and pressures choice through environmental threat (groaning towers, rising wind, deck plates vibrating). Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens (psi-gauge, hydraulic grease, brass inlay spark). The Hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting/tool and charges the closure by glowing rose and channeling silence into data. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (ladder → deck → console → fragment slot). The setting constrains her method (needs altitude and the relic's conductivity) and the "mechanical graveyard hosting a cosmic birth" image reconfigures the space thematically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: capture the dying nebula's frequency before it goes dark. One meaningful tightening occurs when standard protocols fail and lunar interference buries the signal, forcing Elara to discard academy training. The paradigm shift (listening for gaps rather than spikes) is protagonist-driven and narrows her method with visible cost (abandoning her training). The resolution—locking onto "precise emptiness"—is earned by her agency. The final image of packing tools and checking valves shows the cost as routine danger naturalized, though the immediate physical or relational price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges through concrete action: Elara reframes the nebula data as "recipe for the star nursery" rather than obituary. The "shard of hush" image—vibrant absence as opposed to dead silence—offers a non-literal answer to transformation. Subtext operates in the contrast between "most interpreters found this work depressing" and her reframing, and in "just another night shift" normalizing cosmic stakes. The final packing sequence grounds transcendence in procedure without moralizing. Minor gap: the thematic claim "Her motivation was always to find the beginning in every ending" edges toward direct statement where demonstration alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and Elara's professional idiom (psi-gauge, spectral energy, receiver). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices pressure valves, brass inlay sparks, and gravitational interference—details filtered by her role. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (signal interpreter, atmospheric density, negative space in audio spectrum). The prose modulates with pressure: short declaratives during the paradigm shift ("She stopped listening... started listening..."). Minor slip: "residual fame was just a high-grade conductor for spectral energy" reads slightly expository, tilting toward reader assistance rather than pure interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (most lines do double duty: "groaned under the stress of the rising wind" = setting + threat). Clarity is strong with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: "serenely electric" and "shard of hush" are specific and non-contradictory. Minor density lapse: "It was strictly a maintenance run, or so the guild master had claimed, but the sky told a distinctly different story" delays concrete stakes with a stock mystery frame. The phrase "pregnant with potential" in describing silence is close to cliché but redeemed by the immediate tactile follow-up.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signal work + Hollywood star fragment as fame-conductor + listening for silence rather than sound is specific and non-obvious. The "fantasy practicality" tone (magic as volatile procedure, cosmic birth as routine shift) offers a fresh angle on wonder. The emotional core—reframing death as nursery data—resists sentimentality through Elara's professional detachment. Risk: the piece commits to its premise and follows implications (fragment must complete circuit, silence has texture). Minor friction: the Hollywood star fragment as relic feels slightly convenient—its thematic link (adoration → conductor) is clever but not deeply woven into Elara's internal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as celestial signal interpreter frames every beat: she checks the gauge, climbs, inserts the relic, attempts standard tuning, then shifts method by discarding assumptions. Her choice to listen for gaps rather than spikes creates the key turn and drives closure. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle choice (paradigm shift), and ending (secures transmission, packs tools). The final "just another night shift" stance is shaped by her professional identity. Causal pressure is strong; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment appears in three beats: withdrawal from satchel (setup), clamping into receiver slot where brass sparks (middle enabling action), and glowing rose while channeling silence (closure). Its unique property—residual fame as spectral conductor—enables the tuning and charges the final data stream. Removing it would break the story's logic (Elara needs "a receiver with a memory of glory"). Cost connection: she must use this specific relic to pierce atmospheric density. Strong irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is the core concept and shapes the climactic turn: Elara finds "a shard of hush... buried deep beneath the static," described as vibrant absence distinct from dead silence. This negative-space signal alters her tactics (she locks coordinates onto "precise emptiness"). Present in middle and ending; the discovery changes her method from listening for spikes to seeking gaps. It does not appear in setup, limiting early signal. The concept's specificity (hush as vibrant, serenely electric) is high and irreplaceable, but late first mention (past midpoint) and single-beat use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the found silence: "a quietude that buzzed against her skin like the static from a fuzzy wool blanket, raising the hairs on her arms." The attribute enables Elara to identify the correct frequency (it has tactile presence, not dead void). Present in the climactic beat and shapes her locking choice. Absent from setup and not revisited at closure. The trait is specific and embodied, but single-beat use and no closure reprise limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tune" is the assigned action and drives the entire plot: Elara's task is to "tune the array to the frequency of a dying nebula." She attempts standard tuning (protocols fail), then shifts method (listening for gaps), and achieves tuning by locking onto the shard of hush. Present in setup (task assignment), middle (failed then successful attempts), and ending (transmission stabilized). The major turn—discarding assumptions—traces directly to this action. Swappability is low; "tune" is specific to signal work and integral to the procedural stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is the method and appears explicitly: "To succeed, she had to work by discarding assumptions entirely. She had to unlearn the academy training." This shift is signaled at the failure point (standard protocols thrash meters into red) and enacted immediately (stops listening for transmission, starts listening for gaps). The method shapes her successful attempt and is causally necessary. Present in middle choice and implicit in ending success. Late signal (past midpoint) and no setup mention cap the score, but strong causal pressure and specificity elevate within band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "abandoned radio towers suspended over the Great Gorge" setting pressures Elara's choices: she checks the psi-gauge before trusting the rusted ladder, the city groans under wind stress, deck plates vibrate from cosmic noise, and she checks pressure valves to prevent tower collapse. The altitude is necessary for signal work ("observation deck of the central spire"). Present in setup, middle (deck shaking), and ending (checking valves before departure). The gorge below provides contrast ("dead silence of the gorge" vs. vibrant hush). Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"During lunar perigee" is the timeframe and tightens stakes: the swollen moon marks peak proximity, causing "unbearable static" and "gravitational interference" that buries Elara's target signal. Present in setup (moon hung heavy) and implicit in middle struggle (lunar tide overwhelming). The perigee creates the obstacle she must overcome and justifies the difficulty. Not revisited at ending ("the moon began its slow descent" mentions departure but does not reweight the perigee's role). Functional constraint with moderate causal pressure; closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is stated directly ("Her motivation was always...") and dramatized in her reframing: "The data she was collecting wasn't an obituary; it was a recipe for the star nursery." This desire shapes her final stance and charges the closure image (packing tools after securing birth data). Present in middle reflection and ending. Absent from setup and no on-page friction between this want and competing costs—she never struggles with the depressing interpretation others hold. Told more than conflicted; moderate thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" tone is coherent throughout: magic exists (Hollywood star conducts spectral energy, silence has texture) but is treated as procedural work (checking gauges, clamping relics, standard protocols, pressure valves). The tone modulates with pressure: businesslike setup, intensifying technical struggle, then return to routine ("just another night shift"). The final packing sequence charges the image by normalizing cosmic stakes. The tone shapes reader experience (wonder grounded in labor) and supports theme. No tonal breaks; closure image is fully consonant.</comment>
