<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief for her brother, with her "quietly driven" nature embodied through solitary mapping and methodical investigation. Her blowing the whistle represents a meaningful micro-choice that alters the situation, and the final realization about the cage reweights her stance with visible cost (she now knows she was cargo, not passenger). Minor weakness: the transition from cartographer to agent feels slightly compressed, and the ending crystallizes understanding more than showing internal contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative layering. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The whistle triggers a causal chain (sound → response → crack → revelation) that narrows Elara's options from "understand trajectory" to "recognize entrapment," meeting the meaningful tightening requirement. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the city, turtles, and sun as components of a delivery system with undeniable conceptual cost (freedom was never possible). One persistent constraint—the rusted gate—shapes the entire premise and final understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-city setting is vivid and purposeful: scutes constrain Elara's methodology, the fissure reveals gears (environment actively redefines reality), and the harsh sun creates atmospheric pressure throughout. Micro-setting qualifies—her "boots" anchor the spiral pattern that cracks. The Silent Watchers function as spatial pressure that drives both past (brother's expedition) and present action (whistle-blowing). Small gap: the interior of the city (timber frame, plaza) receives less texture than the shell and horizon, slightly limiting spatial immersion during peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understand the trajectory (and implicitly, recover/avenge her brother). The whistle-blowing is protagonist-driven agency that triggers escalation (sound → response → crack → revelation), and the cost is unmistakable on the page—Elara learns she's cargo in a cage, not a citizen seeking answers. One meaningful tightening occurs: her question to the Watchers produces an answer that forecloses hope. Minor limiter: the Lost Expedition functions more as backstory pressure than on-page complication, so the escalation reads as a single decisive turn rather than compounding reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—autonomy versus control, the horror of being cargo rather than passenger—emerges organically from the turtle mechanics, rusted gate, and whistle revelation without stated moralizing. The final image (artificial sun, knowing face, gripped whistle as "key to a cage") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: freedom was architectural illusion. The pattern-language motif constrains Elara's methodology and charges the closure when "biological" scutes reveal mechanical schematics. Small note: "waiting for the delivery to arrive" in the penultimate line edges toward explicit theme statement but remains grounded in the physical discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual filter: Elara notices shell ridges, growth spirals, mathematical singularities—vocabulary consistent with a cartographer's training. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (the crack, the gears). Minor slips: "a sound that was not quite sound, but a vibration felt in the teeth" is evocative but slightly over-engineered for crisis tempo, and "sunwashed dread" as narratorial description (not Elara's exact thought) briefly loosens focalization. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong specific nouns (scutes, barnacled flanks, silica dust). Rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language (sun "flayed" the city, atmosphere "heavy with sunwashed dread") is coherent and supports tone. Minor deductions: "terror that thrived in the total absence of shadow" in paragraph 13 is poetic but slightly abstract for a cartographer's POV under stress. One brief paraphrase loop: paragraphs 18–19 restate the convergence/singularity idea without adding new pressure. No Template cadence or filter-verb stacks detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The turtle-city on silica dunes is a fresh synthesis; revealing gears beneath organic shell transforms the biopunk premise into a horror of manufactured destiny. The whistle as resonance key and the pattern-language methodology are specific, non-obvious integrations. Risk-taking (the artificial sun reveal, the maintenance-protocol twist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Small limiter: the "Silent Watchers as operators" twist, while effective, leans on familiar megastructure-mystery tropes (Arrival, The Expanse); deeper personalization of the Watchers' nature or Elara's final tactical response could push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (spiral-shell cartographer) is present throughout, her skill frames the investigation, and her final act (blowing the whistle) triggers the climactic revelation. Her training shapes both methodology (reading scutes) and the closure realization (pattern was mechanical schematics). Two distinct beats: mapping the shell, interpreting the crack. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reed whistle appears in paragraph 11 (setup), is handled/contemplated in paragraphs 14–15, blown in paragraph 20 (middle action), and gripped in the final line with reweighted meaning ("key to a cage"). Three beats with evolving function. Closure credit: it triggers the revelation and is charged in the final image. Cap at 7.2: the whistle is swappable with any sonic device that produces the "resonance frequency" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lost expedition (Elara's brother's team) is seeded in paragraph 9, motivates Elara's investigation, and the final revelation reframes their fate ("harvested by maintenance protocols"). Two beats: initial mention, closure reinterpretation. Moderate causal pressure: it primes Elara's emotional drive and the whistle's origin. Limitation: the expedition itself is off-page; its primary function is backstory anchor rather than on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" (paragraph 6) is embodied: Elara works alone, rejects prayer in favor of pattern-reading, and takes solitary action (blowing the whistle). The trait enables her methodical approach and constrains social options (no delegation, no appeal to authority). Visible in two beats: the mapping obsession, the final whistle choice. Cost: isolation means no backup when the revelation lands. Mid-band: the trait shapes tactics but is not irreplaceable (any determination-type attribute could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Crack" is the pivotal action (paragraph 26): it splits the scute, vents steam, and reveals gears beneath. This beat redefines the entire story's reality (biological → mechanical) and is the hinge of closure. Setup: Elara's mapping predicts convergence. Development: the whistle triggers the turtle's pause. Payoff: the crack is the on-page moment where illusion shatters. High causal pressure, irreplaceable, shapes the final image. Strong closure linkage; removing it collapses the reveal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Pattern languages" (paragraph 7) is signaled early, used twice (interpreting spirals in paragraph 17, recognizing mechanical schematics in paragraph 29), and its mechanics matter: Elara's cartographic skill is the means by which she predicts destination and later recognizes the deception. Two beats with causal work. Limitation: the method could be replaced by any technical expertise (engineer, biologist) without major structural change; it is apt but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>City-on-turtles is introduced in paragraph 2, supplies the central constraint (mobility beyond control after gate rusts), provides the work surface (shell scutes) that Elara reads, and the crack reveals its true nature (mechanical, not organic). Three beats: initial setting, Elara's mapping workspace, the gear revelation. High causal pressure: the setting *is* the mystery and the cage. Strong closure linkage. Approaching indispensability: remove the turtle-city and the entire premise collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the gate rusts shut" (paragraph 5) is seeded early and frames the story's situation (turtles move autonomously, city cannot steer). It motivates Elara's investigation and is reframed at closure ("locked to ensure cargo could not escape"). Two touches: setup and closure reinterpretation. Moderate causal role: it establishes the problem but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Swappability: any disabling event (sabotage, loss of crew) could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To question the Silent Watchers" (paragraph 16) is dramatized: Elara raises the whistle, hesitates under pressure, then acts. The motivation drives the whistle-blowing and is reweighted at closure when she realizes the Watchers are operators, not answerable gods. Two beats: stated desire, action taken. Strong closure linkage: the act produces the revelation. Cost: her question confirms entrapment. Mid-high band: the motivation is specific but could be replaced by "understand the turtles' path" without major surgery.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is established in paragraphs 1 and 13 ("terror that thrived in the total absence of shadow"), modulates during the investigation (relentless heat, oppressive light), intensifies at the whistle-blowing (hot wind, physical weight of light), and charges the final image ("artificial sun beat down on her knowing face"). Coherent through turns, present in the closure beat. Strong tonal control with purposeful cadence shift from atmospheric dread to existential horror. High integration.</comment>
