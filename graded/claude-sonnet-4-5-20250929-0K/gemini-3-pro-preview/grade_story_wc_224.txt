<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand home is clear and her suppressed talents create internal conflict, but the backstory dominates the opening third without concrete present choices until she finds the stone. The micro-choices (touching the stone, running thumb along the quill, pressing stone into mulch) are embodied and purposeful. The final renunciation of nightly escapism as crutch feels earned by the stone's stabilization, though the emotional cost of this shift remains more told than felt in the closure beat. Internal contradiction between fear of her power and need to use it drives the arc adequately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—roots of light binding the books, nightly escapism becoming "water for growth," and the heartbeat of home. Cost is present but oblique: the final sentence gestures toward stability without showing what Elara forfeits in binding the mountain. The stone discovery→quill translation→seeding sequence links causally under the lens, and the ending reweights prior material (escapism, buried talents) with undeniable pressure, though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is vivid, tactile, and constrains navigation (mercury glass needed to see paths, dust-choked air, treacherous precipices). Micro-setting works well: the quill pressed in an atlas, the ledge of crumbling scrolls, the mulch of rotting paper all serve as functional terrain. The stone's "pulsing heat" and the golden roots stitching books together charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's need (the "dull gleam" caught by her glass, the "cold surface" resonating in bone) and the atmosphere of "hidden thunder" modulates from threat to heartbeat, supporting the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home—is signaled early and drives the ascent. The discovery of the stone is a clear reversal that narrows options (she must resurrect buried talents), and the seeding act is a decisive tightening with stakes on the page. However, the agency feels compressed: Elara's choice to plant the stone is described with ritualistic care but the trade-off cost (what she loses by binding herself to this place, what the suppressed power actually demands) remains abstract. The escalation from finding→decoding→planting works under the Accumulative lens but lacks a visible price that alters her tactics in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Home as "not a destination but a living thing to cultivate from ruin" emerges from concrete action (seeding the stone, roots stitching books) rather than declaration. The mercury glass showing "not what was, but what was coming to be" and the nightly escapism transforming from crutch to water are resonant images that reweight prior material. The final heartbeat metaphor charges the ending without stating a moral. However, "buried talents" and "substitutes reality nightly" edge toward thematic echo in the opening exposition, and the phrase "home was not a destination…but a living thing" risks borderline explicitness, though it stays anchored in Elara's realization rather than authorial aside.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: "sharp edges she refused to touch," "the mercury glass caught a dull gleam," "reading the history encoded via the texture." Diction remains consistent and purposeful throughout. The opening backstory block is substantial (~25% of text) but anchored to present survival mechanism and primes the closure turn. One filter-verb stack in the opening ("did not fear…she feared") and minor register elevation ("terrifying, rhythmic heat," "delicate reverence") in the climax slightly soften immediacy under peak pressure, but voice remains character-particular and the psychic distance modulates intentionally from reflective opening to embodied action at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several prose artifacts cluster in pivotal beats. The opening paragraph uses "not made of…but of" construction followed immediately by "not a destination…but a living thing," creating template cadence. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "petrified folios," "canyons of prose," "stitching…stories into…reality," "water for this new growth" in quick succession at closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "she had forgotten what it felt like to belong" restates the prior sentence's claim about severing from truth. The phrase "rottting paper" / "dark debris" synonym pair and "ledge of crumbling scrolls" echo earlier "dust-choked labyrinthine" in texture without advancing the image. These issues touch the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and lowering line-level score by −1.0 cumulative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The book-mountain premise and mercury-glass navigation offer fresh specificity, and the quill-as-tactile-decoder is an inventive synthesis. The emotional center—home as something cultivated rather than found—feels earned through Elara's choices. However, the "seer with clouded eyes using a mirror" and "character suppressing destructive power" are familiar templates, and the seeding-as-transformation metaphor, while executed with care, does not subvert or deeply transform these foundations. The story commits fully to its premise and the ending turn (escapism becoming growth-fuel) is non-obvious, lifting the score within band, but the core arc remains recognizable from widely used writing frameworks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's mercury-glass sight enables navigation and reveals the stone's gleam (setup, development). Her decision to touch the stone, resurrect her talents, and seed the mountain are key turns driven by her choices. Present in the closure image indirectly (she lowers the glass, recognizing stability). Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, but the glass itself becomes passive in the final act—she acts on the stone, not through continued mirror use—reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lost language stone appears early (first third), demands resurrection of buried talents (middle choice), and is planted to stabilize the mountain (closure action). It pulses with heat, hums in response to the quill, and its roots of golden light directly create the final transformation. Causally indispensable across three beats with high specificity (basalt, shifting glyphs, rhythmic heat) and the seeding act is the pivot of closure. Visible cost connection: planting it forecloses other options and binds Elara to this place.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Buried talents are mentioned in backstory (suppressed ability to alter physical structure, fear of past destruction) and directly enable the closure (stone planting requires resurrecting these talents). However, the actual mechanics of how her talents work remain abstract—"alter the physical structure of the world" is a label without on-page demonstration of cost or constraint in the seeding act itself. The concept shapes the middle choice (she must decide to use power she fears) and the ending gesture, but swappability is moderate: another form of magic or skill could replace it with minor edits. Two-gate lyric reprise without strong middle dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is present in setup (weaving hallucinations to mask grief, escapism as survival mechanism) and reweighted at closure (becomes "water for this new, tangible growth"). However, it never constrains or enables a specific on-page action with visible cost—Elara does not choose between hallucination and reality in a scene, nor does the nightly practice alter her tactics. The attribute functions as backstory motivation and thematic reprise but remains ornamental to plot mechanics. Late payoff in closure image without middle beat involvement limits score to lyric-allowance band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The seeding action is the climactic turn: Elara presses the stone into rotting paper, and golden roots stitch the books into stable reality. This act is irreplaceable—throwing, keeping, or other gestures would not achieve the same effect. It resolves the dominant stake (understanding home) and appears in the closure image (roots binding, heartbeat rising through her boots). Strong causal linkage and closure participation. However, the action arrives only in the final fifth of the text with no prior setup of "seeding" as a concept or method, and the mechanics (why planting stabilizes) rely on metaphorical logic rather than earned physical or magical rules, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The quill from a phoenix appears mid-story, and its texture—microscopic ridges acting "as a needle on a record"—unlocks the stone's cipher. This is a single, causally important beat that enables the climax. The method is specific and irreplaceable in that moment (friction of skin on barbules sparks connection). However, it does not shape earlier attempts, appears only once, and is absent from the closure image. The phoenix quill itself feels convenient—no prior setup of why a phoenix quill would exist in a book-mountain or why Elara would recognize its function. Strong mid-beat involvement but late introduction and no closure participation limit score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine book-mountain is present throughout: treacherous precipices, ravines of lexicons, canyons of prose, ledge of crumbling scrolls. It constrains navigation (mercury glass needed), provides the discovery site (stone in a ravine), and supplies the medium for seeding (mulch of rotting paper). The setting's instability (hidden thunder, threat of avalanche) drives the stakes and its transformation (roots binding books into stable reality) is the closure image. Strong across all three gates with causal pressure and closure charge. High specificity and irreplaceability—another setting would fundamentally alter the logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" frames the opening and motivates Elara's retreat to the mountain and nightly escapism. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—there is no clock, deadline, or escalating temporal pressure. The phrase "long after" is vague, and the story unfolds in a single continuous present without time-based constraints on her choices. The attribute functions as backstory context but does not alter tactics or shape the closure beat. Present in setup, absent in development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is stated early, drives the ascent into the archives, and is directly answered in the closure (home as "living thing to cultivate," the heartbeat of stability). Elara's motivation is dramatized through concrete choices: searching the ravines, touching the stone, seeding the mountain. Friction between her want (home) and fear (buried talents, past destruction) creates tension. The motivation shapes three beats and charges the final image. Strong integration with visible cost (she must resurrect feared power, bind herself to this unstable place). One minor deduction for the phrase "understand the shape of home" edging toward abstract prompt language rather than fully embodied desire, but the dramatization compensates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears as "constant vibration," "low-frequency rumble," and "accumulated weight" threatening avalanche throughout the story. Tone modulates purposefully: threat in the opening and middle (fear of collapse), then transformation at closure (thunder breaks "not into destruction, but into the steady, rhythmic heartbeat"). The tone is coherent, supports the Accumulative lens, and charges the final image with the shift from rumble to heartbeat. Strong setup, development, and payoff with clear emotional progression. Specificity is high and the tonal pivot is irreplaceable to the closure effect.</comment>
