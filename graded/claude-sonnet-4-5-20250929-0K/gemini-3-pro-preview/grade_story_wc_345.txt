<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's agency drives the central choice, and Oren's ghostly persistence is established through his prior altruism. However, the cast feels broad (Elara, Jaxon, Oren, plus the unnamed "family"), and individual interiority remains thin—most characters serve functional roles rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic choice to rig the bell feels more communal problem-solving than a personal cost that forecloses a path. Jaxon's flicker of curiosity is noted but never complicates the collective momentum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early (floating orchards, years post-crash, thinning nebula) and tracks a clear causal chain: messages → diagram → reexamination → pump modification → nebula restored. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (collective labor, risk of failure), and the inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (the watering bell's prior insignificance reweighted). One pressure tightening (discovery of the bell's sonic function) narrows options and forces coordinated action. The ending lands on-page with felt consequence, though the success feels complete rather than charged with residual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating granite arches, dangling orchard roots, and atmospheric moisture create a vivid, coherent micro-setting that constrains choices (navigating thorns, avoiding rock slides, exposure to radiation). The watering bell and pump station function as spatial anchors during the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven ("bruised purples," "hissing through tiny apertures"), and the bioluminescent butterflies charge the final image without feeling ornamental. The environment directly enables the solution, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival against thinning nebula radiation—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Oren's chalked messages introduce one meaningful complication (the obscure diagram), which Elara and Jaxon reexamine under pressure, narrowing options to the collective pump modification. The climax is driven by protagonist agency (gathering the family, rigging the bell), and the cost is legible (day-long labor, shared risk). However, the success feels unambiguous; no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path charges the final image, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of collective effort over individual heroics emerges organically from Oren's intent and the family's coordinated action. "Brambled hope" recurs with earned texture (thorns/bleeding, then "bloomed into something sturdy"), and the watering bell as tuning fork offers a non-literal answer to survival through small tools used together. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("reminded them that the smallest tools...could move the heavens"), though it remains anchored in image. The butterflies' feedback loop adds resonance without forcing allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elara's perspective during key beats. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("brambled hope," "curdle and thicken"), with strong perceptual specificity (e.g., "grease-stained fingernail," "bruised purples"). Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Jaxon's skepticism from Elara's insistence. Some constructions edge toward literary flourish ("frozen lightning," "siren song of the water") that occasionally elevates register above the functional survival tone, but the voice holds coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear, propulsive, and rhythmically varied, with strong information density (most lines advance character, setting, or plot). Figurative language is controlled and avoids muddle ("gravity...letting the granite...drift upward," "atmospheric band...thinning dangerously"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and closure effectively. Minor flourishes ("frozen lightning," "brambled hope") feel voice-motivated rather than overwritten. Zero scaffold or artifact debt touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—sonic resonance stabilizing an atmospheric shield via a butterfly watering bell—offers a fresh synthesis of survival, collective action, and overlooked tools. The ghost-as-guide through chalk messages adds texture, though the altruistic-ghost-helps-colony frame is familiar. The emotional arc and thematic resolution feel earned but not surprising; the transformation test reveals the plot could translate to other settings with minor adjustments. The watering bell's specific perforations and the butterflies' feedback loop provide enough specificity to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Oren is established early (first loss, altruistic, refuses to leave), and his chalked messages drive two key beats: the morning messages and the diagram near the fountain. His intent to orchestrate collective effort is clear and dramatized through the diagram's imperative. However, Oren never appears on-page as a character making choices; his agency is indirect, mediated through messages. The "strangely trustworthy" quality is told rather than tested with cost. Present in setup, development, and closure shaping, but his role is more catalyst than active decider.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The watering bell is introduced via the diagram (development), reexamined under magnification (middle choice), and rigged to the turbine in the climax (closure participation). Its specific perforations and sonic resonance are irreplaceable—removing it breaks the solution. The object constrains the family's tactics (must amplify that frequency) and charges the final image (hissing, humming, butterflies emerging). Early signal is indirect (storage shed mention), but the object drives two distinct beats and closure with visible cost (day-long modification). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Nebula of Respite is the central stake: it's thinning (inciting problem), its harmonic frequency must be matched (solution constraint), and its restoration is the climax (closure participation). The concept shapes tactics (find the resonance, amplify the sound) and alters options throughout. Present in setup (thinning leaves, groaning anchors), development (frequency discovery), and payoff (nebula thickens, radiation drops). Removing it collapses the story's logic. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is applied to Oren's chalked messages and noted when even Jaxon nods at the advice. It enables the family's willingness to act on the diagram without verification, but no on-page cost or tradeoff is shown—Elara simply gathers the family, and they comply. The trait is told more than tested; it doesn't constrain a choice with visible friction. Present in setup and development, but ornamental at closure. Functional but replaceable with "credible" or "compelling."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Reexamine" is the imperative command beside the diagram, and it drives the pivotal turn: Elara and Jaxon take the bell to the magnification lens and discover the sonic perforations. This discovery redefines options from vague hope to concrete solution. The action is signaled (diagram beat), shapes the middle choice (lens examination), and enables the climax (pump modification). Removing it breaks causality; the family would have no path from diagram to solution. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chalk messages on sidewalks at dawn are established early (inciting pattern), and the method shapes Oren's indirect agency—no one sees the artist, creating mystery and trust. The final diagram near the fountain is the key message that drives the plot. The mechanics matter: the medium's ephemerality (fading into stone by evening) and its public placement enforce collective discovery. Present in setup, development (diagram), and thematically at closure (Elara looks down at fading chalk). Causal pressure is moderate; the method could be swapped for carved signs with minor edits, but the dawn timing and sidewalk staging add texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches supplies the central problem (thinning nebula exposing the orchards) and the resources (atmospheric moisture, gravity anchors, pump infrastructure). The setting constrains choices (must navigate thorns, avoid slides, rig existing pumps) and charges the climax (arches groaning, bioluminescent butterflies in crevices). Present in setup (loose gravity, dangling roots), development (storage shed, town square fountain), and closure (floating rocks, sealed sky). Removing it breaks the story's physical logic and stakes. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Years had passed since the crash" anchors the timeframe, and "lately" signals the nebula's recent thinning, but the passage of time remains vague. The one-day modification effort is noted ("spent the day rigging"), but no live clock tightens decisions or tactics. The timeframe is present in setup (strangers → family) and implied at closure (months of unsafe radiation now resolved), but it doesn't constrain choices on the page. Functional but replaceable with "recently" or "over time."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Oren's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is stated clearly and dramatized through the diagram's design (requiring "every hand working in unison") and the family's coordinated pump modification. The motivation shapes two beats (diagram discovery, turbine rigging) and is present at closure ("shared purpose that Oren had silently instilled"). Friction is minimal—no character resists the collective approach—but the motivation drives the solution's structure (amplification requires all). Present in setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is introduced early ("Survival here was an exercise in brambled hope") and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure ("The brambled hope in her chest bloomed into something sturdy and real"). The tone coherently mixes danger (thorns, bleeding, thinning nebula) with optimism (sweetness, collective effort, salvation) throughout, modulating with pressure (desperate hour → hesitant discovery → climactic success). The tone charges the final image (gratitude, cool wet air, mended sky) and is indispensable to the story's emotional arc. Strong closure linkage and thematic resonance.</comment>
