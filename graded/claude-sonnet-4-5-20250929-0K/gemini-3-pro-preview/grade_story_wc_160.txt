<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in compassion versus rationing laws, with embodied tension during the chain-rigging sequence ("hands began to tremble…from the overwhelming adrenaline"). Internal conflict reads somewhat abstract—"dappled resolve" is descriptive rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice is earned by prior setup, but the protagonist's competence overshadows genuine struggle; his ingenious plan executes without meaningful error or adaptation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure arrives on-page as Decisive Change—the water flows into forbidden tunnels, Elian succeeds in sabotage, the gauges falsely read "Closed"—with felt cost (treason, adrenaline terror). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The chain's tension provides one meaningful reversal ("if the chain snapped, the bypass would fail"), and the resolution is earned by Elian's prior analysis and mechanical intervention. Cost is legible: he commits treason and remains "a ghost in the machine," though the emotional price could be sharpened in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater's thermal expansion ("the moment the building breathes") constrains timing and provides cover for sabotage, directly shaping Elian's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his professional lens: "shimmering waves," "deep, resonant groans," "metal singing beneath his boots." The surveyor's chain and pressure gauges function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across the gantry and control platform, and the volcano's residual heat is integrated into action rather than merely described.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the Outer Ring versus obeying the High Council—is signaled early and braided tightly with Elian's personal risk of treason. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chain pulls taut and might snap, narrowing options with visible cost: "if the chain snapped, the bypass would fail, and the Outer Ring would die of thirst." The resolution is driven by Elian's agency (adhesive analysis, chain placement, wheel-hauling) and the volcanic cycle he exploits. Coincidence does not resolve; the plan's success hinges on his preparation and the antique metal holding under stress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "mercy could be hidden in the most mundane of places" is earned by the adhesive-glue discovery and the First Engineer's encrypted blueprint. The final image—Elian as "a ghost in the machine who ensured the city's heart beat for everyone"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of compassion versus law. However, the thematic statement in the penultimate sentence ("The analysis of that simple adhesive had proven that mercy…") leans toward direct articulation rather than image alone, reducing subtextual resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent professional filter: Elian's perceptual bias toward mechanical detail and measurement anchors narration. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-motivated ("masterstroke of encrypted compassion," "dappled resolve"), though some phrases ("slyly heartfelt precision") read slightly forced. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled. Under peak stress the prose compresses appropriately ("threw his weight," "hauling it down"), and internal texture stays consistent. A few register lifts ("geologic inhalation," "topographical data suspended chemically") fit the engineer POV but occasionally border on over-written.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences often do double duty (e.g., glow-lamp → envelope discovery → resin analysis → hidden message). Rhythm varies, but several mid-paragraph descriptors lean ornate: "dappled resolve, a determination speckled with the terror of treason yet brightened by the clarity of his purpose" paraphrases the same emotional state without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the adhesive-analysis paragraph (multiple clauses stacking technical terms). No major loops or scaffolding, and the final image is clear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "speckled" and "brightened" within one phrase risks metaphor mixing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—hydraulic sabotage via encrypted blueprint hidden in adhesive—offers a fresh synthesis of engineering intrigue and covert compassion. The surveyor's chain as analog workaround for digital alarms is specific and non-obvious. However, the "hidden humanitarian bypass erased from records" setup leans toward familiar template (secret good design suppressed by authoritarian regime). Emotional specificity is present in Elian's trembling hands and the tactile chain work, but the high-competence hero solving a technical puzzle without major setback feels somewhat safe. The volcanic breathing cycle and adhesive encryption elevate originality within the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's choices drive all major turns: analyzing the adhesive unlocks the blueprint, using the chain creates the bypass link, hauling the wheel executes the sabotage. His ingenuity shapes setup, middle escalation (chain tension), and closure (gauges falsely read "Closed"). Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Visible cost: treason, adrenaline terror, ongoing ghost status.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in setup (held in grip, described as antique/invisible to alarms), middle beat (looped around axle and lever with "measured restraint"), and climax (pulls taut, threatens to snap, then holds and goes slack). Its specific properties—brass, tarnished, physical/analog—enable the sabotage and are irreplaceable. The chain's tension directly shapes the peak reversal and charges the closure image as it drops "invisibly into the shadows."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is signaled early (First Engineer's "masterstroke of encrypted compassion") and frames the adhesive discovery. It shapes Elian's motivation and the hidden blueprint's existence, thus enabling the sabotage. Present in setup and thematically in closure ("mercy could be hidden in the most mundane of places"). However, it functions more as premise and theme than as an on-page tactical constraint; the encryption is solved off-stage before the main scene begins, limiting mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is explicitly attached to "precision" in one phrase: "With a slyly heartfelt precision, he looped the surveyor's chain." The attribute colors one on-page action (the chain placement) but remains largely label-only; the text does not dramatize how his heartfelt compassion conflicts with or enables slyness in a way that creates visible tradeoff. Present in middle development but swappable with "careful" or "deliberate" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tremble appears at the climax: "Elian's hands began to tremble, not from the vibration of the machine, but from the overwhelming adrenaline of defying an empire." It signals peak emotional and physical stress at the moment of highest risk (chain might snap). The action is specific to this beat and not easily swappable; it embodies the cost of treason. Present in setup (tension building) and closure participation (marks the hinge moment before success). However, it does not directly alter tactics—Elian proceeds regardless—so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Analyzing the adhesive is present in setup (second paragraph details the process: dissolving flake, reactive solution, microscopic lattice revealed) and enables the entire plan by unlocking the hidden blueprint. The method is specific and signaled early, shaping Elian's knowledge and tactics. However, the analysis occurs off-stage ("Earlier that evening") and is recounted rather than dramatized in real-time pressure. It does not appear in the middle escalation or closure beats beyond thematic echo. Causal role is strong in setup, absent from climax.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater's thermal expansion ("the moment the building breathes") is signaled in setup, constrains the sabotage timing (middle beat: "watched the massive iron counterweight sway as the amphitheater walls widened"), and enables the cover for his act (closure: "the very expansion of the volcano to hide his sabotage"). The setting's physical cycle is irreplaceable; without it, digital alarms would detect the sabotage. It directly alters tactics and charges the final image as "the building exhaled and the walls contracted."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The building-breathes timeframe is signaled early ("the precise time of night…the moment the building breathes"), tightens middle action ("As the tension peaked"), and is resolved at closure ("As the building exhaled and the walls contracted"). The cyclical thermal expansion creates a narrow window that forces immediate action and provides concealment. Present across all three gates with causal pressure; the timing directly shapes tactics and charges the final image. Specific cost: if he misses the cycle, the plan fails.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Harmonizing conflicting values (rationing laws versus Outer Ring lives) is signaled in the opening paragraph and dramatized through Elian's choices: analyzing the adhesive, rigging the chain, defying the Council. The motivation drives setup, middle escalation (treason terror), and closure (becomes "a ghost in the machine" to serve both systems). Internal friction is present ("dappled resolve…speckled with the terror of treason") but leans descriptive rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Cost is visible: ongoing subterfuge and risk.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once in the middle paragraph: "The atmosphere…settled into a dappled resolve, a determination speckled with the terror of treason yet brightened by the clarity of his purpose." The tone is coherent (tension plus determination) and modulates slightly as pressure peaks ("hands began to tremble"), but the phrase itself is ornamental and does not charge the final image or recur. The ending shifts to quiet satisfaction ("content to remain a ghost") without tonal callback to "dappled." Present in middle development, absent from closure participation.</comment>
