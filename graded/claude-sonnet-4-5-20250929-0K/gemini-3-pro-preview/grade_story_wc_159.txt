<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is present and the motivation to preserve names is clear, but interior contradiction is minimal—he moves through his ritual without genuine competing impulses acting simultaneously. Emotions are somewhat embodied ("pang of foxglove regret," "chest tightening"), though the phrase "foxglove regret" edges toward label-speak. The final choice to repair the chime feels mechanical rather than a renunciation or transformation with visible cost that forecloses a path. Backstory fragments (predecessor's lullaby, Age of Noise) anchor in present action adequately but the story leans heavily on reflection without micro-choices altering present options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the opening paragraphs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through descriptive density and the wind-chime repair reweights the orchid's vitality. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian resumes patrol with the possibility that names might drift to scavengers below, crystallizing his duty's stakes. Cost is implied (endless guardianship in isolation) but remains conceptual rather than felt in the final image, and the closure image is more iterative echo than decisive reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Opal Library setting is vivid and specific: iridescent stone, high altitude, glass orchids growing from "accumulated breath of history." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (thin atmospheric winds, porous stone walls, opal floor). The wind chime and the cracked bamboo tube function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elian's repair choice and charge the closure when the restored note feeds the orchids. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the orchids and the forgotten names—is signaled early and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cracked bamboo threatens the orchids' vitality, forcing Elian's repair action. The resolution is earned by his effort (humming in unison, acoustically sealing the fracture), but coincidence is absent and the pressure never escalates beyond the initial problem-solution beat; no reversal narrows options further. The cost is conceptual (endless duty) rather than a visible trade-off that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of memory, duty in absence of witnesses—emerges organically from Elian's task and the image of names drifting like rain to scavengers below. The final paragraph offers a resonant image without overt moralizing: "a guardian of ghosts in a palace of light." Subtext operates in the orchids' symbolic function and the "foxglove regret" metaphor, though that phrase edges toward on-the-nose thematic statement. The ending reweights the premise quietly but does not deliver a non-literal answer to the central question with sharp conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited, with perceptual signature ("practiced ease of a shadow amidst brilliance," "porous stone walls"). Diction is elevated and consistent, fitting a solitary caretaker in a cathedral of marvels. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Some phrases ("foxglove regret, that beautiful, toxic sadness") explain metaphor rather than trusting image, and the prose occasionally drifts into expository register ("the friction of the sound began to light the fracture") rather than maintaining embodied immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled. Information density is high, with layered descriptions advancing atmosphere and world-building simultaneously. A paraphrase loop appears: "sound began to light the fracture" followed by "the light acting as both thread and needle" restates the same sealing mechanism without added pressure (−0.2). Overwriting in the opening third (multiple adjacent lines of figurative language without pattern-taught payoff: "cathedral of iridescent stone," "shadow amidst brilliance," "accumulated breath of history") clusters metaphor for atmospheric effect rather than causal work (−0.4). No loops or template cadence touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—glass orchids fed by acoustic resonance, a floating library preserving extinct emotions—is specific and non-obvious. The repair-by-song method and the opal cathedral setting are fresh inflections on preservation-and-memory material. The transformation test is satisfied: plot and arc depend on these particulars. The ending image (names drifting as rain to scavengers) feels earned in hindsight and avoids generic abstraction. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the concept-driven world-building, though the execution favors atmosphere over high-stakes character transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian's choice to repair the chime is the story's central action and alters tactics (searching for the lullaby resonance, humming to seal the bamboo). He is present in all beats and the closure resumes his patrol with renewed purpose. However, the choice is not deeply conflicted—no competing impulse or visible cost forecloses a path—so the character's agency trends toward competent problem-solving rather than transformation. Setup early, development in the middle repair sequence, and payoff in the final patrol image satisfy the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube is discovered, diagnosed as the problem, removed, repaired by acoustic sealing, and rehung to restore harmony. It appears in at least four distinct beats (discovery, removal, repair, rehanging) with evolving function. The object's repair directly enables the orchid's revival and charges the closure by stabilizing the "drifting memories." Its specific properties (cracked down its length, sealed by sound) are irreplaceable. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" frames the setting (glass orchids in an empty library) and shapes the thematic stakes—Elian tends artifacts with no audience. The concept constrains his choices (isolation, no help) and charges the closure image (guardian of ghosts). However, "deserted" operates more as premise and atmosphere than as a dynamic force altering tactics on the page; the orchids and library are marvels whether deserted or not. Present throughout, but swappable with "abandoned wonders" or similar phrasing without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is demonstrated on the page: Elian's "practiced ease," "daily ritual," and methodical diagnosis of the wind chime dissonance all enact the trait. The gentleness constrains his repair approach (careful removal, trembling fingers, listening for faint resonance) and the systematic method enables success. The trait is visible in at least two beats (opening ritual, repair sequence) and contributes to the closure by framing his resumed patrol as habitual duty. Cost is modest—no moment where gentleness or system visibly trades off against speed or force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "light" (as verb: "the friction of the sound began to light the fracture") is the mechanism of repair, and the resulting luminescence ("soft blue luminescence sealing the wood") is the story's pivotal image. Light is signaled early in the library's iridescence and the orchids' pulse, reappears as the sealing agent in the climax, and charges the closure when the orchid "flared with renewed vitality." Causal and irreplaceable—no other action resolves the crack—and present in setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method "by the echo of a long-forgotten song" is signaled midway ("a lullaby his predecessor had hummed during the Age of Noise"), dramatized in the repair sequence (Elian listens for the resonance, hums in unison), and its mechanics matter—the acoustic bond is the only way to seal the bamboo in a place of "condensed atmosphere." The song constrains his attempt (he must match the library's frequency) and enables success. Present in two beats (search and execution) and essential to the resolution, though introduced slightly late (second third) rather than seeded in the opening.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The opal library setting is vivid and specific, providing resources (porous stone walls that trap resonance, thin atmospheric winds, the wind chime archway) and constraints (condensed atmosphere where physical adhesive fails, high altitude isolation). The setting's properties directly enable Elian's repair method and charge the closure image ("opal floor," "palace of light"). Micro-setting elements (the archway, the stone walls) alter tactics across multiple beats. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure participation all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" functions as thematic framing rather than a ticking clock. The opening declares "Time flowed differently in this altitude; across the museum of extinct feelings, centuries passed like the slow turning of a translucent page," but elapsed time within the story is vague—one ritual cycle, no urgency. The timeframe enriches atmosphere and sets metaphorical stakes (extinction, preservation) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Present in setup and closure as lyric reprise, but no middle development where time pressure constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the sound of forgotten names" is signaled early ("the motivation that drove his entire existence"), dramatized in the repair action (fixing the chime to sustain the orchids that hold the names), and charged in the closure image (names drifting like rain to scavengers). The desire faces modest friction—Elian's isolation and the faint possibility of listeners "who might never arrive"—but no on-page moment where preserving the names conflicts with a competing want. Present in setup, development, and payoff with conceptual cost (endless duty) rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is defined on the page ("that beautiful, toxic sadness that comes from watching a miracle decay because there is no one left to witness it") and matches the story's melancholy, contemplative tone. The tone is coherent through the opening ritual, the repair sequence, and the closing meditation. However, the phrase itself is somewhat static—a single mood label rather than a tone that modulates with pressure or charges the final image through rhythmic shift. The metaphor is apt but the execution edges toward thematic tell rather than embodied tonal progression.</comment>
