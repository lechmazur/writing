<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her rejection of neural links shapes her climb. The interior texture is specific—"dissolving her physical form into the freezing vapor"—and the final choice to unstrap the regulatory pack shows genuine cost. However, the moment of slotting the keystone lacks embodied struggle or contradiction; it sigs rather than clicks, which reads as convenience. The transformation feels declared more than earned through visible internal conflict at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by paragraph one. The closure lands on-page with Charged Poise: Elara restores the arch, the Looms stutter, and she feels "slow, deliberate, and deeply, terrifyingly human" mana flow—a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (rejecting automated perfection). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ascent, archaic technique, regulatory unburdening, and the keystone placement, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sheds the brass pack, narrowing her safety in service of the impossible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire's "brilliant dimness" and "paradox of illumination" create a vivid, contradictory sensory field. The permafrost, rime-covered gap, and altitude's crushing pressure constrain Elara's final act: she must shed the regulatory pack to complete the task. The keystone's rough granite texture contrasts with synthetic crystals below, and the folly's marble/basalt incongruity charges the closure image when the luminance pours out and stabilizes the arch against the gale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple by restoring the folly—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara unstraps the regulatory pack, forfeiting system safety to finish. The cost is visible: she shivers unburdened, the pack clatters into the abyss, and the Looms stutter. However, the arch's restoration feels frictionless once the keystone is placed; no physical resistance or second complication tests her commitment at the apex, which caps escalation slightly below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—human craft versus automated perfection—emerges through concrete particulars: the "lingering luminance" versus synthetic crystals, heartbeats versus nanoseconds, the crude stone arch halting the Looms. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "only a flawed hand could touch the divine." No overt moralizing; the hum of wind through stone replaces generated music. The final image of Elara slumped, "bathed in the dying light of a magic that refused to fade," reweights prior material with quiet resonance and conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is controlled ("visual silence that screamed," "paradox of illumination"). Distance modulates purposefully: tight at the summit gasps, zooms to the city Looms' stutter, then returns to Elara's embodied closure. However, "It sighed" at the keystone placement introduces an external, unearned interiority—stone cannot sigh except as metaphor, yet the line reads as literal perception. Filter verbs ("felt the core concept") occasionally dull immediacy without voice justification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely propulsive with strong imagery: "wind did not blow so much as it bit," "ragged, archaic technique." Information density is high. However, multiple scaffold patterns appear: "not with weight, but with purpose" / "not with mortar, but with pure, suspended time"—template parallelism across two beats. "Brilliant dimness" recurs three times without on-page reweighting. The phrase "accommodates impossibilities" reads as prompt-label insertion. These artifacts cluster near closure, lowering line-level control and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The underachieving-mage-versus-automation premise is familiar, and the core plot—climbing to restore a ruin—echoes quest templates. However, specificity lifts execution: mist-walking as archaic dissolution, the regulatory pack as physical burden, "lingering luminance" as soul-imprint. The turn when the Looms stutter for "a single heartbeat" is fresh and ties stakes to consequence. The transformation test partially passes: swapping names would lose the mist-walk mechanics and luminance concept, but the emotional arc (misfit finds validation) remains generic without full lived-detail transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's underachieving-mage status is signaled early (branded for slow casting, refused neural links) and shapes her climb's tactics—she relies on mist-walking and stolen keystone rather than purchased flight-spells. Her choice to unstrap the regulatory pack narrows options and the final act of placing the keystone alters the Looms' function. Present across three beats (city rejection, ascent method, closure action) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is conceptual (system rejection) but visible on-page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The keystone appears in paragraph four (museum theft mention), is described in tactile detail ("rough-hewn wedge," "lingering luminance"), and is physically handled at the climax when Elara slots it into the apex. It drives two distinct beats: the theft backstory primes motivation, and the placement triggers the arch's restoration and Looms' stutter. The object's unique property—soul-imprint the machines cannot replicate—matters causally. Present in closure with visible cost (regulatory pack shed to use it). High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is defined on-page as "faint warmth, spectral light" within the keystone, a soul-imprint machines cannot replicate. It shapes stakes (find the sacred) and tactics (Elara must use this stone, not synthetic crystals). At closure, the luminance "poured out, connecting the marble fragments... with pure, suspended time," which stops the Looms and validates her rejection of automation. The concept narrows options (only this stone works) and charges the final image. Present across setup, middle, and payoff with causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is declared as the spire's "singular attribute" in paragraph six but introduced late (second half). It enables the keystone placement (granite withstands crushing pressure, fragments connect via suspended time) but reads as prompt-label convenience rather than earned rule. No prior grounding: altitude and ancient intent are asserted, not dramatized through earlier friction or cost. The trait enables closure but lacks specificity; any "magic-amplifying location" could replace it. Present in one beat (closure setup) with swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unstrapping the regulatory pack is a pivotal on-page action: Elara "began to unstrap the heavy brass buckles across her chest. The metal clattered onto the ice, sliding away into the abyss, leaving her shivering but unburdened." This forfeits system safety, narrows options (no magical suppression safety net), and enables the keystone's resonance to complete the folly. The action shapes two beats: decision under pressure and immediate physical consequence (shivering, unburdened). Present in closure sequence with visible cost and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mist-walking is signaled early (paragraph two) with specific mechanics: "dissolving her physical form into the freezing vapor... before reassembling her solid mass on a higher ledge." Each transition "tore at her stamina," showing cost. The method is essential to the ascent (she cannot afford flight-spells) and shapes two beats: the climb's middle struggle and her gasping arrival at the summit. However, it does not return or constrain the closure action; once she reaches the peak, it disappears. Present in setup and development with causal pressure but no payoff participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire shapes every beat: altitude's crushing pressure justifies why the folly's magic matters ("laws of physics here were thin"), the permafrost and rime-covered gap require physical effort, and the "gale" tests the restored arch's hold at closure. The spire's elevation above the city creates spatial stakes (underachieving mage climbs where machines hum below). The environment constrains tactics (Elara must shed the regulatory pack due to atmospheric pressure) and charges the final image when the folly "held firm against the gale." Present across setup, development, and payoff with high causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When creativity gets automated into efficiency curves" is declared in paragraph one as the city's present condition, establishing thematic context. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a clock. Elara's ascent has no deadline; the Looms hum ceaselessly but do not pressure her actions. The automation backstory motivates her rejection but does not constrain tactics on-page. Present in setup as context but absent from development and payoff. Swappable with any "dystopian magic-tech society" framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the simple" is stated explicitly ("She was here to find the sacred in the simple") and dramatized through Elara's theft of the crude granite keystone versus synthetic crystals. The motivation drives two key choices: climbing without flight-spells (archaic technique) and shedding the regulatory pack to complete the folly. At closure, she achieves the goal—"simply put a stone back where it belonged"—with visible cost (system rejection, physical exhaustion). Friction: the phrase "find the sacred in the simple" reads as thematic tell rather than fully embodied want-versus-fear conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is established early as the spire's "strange quality... where pale starlight reflected off glacial ice with intensity that felt brighter than the sun, despite deep twilight shadows." The tone recurs at closure when "brilliant dimness flared, turning violet shadows into blinding white that carried no heat." It modulates with pressure: calm paradox at arrival, explosive flare at keystone placement, stabilized glow at rest. The tone charges the final image and supports the impossible-accommodation attribute. However, "brilliant dimness" is repeated three times without reweighting, reading as motif-label rather than evolving sensory experience.</comment>
