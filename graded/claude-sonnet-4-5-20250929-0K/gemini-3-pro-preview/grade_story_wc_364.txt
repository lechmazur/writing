<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ewan's characterization is consistent—meek blacksmith who finds resolve—but his interiority remains thin. The motivation ("to coax resilience from rubble") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final return to the forge reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost; we see no internal friction or price paid for his secret heroism. Decent baseline, but lacks the embodied complexity and earned renunciation needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening window. The causal chain is intact: Ewan retrieves the silk, descends, wraps the core, trades illusion for truth, and the planet stabilizes—each beat follows from the prior. Closure lands on-page (the core flares, arches realign, Ewan returns) with a felt cost (the silk dissolves, the trade accepted), satisfying Decisive Change under a Causal lens. Minor issue: the barter mechanism ("paradoxical value," "perfect lie for harsh truth") is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly softening the cost's visibility. Solid execution with one conceptual seam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, mine shafts, and geode chamber are vividly rendered with selective detail. Gravity fluctuation and "surreal viscosity" are striking. The setting constrains Ewan's descent (he must use the silk spool, navigate unstable gravity) and the central geode is the fulcrum of closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from surface to core compresses quickly. Meets the 9+ gate test (environment constrains choice and charges the final image), but minor propulsion gaps and one vague phrase ("timeframe between understanding and confusion") hold it just below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: save the harvest/planet before it breaks apart. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ewan enters the geode and must offer the correct barter. The silk-for-truth trade narrows options with visible cost (the silk dissolves, irretrievable). However, the escalation is brief; we move from surface to solution without sustained resistance or a second reversal. The final act is Ewan's agency (he chooses the trade), and the cost is legible (the trickster's tool sacrificed). Solid causal pressure, but lacks a second complication or visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of illusion traded for resilience emerges through the silk barter and Ewan's quiet heroism. The final image (blue light, unacknowledged savior) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "coax resilience from rubble" and "azure defiance" flirt with abstraction, and the barter's symbolic neatness ("perfect lie for harsh truth") edges toward allegory. The piece resists tidy closure (Ewan remains anonymous), which strengthens resonance. Theme is coherent but not deeply integrated into micro-choices; it rests more on the premise than on accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, with phrases like "spider-glass and theatrical whispers" and "azure defiance" establishing a slightly elevated register consistent with the speculative setting. The single line of dialogue ("Take this…") reads functional. However, psychic distance remains fixed; under peak stress (the descent, the barter) we get description rather than degraded perception or embodied thought. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—Ewan's way of noticing doesn't shift from his baseline composure. Clean execution, minor missed opportunity for voice modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, several lines loop or restate: "He was quietly determined, possessing a fortitude…" closely paraphrases the prior sentence; "The trade he offered was the sacrifice…" / "He wrapped the deceptive, unbreakable silk…" / "'Take this,' he whispered…" all recount the same action across three beats. Template cadence appears in the descent sequence ("He paused… He tied… He lowered…"). Stock metaphor "the universe seemed to hold its breath" and elevated register ("azure defiance," "transmuting") in peak beats drift from Ewan's focalization. Functional clarity, but loops and figurative overreach in high-pressure moments prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orchard-planet premise and barter-awakening mechanic offer a fresh synthesis of portal-fantasy and planetary engineering. The Magician's silk as both illusion and tensile strength is a smart fusion. However, the one-descent structure and solo-hero arc follow familiar quest logic. Emotional truth is present but not deeply particular—Ewan's meekness and resolve read archetypal rather than lived-in. The barter's symbolic neatness (lie for truth) leans allegorical. Solid freshness in premise, moderate execution of stakes and character specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ewan is named in paragraph two, his trait established early. He makes the key choice to descend and offer the barter, driving the climax. His meekness contrasts with the decisive act, charging the closure when he returns to anonymity. Present in setup, middle descent, and ending return—all three gates. However, his on-page decisions are few (walk to perimeter, descend, wrap silk, return); much of the arc is physical action rather than value-weighted micro-choices. Shapes one major turn with modest causal layering. Mid-band: essential to plot, but not irreplaceable in character texture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silk appears early (paragraph twelve), is handled concretely (tied, lowered, wrapped), and undergoes transformation at closure (dissolves into energy veins). Present in setup (retrieval), development (descent tool), and payoff (barter consummation). Its dual nature—illusion with tensile strength—matters causally: it enables the descent and embodies the paradox the planet requires. Two distinct beats (descent, barter) with closure linkage. The specificity (spider-glass, theatrical whispers) is high; swapping it would require rewriting the barter logic. Strong integration, shy of indispensable only because the barter mechanism itself is lightly dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings is named explicitly ("The ancient mechanics…operated on the core concept of bartered awakenings") and governs the climax (Ewan trades silk for gravity). Present in setup (paragraph eighteen explains it) and payoff (the trade is accepted). However, it is told rather than demonstrated—we don't see competing barters, failure modes, or Ewan puzzling out what counts as "paradoxical value." The concept frames the stakes but doesn't constrain tactics; Ewan arrives with the silk already in hand. Functional but closer to backdrop than active pressure. Mid-low: present and causal at one key beat, but not developed or tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" appears as a label (paragraph eight) and is consistent with Ewan's actions (deliberate walk, descent, silent trade). The trait enables his choice to proceed alone against panic. However, it is not tested or constrained—no moment where his quiet resolve costs him speed, alliance, or acknowledgment in a way that alters tactics. The final return to the forge reflects the trait but as confirmation rather than trade-off. Present in setup and closure echo, minimal middle friction. Functional, but label-heavy and not irreplaceable; a synonym trait (steadfast, patient) would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Deliberate" is instantiated on-page: "His action was deliberate, placing one heavy boot in front…" and the careful wrapping of the silk. It defines Ewan's approach and contrasts with the panicked crowds. Present throughout (walk, descent, barter, return). However, the specificity is modest—most heroic descents require deliberation. The trait shapes tone and pacing but doesn't create a unique turn; swapping it for "methodical" or "careful" would require only line-level edits. Solid presence across beats, but not irreplaceable. Upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mine shafts are signaled early (paragraph nine: "His destination was the gaping maw…") and provide the physical path to the core. They constrain Ewan's route (he must descend through unstable gravity) and are causally necessary—the core is inaccessible otherwise. Present in setup, used in middle descent, implicit at closure. However, their mechanics are summary-level (we don't see alternate routes closed or shaft-specific obstacles). Functional and somewhat irreplaceable (the surface can't access the core), but not maximally charged. Solid integration, one step below essential due to light dramatization of route-choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are established in the opening line and frame the entire crisis. The arches' instability is the inciting threat; their realignment is the visible closure payoff ("floating arches above began to realign"). The apple trees' survival is the human-scale stake. Setting is causally active: the planet's structure forces the descent, the geode houses the engine, and the restored gravity stabilizes the arches. Present in setup, middle (descent through root systems), and ending image (shadows over apple trees). Specific and irreplaceable—removing the orchard-planet premise would collapse the plot. Strong integration across all three gates with closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" appears once (paragraph fifteen) as a descriptor of the surreal descent atmosphere. It does not function as a ticking clock or constrain Ewan's choices—there is no deadline pressure or time-sensitive tactic. The phrase is abstract and ornamental, more tonal than mechanical. Absent from setup and closure; mentioned in one middle beat without causal force. Swappable with any atmospheric phrase. Low score: present but not functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ewan's motivation—"to coax resilience from rubble before the harvest was lost entirely"—is stated in paragraph five and drives his entire arc. It explains why he walks toward the perimeter and descends into the mine. Present in setup and implicit at closure (the harvest saved, resilience coaxed). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or tested through a choice that sacrifices something else he values. No on-page friction between this desire and, say, self-preservation or doubt. Functional and plot-driving, but thin on embodied conflict. Mid-band: causal but not irreplaceable in texture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" is named explicitly in the climax ("cool, stabilizing tone of azure defiance") and colors the ending's emotional register. The tone—quiet heroism, refusal of decay—is coherent from Ewan's resolve through the final return to the forge. However, "azure defiance" arrives late (paragraph twenty-nine) and reads ornamental; the defiance could be red, silver, or uncolored without changing stakes. Tone is consistent but not modulated—no tonal shift under pressure. Present at closure with modest charge, but not irreplaceable. Upper mid-band for coherence, capped by late signal and limited causal role.</comment>
