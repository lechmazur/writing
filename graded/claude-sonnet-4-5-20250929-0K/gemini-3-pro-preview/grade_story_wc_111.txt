<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is concrete and his actions embody the central stake without therapy-speak. The sub-prefect remains functional but somewhat flat, serving primarily as foil. Elian's pragmatism shows in embodied choices (kneeling, polishing, building the cairn) that avoid moralizing. The backstory of fraudulent marbles integrates cleanly via present action, grounding his penance without derailing momentum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: Elian, the maze, the sub-prefect's gauge by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Situational-Accumulative hybrid: pressure from the "statistically dead" verdict accumulates through Elian's ritual until the marble-prism moment crystallizes his stance and validates his method with visible physical effect (leaf revival, gauge confusion). Closure is Charged Poise / Conceptual Repricing: the final exchange and image ("broken tools cast the brightest light") reweights the luck-versus-care premise with felt cost (decades of penance, patient labor) legible on the page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Helix Maze provides spatial constraint and sensory texture ("blooming withering" scent, high walls that limit sunlight). The marble's physical properties—cracked glass, precise angle—directly enable the climactic light-refraction that alters the leaf's state and confuses the sub-prefect's sensor. Micro-setting (the flat paving stone, the narrow shaft of light) charges the final image. Selective detail (gnarled knuckles, canvas apron) reflects Elian's priorities without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: proving that intentional care, not measurable luck, sustains the garden. Pressure tightens when Elian's silence and ritual confront the sub-prefect's prediction of "total necrosis." The marble-polishing and cairn-building are goal-driven actions under constraint (narrow sunlight window, ambient "luck quotient" at zero). The leaf's visible revival and the sub-prefect's flustered "anomaly" constitute a meaningful reversal with on-page consequence. Cost is legible in Elian's decades-long penance and the elaborate ritual itself, which forecloses easier paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: broken marbles repurposed, light refracted through flaws, gardens responding to touch rather than algorithm. The closing line ("broken tools cast the brightest light") reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in Elian's silence, the sub-prefect's frustrated tapping, and the juxtaposition of "blooming withering." No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak in the final paragraph; the image of the warm, glowing glass does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elian's perceptual signature (gnarled knuckles, "subtle mechanics of life"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the sub-prefect's technocratic diction contrasts with Elian's earthy pragmatism. Psychic distance tightens during the ritual sequence. Diction stays within Elian's lexicon; elevated phrasing ("commemorating small victories elaborately," "blooming withering") reads as narratorial voice consistent with the story's texture. One minor filter-verb cluster ("watched as," "seemed to") in the climax slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong sensory specificity ("sharp tang of fermentation," "hungry light"). Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates during the ritual sequence. A few adjacent lines restate concepts with slight synonym variation ("broken tools" / "emptiness inside" / "fracture"; "luck quotient" / "metaphysical luck") that add −0.3. One paraphrase loop in the backstory paragraph ("concentrated vessels of good fortune" / "profitable lie" / "exposing his fraud") adds another −0.2. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high; no scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core synthesis—fraudulent luck charms repurposed as light-focusing tools to sustain a dying garden in a world where luck is quantified—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "luck versus skill" trope through concrete physics (refraction via cracked glass) and a post-algorithmic setting. The marble's transformation from symbol of deceit to functional optics feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the extended descriptive texture and the juxtaposition of technocracy versus horticulture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian drives all key beats: kneeling, selecting the marble, polishing, building the cairn, calculating the angle of incidence, and delivering the closing line. His choice to perform the elaborate ritual rather than argue shapes the escalation and delivers the climax. Present from the opening, active in every beat, and central to the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marbles appear in three distinct beats: spilled onto the paving stone, one selected and polished, and placed atop the cairn to refract light. Their backstory as fraudulent luck vessels reweights their present function as optical tools. The cracked marble's specific property (internal fissure that catches and intensifies light) is indispensable to the climax; removing it collapses the causal chain and the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is the story's engine: Elian's former fraud becomes the tool of penance and proof. The concept shapes his motivation, the marble's function, and the final thematic repricing ("broken tools cast the brightest light"). It appears early, drives the middle ritual, and articulates the closure. The cost—decades of guilt, elaborate compensation—is visible throughout. Swapping this for another concept would dismantle the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is demonstrated in Elian's refusal to argue ("did not argue, for he was wisely pragmatic") and his choice to act rather than speak. This trait enables the ritual sequence and shapes his interaction with the sub-prefect. It appears early and constrains his approach, though the cost tied to pragmatism itself is less visible than the cost tied to the broader penance arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Polishing the marble is a distinct, extended action that prepares the glass for light refraction. The act is deliberate ("slow, deliberate movements," "scouring away the dust") and causally essential to the climax: only the polished surface can refract the narrow sunlight beam. The action appears mid-story and pays off at closure. Removing or swapping it would break the physical logic of the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" frames the entire ritual sequence (cairn-building, precise marble placement) and is signaled early as "his ritual." The method's mechanics—treating "the placement of each stone with the gravity one might accord a coronation"—matter to the light-angle calculation and thematic resonance. It shapes Elian's approach across multiple beats and charges the closure with visible cost (time, labor, penance).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Helix Maze provides spatial constraint (high walls that limit sunlight to a narrow, fleeting shaft), sensory atmosphere ("blooming withering"), and the physical logic for Elian's angle calculation. The maze's "dormant wisteria" and "desiccated stretch of ivy" are the stakes' material ground. The setting enables the climax (light refraction depends on maze geometry) and charges the final image with accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after luck becomes measurable," "the era when luck became measurable") establishes the story's premise and conflict: Elian's pre-algorithmic fraud versus the sub-prefect's metrics. It shapes the sub-prefect's presence and the tension between old care and new quantification. The timeframe is signaled early and informs the stakes, though it does not tighten a live clock or alter tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian's desire "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" is dramatized through every action: ignoring the sub-prefect, building the cairn, calculating the sunlight angle, and reviving the leaf. The motivation is stated explicitly ("His motivation was simple yet stubborn") but grounded in choice and friction (the sub-prefect's skepticism, the algorithmic verdict, decades of penance). The proof's success—visible leaf revival—delivers the closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("a paradox of scent where the sharp tang of fermentation mingled intimately with the sweetness of new buds") and reprised in the final sentence ("The blooming withering continued all around them, a cycle of life fed by decay"). The tone modulates with pressure—contemplative during the ritual, charged during the light-refraction moment—and coheres through the piece's central paradox of life-from-death, charging the closure image.</comment>
