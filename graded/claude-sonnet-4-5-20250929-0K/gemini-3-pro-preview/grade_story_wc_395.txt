<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas's obsession is clearly motivated and his micro-choices under pressure (the lie to the drone, gripping the patch) reveal hierarchy of values. The "brightly attentive" facade is embodied rather than labeled. Interior texture remains consistent throughout, though the final horror feels slightly summarized rather than somatically lived. The choice to proceed after the drone encounter carries visible cost and narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the recurring numbers lead to audio layering, which yields coordinates, which unlock the hidden partition. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—discovery of trapped consciousnesses—lands on the page with conceptual horror as cost, and the grip on the patch charges the final image. One meaningful tightening (drone encounter → merge execution → revelation) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian console, server stacks, monitor drone, and "stagnant ocean" of profiles create a coherent digital archive. The mission patch functions as micro-setting, anchoring Silas through tactile detail and charging the ending when he grips it "until his knuckles turned white." Spatial choreography (console, drone hovering into peripheral vision, shadows of server stacks) remains clear. The archive's oppressive atmosphere supports the tone without excess decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where deleted files go—is signaled early and tightens through the drone encounter (risk of exposure) to the merge attempt. The lie is agency under pressure; discovery of the "archived assets" forecloses innocence and imposes conceptual cost. The recurring numbers function as a credible constraint that shapes his method. One reversal (thinking he'd found deletion, discovering enslavement instead) narrows options with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of surveillance totalitarianism and corporate capture emerges through concrete action—the recurring numbers as hidden distress signal, the black site partition, profiles tagged as "assets." The mission patch recurs with shifting weight (focus anchor → horror anchor). The ending image (gripping the patch, crew staring back) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "where deleted things go" without stating a moral. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (widening for the drone, tightening for the merge). The "brightly attentive" mask and the drone's flat synthesis create distinct voices. Perceptual signature is selective: Silas notices metadata patterns, file sizes, pixel dimensions—details fitting a memory keeper. The lie reads natural and goal-driven. Minor filter-verb density ("sensed absence," "felt") in the opening beat slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance plot or atmosphere. Minor issues: "distinct and pressure-filled feeling" is slightly abstract; "adrenaline leaving a metallic taste" is stock. The phrase "sensed absence" recurs but serves the tone rather than looping content. "The silence of the room deepened, emphasizing the sensed absence" paraphrases the opening motif without added pressure (−0.2). No loops or scaffold mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—consciousnesses uploaded and held hostage—transforms familiar surveillance dystopia through the specificity of the recurring-number distress signal embedded in upload metadata. The drone encounter and the audio-waveform merge are purposeful rather than templated. The final image (crew as "archived assets") feels earned in hindsight. Minor proximity to Black Mirror–style tech horror and the stock "metallic taste" phrase limit freshness slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's role as corporate memory keeper is established in the opening line and shapes every beat: his jurisdiction over the archive grants access, his maintenance authority enables the unauthorized query, and his corporate position creates the ironic horror when he realizes he "served" the captors. His decision to lie (constrains) and his choice to execute the merge (enables) are key turns. The final grip on the patch is a choice under the new knowledge. Present in setup, middle (lie), and ending (realization of complicity).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats: initial grounding ("rubbed his thumb over the fraying edge"), the lie to the drone (implicit anchor for his focus), and the ending ("gripped...until his knuckles turned white"). It functions as a tactile anchor and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (innocence → complicity). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves primarily as a symbolic touchstone. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but no causal pressure (−0.7), yielding mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case is the inciting motivation, named in paragraph two and driving Silas's obsession. It shapes his tactics (tracking metadata anomalies, audio layering) and the revelation that the crew was hijacked rather than crashed redefines the stakes at closure. The case moves from "unsolvable" mystery to corporate crime, and the final image of the crew as "archived assets" directly answers the case. Setup early, drives two middle beats (number-tracking, audio merge), and articulates the closure consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is embodied in one key beat: Silas "widened his eyes and forced a sharp, eager smile" to project compliance, and the drone's biometric scan validates the facade. This enables him to proceed without triggering an alert, altering his immediate tactic. However, it does not appear in setup or return at closure; its involvement is limited to one middle action. Present in middle development, one beat involvement +0.4, causal enabling +0.8, but missing setup (−0.4) and no closure link (−0.7), placing it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lie to the drone is the story's hinge: it enables Silas to continue the merge and reach the revelation. Without it, discovery halts. The lie is prepared (he "did not hesitate"), dramatized in dialogue, and tested (biometric scan). It drives one major turn and is irreplaceable—no other action would satisfy the drone's authority. Setup via the drone's arrival, middle execution, and its success permits the ending discovery. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though it does not reappear in the final image itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (`04-21-X`) are introduced early as metadata anomaly, drive Silas's method (tracking across file sizes, durations, pixel dimensions), and culminate in the realization that they encode a distress signal. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (layering audio to isolate the coordinates), and it redefines the crash as hijacking. Present in setup, shapes two middle beats (tracking, audio merge), and articulates the closure revelation. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity; no alternative method would yield the same discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The social network archive is established in the opening ("vast, stagnant ocean," "profiles drifted like shipwrecks") and provides the resources (corrupted images, error logs, forgotten songs) and constraints (monitor drone, unauthorized query risk) that shape Silas's tactics. The archive's black site partition is the closure discovery. The setting is not merely backdrop; it supplies the method (network upload stream) and the horror (profiles as "archived assets"). Setup, middle pressure (drone enforcement), and ending revelation all depend on this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" functions as a thematic descriptor for the audio files spanning decades but does not impose a ticking clock or tighten decisions. Time is vague ("months," "decades ago") and does not pressure Silas's choices in the present scene. The phrase enriches atmosphere but remains ornamental; removing it would not alter tactics or stakes. Present as setup flavor, but no middle tightening or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to find where deleted files go—is stated early, drives Silas's obsession and every tactical choice (tracking numbers, audio layering, executing the merge despite risk), and the ending directly answers it with horrifying specificity. The motivation is dramatized through his choices under pressure (lying to the drone, proceeding with the merge) and the final discovery imposes conceptual cost (complicity, horror). Setup, middle agency, and closure all trace to this desire. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone of "sensed absence" is established in the opening ("heavy with a sensed absence...a billion voices having just fallen quiet") and recurs at key beats ("the silence of the room deepened, emphasizing the sensed absence"). It modulates appropriately: quiet dread during tracking, tension during the drone encounter, and horror at the revelation of suspended profiles. The tone charges the final image (crew "staring back") without becoming static. Coherent through turns, with purposeful intensification at closure.</comment>
