<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" drives her descent and final discovery, but her internal contradictions remain abstract—"borrowed time" is label-only until the shard stills it. The closing epiphany ("abrasive like ash") feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority operates at a cerebral, slightly diagnostic register ("obsession," "anticipated mysteries") that flattens crisis affect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates world-detail and imagery until the shard triggers a cadence shift and conceptual repricing—death as "unchangeable integer" reweights the chaotic premise. Closure lands with felt cost (her "borrowed time" aligns, forecloses frantic pace) and the final image is resonant. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Emerald Silo, toxic skyline, borrowed-time role). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the because/therefore linkage from message → descent → shard is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Emerald Silo's verdant gloom, pulsing lights, and shifting walls supply concrete sensory pressure; the shard's rough ceramic and the scorched titanium capsule charge the final image and constrain Elara's choice to pocket it. Spatial choreography (apex → sub-basement → loading dock) tracks cleanly. The "toxic green skyline" and "heavy air" cue the altered reality without catalog excess, and the sudden clarity of glass at the end visually registers the conceptual shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rediscovering "solid world" / fixing her fractured timeline. The covert-message setup establishes the hunt; the response triggers descent; the shard discovery tightens options by offering a stabilization key. One reversal (capsule "failed" yet delivered a lesson) narrows her path. Cost is visible (her frantic borrowed seconds slow, aligning with stillness), but the peak choice—pocketing the shard—feels more like acquisition than a trade-off with visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: death as the sole stable equation in a world of variables, time's texture as "abrasive like ash, defined by what it eroded." The urn fragment anchors this conceptually without overt moralizing. The final image (emerald glass now clear, "calculated resolve") reweights prior chaos with a non-literal answer. No Thematic Echo penalties; the closing lines avoid prompt-label language and stay rooted in scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (numbers as sensations, "zero" as hum) and lexicon stays consistent—slightly elevated but character-apt for a timekeeper. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the shard moment. Minor register drift: "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "chronologies of the elite" edge toward exposition-speak in the opening, but voice recovers and the closing rhythm ("abrasive like ash") carries distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are solid; information density is high. Two paraphrase loops: "toxic green skyline churn with illogical storms" / "fluctuating mathematics of the atmosphere" (lines 1–3), and "texture of time passing" / "gritty, linear progression rather than slippery, subjective fog" (line 5) restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the descent sequence ("She descended… her heart racing… She knelt… her hands shaking") stacks participles across three moves. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy; cumulative penalty −0.3 for loops, −0.4 for template stems = −0.7 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-logic catastrophe, borrowed-time existence, and funerary object as anchor is specific and non-obvious. The covert dark-mesh trade method and "garage sale item descriptions" offer fresh tactical detail. The final turn—death as invariant—feels earned in hindsight. Conceptual integrity is strong; the piece commits fully to its altered-math premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking (fragmented reality, abstract stakes) heightens without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's choices (embedding the message, descending, gripping the shard, pocketing it) create key turns across three beats. Early signal (line 3), middle development (descent decision), closure participation (shard enables stabilization key). Her agency drives the hunt and the final resolve. Causal pressure is present but the peak choice feels more discovery than dilemma; visible cost is opportunity (forecloses frantic borrowed time) rather than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in two distinct beats: discovery (lines 14–15) and grip/realization (lines 16–22). It halts the Silo's lights, anchors the climax, and charges the closure image with "abrasive like ash" specificity. Early signal is absent (arrives ~60% through), but transformation is undeniable—death's "singular integer" reweights the entire premise. Irreplaceability is high; no generic relic could deliver this thematic/causal load. Late penalty −0.5, but causal + closure + specificity lift score solidly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule frames the entire descent, supplies the breach Elara reaches into, and delivers the urn shard that solves her quest. Present in setup (via "response" directing her), middle (loading dock discovery), and ending (lesson extracted). Its failure-yet-delivery paradox drives the thematic turn. Causal pressure is strong; removing it would collapse the retrieval logic and the contrast between failed preservation and successful lesson.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" manifests on-page when the Silo's lights cease and walls halt (line 16), enabling Elara to "rediscover the sensation of a fixed point" and feel "a genuine second ticking by." The attribute constrains her fractured timeline, forces alignment, and charges the closure image (clear glass, calculated resolve). Setup is implicit in "slippery, subjective fog"; development is the shard-triggered stillness; closure shows her pocketing the key. Cost: borrowed time slows, forecloses frantic pace. High irreplaceability; the attribute is the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears as her primary motivation (line 5) and is actualized twice: she "rediscovers a piece of the solid world" (line 10) and "rediscovers the sensation of a fixed point" (line 19). The shard enables rediscovery; without it, no closure. Present across all three gates (setup, middle grip, ending stabilization). Causal role is strong but the action itself is passive receipt rather than effortful agency, capping mid-7s despite closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (lines 6–8: "embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions"), triggers the response that directs her descent (line 9), and thus enables the entire retrieval sequence. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is indirect (the shard she finds was delivered via this method's fruit). Mechanics matter (covert syntax alerts seekers) but the method itself does not constrain peak choices—once the response arrives, the method recedes. Mid-band; functional but not indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Emerald Silo supplies the apex vantage, verdant gloom, pulsing lights, shifting walls, and sub-basement loading dock—each location-beat advances pressure. The setting's instability contrasts with the shard's stillness, charging the final image when glass "now appeared clear and sharp." Spatial choreography (apex → descent → dock) is coherent and the environment actively shapes Elara's perception and final resolve. Present in all three gates; causal and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers changed meaning" anchors world logic (lines 1–2) and primes Elara's quest for linear time. The altered-reality premise tightens her need and the shard's resolution reweights it. Setup is clear; development shows borrowed-time mechanics under pressure; closure delivers the timeless moment that restores fixed sensation. The timeframe is conceptual rather than a live ticking clock, so tactical urgency is lower, but thematic integration is solid.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated early (line 5), dramatized in her descent and grip (lines 10–20), and answered in the closing epiphany ("abrasive like ash, defined by what it eroded"). Setup, development (hunt and discovery choices), and closure all hinge on this desire. Friction between want (solid time) and cost (borrowed seconds align, forecloses frantic pace) is visible. The motivation shapes every major beat and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone: "anticipated mysteries" coheres through the covert-message tease (line 8), the descent into "verdant gloom" with "heart racing" (line 10), and the climactic discovery that fulfills anticipation with a conceptual charge rather than melodrama. Modulation is purposeful: anticipation → stillness → resolve. The tone supports the accumulative lens and charges the final image (clear glass, calculated resolve). Present across all gates; consistent and ending-aligned, but static mystery-register limits upper reach.</comment>
