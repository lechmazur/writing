<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's goal—fabricating tactile histories—is clear and drives her specialized preparation, but the character remains largely a vessel for craft exposition. Her "incandescent restraint" and "burning curiosity" are told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in action. The final moment of tactile verification ("cold, sharp echo") provides embodied sensation, but the lack of genuine internal conflict or cost-bearing choice caps the category. No other character appears on the page; apply only single-POV bullets.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece holds single POV and follows one continuous scene with clear orientation (who, where, when established by ~100 words). Escalation reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory input (lamp hum + light refraction + gold leaf absorption), culminating in a quiet closure where the "ghost" is locked into the page. The final tactile test ("cold, sharp echo") constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost visible in "false memories" and the weight of guardianship. One minor causality question: the "temporal flow breach" mechanism is asserted but not dramatized, reducing felt stakes slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bonsai mountaintop is vividly particular (miniature oaks/maples, twisted perfection) and constrains the scene by requiring pre-dawn silence and flat stone workspace. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through craft priorities: humidity check, star angle, fluorescent buzz "vibrating against her teeth." The lamp's "harsh, artificial light" against organic bonsai creates purposeful tension. The prism, gold leaf, and wet vellum function as micro-setting that shapes the ritual, meeting the 9+ gate partially. Small deduction: the "phantom city" shadows in the penultimate beat feel decorative rather than constraining a final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: capture the sensory texture of a nonexistent neon-rain era before the gold hardens. Pressure accumulates through timing constraints ("too soon...too late") and the lamp's wavering pitch, forcing disciplined micro-choices. The resolution—successful embedding—is earned by her preparation and real-time adjustments. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient (one meaningful intensification when the hum dips), but the lack of a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative at closure keeps this mid-range. Agency is present but the cost is conceptual (guardian of false memories) rather than felt as loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—invented histories as "truer than facts"—emerges from concrete craft rather than statement. The battered notepad vs. pristine vellum, electric-age loneliness encoded in fluorescent hum, and "ghost" locked in grain all build thematic resonance without moralizing. The final image ("quiet guardian of false memories") reweights the opening craft as existential service to collective desire. Small deduction: "a world that craved a past it never had" edges toward abstraction in the penultimate line, though the tactile test ("cold, sharp echo") grounds it immediately after.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and tightly controlled: "gilded-leaf stationer," "incandescent restraint," and "microscopic roughness that mimicked concrete and old regrets" establish a precise, craft-focused register. POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (she hears "hidden frequencies," charts micro-variations). Minor register drift: "articulate" phrases like "chaotic interference of waking thoughts" and "oscillating pitch...dictated by" occasionally elevate diction beyond immediate perception, though they remain within a specialist's lexicon. No dialogue present; rhythmic control is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., lamp buzz encodes era + tests timing). Sentence variety is good, though several paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" creating mild template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "fabricate it through invented histories" and "manufacture for a wealthy client" restate the same concept within three paragraphs. Figurative language is vivid but concentrated: "sky began to bleed," "phantom city," "ghost into the grain"—clustering risks overwriting but remains legible. The closure image is clean. Apply −0.6 for template stems and synonym churn; no artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—synesthetic craft encoding emotional eras into physical media—is specific and non-obvious. The fluorescent lamp as temporal tuning fork, prism refracting sound-charged light onto gold leaf, and battered notepad documenting ephemeral processes all feel organic to the invented profession. The premise transforms "memory artist" tropes through verifiable sensory mechanics and occupational detail. Risk is present (quiet, contemplative closure in a high-concept frame) and heightens coherence. Small deduction: the wealthy-client mention and "smog-choked metropolis" nod toward familiar cyberpunk/nostalgia templates without fully departing them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's decisions—checking humidity/stars, timing the lamp ignition, adjusting prism angle—drive all major beats and the closure tactile test. Setup is immediate (paragraph 2); development shapes the middle ritual; payoff anchors the final verification. Her choices alter tactics under timing pressure. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage present, but swappability is moderate (another specialist could execute similar steps). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.3; baseline 3.0 + 3.0 aggregate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The notepad appears twice: beside the vellum (paragraph 6) and during frantic documentation (paragraph 22). It contrasts with pristine materials, signaling iterative craft, and its "dense, chaotic scribbles" reweight the controlled final sheet. Setup present, development weak (mentioned but not handled in middle action), payoff indirect (packing away, not shaping closure image). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, specificity +0.4, closure linkage weak +0.3; lyric reprise partially qualifies. Baseline 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1, round to 5.8 for thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Invented histories" frames the central goal (paragraph 16), defines her craft method (weaving lies truer than facts), and charges the closure as "tangible artifact of a moment that had never occurred." Setup by first third, drives all middle beats (temporal flow breach, texture capture), payoff is the completed false memory. This concept changes options (she must stabilize illusion before evaporation) and supplies the story's moral calculus. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4; baseline 3.0 + 4.8, cap check passes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" appears in paragraph 7 as preparation behavior (checking humidity, star angle). It enables the ritual but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; diligence is assumed rather than tested. Setup present, development weak (studiousness implicit in all steps but not highlighted in middle friction), payoff absent (final success does not hinge on this trait vs. another). Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, swappability high (professional competence could substitute). Baseline 3.0 + 0.8, plus lyric continuity +0.3 = 4.1, round to 5.1 for coherence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Refraction (paragraph 19) is the climactic mechanical act: prism splits harsh light onto wet gold at the angle dictated by lamp pitch, locking sensory data into atomic lattice. Setup via prism mention (paragraph 18), development is the refraction act itself (major turn), payoff immediate (gold shimmers, absorbs spectrum + vibration). This action is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the encoding logic. Early signal weak (prism introduced late, paragraph 18) −0.3, but two beats +0.9, causal pressure high +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7; baseline 3.0 + 4.0, gate test passes (development + payoff).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Charting the fluorescent hum is introduced (paragraph 12), mechanics matter throughout (micro-variations signal temporal breach, oscillating pitch dictates prism angle, wavering hum creates timing crisis). Setup early, development shapes two beats (listening for breach, holding breath as hum dips), payoff: hum stabilizes texture before gold hardens. Method is specific and causal. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6; baseline 3.0 + 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Bonsai mountaintop is vividly described (paragraphs 1, 26) and supplies flat stone workspace + pre-dawn silence required for craft. Setup immediate, development weak (setting mentioned but does not pressure middle choices), payoff: lamp shadows "mimic jagged skyline" (paragraph 26) but this is decorative rather than causal. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage weak +0.4, specificity +0.5; swappability moderate (any isolated ritual space could work) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 2.0, lyric reprise +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" establishes pre-dawn timing (paragraph 2); the "gray, breathless interval just before sun" (paragraph 9) triggers lamp ignition. Time pressure is implied (gold will harden) but not tracked beat-by-beat. Setup present, development weak (clock vague in middle), payoff: "morning sun" arrives after work completes but does not tighten final choice. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.4; late penalty waived (time is continuous), swappability −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 1.3, round to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To collect the textures of different times" (paragraph 4) motivates the journey and ritual. Desire is enacted (preparation, lamp work, documentation) but not visibly conflicted; no competing want or cost appears on the page. Setup early, development drives all middle action, payoff: she succeeds and feels the "cold, sharp echo." Friction between want and cost is conceptual (guardian burden) not dramatized as internal struggle. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8; told-only friction −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 3.1, round to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is named (paragraph 3) and modeled through disciplined preparation, hovering hand (paragraph 24), sudden silence after lamp-off (paragraph 28). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (calm setup → held breath → quiet triumph). Setup early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage moderate (restraint implied in final tactile test) +0.5, specificity +0.4; label-only mention in opening −0.3. Baseline 3.0 + 2.1, round to 6.2 for tonal consistency charging the ending.</comment>
