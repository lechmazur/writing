<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and singular—finding the source of resilience—and her decision to fly during the Flux forecloses the grounded-pilot path. Her kneel-and-twist sequence at the sapling demonstrates agency under pressure. However, interiority is thin; we see bold action but little embodied contradiction or internal cost beyond physical disorientation. The final scramble reads more as escape than a choice that reveals competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (water-flow navigation teaches a discovery pattern). Closure lands on-page: Elara realigns the arrow tip, the tree erupts, and she carries "the song of life back home"—a Decisive Change with visible cost (scramble, time pressure, physical risk). Orientation anchors early (altimeter, Terrus IV, orchard pilot). One meaningful tightening: the Flux inverts gravity, forcing water-navigation, which leads to the amphitheater and the arrow tip solution. Cost is legible in the scramble and the physical eruption that pushes her back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, reversed waterfalls, and the magnetic-storm Flux create vivid, purposeful constraints that shape Elara's navigation choices. The skiff's magnetic boots and the underside landing demonstrate lived-in spatial logic. Sensory hierarchy is strong: metallic air, thinning atmosphere, whirling silence, humming arrow tip. The broken arrow tip—a small recurring object—charges the final image by grounding the sonic energy into soil, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find the source that survives the blight. One meaningful tightening: the Flux window forces immediate action, and water-flow navigation narrows her path to the amphitheater. The arrow-tip twist is protagonist-driven and alters the valley's fate. Cost is visible—she must scramble back as gravity inverts, risking the fall—but the escalation feels more environmental than a trade-off between competing goods. Agency is present but the moral calculus is light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: resilience arises not from silence but from resonant song channeled through an ancestral tuning fork. The "blight below was merely a silence" realization reweights the premise without moralizing. The arrow tip's shift from weapon to instrument offers conceptual depth. However, the sapling-to-tree eruption and "song of life" risk slight abstraction; the ending hovers near assertion rather than purely resonant image. No overt thematic echo, and the final question is non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "whirling silence," "thrum of blood in her ears," navigation by water flow. Diction stays grounded in Elara's orchard-pilot idiom. No dialogue to judge. The phrase "groped blindly" and "gnarled sapling" risk slight cliché, and "shattered emerald" + "garden of peace" lean decorative, but the core voice remains distinct and the compression under Flux pressure feels purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—every beat advances discovery or stakes. However, figurative language clusters in the opening and amphitheater paragraphs: "shattered emerald," "groped blindly," "garden of peace," "harmonic chord that vibrated through her bones." Mixed metaphor: "unspooling upward in shimmering, cohesive ribbons" + "liquid guide" + "vein" overloads the water image. "Whirling silence" is paradoxical but unclear—does it mean rotating quiet or chaotic hush? These artifacts dull immediacy in peak beats, triggering −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—orchard pilot, floating arches, gravity inversion, water-flow navigation, sonic agriculture—is specific and non-obvious. Navigating by reversed irrigation streams during the Flux is a fresh inflection that grows organically from the premise. The arrow tip as ancestral tuning fork rather than weapon transforms a familiar object. Risk-taking (whirling silence, unconventional navigation method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise and follows the implications to closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara is introduced in paragraph one, frames the entire journey, and her choices—throttling forward during the Flux, navigating by water, twisting the arrow tip—drive all three major beats. Present in the scramble-and-fall closure. Her decisions alter tactics (disengaging the nav computer, aligning with water, realigning the artifact). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the interiority is thin, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears in the amphitheater discovery (beat two), is handled and twisted (beat three, altering the signal), and its realignment directly causes the tree eruption and the valley's salvation at closure. Early seed: "massive floating rock arches" and "magnetic storm" prime the sonic/vibrational logic. The tip's shift from "weapon of war" to "tuning fork" reweights its meaning. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity (jagged metal, humming resonance, embedded in roots). Cost is tied to the element: Elara risks the scramble to realign it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Gathering of Echoes" is named and described in the amphitheater paragraph, where "the planet's acoustic history was trapped and concentrated by the gravitational warp." It enables the discovery (the sonic vortex holds the arrow tip and sapling) and shapes the resolution: the trapped echoes, when channeled, accelerate growth. The realization "the blight below was merely a silence" ties the concept to stakes. Present across discovery and closure, with visible cost (disorientation, scramble). However, "whirling silence" as description is paradoxical and slightly unclear, reducing specificity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plant-growth acceleration is explained in the amphitheater beat: "This specific vibration... accelerates plant growth by stimulating cellular division at an exponentially increased rate." The sapling's blur-edged leaves and eruption into a mature tree in "mere seconds" dramatize the trait on the page. The trait enables the resolution—Elara realigns the arrow to "broadcast the signal downward toward the dying farms," saving the crops. Cost: she must scramble back as the eruption pushes her. Setup (via blight mention), middle mechanics, and closure all present. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Discover" structures the entire arc: Elara's explicit motivation is "to find the source of resilience," the water-flow navigation is discovery-by-seeking, the amphitheater and arrow tip are the discovered objects, and the final realization—"the blight below was merely a silence"—is the discovered truth. The action is signaled in paragraph one and shapes all three beats. The twist and broadcast are applications of the discovery. Removing "discover" would collapse the logic. High causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Water-flow navigation is introduced in paragraph two: "she began navigating by water flow... aligning her nose with a crystalline vein of water." The method's mechanics matter—"shimmering, cohesive ribbons that sought the center of the magnetic disturbance" guide her to the amphitheater. It enables the middle beat (reaching the convergence of three waterfalls) and primes the closure scramble ("streams of water began to waver"). Early signal, middle constraint, and closure linkage all present. The method is irreplaceable—no other cue could plausibly lead her through the magnetic chaos.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches are anchored in paragraph one and recur across all beats: the narrow gaps Elara has dusted, the granite arch through which she navigates, the underside platform where she lands with magnetic boots. The arches structure the spatial logic of the Flux and the amphitheater's suspension "in the void." At closure, "the sky reclaimed its floor" ties the inverted architecture to the ending image. Strong setup, middle choreography, and closure charge. Environment constrains choices (navigation, landing) and charges the final fall.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The one-hour Flux window is introduced in paragraph one: "the terrifying window when gravity inverts for an hour." Time pressure tightens the middle beat—Elara must navigate and act before the inversion ends. At closure, "the streams of water began to waver as the hour concluded and gravity prepared to right itself" triggers her scramble. The clock is tracked and shapes tactics (throttle forward, scramble back). Strong setup, middle pressure, and closure participation. Visible cost: she risks being caught mid-action when gravity flips back.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find the source of resilience that allowed the forbidden Elder Groves to survive the blight"—is stated in paragraph one and drives every choice: flying during the Flux, navigating by water, approaching the sapling, twisting the arrow tip. The motivation is tested by physical disorientation and time pressure. At closure, "her mission complete," she has found and redirected the source. Setup, middle friction (disorientation, scramble), and closure satisfaction all present. Cost is tied to the pursuit: she risks the Flux and the fall.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" is introduced in paragraph two as "a paradoxical quiet, where the violence of the physical shift was muted by the thinning air." The tone recurs in the amphitheater: "absolute silence," "silence shattered, replaced by a harmonic chord." The shift from silence to song charges the resolution. However, "whirling silence" is paradoxical and slightly unclear—does it mean rotating quiet or chaotic hush? The tonal arc is coherent (muted → absolute → shattered → harmonic) but the descriptor itself risks opacity. Modulates with pressure and charges the final image, but specificity is weakened by the paradox.</comment>
