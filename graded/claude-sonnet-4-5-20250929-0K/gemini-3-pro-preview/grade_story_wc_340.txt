<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's warmly inquisitive stance is established through his actions—cradling objects with care, tilting his head at the cipher—and his motivation to find joy beneath anguish drives the discovery. However, his interior remains somewhat remote; the "affectionate detachment" reads more as narrative posture than embodied contradiction. The final validation ("smiled, validating his theory") tells rather than shows the culmination of his emotional journey. Minor embodiment throughout (adjusting gloves, ears popping) supports presence, but the peak beat lacks visceral cost or surprise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: floor-by-floor ascent accumulates sensory detail and rising light intensity until the cipher resolves. The closure—Elian stepping into the solarium carrying "the weight of the secret not as a burden, but as a final gift"—lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he carries private knowledge, foreclosing public mourning). The lens holds throughout, and the resolution reweights the Captain's legacy. One meaningful tightening (light pressure building to revelation) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, elevator ascent, and shifting light through rime ice create a vivid, purpose-driven frame. Sensory detail—"kaleidoscope of refracted luminance," air pressure shifting in Elian's ears—is filtered through POV and tied to the puzzle-solving action. The goggles and diary function as micro-setting elements that constrain the解密 attempt. The solarium at the top charges the final image. Spatial choreography (elevator floors, external ice, internal light) tracks cleanly and the environment enables rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—deciphering Halloway's encrypted diary to find hidden joy—is signaled early and drives every beat. Light intensity rising with the elevator's ascent creates natural tightening. The turn occurs when the goggles filter sunlight to reveal silver ink, narrowing Elian's search to a concrete method. However, agency is observational rather than a difficult choice under pressure; Elian enacts a theory without visible cost or resistance. The resolution (finding warmth in the cold) is thematically resonant but lacks a felt price that would elevate into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—that grief's public mask can hide contraband joy—emerges organically from the cipher reveal without overt statement. The Captain's silver-ink confession (love of stratosphere silence, shared laughter, sunrise beauty) contrasts his "public mourning" and earns the final line's gift metaphor. The goggles and diary motifs charge the closure by literalizing hidden truths. "Secret contraband" risks slight over-articulation but remains image-grounded. The ending reweights prior material (the Captain's "hardened" eyes held light) without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to whether sorrow can coexist with delight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is elevated yet consistent ("icebound spire," "affectionate detachment," "kaleidoscope of refracted luminance"). Psychic distance is controlled, filtering setting and action through Elian's inquisitive focus. However, some constructions lean formal—"He was a man of routine, an ascending servant dedicated to the final duties"—where more idiomatic phrasing would sharpen voice. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (he notices prisms, polarized lenses) but could be more distinctively character-specific under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("He felt," "He believed") appear sparingly and fit the measured tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("frozen needle piercing the sky," "sun to filter through heavy glass"). However, several phrases approach overwriting: "discovery waiting to happen" is abstract, "climaxes into a kaleidoscope" stacks metaphor, and "allowing him the clarity to see what the grieving family could not" tells rather than trusts the dramatization. Minor paraphrase: "tarnished brass frames, the airship captain's goggles" and "pressed the goggles against the open page, allowing the sun to filter through" recycle phrasing. No major loops or scaffold, but density could tighten in the final paragraph where "validating his theory" and "the mystery resolved" summarize rather than image the emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The frame—cipher solved via polarized goggles filtering sunlight during elevator ascent—is inventive and well-integrated. The emotional premise (seeking hidden joy beneath public grief) transforms a familiar trope through the specific mechanics of prism lenses and silver ink. The setting (stratospheric spire) and constraints (rising light, ten-floor clock) feel organic to the puzzle rather than ornamental. Risk-taking in the quiet, observational closure is appropriate to the concept. However, the "ascending servant" and "keeper of secrets" roles lean toward archetype without full personalization, and the resolution's inevitability (Elian's theory confirmed without complication) sacrifices some surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his role—ascending to fulfill the Captain's final mystery—frames the entire piece. His choice to use the goggles (paragraph 3) and his decision to carry the secret as a gift (final paragraph) are on-page actions. However, these are enactments of a pre-formed theory rather than choices under pressure or conflicting wants. He observes and validates but does not alter tactics or face meaningful opposition. Two beats (applying goggles, stepping out with the secret) involve him, earning mid-range, but the lack of genuine decision cost or turn caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The goggles are introduced early (paragraph 1: "tarnished brass frames, the airship captain's goggles"), used functionally in the middle (paragraph 3: "pressed the goggles against the open page, allowing the sun to filter through"), and appear in closure (paragraph 4: "refolded the diary and tucked the goggles into his breast pocket, the mystery resolved"). Their polarized prisms are causally essential—without them, the cipher remains unreadable. The object is irreplaceable (only Halloway's navigation lenses work) and its mechanics shape the entire middle beat. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early (paragraph 2: "small book, its pages locked behind a complex cipher") and its decryption drives the central action. The concept shapes stakes (Elian must solve it before the elevator ride ends) and tactics (testing the goggles' prisms against sunlight). The payoff (paragraph 4: silver ink reveals Halloway's hidden joy) reweights the Captain's legacy and delivers the thematic closure. The diary is causally indispensable—removing it collapses both plot and meaning. Present in setup, development (ongoing study across floors), and closure (mystery resolved, diary refolded).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is shown through Elian's tilting his head at the cipher, his gentle precision unfolding the diary, and his serene expression during the revelation. The trait enables his approach (study rather than force) and aligns with the final gift framing. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; Elian's method proceeds smoothly without friction between warmth and detachment. The attribute is consistent and present across beats but lacks a moment where it forces a tradeoff or complicates tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears explicitly (paragraph 3: "began to unfold the leather flap of the diary") and is the physical action that transitions from cipher mystery to revelation. It enables the next step (pressing goggles to the page) and is dramatized on-page. However, the action itself is a single gesture rather than a multi-beat struggle; it unlocks the turn but does not recur or accumulate pressure. Present in development and linked to closure (the unfolding reveals the hidden text), but its simplicity and replaceability (other verbs could serve) prevent a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method—using scattered/filtered light through prisms—is seeded early (paragraph 2: "Halloway navigated by stars and prisms"), tested in the middle (paragraph 3: "pressed the goggles against the open page, allowing the sun to filter through"), and pays off causally (paragraph 4: "prisms in the lenses broke the sunbeams into specific spectral bands" revealing silver ink). The mechanics are specific and irreplaceable; direct magnification would not work, only spectral filtering does. The method shapes Elian's timing (he must act as sunlight intensifies) and delivers the closure. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly described (paragraph 1: "frozen needle piercing the sky where the air is too thin for sorrow to linger") and the elevator's ascent through rime ice into intensifying sunlight creates the environmental pressure that enables the cipher's解密. Light filtering through glacial ice (paragraph 2: "kaleidoscope of refracted luminance") is essential to the method. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere and a clock (ten floors); it does not constrain Elian's choices or force tactical adaptation. Present in setup and development, with some causal role in payoff (sunlight required), but more enabler than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ten-floor ascent is introduced early (title concept) and tracked throughout: "passed the second floor," "fourth floor," "fifth floor," "sixth and seventh floors," "eighth floor," "tenth floor." The timeframe creates urgency (paragraph 3: "As they reached the fifth floor, the intensity of the sun grew, forcing Elian to act before the journey ended") and structures the revelation beats. The clock is legible and tightens decisions—Elian must solve the cipher before arrival. Present across all beats and causally linked to the method (rising light) and closure (arrival at solarium). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation—"to seek out the joy beneath anguish"—is stated early (paragraph 1) and drives Elian's entire approach. It shapes his method (looking for "a kernel of light" in the Captain's grief) and is fulfilled in the payoff (paragraph 4: finding the Captain's cataloged delight). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices; Elian enacts his theory without friction between competing wants or visible cost. It frames the action and charges the thematic closure but lacks the on-page struggle or tradeoff that would elevate it into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is established early (paragraph 2: "loving the old Captain enough to invade his privacy, yet distant enough to remain composed") and maintained through the serene, measured narration. The tone modulates slightly under pressure (paragraph 4: "Elian smiled") but remains coherent. It charges the final image—carrying the secret "not as a burden, but as a final gift"—by validating the stance. However, the tone is somewhat static; no moment forces it to tension with raw emotion or complicates the detachment. Present across beats and linked to closure, earning solid integration, but lacking the dynamic pressure shift that would reach the high 8s.</comment>
