<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is signaled early and his custodian role shapes his actions throughout. The woman's shadow-loss provides coherent stakes, though her agency remains entirely off-page. Interiority carries distinct philosophical weight ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," the carved-out space of hope), but the final moment—placing the stone and feeling "luminous regret"—edges toward label-only emotion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece earns its Earned Stasis closure (Elian preserves the fragment but cannot restore wholeness), yet the woman's absence and the collective mind's unexamined passivity limit relational crucible and secondary pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The library setting and shadow-hunting frame anchor who/where/when by the opening paragraphs; no orientation debt. Causality coheres: Elian's forensic comparison (video evidence of shadow-loss) motivates the river-stone capture, and the metamorphosis delivers an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he saves the fragment but forecloses the woman's wholeness). Cost is legible in the final beat: the woman "would never be whole again," and Elian's "luminous regret" charges the shelf-placement image. One meaningful deepening (the shadow's desperate fusion into the stone) tightens the thematic stakes. Minor penalty: the collective-mind backstory occupies significant real estate without dramatized resistance or a present-tense micro-choice that alters Elian's options on the page, slightly flattening momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming library's "photosynthesizing verbs" and "phosphorescent spores" create a vivid, purposeful frame that reflects the story's theme of narrative as living archive. The river stone's "cold, geological patience" and "mineral lattice" ground the ethereal shadow-work in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, shelf, biography section), and the "golden, unceasing afternoon" tone modulates with Elian's regret at closure. The stone qualifies as micro-setting, constraining the shadow's capture and charging the final shelf-placement image. Minor gap: the cloud-world and dream-stream remain high-level placeholders; a single concrete detail of how the collective mind's infrastructure affects Elian's access or tactics would deepen necessity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve individual depth (the shadow) against collective erasure. The video-comparison beat establishes the problem, and Elian's stone-offering narrows options (the shadow must accept or dissolve). The metamorphosis delivers one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, and cost is explicit: the woman remains severed, the collective drifts unaware, and Elian's act is a "steep victory." Agency is Elian's throughout (decision to use the stone, deliberate approach, shelf-placement). Minor limitation: the shadow itself has minimal resistance or choice texture; its "desperate need for form" is asserted more than dramatized through competing impulses, slightly reducing the peak beat's friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from image and event: hope as "the specific, carved-out space where light was missing" charges the shadow-preservation arc without didactic summary. The river stone's transformation from anchor to obsidian geode enacts the cost of preserving contrast in a world that "traded its shadows for an endless, blinding peace." The final shelf-placement—hidden between encyclopedias—resonates as both rescue and burial, reweighting the opening library image. The "luminous regret" ending coheres tonally and offers a non-literal answer. Very minor penalty: "preserve the shape of hope" borders on prompt-echo abstraction in one interior line; the thematic work is otherwise concrete and layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Elian's perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "forensic archaeology of the soul") is consistent and voice-particular. Diction is controlled and elevated without register breaks ("photosynthesizing verbs," "phantom city," "luminous regret"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from the opening's wide collective-era frame to the intimate stone-handling beats. Single line of dialogue ("You have nowhere left to go") reads as ritual address rather than conversation, apt for the scene's solitary mood. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean. The prose texture remains distinct and legible under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or concept without padding. Sentence rhythm varies ("He stopped before his workbench" / "The discrepancy confirmed Elian's theory" / "Then, the impossible began to happen"), and the metamorphosis beat propels without loops. Figurative language is vivid but mostly purposeful ("tangled, verdant vines of narrative possibility," "smoke," "gravitational pull"). Minor penalties: "forensic archaeology of the soul" and "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" edge toward elevated abstraction without full embodiment in action; "luminous regret" in the final line risks stock pairing. One paraphrase slip: "The shadow unbound rippled" followed immediately by "It swirled" restates motion without added detail. No major artifact or template cadence runs, but the cumulative decorative density in the opening third slightly softens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The shadow-as-severed-individuality premise offers a specific angle on collective-consciousness tropes, and the river-stone anchor device is concrete and non-obvious. The video-comparison forensic method and the metamorphosis beat feel earned in hindsight. Tone and concept cohere organically. Minor limitation: the "dreams become shareable" collective-mind frame and the cloud-library setting remain high-concept placeholders without granular world-logic surprises; replacing them with alternate sci-fi furniture would not fundamentally alter the emotional or thematic arc. The transformation of the woman's case into Elian's solitary ritual is thoughtful but not structurally bold. Solid synthesis with room for deeper irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian as "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" frames the opening, his custodian role motivates the forensic comparison (setup), his decision to offer the stone constrains the middle choice (development), and his shelf-placement with "luminous regret" charges the closure image (payoff). His observation drives the key turn (video analysis → stone capture). Cost is visible: he preserves the shadow but cannot restore the woman. The character is indispensable; removing Elian would collapse the plot and thematic stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The river stone appears early (workbench beat, setup), Elian handles it deliberately in the approach sequence (development), and the metamorphosis transforms it into the obsidian geode placed on the shelf at closure (payoff). The stone's "cold, geological patience" and "mineral lattice" provide the necessary anchor for the ethereal shadow, and its transformation into light-absorbing obsidian charges the final image. Swapping it for another heavy object would require rewriting the material fusion logic. Two distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; very strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is the central stake: the woman's severed darker self drifts as a restless fragment (setup), Elian tracks and approaches it (development), and the metamorphosis fuses it into the stone, foreclosing its unbound state (payoff). The concept shapes every beat and defines the closure cost: the shadow is preserved but trapped, no longer unbound. Removing this exact element would eliminate the plot's causal engine and thematic resonance. Indispensable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears as a descriptor of Elian's movements when approaching the shadow: "movements that were softly deliberate, ensuring he did not startle the wild abstraction." Setup is implicit in the opening's measured tone; development shows the trait enabling his careful approach without dissolving the shadow; closure linkage is weaker—the shelf-placement is gentle but not explicitly marked by this phrasing. One clear beat where the trait constrains action with implicit cost (startling would lose the shadow). Functional but not charged at the ending; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the climactic action: the shadow "began to metamorphose...seeped into the mineral lattice, fusing the ethereal with the tangible." Setup via the video-comparison discovery; development is the stone-offering and approach; payoff is the transformation itself, which redefines the shadow's state and delivers the closure cost (trapped essence, "steep victory"). The verb and its material stakes are irreplaceable; no synonym ("transform," "merge") captures the biological/alchemical resonance that charges the final geode image. The action drives the major turn and shapes the ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The video-comparison method is signaled early: "On the left screen flickered a grainy, monochromatic recording...On the right screen played a recent capture from the dream-stream" (setup). It provides the forensic evidence that motivates Elian's capture attempt (development): "The discrepancy confirmed Elian's theory." Closure participation is indirect—the method does not reappear in the final beats, though its proof underpins the entire mission. One clear beat where the method shapes the central choice. Functional and specific, but the ending does not loop back to the footage or dream-stream mechanics, slightly limiting payoff charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" frames the opening (setup) and provides the refuge where the shadow hides among biographies (development). The shelf-placement—"between two blooming encyclopedias, hidden in the leaves"—closes the spatial arc (payoff). The phosphorescent spores and mossy floor enrich atmosphere and contrast with the stone's solidity, but the library's sky-location does not constrain Elian's tactics or alter his choices under pressure; it functions more as thematic backdrop than pressure-engine. The cloud-world's lack of "solidity" is asserted but not tested through a failed alternative. Solid integration across gates with thematic resonance, but micro-setting constraint is modest.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After dreams become shareable" establishes the era and the collective-mind condition (setup). The dream-stream footage is the method Elian uses (development), and the closure stakes (collective joy vs. individual depth) depend on this timeline. However, the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the story unfolds in a single continuous present without urgency from the "shareable dreams" mechanic pressing on Elian's window of action. The element is causally consistent and thematically load-bearing but does not escalate pressure through time constraints. Mid-band for coherent presence without tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is Elian's explicit motivation, articulated in the middle section: "His motivation was to preserve the shape of hope, which he understood not as a blinding light, but as the specific, carved-out space where light was missing." Setup is implicit in the custodian framing; development shows him acting on this desire (offering the stone); payoff is the shelf-placement with "luminous regret," where preservation and loss coexist. The motivation drives every choice and charges the closure cost (hope saved but the woman severed). One friction: the motivation is stated more than dramatized through conflicting wants; Elian never doubts or weighs an alternative. Strong integration with visible cost, but the internal friction is modest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" coheres from the opening's "blinding light of unity" through the middle's "golden, unceasing afternoon" and culminates in the final line: "profound, luminous regret for a world that had traded its shadows for an endless, blinding peace." The tone modulates with pressure—expansive description at the start, tightening to Elian's tactile focus during the capture, then opening to the philosophical close. The paradox of luminosity as both beauty and suffocation charges the ending image. No static mood; the tone evolves and reweights the library's glow. Strong tonal control across all three gates with clear closure linkage.</comment>
