<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior life is richly embodied through visceral responses to petrichor and the crystal vibrations, with contradictory impulses—longing versus discipline—acting simultaneously in the forecourt scene. The final act of bearing rather than silencing the vibration crystallizes his stance with visible cost: he acknowledges his sacrifice daily and returns to the clock, foreclosing the path to his dream. Minor deduction: the luthier backstory is told rather than woven into micro-choices earlier, slightly reducing earned weight at closure. The renunciation reads credible and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—petrichor → memory → forecourt → vibration → tears → return forms a cadence that deepens pressure and reweights the dominant stake (peace with an abandoned dream). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Elian, Order, storm aftermath). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he bears the weight, then returns to the clock, foreclosing the luthier path with felt cost visible in "leaving his ghost behind." One meaningful tightening (the shift from nostalgia to communion to renunciation) suffices at this length. Causality holds under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt constrains the climactic choice—water unlocks vibration, Elian kneels on wet quartz, the hum travels through bone—and charges the final image when sun dries the stones and quiets their whispers, forcing his return. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: petrichor bypasses discipline to strike the heart, the amethyst vein hums felt rather than heard. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The micro-setting (body, wet stone, fingertips) functions as setting and directly shapes the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (make peace with abandoned dream) is signaled early and tightens through the sequence: nostalgia → forbidden forecourt → kneeling → touching stone → bearing vibration → return. Agency is endurance and renunciation—he does not amplify or silence, he bears the weight—and this forecloses the luthier path with on-page cost ("leaving his ghost behind"). One meaningful deepening (the shift from communion to bearing to departure) suffices under the accumulative lens. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (rising, moving, kneeling, touching) and the price is legible in tears and the final return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (sacrifice of beauty for discipline, the daily choice of silence) emerges through concrete particulars: wet crystals, phantom violin, the crushing weight borne rather than resolved. The final image—sun drying stones, quieting whispers, Elian returning to the clock—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the excruciatingly gentle stroke, the tears, the choice to bear rather than possess. No overt theme statements; the communion moment and return reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. Exceptional restraint elevates the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices "gears that turned without grinding," "wet perfume of dust," "hum traveled up his arm…felt rather than heard"—sensory bias reflecting scribe and suppressed luthier. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated but consistent with the monastic, introspective register. Minor deduction: a few phrases ("aching resonance," "phantom pluck of a string") approach stock lyric moves and slightly dilute voice specificity under peak pressure. Rhythmic control and POV modesty remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent ("viscosity," "glacial hush," "wet wound of ink"). Minor overwriting in the opening third: "mute passage of seconds," "cold preservation of reality," and "vestigial memory in his throat" stack elevated metaphors without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He moved…He was heading…") but does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold artifacts touch closure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the final line ("leaving his ghost behind to return to the clock") lands with clean propulsion. Strong overall, not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The introverted scribe / forbidden resonant forecourt / renunciation arc is a fresh synthesis within monastic-silence premises, grounded in specific sensory and emotional particulars (petrichor, amethyst hum, excruciatingly gentle touch). The ending—bearing beauty without possessing it, returning to the clock—feels earned rather than tropey. Minor deduction: the luthier dream and "Order of the Null" lean into familiar territory (artistic calling versus ascetic order) without fully transforming the template. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric closure elevates within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's choices drive key turns: rising from desk, moving to forecourt, kneeling, touching stone, bearing vibration, returning to clock. Setup early, beats across middle and end, causal pressure at closure. Swappability is low—removing him breaks the arc. Cost is tied to his endurance and return. Scores solidly in the essential-across-beats range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt present in setup (forbidden, water unlocks voice), middle (kneeling, touching amethyst vein, hum), and closure (sun dries stones, quiets whispers, forces return). Drives two beats and charges final image with irreplaceable specificity (wet quartz physics). Visible cost: the forecourt's silencing closes Elian's communion and compels departure. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Glacial hush frames the world (silence as "physical weight," "viscosity") and shapes tactics: Elian's voice has shrunk, he steps softly, the forecourt is forbidden during storms. Returns at closure when the sanctuary's stillness reclaims him. Causal pressure across beats, closure linkage strong. Specificity (glacial versus mere quiet) matters to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Excruciatingly gentle" appears in setup metaphor (stroking fragile imaginary violin) and is embodied in the climactic touch: fingertips graze wet amethyst, the action constrained by fear of shattering. Visible tradeoff: gentleness enables communion but also signals his restraint/submission. Closure linkage indirect but present in bearing versus amplifying. Essential to one key beat, contributes to ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Bear" is the hinge of the climax: "He simply had to bear it. He had to bear the crushing weight of the beauty he had sacrificed." The action redefines options—endurance instead of possession or silence—and articulates the dominant stake's resolution. Present in closure beat, causally indispensable, irreplaceable (no near-synonym fits). Cost is explicit and charged. Exceptional integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Soundless Sanctuary pressures all choices: the silence Elian worships, the forbidden forecourt, the glacial hush that reclaims him. Setup early, beats across middle (moving through corridors, stepping into forecourt), closure (return to the clock within the granite walls). The setting supplies the central constraint and shapes the final departure. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hidden sunrise frames the forecourt scene: Elian steps out as light bleeds, kneels in dim light, and the sun crests to dry stones and quiet whispers, triggering his return. Time tightens the window of communion and closes the moment with physical causality (drying ends vibration). Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal pressure clear. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation (make peace with abandoned dream) is stated early, dramatized through the journey to forecourt, kneeling, touching stone, and borne in the climax ("crushing weight of beauty sacrificed"). Friction between want (communion) and cost (daily choice of silence) drives the arc. Desire shapes all major beats and the closure renunciation. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Petrichor nostalgia anchors the inciting moment (storm scent triggers longing), modulates through the forecourt communion (tears, aching resonance), and charges the final departure (leaving his ghost, returning to sterile stone). Tone coherence is strong; the nostalgia reweights at closure when Elian accepts its cost. Present across beats, closure participation clear, irreplaceability high.</comment>
