<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is asserted but never internally contradicted or complicated by doubt in the moment—his ritual proceeds without hesitation or visible cost to his own stance. The specimen's transformation feels externally imposed rather than earned by Elias's internal shift; his agency is reduced to performing a recipe. The final "frostbitten hope" is told ("he nursed a fragile…hope") rather than shown through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sporadic; the flint burning against his thigh and the sliced thumb are vivid, but peak beats rely on stock metaphors ("bile," "void") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation is solid: who, where, and when are clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—the brother solidifying and laughing—lands on the page and reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is unclear: Elias floats, watches, then "nurses hope" without visible forfeiture or altered options. The ritual's success feels automatic once the phone is activated; no mid-sequence reversal or friction tests Elias's commitment. The inferred lens is Causal (the ritual causes the transformation), but the because/therefore linkage is declarative rather than dramatized through setback or adaptation. Cost proof test: I cannot point to a sentence where Elias's victory forecloses a path or exacts a felt price beyond the now-dead phone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underground garden is vivid and purposeful: "wet earth and secrets," "twenty feet of rock and permafrost," ferns and ivy establish a contained, lived-in space. The flint arrowhead is discovered in the loam, the phone hidden in ivy, and gravity's release scatters objects (watering can, dust motes) in a way that makes the ritual's mechanics feel spatial. The environment constrains and enables: Elias moves through the garden, retrieving the phone and approaching the specimen, and the final image of them "dropped gently back to the loam" anchors the closure in texture. Micro-setting (the phone, the loam, the ferns) charges the ending and shapes the ritual's execution, lifting the score toward high-7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the brother—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is weak: the ritual unfolds in a single uninterrupted sequence without friction, setback, or a moment where Elias must adapt tactics. The phone activates, gravity releases, Elias whispers resentments, slices his thumb, and the transformation occurs—no reversal tests his commitment or raises cost. The protagonist's agency is reduced to executing a pre-designed ritual; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does dramatized choice under pressure. The "Laugh or be laughed at" command is declarative mood rather than a hard choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming hope from horror through "sheer spite" emerges organically from Elias's actions and the brother's transformation into "butterflies made of light and sound." The final image—"the broken things could be put back together, even if the pieces didn't quite fit"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the cosmic-joke framing is asserted ("the universe had tried to offer a ghost, and Elias had forced it to deliver a miracle") rather than arising implicitly from scene pressure. The flint, phone, and static motifs recur but do not accumulate symbolic freight that charges the ending; they function more as plot tokens than thematic nodes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—"trowel scraping," "eyes darting," "familiar surge of bitterness"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "vibrating blur of static and sorrow," "gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope." The prose modulates with intensity: short, active clauses during the ritual ("He pulled the flint out and sliced his own thumb") contrast with longer, contemplative sentences at the close. One slip: "the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone" reads like exposition inserted for the reader rather than Elias's present thought. No dialogue present; evaluation skips those bullets.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("to the old herbalist, Silas, Elias was merely a drift-less wanderer seeking shelter, but in truth…"). However, the middle section leans on stock metaphors and declarative exposition: "a frequency that bypassed the ears and vibrated the soul" is abstract; "pouring his bile into the electronic hiss" is cliché. The phrase "a chorus of lost voices trying to find a shape" is evocative but unearned—no prior beat dramatizes these voices. Minor scaffold: "It was—or had been—Silas's brother" repeats the specimen's identity without adding pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, but figurative density in the ritual sequence ("cosmic punchlines," "bile," "void") accumulates without fresh vehicle specificity, applying a −0.3 deduction within the 6-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underground-garden-during-ice-siege premise and the cordless-phone-as-ritual-conduit offer a fresh synthesis. The emotional turn—bitterness weaponized into restoration—is specific and non-obvious. However, the "missing return changed" backstory and "hollow geometries wearing familiar faces" echo familiar cosmic-horror and disappeared-persons tropes without transformation through lived detail. The brother's metamorphosis into light-butterflies is vivid but arrives without groundwork in his prior flickering form; the payoff feels decorative rather than inevitable. Proximity check: "cosmic punchline" and "put back together, even if the pieces didn't quite fit" are near-stock phrases that lower freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (cryptid researcher undercover) frames the setup, but his undercover status is exposition-only—Silas never appears on the page to test the deception. Elias's research role enables the ritual design (functional), but his choices during the ritual are execution rather than decision under pressure. The element shapes one key turn (the ritual) and is present at closure (he watches the brother solidify), meeting two gates. However, swappability is moderate: a hedge-mage or amateur occultist could perform the same ritual with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental undercover premise −0.4 place the score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead is discovered early (setup), described as "cold and sharp enough to sever the tenuous threads of reality" (foreshadowing), grows hot during the ritual (development), and is used to slice Elias's thumb to "ground the ethereal current" (payoff). Three gates met. The arrowhead's unique property—reality-severing sharpness—matters on the page and is irreplaceable. However, the blood-grounding mechanic is asserted rather than tested; no prior beat establishes why blood + flint charges the phone. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, but ornamental "reality-severing" claim without on-page consequence −0.6, and the blood mechanic is summary-only −0.4, yielding mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A harmony untamed" appears only in the transformation climax: "a wild, cacophonous music of existence that refused to be sad or structured." It is label-only and thematic rather than a constraint that shapes Elias's tactics. The concept is not signaled before the final third, missing the setup gate. It does not change options or tactics; it describes the result. One beat (closure image) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, but late appearance −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, and swappability (near-synonym "untamed vitality" would fit) −0.5 place the score in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is demonstrated early when the watering can drifts and dust spirals after the phone is activated, enabling the floating ritual and forcing Elias to act mid-air. Two gates: development (the gravity shift alters tactics) and payoff (they are "dropped gently back"). The trait constrains on-page action with visible effect. However, it is a side-effect of the phone activation rather than a resource Elias chooses to exploit; swappability is moderate (any disorienting environmental shift could serve). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability −0.5 and ornamental phrasing ("gravitationally playful" as label) −0.3 yield high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the climax action: "The brother's form stopped flickering and exploded outward…into a cloud of butterflies made of light and sound." It is signaled by the title "energy in the room began to metamorphose" and is the story's central turn, redefining the brother's state from static blur to solid man. Three gates met. The action is irreplaceable and causally driven by the ritual. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6. Minor deduction: the transformation is automatic once the ritual completes, reducing agency cost −0.4. Total mid-to-high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cordless phone is hidden in ivy (setup), its mechanics explained ("a frequency that bypassed the ears and vibrated the soul"), activated to trigger gravity shift (development), used as the conduit for Elias's confessions, and blood-smeared to ground the current (payoff). Three gates met. The method is specific and irreplaceable: no other device could plausibly serve. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7. Deductions: the mechanics are asserted rather than tested (−0.5), and the "bypass the ears and vibrate the soul" claim is ornamental exposition (−0.4). Total mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is present throughout: Elias kneels in loam, discovers the flint, retrieves the phone from ivy, approaches the specimen in the corner, and the final image returns to the loam. Three gates met. The setting supplies resources (flint, phone) and constrains the ritual spatially (enclosed, below permafrost). Micro-setting (loam, ivy, ferns) charges the final image. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5. Deduction: the garden is atmospheric rather than a live constraint that forces a tactical choice (−0.6). Total low-to-mid 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed" is backstory exposition in paragraph four, establishing the world state but not tightening present decisions. The timeframe does not impose a deadline or alter Elias's tactics; the ritual proceeds without time pressure. One gate: setup (present as context). The element is functional but replaceable; any post-catastrophe frame could serve. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, but ornamental use (does not constrain) −0.7, swappability −0.6, and summary-only (not dramatized) −0.5 yield high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated early and drives the ritual design. It is present at closure when "the cosmic joke had landed." Two gates: setup and payoff. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable, but it is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or a hard choice. Elias never hesitates or pays visible cost for weaponizing his resentment. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6, but ornamental framing (told rather than conflicted) −0.7 and summary-only use −0.4 yield low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is signaled in the final sentence ("he nursed a fragile, frostbitten hope") and implied throughout by the contrast between frozen wasteland and underground vitality. The tone modulates from bitter ("curdled into horror") to charged ("wild, cacophonous music") to tentative optimism at the close. Two gates: development (tonal shifts with pressure) and payoff (final image). The tone is coherent and charges the ending. Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, coherence +0.8. Deductions: the phrase "frostbitten hope" is label-only in the final line (−0.4) and the tonal shift is asserted rather than embodied in a micro-choice (−0.3). Total mid-to-high 6s.</comment>
