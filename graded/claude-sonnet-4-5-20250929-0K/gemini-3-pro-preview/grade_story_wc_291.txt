<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's prosopagnosia is introduced clearly and motivates his detachment, but the trait functions more as premise than internal contradiction—he never wrestles with competing impulses in scene. The final moment ("he recognized the reaction it provoked") offers earned observation but not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Miller's transformation is told through narration ("his hardened expression crumbled") rather than dramatized through micro-choices or embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered artistic process until the final image reweights the tragedy. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the artwork shifts from abstraction to undeniable ghost—with conceptual cost legible in Miller's crumbled grief and the town's forced confrontation. One meaningful deepening (the physical piercing and ribbon merge) tightens pressure and charges the ending, meeting the lens requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry's limestone, slate-grey ground, and mist are vivid and selective. Spatial choreography (easel, canvas, Miller's position) tracks cleanly. The environment constrains the artistic process: Silas measures "the distance between a jagged rock and the horizon," and the quarry's geology becomes the canvas's texture. The ribbon fragment pressed against wet fixative is a micro-setting moment that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy in a community that looks away—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas pierces the canvas and merges the ribbon, a protagonist-driven action that reweights the portrait from abstraction to undeniable presence. Miller's hitched breath and crumbled expression suggest cost, but the price remains observational rather than altering tactics or foreclosing options on the page. The escalation is legible under the Accumulative lens, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (indifference versus empathy, violence masked by time) emerges through the collision of silk and stone, the pierced pupil, and the merged ribbon rather than stated moral. The final image—"the image on the easel burned through the grey, undeniable and alive"—offers a resonant answer without summary. "He had lanced the infection of indifference" risks thematic echo but stays just within dramatized metaphor because the prior physical act (piercing the canvas) anchors it. The piece resists tidy resolution; Miller's grief is visceral, not redemptive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable through Silas's perceptual filter: "topographic maps of skin and bone, devoid of emotional recognition." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("furrowed hush," "jagged scrap of black silk"). Miller's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One slip: "glint of terror that no brush could replicate" and "mimicking the reflection of a soul realizing its end" drift toward metaphysical certainty beyond what Silas's prosopagnosia would permit; he cannot see terror or souls, only shapes. The slippage is brief and does not touch closure, capping damage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the artistic-process beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He did not see a face…he saw topographic maps" is restated as "to him it was just a collection of shapes and values" in the penultimate paragraph. "The cold case was no longer just a stack of papers; it was a ghost demanding to be heard" adds metaphorical restatement without new pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "He approached…He worked…He needed…He picked up…He looked…He then took" in successive paragraphs. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia with cold-case art and the physical piercing/ribbon merge feels specific and non-obvious. The premise (artist who cannot see faces reconstruct empathy) is fresh, and the ending's earned resonance—art as mirror of tragedy rather than likeness—grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking (piercing the canvas, merging relic with representation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its vision and avoids hedging or median choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silas appears in the first line and his prosopagnosia frames the approach. His methodical setup and artistic choices (piercing, merging ribbon) drive two beats and shape the ending. However, his role is primarily instrumental observation—he executes a plan without on-page conflict or cost that alters his own tactics. The final satisfaction ("his methodical work complete") is told rather than tested. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff) with beat involvement, but causal pressure and personal cost remain low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment is introduced early ("sole surviving artifact"), handled in the opening, and physically merged with the canvas in the climactic beat ("pressed it against the wet fixative on the canvas's throat"). The merger is irreplaceable—no other object could fuse relic and representation—and charges the final image: the portrait "ceased to be a drawing of a stranger" and "became a mirror of the tragedy itself." All three gates met with strong closure linkage and specificity, but the element does not narrow options or impose visible cost on Silas, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cold cases are mentioned in the opening ("the department's cold cases") and the penultimate paragraph ("The cold case was no longer just a stack of papers"). The concept frames backstory but does not constrain on-page tactics or alter Silas's artistic choices. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes decisions. Setup present, but no middle development or causal work; payoff is a thematic claim, not a dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is signaled early ("adjusted his easel with very methodical precision") and recurs in the final paragraph ("his methodical work complete"). The trait enables the careful layering and measurement but does not impose visible cost or constrain a choice under pressure—Silas's precision never conflicts with another need or fails him. The attribute shapes approach but remains label-level without friction. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff) with functional presence, but no causal pressure or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Lance" appears twice: the physical act ("used the tool to lance the center of the charcoal pupil") transforms the portrait into a "violent injection of life," and the metaphorical payoff ("He had lanced the infection of indifference") reweights the premise. The action is irreplaceable—no other verb could unify the surgical precision, the piercing of paper, and the thematic drainage of secrecy. All three gates met with strong closure linkage and specificity. The action drives the key turn and charges the final image, meeting causal pressure and beat involvement criteria.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is signaled early ("He approached the canvas by unifying opposites, blending the harsh, angular charcoal…with the soft, fluid pastels") and demonstrated in the piercing/ribbon merger. The method shapes the artistic process across two beats and informs the final image's power. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"collision of textures," "layering shadow upon light"—without imposing visible cost or friction. All three gates met with purposeful reprise, but the method does not constrain choices or force tradeoffs, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The quarry is anchored in the opening line ("limestone walls of the abandoned quarry") and sustained through mist, slate-grey ground, jagged rock, and horizon. Silas measures "the distance between a jagged rock and the horizon," and the quarry's geology becomes the canvas's texture. The setting returns in the final image ("The mist swirled around them, claiming the quarry once more") to frame closure. All three gates met with spatial constraint and closure linkage, but the environment does not alter tactics or impose a visible cost—Silas works unimpeded.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is signaled early ("The physical evidence…had disappeared years ago") and sustained in Miller's decade of suppressed grief. The timeframe frames the premise but does not tighten on-page decisions—Silas works at his own pace without a live clock or urgency. The element informs backstory and thematic weight but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff) with thematic presence, but no middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly in paragraph 8 ("His motivation was not merely to identify the dead, but to awaken dormant empathy") and paid off when Miller's "hardened expression crumbled, revealing the grief he had suppressed for years." The desire drives Silas's artistic choices (piercing, merging ribbon) and the final recognition ("he recognized the reaction it provoked"). All three gates met with clear setup and payoff, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The friction between goal and personal price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears in the opening line ("the world was reduced to a furrowed hush") and is sustained through "dampening sound," "silence," and "the mist swirled around them" at closure. The tone modulates with the artistic process—methodical calm gives way to the "jarring" result and Miller's hitched breath. The tone charges the final image: the portrait "burned through the grey, undeniable and alive" contrasts with the earlier hush. All three gates met with coherent modulation and closure linkage, meeting accumulative/textural pressure criteria.</comment>
