<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the chapel is clear and her methodical trait drives the solution methodology. The grandfather backstory ("methodically curious") feels mildly scaffolded but does anchor present choice. The emotional channeling at the climax—mimicking grief to operate the lever—reads as intentional but the leap from observation to embodied empathy happens quickly without visible internal contradiction or cost. Minor issue: her perceptiveness is told more than tested under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (dual-timeline comparison accumulates evidence, then causes the mechanism unlock). Closure is on-page—floor spirals, staircase revealed—with a felt cost of channeling grief and the conceptual cost of "repairing the tear with understanding." The metaphor of framing the map by bridging past/present holds cleanly. One meaningful tightening: the woman's grief-posture in vintage footage unlocks the present mechanism. Orientation is swift (vault, henge, map framer role by ~100 words). Minor weakness: the empathy leap feels slightly asserted rather than earned beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, vanished fresco, henge shadow, and dual-timeline footage create vivid micro-setting that directly constrains the solution (height coordinates via shadow, eroded lever invisible without comparison). Sensory balance is strong: damp chill, cold wet stone, stale incensed air. The vault's decay and the henge's permanence charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. One slip: "grayscale reel" and "high-definition survey" feel slightly generic within the rich textures elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen the sealed chapel) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the footage comparison narrows options from brute force to empathetic pressure. The final act—mimicking grief to activate the mechanism—demonstrates agency with felt cost (channeling sorrow). The cost of understanding as the tool is elegant. Minor limitation: no false starts or visible failures that test commitment; the single attempt succeeds, reducing visible price before success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of interpretation, empathy, and "framing by repairing the tear" emerges organically from the dual-timeline method and the grief-lever mechanism. The final image—"silence had been heard"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The map-framing metaphor threads through without becoming thesis. "What was excluded from the frame" is purposeful. One slip: "to interpret silence with empathy" appears close to prompt language in narration, risking thematic echo, though it's embedded in action rather than stated as moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is profession-specific (framer's eye for borders, exclusions, coordinates). The register occasionally elevates ("forensic observation," "shielded openness," "spectral pantomimes") but remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Elara's internal texture—observant, methodical—stays consistent under pressure. Minor note: "shielded openness" as attributed emotion feels slightly abstract for peak stress; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high (profession, goal, method, dual footage all established efficiently). No loops or synonym churn detected. A few lines edge toward over-figuration: "spectral pantomimes," "triangulated its exact coordinates," "incensed air rose to meet the damp wind"—elevated but not opaque. The closing image ("dripping from her fingertips") is clean. One template stem: "She did not... she..." near the end, but isolated. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dual silent-footage method combined with empathy-as-key (rather than force) offers a fresh synthesis. The grief-lever disguised as fresco detail is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the map-framer trope beyond ornament. Risk: the empathy mechanism could feel convenient, but the prior setup (woman's posture, erased fresco) earns it in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes. The story commits fully to its logic. Within-band bonus for risk-taking in method (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's perception drives the solution: she identifies the discrepancy (woman's grief-posture vs. bare wall), triangulates coordinates, and chooses to channel emotion rather than force. Present by opening; shapes the footage-comparison beat and the final lever activation. Two distinct beats (observation, activation). Causal pressure: her interpretive skill narrows the method. Closure linkage: she executes the unlock. Minor friction: "perceptive" is more trait-label than action in early paragraphs; her framing profession is elegant but slightly ornamental until the final metaphor. Swappability test: another observer could follow the footage logic, but the empathy leap is character-specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The henge appears in three mentions: looming outside the vault, its shadow used to triangulate coordinates in footage comparison, and implicit in the vault's spatial context. Setup by first third. Development: the shadow enables the triangulation (middle beat). Payoff: present in spatial logic at closure. Two beats (triangulation, implicit framing). Causal: enables coordinate precision. Friction: the henge is described but not handled or revisited with reweighted meaning in the final image; it functions as spatial anchor rather than charged object. Late penalty mitigated by coordinate role, but closure participation is indirect (shadow, not the structure itself).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Whispered Chapel is the goal from the opening, shapes all tactics (Elara's method is tuned to "human emotion, not leverage"), and the staircase reveal is the closure beat. Setup immediate; development: the chapel's emotion-tuned mechanism dictates the empathy approach (middle); payoff: the staircase opens, incensed air rises, echoes emerge—closure image. Three beats (goal, method constraint, reveal). Causal pressure: the chapel's nature requires empathy, not force, narrowing options. Closure linkage strong. Cost: Elara channels grief. Specificity: "amplify the quietest confessions" is unique. Minor friction: the chapel itself remains off-page (staircase revealed, not entered), slightly reducing irreplaceability at the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is introduced early via grandfather's label and demonstrated in the footage-comparison setup. Setup by first third. Development: her systematic approach (scrubbing timeline, locating depression) is methodical. Payoff: the careful mimicry of posture at closure reflects method. Two beats (setup, execution). Friction: the attribute is told ("her grandfather had called") and then shown, but the label itself adds little specificity beyond "systematic observer." The trait enables the method but is near-swappable with "thorough" or "analytical." Cost: no visible trade-off between curiosity and another impulse. Swappability test: the trait describes execution rather than constraining a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the stated intent from paragraph two, drives the entire search, and is achieved on-page when the floor spirals open. Setup immediate; development: all middle action (footage analysis, wall approach) serves reopening; payoff: the circular flagstones descend, staircase revealed. Three beats (intent, method, success). Causal pressure: the action defines the dominant stake and all tactics. Closure linkage: the reopening is the closure beat. Specificity: not merely "find" but "reopen that seal"—implies prior closure and reversal. Cost: channeling grief to succeed. Irreplaceability: high; removing "reopen" removes the conflict. Minor friction: the success occurs on first attempt without visible failure, slightly reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dual silent-footage method is signaled in paragraph three, shapes the middle investigation (scrubbing timelines, identifying the woman's posture, triangulating via shadow), and enables the closure solution. Setup by ~30%; development: two beats (observation of woman, coordinate triangulation); payoff: the footage comparison yields the lever's location and the empathy cue. Three beats. Causal pressure: the method is the only way to locate the eroded, invisible lever. Closure linkage: direct—without the footage, no unlock. Specificity: "silent video" and "decades apart" are exact constraints. Cost: Elara must interpret emotion across media. Irreplaceability: high. Minor friction: the method is described more than dramatized in sensory detail (we don't see her rewinding, zooming), slightly reducing embodied presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault is present throughout: opening anchor, the erased fresco creates the core puzzle (lever invisible), the western wall is the interaction site, and rain drips from Elara's hand in the final line. Setup immediate; development: the scoured fresco (middle) is the mechanism's concealment; payoff: rain drips at closure, framing the reveal. Three beats (anchor, puzzle, closure image). Causal pressure: the erosion hides the lever and necessitates the footage method. Closure linkage: rain appears in final sentence, charging the image. Specificity: "rain-scoured" is exact and functional. Cost: the vault's decay is the obstacle. Irreplaceability: high; a dry vault would reveal the lever. No late penalty; no swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At the spot where a map tears" appears as metaphor in paragraph two (the torn survey as clue) and returns in the closing reflection ("repairing the tear with understanding"). Setup by first third; payoff: metaphor reprised at closure. One functional beat (the tear divides known/unknown on the survey). No middle development: the tear is not revisited or used tactically between setup and closure. Lyric reprise: the return reweights the framing metaphor. Friction: the tear is conceptual/symbolic rather than a live constraint; it does not tighten a decision or alter tactics. Swappability: moderate—the metaphor enriches theme but is not mechanically necessary. Closure participation is thematic, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated in paragraph three and demonstrated when Elara channels the woman's grief to activate the lever. Setup by ~35%; development: one beat (closing eyes, mimicking sorrow); payoff: the mechanism responds, closure achieved. Two beats (intent, execution). Causal pressure: empathy is the required input ("tuned to human emotion, not leverage"). Closure linkage: the empathic act opens the floor. Specificity: unique to this mechanism. Cost: channeling grief is emotionally effortful. Friction: the motivation is told ("singular") before shown, and the empathy leap feels slightly asserted rather than built through internal contradiction. Swappability: low at closure; the trait is mechanically necessary. Late setup (second third) applies −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is named once in paragraph four ("Moving with a sense of shielded openness") and enacted in the careful, respectful wall approach. Setup by midpoint; development: one beat (the approach as "one would a frightened animal"); payoff: the tone modulates with the reveal (stale air, trapped echoes). Two beats (approach, reveal). Coherence: the tone holds—observant distance with emotional porosity. Friction: the phrase is abstract and label-like; the tone is shown more through syntax (measured pacing, sensory balance) than through this exact coinage. Swappability: moderate—"cautious empathy" or similar could replace it. Closure: the tone charges the final image (rain dripping, silence heard). Late first mention (midpoint) applies −0.2. Cost: the tone reflects method, no trade-off visible.</comment>
