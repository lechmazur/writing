<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained throughout—collecting emotional burdens—and her specialized role as Fractal weaver provides distinctive interiority. The wrestling with regret shows embodied struggle ("boundary-lessly trapped," "mind would be lost"), and the final gathering of stones demonstrates a completed micro-arc. However, the piece leans heavily on specialized vocabulary ("recursive, self-similar geometries," "fractal weave") that borders on diagnostic labeling, and Elara's internal contradictions remain abstract rather than dramatized through competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the recursive regret pattern build pressure until the alignment-and-calcification beat shifts the emotional register and forecloses the spiral with visible cost (the sorrow becomes dead stones in a satchel). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis, as Elara endures the somber cycle and waits for the next burden—with felt cost legible in "dense, dead weight" and the sealing quiet. One deduction: the middle escalation is primarily descriptive intensification rather than a choice-driven tightening, which slightly softens causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with specificity ("greening alloy," "oxidizing floor," "skeletal brass object") and the sensory details are filtered through Elara's professional focus. The kerosene burner functions as a micro-setting object that directly constrains her choice—she must align it with starlight to calcify the regret—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (cross-legged on floor, burner by knee, fissure above), and the "shingled hush" operates as tangible atmospheric pressure. Minor note: some metaphors verge on ornamental ("whalebone reverie") but remain tonally consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stabilizing the recursive regret before it traps Elara's mind—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pattern multiplies and threatens to consume her, forcing the burner-alignment action. The resolution is protagonist-driven (she twists the burner into alignment) with visible cost: the living grief becomes dead chalk, "no longer a feeling," archived and inert. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and pattern intensification, though the middle beat could have benefited from a secondary complication or physical cost to enter the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: emotional burdens as tangible, recursive geometries that can be transmuted and archived. The final image—chalk stones replacing living sorrow, Elara waiting for the next meltwater—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of bearing others' pain without stating a moral. The "whalebone reverie" and calcification motif accumulate meaning across beats. One limitation: the piece occasionally verges on abstract philosophizing ("profound, oceanic drifting of thought") rather than letting the imagery alone carry thematic weight, which slightly weakens emergent force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent psychic distance and a distinctive perceptual signature (professional focus on geometry, weight, and transformation). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with vocabulary choices ("fractal weaver," "gallery and wick winder") reflecting Elara's specialized knowledge. Register is elevated but consistent with the meditative tone. One penalty: filter verbs ("felt," "feeling") cluster in the middle section during high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy; and the prose occasionally shifts into expository mode ("Her motivation was singular and crushing") that tells rather than shows through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("shingled hush where layers of quiet overlapped like slate tiles"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character state, or plot. However, overwriting appears in several beats: "whalebone reverie, a profound, oceanic drifting" stacks near-synonym metaphors without pattern payoff, and the opening paragraph layers multiple conceits ("bronze grotto," "skeletal ribcage," "greening alloy," "roots of the pine forest...machinery of the earth") in rapid succession, creating mild register drift and slight opacity. The closure beat is clean, limiting the penalty, but mid-section density crosses into purple prose that slows momentum. Apply −0.6 for figurative density without payoff and mild coherence slip in metaphor vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—emotion as manipulable fractal geometry, calcified by starlight through a lamp burner—is specific and non-obvious. The underground sanctuary, Fractal weaver profession, and the mechanics of alignment feel fresh rather than generic fantasy-helper tropes. Emotional particularity (regret as "jagged sorrow that spiraled endlessly inward") and the sensory grounding elevate the concept beyond abstract magic. One friction: the piece does not fully transform the burden-bearer archetype; Elara's arc is more endurance than revelation, and the ending returns to the static waiting position without a surprising inflection that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to use the burner creates the key turn. Setup is immediate (opening paragraph), development shows her wrestling with the regret (middle), and closure links directly to her gathering the stones. However, much of the middle is internal struggle without distinct choice beats; the alignment action is singular rather than a sequence of decisions under shifting pressure. Causal role in one major beat plus framing presence justifies mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kerosene burner is introduced early ("sat by her knee"), handled in the climactic alignment beat ("lifted...toward the fissure," "twisting her wrist"), and its specific mechanics (gallery, wick winder, no chimney) matter to the transformation. Two distinct beats: sitting ready, then active use. Closure directly depends on the alignment succeeding. The object's unique properties (empty frame as lens, not fire source) make it irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage with specificity elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" is introduced early as atmospheric detail ("layers of quiet overlapped like slate tiles") and returns at closure ("shingled hush settled back"). The concept shapes Elara's concentration challenge (pressure threatens to suffocate) and the final sealing image reweights it as a permanent container. The middle beat shows it as obstacle; the end as restored equilibrium. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, though it does not directly constrain a tactical choice. Early seed and charged return justify low-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" appears once in the middle paragraph as a label for Elara's subjective state ("felt boundary-lessly trapped, caught in a transparent cage"). It conveys internal pressure but does not enable or constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost; the trait remains abstract and interchangeable with "overwhelmed" or "lost." No setup, no closure participation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Calcify" is seeded early (Elara needs regret "to calcify, turning from a drowning liquid into a hard, white bone"), drives the climactic transformation beat ("the grief finished its transition," "pile of small, porous chalk stones"), and defines the closure consequence (burden archived as dead weight). The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the story's central mechanism. Three beats (setup, execution, consequence), high causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is introduced mid-story as the mechanism ("magic worked not by force of will, but by orienting properly the empty burner frame") and executed in the climactic beat ("closed one eye, twisting her wrist to align...with the celestial coordinate"). The method shapes the attempt and its success hinges on precision. Two beats (explanation, execution) with causal pressure and closure linkage. The mechanics are specific enough to matter, though the concept could have been seeded earlier for stronger integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "bronze grotto under starlight" is established in the opening paragraph and provides the essential resource (starlight through the fissure) that enables the climactic action. The setting constrains choice: Elara must position the burner to catch the beam. Three gates met (setup, development, closure participation) with causal pressure. The environment is specific and irreplaceable—no starlight, no calcification. Solid integration with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph as atmospheric context ("just after the first snowmelt, when the frozen world above finally wept its cold thaw"). It frames the moment but does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics. The story would function identically in any season. Present as setting detail but functionally inert; replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is stated explicitly in paragraph two ("Her motivation was singular and crushing: to collect the weights...freeing them from the heaviness") and dramatized through the wrestling-with-regret beat and the final gathering of stones. The motivation drives the entire sequence and shapes the closure consequence (burden archived, waiting for the next). Three beats (declaration, struggle, completion) with causal pressure and closure linkage. One friction: the motivation is told rather than shown through a prior choice or dramatized friction between desire and cost, which slightly lowers the score from high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is introduced early ("atmosphere...steeped in a whalebone reverie, a profound, oceanic drifting") and returns at closure ("letting the somber whalebone reverie wash over her again"). The tone is coherent and meditative throughout, modulating slightly as pressure builds (from drifting to threat to restored calm). The final return reweights the opening image with the cost of endurance. Lyric reprise with tonal charge, though the middle section's tonal intensity could be more distinct. Early seed and closure reprise justify low-6s.</comment>
