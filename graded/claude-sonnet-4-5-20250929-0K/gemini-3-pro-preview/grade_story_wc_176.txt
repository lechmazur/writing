<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's interior motivation is concrete and embodied—his "snowmelt ardor" and the tactile engagement with the punched card ground his emotional arc in physical action. The renunciation (burning the paper to achieve permanence) is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "snowmelt ardor" itself borders on label-speak, though the subsequent embodiment recovers immediacy. The grief-to-monument transformation shows internal contradiction (destroying to preserve) acted out in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the ephemeral memory becomes imperishable metal, and the act forecloses the paper's fragility permanently. Drive lens is Causal (because/therefore: coating → mold → rope reconfiguration → heat → pour → solidification). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Elias, icebound sanctum, aurora, workbench). One meaningful tightening occurs when the furnace mechanism requires the rope reconfiguration, narrowing options and forcing the ceremonial act. Cost is legible in the final image: the "ghosts of the past" are now "locked…into a fortress of permanence," and the original card is ash.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rope's physical constraint (stiff with frost, requiring delicate manipulation) shapes Elias's method and the scene's tension. The aurora functions as both atmosphere and active force—its light carries physical heat that melts the bronze, directly enabling the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear: workbench, mold, crucible, rope, aperture. Micro-setting (the rope's brittleness, the crucible's placement) charges the final beats. One slip: "icebound sanctum under aurora" risks postcard generality in early description, but the piece anchors tactile detail (frost, plaster, tongs) that recovers specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the melody/names) is signaled early and tightens when the rope reconfiguration becomes necessary—no rope activation, no heat, no casting. Escalation is causal: each step (coating, curing, activating furnace, pouring) narrows options and raises irreversible commitment. The pour is an on-page act with visible cost: the paper is destroyed to create the bronze replica, and the decision forecloses return. Minor issue: the atmospheric energy mechanism arrives late (midpoint) without prior setup, though it functions as obstacle rather than convenience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (permanence vs. ephemerality, redemption through sacrifice) emerges organically from the lost-wax process metaphor and the punched card's transformation. The final image—bronze singing the melody—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the rope's "knots of silence" re-tied into "shapes of reception." One slip: "turning grief into a monument" in the final line edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The piece resists tidy resolution (the original is ash; only the replica remains), maintaining complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during rope work, pulling back slightly for the pour). Diction remains consistent—elevated but grounded in craft language ("investment mold," "crucible," "silica and plaster"). Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices texture (rectangular perforations, brittle fibers) and process details. Minor slip: "snowmelt ardor" and "fortress of permanence" drift into slightly archaic register not fully anchored in the established voice. No dialogue present; internal rhythm supports pressure peaks (short clauses during the pour, longer during reflection).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance action or deepen stakes. Rhythm varies (short urgent beats during activation, longer contemplative ones framing the process). Clarity remains strong through technical choreography. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop ("a perfect void remained, waiting to be filled" echoes "empty space where the paper memory had once been" two paragraphs later); (2) "fierce, burning vitality" + "thawing the numbness" stacks fire metaphors densely in the opening; (3) "illuminate with a blinding, pulsating violet radiance" overmodifies a single beat. Applying Non-closure Accumulation Cap: −0.8 for paraphrase + metaphor density, confined to non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting + punched card + aurora-powered furnace feels specific and non-obvious. The rope-as-focus-mechanism offers a fresh inflection on the craft-ritual premise. Emotional specificity (grief transformed through artisan process) grounds the concept. Minor limitation: the "forgotten names" stake remains somewhat abstract—we never learn whose names or what failure Elias carries, which keeps the premise one step from full irreplaceability. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through without retreat, though the core arc (redemption via craft) is recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's decision to coat the card, activate the furnace via rope reconfiguration, and pour the bronze drives all major beats. His choices narrow options (destroying the paper) and the final act (breaking the mold, tapping the plate) crystallizes closure. Present in setup, middle (rope work), and ending. Causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The punched card appears in four distinct beats: initial handling/contemplation, coating in slurry, burning away to void, and final replication in bronze. Its perforations are felt tactilely, then filled with metal. The card's transformation from ephemeral paper to permanent bronze is the story's central action. Removal would collapse all stakes. Strong setup, development, and payoff with evolving use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" shapes the premise (punched card = recorded melody) and the dominant stake (preserve it). The concept is dramatized in the card's handling and the casting process, not merely thematic. It constrains Elias's method: he must use lost-wax to lock the perforations. Present in setup and payoff; middling development as the concept recedes during rope activation. One beat of strong causal work (coating the memory), closure linkage solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is embodied on-page: Elias's "rough, scarred hands manipulating the brittle fibers with the delicacy of a surgeon" during rope work. The trait enables success (rope doesn't break) and creates tension (one mistake could ruin the activation). Visible in one extended beat with clear cost/benefit tradeoff. Present in setup (thumb over perforations) and key middle action. Specific rather than label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the climactic action: the aurora's violet radiance floods down, heats the bronze, and enables the pour. Without it, the casting fails. The action is causally essential (rope → light → heat → liquid metal) and charges the final image (the bronze "singing"). Setup via architectural mention, major turn in activation beat, payoff in successful melt. Irreplaceable and causal throughout.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rope reconfiguration is signaled early (central spire, ceremonial rope), its mechanics detailed in an extended beat ("unwove the knots of silence…re-tied them into shapes of reception"), and its success directly triggers the climax (light flood). The method is specific and irreplaceable: the furnace "responded only to the geometric language" requiring this exact technique. Setup, development (full beat of manipulation), and payoff all present. Strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sanctum's architecture (open roof, central spire, ceremonial rope system) constrains Elias's method and supplies the mechanism for bronze melting. The aurora overhead is both atmospheric and functional (source of heat). The setting is not postcard—it pressures tactics (must use rope to channel atmospheric energy). Present in setup, key to middle action, charges final image. Micro-setting elements (frost on rope, aperture) alter execution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving himself" frames the opening emotional state and contrasts with "years…in the cold shadow of his own errors." The timeframe motivates present action (tonight he is ready to sacrifice the original) but doesn't tighten tactical decisions within the scene. It's a psychological gate rather than a ticking clock. Present in setup, colors motivation, but no middle constraint or payoff escalation. Lyric reprise in final satisfaction, but modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") is stated early, embodied in Elias's tactile engagement with the card ("feeling the rhythm of lives he had failed to protect"), and drives every major action: coating, activating furnace, pouring. Conflict is present: to preserve, he must destroy the original. The final image (bronze plate "singing the melody of the lost") directly fulfills and reweights the motivation. Setup, two beats of dramatized choice, strong payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears in the opening ("fierce, burning vitality…thawing the numbness") and returns implicitly in the final line ("warmth in his chest lingering"). The tone modulates with pressure: contemplative during card handling, tense during rope work, triumphant at the pour. One slip: the phrase itself trends ornamental and isn't tactilely carried through middle beats. Coherent and purposeful, with closure echo, but modest development between setup and payoff.</comment>
