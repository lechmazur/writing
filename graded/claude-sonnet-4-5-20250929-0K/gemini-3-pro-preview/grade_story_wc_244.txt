<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and embodied through his defensive humor and the physical moon rock. His internal contradiction—mastering logistics while paralyzed by personal connection—drives the core choice to discard the rock, foreclosing the transactional path with visible cost. The woman's entrance and violin offer sufficient pressure to earn the shift. Minor deduction: her characterization remains somewhat instrumental, though her "shared moment is the only currency" line carries thematic weight and the final beat lands cleanly on Arthur's vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece infers as Causal-Hybrid: Arthur's whisper campaign sets up the encounter, and his decision to toss the rock creates a decisive before/after that reconfigures his isolation into connection. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shading into Decisive Change): Arthur abandons barter for vulnerability, and the cost—destroying the rock's exchange value—is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening through the stranger's arrival and Arthur's realization suffices for this length. Minor slip: "This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" is meta-commentary that weakens immersion slightly, though it does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivy-station setting is vivid and purposeful: looters tipping hats, vines holding up brickwork, the platform where Arthur organizes gauze. The moon rock's discard onto the tracks—where it "clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel"—charges the closure image by erasing its celestial status. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting constrains and enables the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure. Minor deduction: some descriptions ("polite anarchy," "benign virus") lean slightly ornamental in early paragraphs, though they anchor tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled early and drives all moves. The woman's arrival tightens options: Arthur must choose between transactional safety and vulnerability. His toss of the rock narrows the path with visible cost (he destroys its trade value), and the ending forecloses the barter route. Agency is clear and the escalation is protagonist-driven. One solid reversal (offer to play vs. no transaction) suffices for this length under the Causal lens. The price—risk of being known—is felt in "the strange, terrifying sensation of being known."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (connection requires vulnerability, not barter) emerges organically from Arthur's arc and the rock's symbolic trajectory. The final image—music retreating silence, Arthur no longer hiding—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The closing line "the logic of the heart had finally taken over" flirts with abstraction but is earned by prior particulars (the discarded rock, the violin, Arthur's embodied terror). Subtext operates cleanly in dialogue ("a truth that's had a few drinks") and in the moon rock's transformation from celestial object to worthless gravel. Strong thematic coherence with minor exit toward sentimentality in the final clause ("polite anarchy...continued outside").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Arthur is stable and effective. Voice is distinct: "invoices never asked him why he was crying," "at least the trains weren't running late anymore," "grin stretching too wide." Diction matches Arthur's logistician mind and desperate humor. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit ("I assume you have the payment?" masks terror). The woman's speech is slightly less individuated but functionally clear. Minor slip: "This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" breaks POV modesty with narratorial intrusion. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure (close at the rock-toss, slightly pulled back for the ending summary).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich with strong concision. "Invoices never asked him why he was crying," "ivy...held up the crumbling Victorian brickwork better than the original mortar," and "clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel" demonstrate high craft. Information density is excellent. Deductions: "This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" is scaffold meta-commentary that should be cut. "The polite anarchy of the world continued outside, chaotic and absurd, but inside the station, the logic of the heart had finally taken over" leans slightly purple and abstract at the closure beat, reducing punch. One paraphrase loop: "catalyst" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 6 and final paragraph). These keep the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—trading moon rock for friendship via rumor chains in a post-crisis world—is fresh and specific. The turn (discarding the rock to preserve its meaning) transforms the transactional premise through Arthur's lived choice. Risk-taking in tone (looters tipping hats, "polite anarchy") and the bartered-intimacy conceit elevate the piece. Minor deduction: the woman's arrival via "heard a story" feels slightly convenient, though it is set up by the rumor mechanism. The ending's "logic of the heart" phrase nudges toward abstraction. Overall, the synthesis is non-obvious and the emotional specificity (Arthur's terror, the violin case) grounds the concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arthur appears in every beat, makes the key choice to discard the rock, and his logistics expertise frames the world. His decision alters tactics (from barter to vulnerability) with visible cost. Early signal, middle involvement (organizing gauze, waiting), and closure linkage all present. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moon rock introduced early (breast pocket), reappears when he holds it ("cold, dead stone"), and is discarded onto the tracks at closure where it "clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel," reweighting its celestial myth into ordinary matter. Three beats, causal pressure (offers/withdraws trade), closure linkage, and charged reprise. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Reciprocity is stated ("reality bound by reciprocity") and Arthur reasons that "ultimate connection required an offering of celestial value," shaping his initial tactic. The woman counters with "shared moment is the only currency that doesn't depreciate," and Arthur's rock-toss enacts rejection of barter logic. Setup, development, and payoff present; the concept constrains one major choice. Mid-band: it shapes stakes but is somewhat told rather than fully dramatized across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" appears in the opening ("His humor was desperately jocular, a frantic shield") and is embodied in Arthur's quips about trains and his "grin stretching too wide, masking the terror." At closure he sits "no longer hiding behind a joke," foreclosing that defensive path. Setup, development (jokes to the stranger), and payoff with visible cost. Causal pressure and specificity present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Catalyze" frames Arthur's intent ("He needed the rock to catalyze a reaction") and the final paragraph states "the catalyst had not been the rock, but the risk of letting it go." The rock-toss is the major turn that enables connection. Early signal, middle involvement (holding/offering), and closure linkage. High causal pressure and the action redefines options from transaction to vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rumor chains are detailed early (scavenger, barber, deaf composer; message "distorted and embellished at every node") and directly enable the woman's arrival ("I heard a story"). Setup and payoff clear; the method's mechanics matter (whispers vs. broadcast, myth-making). Causal pressure moderate (brings the stranger but does not constrain the final choice). Strong integration across two beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Railway station introduced in the opening paragraph with vivid detail (ivy, crumbling brick, looters, sleeping families) and reappears throughout (platform, tracks, entrance rustling). Arthur organizes gauze on the platform, waits there, and tosses the rock onto the tracks at closure. The tracks supply the literal ground for the rock's demotion. Setup, development, and payoff; environment constrains and charges the final image. Three beats, high causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" explicitly names the element and marks the shift from logistics procedural to intimate encounter. Arthur "checking his watch though time had long since ceased to matter" and the phrase "eventually, the ivy...rustled" signal waiting. Setup and payoff present; the shift is legible. Mid-band: somewhat told and the meta-commentary reduces integration elegance. Lyric reprise partial; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Loneliness named early ("consumed by the motivation to find the cure for loneliness") and dramatized through Arthur's preference for invoices, his silent radio, and "crushing silence." The woman's music retreats that silence, and Arthur feels "the strange, terrifying sensation of being known." Setup, development (offering the rock to solve isolation), and payoff with visible emotional cost (terror of vulnerability). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" introduced early ("looters would tip their hats as they stepped over sleeping families") and recurs at closure ("The polite anarchy of the world continued outside, chaotic and absurd"). Tone is coherent: absurdist details (tipping-hat looters, barber-to-deaf-composer chain) modulate under pressure as Arthur's jocular mask drops. Setup, development through Arthur's quips, and payoff. The tone charges the final contrast (anarchy outside, heart-logic inside). Strong integration.</comment>
