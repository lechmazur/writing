<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is grounded in specific embodied detail—the watch heating, cautious exuberance as "fragile blend"—and her micro-choices (closing eyes, catching text in periphery) reveal method under pressure. However, the narration often tells emotional state ("terror and thrill," "rush of triumph") rather than letting contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final smile and "eager to bear" land as summative rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first 100 words. The piece accumulates pressure through the unfolding cipher, propagation-delay method, and time inversion, then closes on "the unspoken had finally found a voice"—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. Cost is legible: she risks entrapment ("cyclic reversal would trap her") and must flee before completion. One meaningful tightening (watch warning, walls groaning) is sufficient at this length, and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing library, translucent marble, shifting panels, and mist are vivid and selective. The confidence man's watch constrains her method (she relies on its rhythm), and the environment directly pressures her exit choice ("walls groaned," purple light signals inversion). Spatial choreography is clear—archway, panel to the right, shifting floor—and the watch's heating functions as micro-setting that charges the final turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the library before the cyclic reversal traps her) is signaled early and tightens once: the watch grows hot, walls groan, she must flee. Her agency (using propagation delays, closing eyes, documenting fragments) drives the tightening. The cost is visible—she gets "enough" but not all, and arrogance is explicitly tempered—but the final act reads as successful extraction rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: "Truth decays when spoken," "silence is not empty," the library of unspoken words. The unfolding cipher and propagation-delay method embody rather than declare the premise. The final image—ink proving "the unspoken had finally found a voice"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One flaw: "cautious exuberance" and "the weight of the unwritten letter now a burden she was eager to bear" edge toward abstraction rather than allowing the notebook and smile to carry full thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is present: "logic of this place was cyclically reversed," "catching the words in the nanoseconds." Diction mostly fits ("veiled dreamer," "cheating time she had perfected in dreams") but "cautious exuberance," "intoxicating," "fatal error" lean toward stock intensifiers. No dialogue to evaluate. The narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sheer magnitude," "chaotic dance of geometry") that reads competent but not sharply character-particular under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and no hard loops or scaffold appear. However, multiple adjacent sentences share template cadence: "She was known…" / "She was here…" / "She had to…" / "She felt…" / "She looked…" Figurative language in peak beats ("bruised purple," "chaotic dance of geometry," "intoxicating") is competent but leans decorative. "The air hummed with a low frequency vibration" and "the library protected its secrets" could be tightened. No artifact touches closure directly, so the −0.4 non-closure adjustment applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher, propagation-delay decryption, and cyclically reversed logic are fresh enough to avoid template. The confidence man's watch as deception-tracker repurposed for architecture is a clever twist. However, the core frame—lone explorer in mystical library retrieving forbidden knowledge under time pressure—is well-trodden, and the emotional arc (triumph tempered by caution) follows predictable beats. Specificity in method lifts the piece, but the resolution (successful extraction) does not surprise or transform expectations in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara ("veiled dreamer") drives the inciting choice (entering the library) and the exit decision (fleeing before the cycle inverts). Her method (closing eyes, watching the periphery) shapes two beats. However, her final smile and eagerness are summative rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in four distinct beats: initial check, hands spinning/settling into rhythm, growing hot (warning), and final loud click (exit trigger). It constrains her method (she relies on its ticking to guide perception) and enables the propagation-delay tactic. It is causally active at closure (the loud click forces her to flee). However, its "deception measurement" premise is mentioned but not reweighted or used; it functions primarily as a timer.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is signaled early ("security measure that rewrote itself the moment it was observed"), shapes her tactic (she must use propagation delays to catch text before it scrambles), and pressures her exit (the cipher "rippled behind her, sealing the secrets"). It defines the story's core obstacle and makes her method necessary. Removing it would collapse the plot's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" is signaled early ("to move forward, one had to remember the future"), constrains her navigation ("anticipating where [the floor] would not be"), and pressures the exit ("the cycle was about to invert," trapping her as "turning her exit into an entrance"). It enables one on-page choice (closing eyes to access the lag) and forces her final retreat with visible cost (incomplete retrieval). The cost is felt but not deeply personalized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Document" drives two beats: she "hurriedly began to document the fragments" (mid-scene) and the wet ink in her notebook at closure proves success. The act enables her to carry knowledge out and shapes the final image ("proving that the unspoken had finally found a voice"). However, the documentation itself is not a contested or costly choice; it follows straightforwardly from her goal. Swapping "document" for "capture" or "transcribe" would require minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Propagation delays" is signaled early ("the lag between reality and perception"), shapes her core tactic ("catching the words in the nanoseconds before the library's defenses could scramble them"), and enables the successful retrieval of text. It is mechanically specific (opening eyes "for a fraction of a second," seeing text "freeze in the periphery," capturing "the afterimage") and causally necessary—removing it would eliminate her means of decryption and collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "glowing library in mist" is present at open and close, provides the shifting panels she must decode, and supplies the physical pressure (walls groaning, light shifting to purple, floor shifting) that forces her exit. The mist re-envelops the library at closure, sealing it as memory. The setting is not merely backdrop; its cyclic inversion rule and unfolding cipher are the story's dominant obstacle and constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "two fateful letters" frame is signaled in the opening ("this moment existed precariously between two fateful letters") and returns at closure ("the weight of the unwritten letter now a burden she was eager to bear"). The first letter is held (crumpled) but its decoded cost is told, not shown; the second remains abstract. The timeframe shapes her urgency (she must document before the cycle inverts) but does not tighten choices in a dramatized way—time pressure comes from the watch and walls, not the letters themselves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To find the library of unspoken words" is stated as her goal ("She was here to find the library of unspoken words") and realized at closure ("the unspoken had finally found a voice"). The desire is coherent and drives her entry and documentation. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction; no moment shows her weighing the cost of pursuit against another need. The motivation is functional and stable but not tested or deepened under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named in the opening ("Her heart hammered with cautious exuberance, a fragile blend of terror and thrill") and returns implicitly in "She felt a rush of triumph, but she tempered it instantly" and the final smile. The tone modulates with pressure (caution rises as the watch heats, triumph is checked by awareness of danger) and charges the ending image (veiled smile, eager burden). However, the label itself is abstract and the prose often tells the blend ("terror and thrill," "intoxicating") rather than letting rhythm and image alone carry the tonal contradiction.</comment>
