<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's prism-minded intellect is asserted but not shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her competence overwhelms genuine struggle—she calculates twelve trajectories, exploits threshold effects, and speaks resonant frequencies without visible friction or cost to her choices. The final "satisfied thought of completion" tells triumph rather than embodying it through renunciation or trade-off. Interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("prism-minded," "multi-faceted vision") rather than concrete, character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (waiving orientation penalties). A causal lens holds: gravity inversion → ascent → grotto navigation → sanctum entry → seed activation → escape. However, the closure lands as a competence demonstration rather than a choice with visible cost; "satisfied thought of completion" asserts outcome without showing what was foreclosed or risked. The chronometer warns of collapse, but Elara's escape reads as executed skill, not a decision that reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent moss pulsing with heartbeat, ionized air tasting of ozone, threshold effects as shimmering distortions. The grotto's oblique-angle luminescence and frictionless surfaces constrain navigation tactics. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the inversion and return. However, the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than forcing a choice that charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—renewing the Seeds of Vigilance—is signaled early and drives the sequence. However, escalation reads as a series of competence checks rather than narrowing options: Elara solves the doodle, exploits thresholds, speaks frequencies, and escapes on schedule. The chronometer warning adds urgency but not a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No on-page cost is dramatized; the resolution feels like flawless execution rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges around vigilance, forgotten knowledge, and institutional decay, but the ending offers no non-literal reweighting of the question. "Fire of protection burned silently overhead, unseen but ever-present" states the outcome without irony or cost. The prism-mind convergence into "a single, satisfied thought" feels like thematic summary rather than earned resonance. Latent blaze and seeds function as prompts echoed rather than particulars that constrain or reweight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (gravitational maps in doodles, twelve-trajectory calculations). However, diction frequently elevates beyond immediate perception: "cognitive anomaly," "metaphysical tumblers," "suppressed, smoldering energy trapped inside a seed" read as writerly exposition rather than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. No dialogue present. The voice is coherent but over-polished, reducing embodied urgency at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is textured and rhythmically varied, but density issues accumulate: "the air suddenly ionized, tasting sharply of ozone and ancient dust" stacks sensory modifiers without advancing action. "Serpentine grotto in mist, a chaotic network of tunnels carved into the underside of the floating archipelago that usually served as the canyon's ceiling" loops spatial description. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("strobe light," "seed with crack," "intestines") without clear pattern-teaching. Register drifts into elevated academic phrasing ("metaphysical tumblers," "cognitive anomaly") during peak action, reducing immediacy. Applying −0.8 for density and coherence issues in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—gravity inversion enabling access to a hidden sanctum—offers a fresh angle, and prism-minded perception is inventive. However, the emotional arc and resolution (competent archivist solves puzzle, renews wards, escapes) could function unchanged with different window dressing. Threshold effects and gravitational maps feel ornamental rather than transformative. The piece risks abstraction: "forgotten combinations," "metaphysical tumblers," and "seeds of vigilance" remain high-concept labels without grounded cost or lived stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her choices drive the sequence (consult doodle, surf thresholds, trace the spiral, speak frequencies). However, these read as competence demonstrations rather than decisions under friction. She never hesitates, trades off, or renounces; her prism-mind solves each obstacle flawlessly. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but her role is executioner of a plan rather than agent facing cost, capping score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doodle is handled in the opening (gravitational map overlay), consulted at the impasse (counter-intuitive path in four dimensions), and tucked away at closure. It enables two beats and shapes the sanctum entry. However, its meaning does not evolve or reweight; it remains a static key. Strong causal role across beats, but no felt cost tied to its use and no charged reprise at the end, limiting the score to upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seeds of Vigilance are the story's goal, named early, sought through the grotto, discovered as rune-carved spheres, and renewed with forgotten combinations. They drive stakes, define success, and appear in the final image as "fire of protection...unseen but ever-present." The element shapes three beats and articulates closure participation. However, the renewal lacks visible cost or trade-off—Elara simply speaks the frequencies—reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Clandestinely luminous moss emits light at oblique angles and pulses with Elara's heartbeat, guiding her deeper. It appears in two beats (ascent navigation and return fade) and adds atmospheric constraint. However, the moss does not force a choice or impose cost; it functions as helpful scenery. Present in setup and closure periphery, but swappable with any guiding environmental marker, capping score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reentry to the inner sanctum is Elara's stated goal ("needed to reenter") and frames the quest. The sanctum houses the Seeds, and reaching it defines success. However, the action itself—passing through the dissolved wall—is brief and uncontested. The element shapes stakes but is not dramatized as a turn with cost; it could be replaced by "find" or "reach" with minor edits, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Threshold effects are signaled early ("the only way to traverse") and explained as volatile boundary layers between inverted gravity and static magic. Elara uses them to surf jagged seams, and destabilization at the hour's collapse adds urgency. The method appears in two beats and constrains navigation tactics. However, mechanics remain abstract; no on-page failure or cost is tied to exploiting thresholds, limiting score to low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is central: Elara ascends into it during inversion, navigates its frictionless surfaces and luminous moss, reaches the sanctum within, and descends from it at closure. It supplies obstacles (mist, oblique lighting, threshold turbulence) and resources (moss guidance). The setting appears in all three phases and pressures tactics. However, the grotto does not force a pivotal choice; it remains a gauntlet skillfully navigated, capping score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hour-long gravity inversion is signaled at the start, triggers the ascent, defines the tactical window, and collapses with a chronometer warning at closure, forcing Elara's rapid descent. Time shapes three beats and tightens the final escape. The chronometer buzzes "against her bone," embodying urgency. However, the escape reads as executed skill rather than a choice under time pressure, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's goal—to find forgotten combinations securing the world against chaos—is stated early and drives the quest. She seeks the Seeds, decodes the doodle, and speaks the resonant frequencies. Motivation is present in setup, middle, and payoff. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs; no friction between desire and sacrifice appears on the page, placing it in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Latent blaze is introduced as "suppressed, smoldering energy...waiting for a single crack to erupt," describing the grotto's atmosphere. It erupts when the Seeds flare into "controlled inferno of protective golden light." Tone appears in setup and payoff, and the controlled eruption supports the ending image. However, the tone remains a static descriptor rather than modulating with pressure or charging character choice, limiting score to mid-band.</comment>
