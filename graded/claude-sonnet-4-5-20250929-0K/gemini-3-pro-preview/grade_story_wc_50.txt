<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is declared ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") but operates as a philosophical thesis rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The weeks of study are summarized, not dramatized as micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("maddeningly delicate process," "volatile beauty") that read as authorial rather than embodied perception. The final satisfaction ("satisfied with his work") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would earn a meaningful change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, reflection, and mechanical detail toward a single harvest moment. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cavern stripped of spirit, wonder "contained" in the machine, with the promise of future release. Cost is stated abstractly ("cavern was suddenly dead") but legible. The tightening from observation to harvest is present but much of the escalation occurs in summary ("For weeks..."), weakening the felt pressure at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (damp, polished stone; shaft of daylight; misting breath) filtered through Elias's technical focus. Spatial choreography is coherent across the nave, floor, and surface climb. The cavern's acoustic properties constrain his method (perfect stone walls, reflection angles) and the final image of a "dead" cavern stripped of echoes charges the closure. Minor slip: "the surface world" description leans toward elevated summary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the lost echoes before silence freezes them. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mechanism whirs and pulls the sounds into the device. However, weeks of study are summarized rather than shown as live attempts with escalating difficulty. The harvest itself proceeds without complication or trade-off on the page—Elias succeeds on the first attempt shown. Cost (the cavern's death) is conceptual and felt, but no tactical choice narrows options or forecloses a path with visible consequence during the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus experience, reason as shelter for wonder, emerges through Elias's project and the "wounded season" frame. The final image of the dead cavern reweights the earlier texture with conceptual cost. Weaknesses: "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated rather than discovered; the locksmith metaphor (unlocking memories in spaces) is explained rather than enacted in a choice; and the harvest proceeds without irony or friction that would complicate the thesis. The ending avoids moralizing but the thematic question is articulated rather than lived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elias. Register drifts into elevated authorial diction ("subterranean cathedral smoothed by eons," "cage for the intangible," "custodian of the past") that exceeds the plausible lexicon of a solitary artisan mid-crisis. Perceptual signature is present (technical observation, peripheral focus) but the interior voice reads as essayistic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance widens at key beats into philosophical summary. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("He knew," "He believed") are acceptable but stack in the second paragraph, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Syntax varies and figurative language is purposeful in many lines ("vacuum for nostalgia," "inhaling lung"). However, density issues and scaffold appear: "He noted where the light lingered and where it fled, using these visual cues to map..." recaps the same observational work across adjacent clauses. Template cadence in paragraph three: "He adjusted... He was building... He tightened..." Stack of filter verbs in paragraph two ("He knew," "He needed," "He had to") flattens peak momentum. The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but the closure beat leans on abstract summary ("reduced to mere geology," "secured within the rational architecture") rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "reflective locksmith" who harvests acoustic echoes using a reversed timer is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The peripheral-focus technique and the wounded-season frame add texture. However, the emotional core—solitary preservation against entropy—is familiar, and Elias's project proceeds without friction or surprise that would transform the premise. The ending commits to its implications (the cavern's death) but the final stance (climb to surface, custodian awaiting a new era) reads as a median option rather than a bold, irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his reflective locksmith trait frames the premise, but his key "choices" (adjust the timer, tighten the screw) are mechanical rather than decisional under pressure. Weeks of study are summarized. The harvest succeeds without complication, and the final climb is satisfaction rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Early signal and closure presence meet two gates, but causal pressure and cost are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism appears in setup (salvaged, described), development (adjusted, pins forced to click), and closure (shakes, engages, placed in pocket). It is handled across three distinct beats and its reversed function enables the harvest. Specificity is strong (brass gears, escapement, pins). The mechanism's transformation from broken to inverted is causally active. Minor cap: it does not constrain a choice—it simply works when used—so irreplaceability and visible cost tied to the object itself are modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is the dominant stake and shapes the entire arc: observation, mechanism preparation, and the whirring vortex that pulls phantom sounds into the device. It appears in all three gates and drives the closure image (cavern stripped, echoes compressed). However, the concept is more atmospheric thesis than on-page constraint—Elias's tactics do not shift because of competing methods or costs tied to the harvest itself. The echoes are captured successfully without complication, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is introduced in the second paragraph and demonstrated once: Elias trains his gaze on dark recesses while his mind attends to shimmering distortions at the edge of vision. The trait enables the final observation ("Because he was meticulously looking at the floor, he saw the air above the device warp in his side view"). Two-gate presence (development, closure) and one beat involvement, but no cost or trade-off tied to the peripheral method itself. The attribute is more technique than constraining trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering the timer is central to the plot: the action is signaled early, described in mechanical terms (forcing pins to click in unnatural rhythm), and produces the harvest vortex. It appears in setup and climax, driving two beats. However, the reverse-engineering itself is summarized rather than shown as a live attempt with setbacks. The action's specificity is strong, but swappability is modest—another method of sound capture could replace it with minor edits to the mechanism description.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is introduced early and described in a full paragraph (observing daylight refraction, mapping invisible sound trajectories). The method frames Elias's approach and is causally linked to the peripheral-focus technique. However, it is summarized ("For weeks...") rather than shown in live beats where the method's mechanics matter. It does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Two gates (setup, development via summary) and functional role, but no payoff beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced in the opening line, its acoustic properties (perfect stone walls bouncing echoes) enable the entire premise, and the final image charges closure ("cavern was suddenly dead, stripped of its ambient spirit"). The setting is handled across three beats (observation, harvest, aftermath) and supplies the resource (trapped echoes) that drives the plot. Minor limitation: the cavern does not constrain a tactical choice—it is stage rather than obstacle. Strong setup and closure linkage, solid causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "lull of a wounded season" appears in the opening sentence and is reprised in the final image ("when the season turned"). It provides atmospheric context and frames Elias's motivation (preserving wonder before silence freezes it). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—the "weeks" of study are vague, and no clock or seasonal pressure shapes the harvest attempt. Two gates (setup, thematic closure echo) but minimal causal role and no live tracking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated explicitly mid-story and drives Elias's project from setup through closure (placing the device in his coat, planning future release). It shapes the dominant stake and returns in the final paragraph. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—Elias acts without friction, cost, or competing impulses tied to this motivation. Three gates and thematic resonance, but limited on-page pressure or felt trade-off between storing and experiencing.</comment>
