<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's dual performance—trembling senility versus sharp agency—is embodied through concrete choices (fumbling the spool, straightening after Kael leaves). Her motivation to "listen for unheard stories" drives the needle work with visible cost (the risk of encoding treason). Kael remains functional but one-note; his sneering impatience serves pressure without interior contradiction. The shift from mask to truth is clean, though the final slump back into senility feels more asserted than earned by on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. Orientation anchors early (dome, loom, Kael's demand). The conspiracy setup → flame ritual → encoded map follows clear because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change: the map now screams treason to those who know the codes, altering the coup's outcome off-page. Cost is conceptual (Lysa's continued risk) rather than viscerally felt in the final image; the slump and wind feel more atmospheric than a reweighting with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening (Kael's two-day deadline narrowing options) is present but the ending skips the lived consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt meteorite dome, russet vines, thin cold air, and acoustic perfection ground the scene with sensory specificity. The loom, eternal-candle lantern, and spun-nebula filament function as micro-setting that constrains Lysa's method. The autumn decay motif and wind return in the final beat to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (hidden compartment, needle into flame, embroidery ripple) is clear and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent Kael's coup by encoding the trap into the map. One clear tightening (two-day launch deadline) raises cost. Lysa's agency—choosing to thread the warning rather than comply—drives escalation under the causal lens. The final cost is legible (her continued subterfuge, the coup beginning "soon") but remains conceptual; we do not see the map challenged or Lysa's next move, so the price feels more projected than paid on the page. The middle ritual beat (synchronizing needle to flame frequency) adds texture but doesn't narrow options beyond the initial decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth hidden in plain sight emerges through the embroidery that "screams treason" only to those who know the codes, avoiding overt statement. The flame from the burned Great Library anchors memory versus erasure. "Silence would speak volumes" in the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The russet-decay motif and "ending cycles" risk decorative symbolism but serve the autumn/conspiracy parallel without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady on Lysa; psychic distance tightens from her performed senility to interior clarity without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "quantum foam where choices branched like capillaries" and "synchronize the vibration of her needle with the resonant frequency of the flame" read as her expert idiom. Kael's dialogue ("Is the chart ready, old woman?") and Lysa's croaked evasions carry subtext and goal pursuit. Voice modulates cleanly between the mask and the truth without filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor acoustic texture and setting. Information density is high in the ritual sequence (flame, nebula filament, quantum foam, synchronization). Minor scaffold appears: "She was a galaxy-chart embroiderer, but her medium was not merely silk and light; it was the fabric of truth itself" over-explains rather than trusting prior dramatization. "The silence of the room seemed to deepen, pressing against her ears" is vivid but the next sentence ("She was unraveling conspiracies by stitching them into plain sight") restates the concept without advancing pressure. No loops or template cadence in peak beats; copy is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer premise and "listen for unheard stories" motivation combine familiar tropes (cryptographer, resistance insider) with the specific medium of embroidery viewed through "adjacent possibilities." The eternal-candle flame from the Great Library and the nebula-thread ritual add fresh texture. The ending risks the tidy "warning encoded, coup forestalled" template but the specificity of "crimson light" visible only to trained navigators offers a non-obvious inflection. Risk-taking in the esoteric method (quantum foam, resonant frequency) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's choices create key turns: she decides to encode the trap (middle), retrieves the lantern and threads the needle (ritual), and completes the map with the warning visible to the Chancellor's navigators (closure). Present in setup (hunched over loom), development (flame ritual), and payoff (final embroidery ripple). Causal pressure is strong; her agency drives escalation. Cost is conceptual (continued risk, mask resumed) rather than viscerally paid, preventing the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The eternal-candle flame is withdrawn from the hidden compartment, its "colorless" heat "felt like memory," and Lysa holds the needle tip "directly into the wavering heat" to access adjacent possibilities. Used in two beats (retrieval and synchronization) with reweighted meaning (relic of the burned Library → tool for unraveling conspiracy). Closure links indirectly: the map's success depends on the flame's use, but the flame itself does not reappear in the final image. Swappable with another esoteric tool without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unraveling conspiracies" is the explicit goal: Lysa must "see beyond the physical location of the stars" to find "where the conspiracy had frayed the weave of reality" and encode the ambush points. Present in setup (Kael's coup whispers), development (quantum-foam search for the trap), and payoff (embroidery reveals treason). Shapes tactics (the esoteric method, the encoding) and the dominant stake. The phrasing "unraveling conspiracies by stitching them into plain sight" risks meta-commentary but the concept drives on-page choices with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" constrains multiple on-page actions with visible cost: Lysa fumbles the spool, giggles vacuously, and mutters "Time is just a loop of thread" to survive Kael's impatience. The mask enables her survival in the "viper pit" and buys time for the encoding. The trait pays off when she "re-assuming her mask of senility" after completing the map, foreclosing openness with felt risk. Introduced early, used across beats, and integral to the closure's tension (the coup will begin, but she remains disguised).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears once, explicitly: Lysa must "synchronize the vibration of her needle with the resonant frequency of the flame." This action enables the map's revelation ("If she failed, the chart would remain a simple map"). Present in the middle ritual beat and implicitly shapes the payoff (the map ripples with encoded warnings). Not seeded early; introduced in the second half. The mechanics are stated but not dramatized with failure or visible struggle beyond "the needle dipped and dived." Swappable with another technical term (attune, calibrate) without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through adjacent possibilities" is Lysa's method: she "closed her eyes, letting her mind drift into the quantum foam where choices branched like capillaries." The mechanics are explained but not enacted with on-page cost or failure; we are told she sees one possibility early, another where the Chancellor surrenders, and "the true thread" with the trap. The method does not shape multiple attempts or constrain tactics beyond the single ritual sequence. Introduced late (second half) and summarized rather than dramatized. Functional but largely ornamental flavor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Cobalt Observatory is introduced in the opening line, "carved from a single meteorite of blue stone," "high above the cloud line where the air was thin and cold." The dome's acoustic perfection amplifies Kael's voice and later the "profound, echoed silence" that lets Lysa work. The autumn vines and wind return in the final beat to charge the closure. The hidden compartment beneath the loom supplies the lantern. Setting pressures choices (isolation enables secrecy; the loom is her workspace) and the "blue glass" shaken by wind in the closing image ties location to tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Before the coup" and the two-day launch deadline create urgency. Kael's "We launch in two days" tightens Lysa's window and raises cost. The final line ("The coup would begin soon") confirms the timeframe shapes the closure. Present across beats: whispers "before the coup," the deadline, and the imminent start. The clock is stated but not tracked moment-to-moment; we do not feel minutes passing during the ritual. Functional causal role but not a live, escalating countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is stated as Lysa's motivation: "Her motivation was not to serve the military, but to listen for unheard stories, the quiet tragedies of those who would be crushed by Kael's ambition." This drives her decision to encode the warning. The desire is told rather than dramatized through prior choices or internal conflict; we do not see her weighing the cost of listening versus safety. Present in the middle beat (explanation after Kael leaves) and implicit at closure (the map will prevent tragedies). Functional but largely expository.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is introduced in the opening (dome's "hollow resonance") and returns multiple times: the "profound, echoed silence" after Kael leaves, "the silence of the room seemed to deepen" during the ritual, and "the silence would speak volumes" in the final line. Tone modulates from oppressive (Kael's booming voice) to enabling (Lysa's work) to charged (the encoded warning). The recurrence reweights silence from absence to presence, charging the closure image with undeniable pressure. Coherent across beats and integral to the ending's conceptual cost.</comment>
