<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is established through embodied detail—arthritis vanishing, "clouded eyes tracing the lines"—and her motivation to witness without judgment shapes the arc. However, the character remains observational throughout; her agency at closure is passive acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The final stance ("keeper of the quiet") feels like a label rather than an earned renunciation with dramatized consequence. Internal contradiction is minimal; she glides toward stasis without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the library's decay accumulates pressure until the swelling river forces transition, and the obsidian refuge offers a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis qualifying as RR). Orientation anchors quickly (Chronicle Keeper, overgrown library, catacombs). The origami-swan mechanism provides a single meaningful tightening that narrows spatial options and delivers Elara to the refuge, where regenerative silence crystallizes her final stance. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the archive and her role—but the final image makes the trade-off legible: "no longer a keeper of books, but a keeper of the quiet."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: vines, ferns, fractured ceiling, moss carpet, and the subterranean river all shape the decision to relocate. The obsidian refuge charges the final image with its black volcanic glass and bioluminescent cavern, constraining Elara's vantage and crystallizing her new role. Sensory detail—damp earth, mold, the river's "heavy, silent power"—is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clear throughout both locations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's need to reach the refuge before the rising water—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The swelling river provides one meaningful tightening that forces the origami-swan action. However, escalation is low-tension; the protagonist's response is assured and contemplative rather than conflicted. The cost at closure (abandoning her keeper role) is conceptual and legible but lacks dramatized struggle or trade-off that would raise the stakes into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: decay, transition, and the regenerative power of silence. The obsidian refuge and the origami swan carry thematic weight without overt statement, and the final image—"a keeper of the quiet that follows the end of stories"—reweights the archive's collapse as necessary return rather than tragedy. The piece resists moralizing and embraces complexity ("watching the universe change without needing to save it"). No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara mistakes shadows for scholars, experiences "the boundary between what was and what is had softened like wet paper." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("gripped reality loosely," "anxious handling," "breathy expansion"). Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects her contemplative, detached stance without filter-verb stacks or register drift. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is deployed with control: "the books were merely trelliswork," "soft as wet paper," "drank the dim, bioluminescent light." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor issues: "cryptic folds in a well-worn origami swan" appears twice verbatim (once as prompt element, once as internal narration), a small loop. The final third maintains clarity and propulsion without artifact intrusion at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The origami-swan-as-portal mechanism offers a fresh angle on the keeper-and-archive premise, and the obsidian refuge is memorably specific. The combination of crumbling library, paper geometry, and regenerative silence feels organic rather than checklist-driven. However, the emotional arc—contemplative acceptance without conflict—trends toward a familiar meditation on impermanence. The transformation test is borderline: swapping names and setting would reduce resonance, but the arc's quiet inevitability leans conventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara anchors the story and her decision to use the swan and relocate drives the single major turn. However, her role is largely observational; she witnesses change rather than creates key reversals. Present across all three gates (setup, middle action, closure participation) but her agency is passive acceptance, not conflict-driven choice with visible cost tied to her actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge is signaled early ("mentioned only in the oldest, now-dissolved scrolls"), functions as the goal that drives the middle transition, and dominates the closure scene with its black volcanic glass and regenerative silence. It shapes Elara's final stance and charges the ending image. Irreplaceable; the story's logic hinges on this exact sanctuary.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named early, drives Elara's motivation to reach the refuge, and is dramatized in the closure scene: "the regenerative silence washed over her like a cool tide...knitting together the memories." It constrains her final choice (to remain in the refuge) and charges the ending. Present in setup, development (as goal), and payoff. Slightly weakened by some abstraction; the concept is more told than shown in embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is established early with embodied examples: mistaking shadows for scholars, the boundary softening "like wet paper." It enables the origami-swan navigation ("urging her consciousness to burrow into the abstract depths") and subtly justifies the mystical transition. Present in setup and development, with indirect closure linkage (her ease in the refuge's void). One causal beat involvement, but specificity and cost connection are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Burrow" is signaled as the key action ("leaning forward, urging her consciousness to burrow into the abstract depths"), drives the major turn (transition from library to refuge), and its effect—compression, expansion, navigating creases—is shown in detail. The entire middle sequence depends on this exact verb and its mechanics. Present in all three gates; causal pressure is high. Slightly docked because the climax is mystical transit rather than conflict-driven struggle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced early, handled physically ("smoothed...on her knee," "her fingers began to manipulate the cryptic folds"), and its mechanics ("She did not fold the paper to reshape the bird; she folded the bird to reshape her own location in space") are essential to the middle transition and enable the closure in the refuge. Irreplaceable; removing it would break the story's logic. Present in all three gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The overgrown library is vividly rendered and provides concrete pressure: the rising river forces Elara's departure, and the catacombs anchor the mystical geography. It shapes the inciting problem and the middle transition. Present in setup and development; the closure occurs in the refuge, so the library's direct participation ends mid-story. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure in the first half, with thematic reprise ("the library above finally succumbing") in the final reflection.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears once as descriptive phrase but does not constrain on-page choices or create urgency. The swelling river provides immediate pressure, but the timeframe itself remains vague and untracked. Present in setup (atmospheric mention) but absent from development and closure participation. Ornamental; swappable with "over long years" without affecting structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to witness change without judgment, accepting the collapse of the archive as naturally as its construction"—is stated early and drives her decision to relocate rather than save the library. It shapes her final stance in the refuge ("watching the universe change without needing to save it"). Present in all three gates, but the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices. One strong beat (choosing to leave) with moderate friction; the acceptance reads serene rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is established in the opening (vines overtaking books, damp earth, "ancient forgetting") and modulates through the transition: the library's decay contrasts with the refuge's "permanent, crystalline stillness." The tone charges the final image—"the quiet that follows the end of stories"—and remains coherent across turns. Present in setup, development (the rising water adds urgency without breaking the contemplative register), and payoff. Slightly weakened by consistent serenity; no sharp modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
