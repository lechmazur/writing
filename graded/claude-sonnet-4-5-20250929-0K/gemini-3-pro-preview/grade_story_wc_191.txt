<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's occupation as Lore Keeper is stated but never constrains a choice; her "wisely adventurous" nature is asserted, not embodied through contradictory impulses. The climb and throne-claiming sequence reads as competent execution without visible struggle or trade-off—no stamina cost, no fear response, no moment where caution wars with ambition. The final shift from observer to ruler is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly and follows a causal chain (waterfall → orchard → mural → stairs → throne). Closure delivers a Decisive Change—Elara claims the seat—but the cost remains abstract: "nostalgia faded into resolve" tells rather than shows a felt price. The lens reads Causal, held throughout, yet the final image asserts transformation without on-page evidence of what she sacrificed or lost to sit there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, skeletal chrome trees, and high eastern wall are vivid and purposeful. The ruby flake and smart-paint interaction create a micro-setting that enables the stairway reveal. Spatial choreography is clean, and the projection's instability adds urgency. The setting does not, however, force a tactical choice at closure—Elara climbs without environmental resistance—which keeps it shy of higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reach the throne before sunrise incineration) is signaled early and produces one meaningful tightening when the stairway flickers and klaxons wail. Agency at closure is decisive physical action—she leaps and climbs—but no visible cost appears: no exhaustion, no tool failure, no sacrifice of knowledge or relationship. The deadline creates urgency but does not narrow options or extract a price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "lore keeper to ruler" and "nostalgia for a tomorrow that never happened" is coherent and emerges from images. The final line ("nostalgia faded into resolve, for the sunrise brought not destruction, but a new command") tips into thematic statement rather than letting the image speak. The Unclaimed Throne and mural motifs are present but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning at closure—they remain illustrative rather than resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a controlled distance and purposeful diction ("ferrocrete," "hard-light projection"). Perceptual signature is present in tech-infused observations. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sally forth," "bridging the gap between the lore of the past and the survival of the future") that sits uneasily with the urgency of a timed escape, and the final paragraph's declarative tone flattens the focalizer's lived experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries multiple text artifacts: "her nature wisely adventurous" is filter-heavy and label-like; "evoke a deep sense of futuristic nostalgia" over-explains; the final two sentences loop thematically ("Lore Keeper had become the ruler, bridging the gap" then "nostalgia faded into resolve"). Template cadence appears in the mural-peeling sequence ("she sliced," "the surface curled," "she worked," "every layer removed"). These accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of Lore Keeper profession, smart-paint archaeology, and hard-light stairs is specific and non-obvious. "Futuristic nostalgia" and the skeletal orchard offer fresh texture. However, the "Unclaimed Throne awaits the chosen one" and "leap of faith onto glowing steps" beats echo familiar genre templates without sharp transformation. The final image of claiming the seat is competent but predictable, lacking a final turn that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation frames the mission, but her Lore Keeper role does not constrain a key choice—she acts as adventurer, not archivist, after the opening. She presses the ruby, peels paint, and climbs without a moment where preservation conflicts with risk. Present and functional, but swappable with "archaeologist" or "explorer" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears early (setup), enables the mural reveal (middle development), and is "clutched tight" as she climbs (closure participation). It shapes two distinct beats: retrieving it from her belt and using it to slice paint. Its "crystallized code-memory" property is specific but does not impose a cost or narrow options—it works as needed. Strong across beats but lacks irreplaceability or felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Unclaimed Throne is the stated objective, shapes the mission from the opening, and is reached at closure where Elara sits and syncs with the interface. It appears in all three gates and drives the escalation when klaxons announce the solar reset. The act of claiming it delivers the Decisive Change. The conceptual cost (ruler vs. keeper) is asserted but not dramatized, which limits the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is introduced early as a label ("her nature wisely adventurous, balancing the thrill of discovery with the calculated risks of structural collapse") but never constrains an on-page action. She proceeds without visible caution, hesitation, or tradeoff between prudence and risk. The trait is present in setup, absent in middle and closure. Swappable with "determined" or "skilled" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sally forth" is signaled when the projection becomes unstable and she realizes she must rush onto the ephemeral steps. It creates the climactic leap and drives the ascent beat. However, the word "sally" itself is ornamental—"launch," "leap," or "dash" (all used nearby) would serve identically. The action is essential; the exact verb is not. Strong closure linkage but high swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (ruby flake retrieval), executed across multiple beats (slicing, curling surface, revealing murals, dissolving wall), and directly produces the stairway that enables closure. The mechanics matter: without peeling the paint layers, the hard-light projection does not manifest. The method shapes both middle development and closure participation with specificity—removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hidden orchard is established early, provides the high eastern wall that hides the mural, and appears in the closure beat ("the hidden orchard shrank below"). It supplies spatial anchoring and atmospheric texture (chrome trees, glowing fruits). The kaleidoscopic waterfall frames entry. However, neither orchard nor waterfall constrains a choice or extracts a cost—they are traversed without resistance. Present across all gates but largely scenic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is stated in the opening ("only until sunrise before the solar arrays reset and incinerated the unauthorized zone") and returns when "the first rays of the real sun crested the horizon." The klaxons midway add urgency. However, the timeframe does not visibly tighten tactics—Elara proceeds methodically without time-pressure choices, and she reaches the throne "just as" the sun arrives, a coincidence rather than a cost. Functional but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Finding the stairway of ascension is the stated objective, drives the search and mural-peeling sequence, and is realized when the projection appears. The motivation is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it reads as single-track goal pursuit without conflicting wants or visible friction—no cost of what she gives up to reach it, no moment where fear or doubt complicates the climb. Causal but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" is woven through diction (ferrocrete, hydro-coolant, techno-utopia, "a tomorrow that never happened") and the mural of figures ascending toward a sun. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly when the klaxons wail. The final line ("nostalgia faded into resolve") names the tone shift rather than embodying it through image, and the declarative register flattens the futuristic texture. Present and purposeful but does not fully charge the closure image.</comment>
