<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and grounded in his indexer's logic, with embodied micro-choices (suppressing doubt, forcing readjustment). Internal conflict appears when doubt assaults his mind but is quickly suppressed—more simultaneous contradiction would strengthen. The choice to pocket the stamp and plan dissemination earns the ending, though the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Minor deduction for "dappled resolve hardening in his chest," which edges toward abstract performance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements: blackout → stillness → physical decryption → revelation. Closure lands as Decisive Change (discovery) combined with Charged Poise (pocketing the stamp, organizing next steps) with conceptual cost legible in "dangerous truth that could shatter the city's glass walls." The two-paragraph historical exposition (founding era, High Council claims) sits near the 20% threshold but anchors present stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stamp clicks and text shifts. Cost is felt but slightly oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken city, bioluminescent algae, reinforced glass, and vibrating infrastructure create vivid constraint: the blackout's stillness enables fingertip detection of grooves. The stamp's prism mechanism charges the final revelation. Spatial choreography is clean (library tier, central pedestal, western wall). Minor gap: the "cavitating water pumps" and oxygen scrubbers are mentioned for stakes but don't pressure a mid-scene choice. Setting does constrain the climax (stillness required for decryption) and the final image (glass walls as metaphor and literal vulnerability).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trace honest origins vs. suffocation risk) is clear and tightens when the stamp initially doesn't fit, forcing readjustment. Agency drives the turn: Elian's hypothesis, suppression of doubt, micro-adjustment. The revelation narrows options (he now holds dangerous truth) with visible cost in the final lines—"armed with a dangerous truth that could shatter the city's glass walls." One escalation point (stamp clicks, text shifts) is sufficient at this length. Cost is conceptual but legible and charged by the closing image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fabricated history vs. honest origins emerges through concrete action (decryption) rather than statement. The "reclaimed stillness" motif works thematically but leans slightly toward metaphor convenience. Final image (pocketing stamp, facing artificial light with truth) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. The prison-manifest reveal reweights the sanctuary premise with conceptual cost. Minor slip: "clarity it had provided would remain fixed in his mind" edges toward telling theme rather than trusting the image. Ambiguity persists (what will he do?) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: "logical page indexer," "alphanumeric coordinates," "statistical inconsistencies." Diction fits character (calculated, orderly, hypothesis). Two slips: "dappled resolve hardening in his chest" inflates register, and "the darkness dappled the room with shifting aquatic shadows, mirroring the dappled resolve" forces symbolic echo via repetition rather than letting image work alone. Psychic distance is controlled. Elian's way of noticing (cataloging, organizing data) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances setup or decryption. Rhythm modulates appropriately (short bursts during adjustment, longer clauses for revelation). Two clusters reduce score: "dappled" appears twice in close proximity for symbolic work rather than natural description, and "abruptly stripping," "darkness became...a physical weight," "tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve" stack elevated diction in the opening third without clear voice motivation from a "logical indexer." No loops or paraphrase; propulsion is strong. Figurative language ("darkness...a physical weight") is coherent but slightly dense for the established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sunken penal-colony twist and physical-decryption-key premise offer fresh angles on hidden-history trope. The stamp-as-key (prism + grooves) is specific and inventive. Risk: the setup delivers considerable exposition (two paragraphs of world-building and backstory), but it's integrated into Elian's motive and the blackout's utility. The "vibrations blur text" constraint is clever and earns the stillness payoff. Slight deduction for "dappled resolve" poetic inflation and the convenience that the stamp's prism catches bioluminescence at the exact needed moment. Emotional truth (pursuit over survival) grounds the concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's indexer logic frames his hypothesis, suppresses doubt, and drives the micro-adjustment (three-degree twist) that unlocks the text. His choice to pocket the stamp and plan dissemination creates the story's final turn. Present in setup, development (readjustment under doubt), and closure (organizing "terrifying reality into a plan"). Causal pressure is strong; cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stamp appears in four beats: theft mention, initial placement (fails), readjustment (succeeds with prism effect), and pocketing at closure. Its physical properties (brass weight, crystal handle prism, microscopic grooves) enable the decryption and charge the revelation. Removing it collapses the plot. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is seeded early (blackout arrests mechanical heartbeat), enables the decryption (vibrations masked grooves), and returns in closing reflection ("reclaimed stillness was ending"). It constrains the key choice (fingertips detect grooves only in silence). Slightly thematic rather than tactical in final image, but it does alter options mid-scene. Two gates plus tactical payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears in the opening ("did not panic...remained tranquilly perceptive") and enables his eyes to adjust and his suppression of doubt. It's more label than visible tradeoff; the trait is consistent but doesn't constrain a peak choice with cost. Functional but closer to voice coloring than decisive action driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Readjust" is the story's hinge: initial failure → re-examination → three-degree twist → click → revelation. The action is irreplaceable (any synonym would dilute the precision). Seeded in paragraph three, executed in paragraph four, and its result (pocketed stamp) drives closure. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" (stamp as decryption key, not ink dispenser) is seeded early, frames Elian's approach, and differentiates his method from "standard protocol." It shapes his attempt and the readjustment beat. The mechanics matter: prism + grooves = revealed text. Slightly more conceptual than physical constraint, but it does guide tactics. Present in setup and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The library's lowest tier, bioluminescent algae, vibrating pedestal, oxygen scrubbers, and glass observation wall all constrain choices and supply resources. Blackout removes vibrations (enabling decryption), algae provides light for prism, glass walls frame the fragility metaphor at closure. The setting is indispensable to the plot mechanism. High integration across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blackout timeframe gates the entire plot: only during power loss can Elian detect grooves and use the stamp. The ticking clock (oxygen scrubbers might not restart) raises stakes in paragraph three. Turbine groan signals time running out at closure. The timeframe tightens decisions and is irreplaceable. Strong causal role and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is stated early, motivates the theft and risk, and drives the readjustment under doubt. The revelation (prison manifest) delivers the desire's object with brutal cost. Friction between want (truth) and survival risk is dramatized in paragraph three. The motivation shapes all three acts and charges the final choice to disseminate. High causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears twice (paragraph three: "darkness dappled...mirroring the dappled resolve"; paragraph five: "resolve...hardening"). The tone modulates from calm cataloging to doubt-assault to renewed determination, coherent with pressure. The "dappled" image charges the aquatic setting but feels slightly forced via repetition. Tone supports closure (facing artificial light with truth) but leans thematic. Two gates plus lyric reprise.</comment>
