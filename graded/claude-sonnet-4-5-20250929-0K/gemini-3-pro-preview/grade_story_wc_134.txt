<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's arc from macro-focused seer to someone who notices "microscopic miracles" is legible but arrives through exposition rather than dramatized contradiction. The pearl-handling moment offers one concrete micro-choice (reaching out, then withdrawing), yet her interior voice leans heavily on abstract philosophical register ("concentration of the ambient wonder") that feels more like authorial thesis than character-particular perception under stress. Kael remains functional but thin—his weeping feels asserted rather than earned by prior embodied struggle. The ending renunciation (withdrawing her hand) carries conceptual cost but minimal visceral price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's withdrawal breaks the shadow bridge but accepts the lesson, foreclosing her old method with felt cost. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (bioluminescent pulse, symphonic resonance, layered sensory detail) and holds it through the ending image, which reweights her vision practice. One orientation slip: "after the pilgrim arrives" (timeframe element) is stated but the precise trigger moment and spatial entry path remain slightly vague until Kael "shuffled into the chamber." Causality is clean—shadow geometry enables the entity's arrival, pearl transforms, Elara withdraws—though the midpoint leans into reflection that slows momentum slightly before the climactic shadow-merge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Singing Geode is richly anchored through sound (melodic humming, harmonies), light (bioluminescent pulse, high-contrast silhouettes), and geology (quartz formations, obsidian gloom, cave pearl's geological memory). The overlapping shadows—specific geometry of light and darkness—directly enable the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint. Sensory selection reflects urgency: Elara narrows to the pearl's "magical signature" and shadow intersection at peak pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (cross-legged center, pilgrim shuffles in, hands approach, silhouettes merge on pearl surface).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elara's encounter with an unpredictable magic that defies her structured prophecy. The shadow-merge moment meaningfully tightens pressure, narrowing her epistemology and forcing the withdrawal choice. However, the escalation mechanism—"unseen forces" that slip through the shadow doorway—arrives conveniently late and resolves the tension by broadcasting mundane-joy images rather than testing Elara's agency against a concrete obstacle. Kael's arrival and the pearl's revelation feel more situational complication than protagonist-driven reversal. Cost is conceptual (abandoning her grand-vision practice) but the physical or relational price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—attention to the overlooked present versus horizon-gazing prophecy—emerges organically from the cave pearl's broadcast of "morning dew on a spiderweb, the smell of baking bread, and the warmth of a held hand." The "bright darkness" motif recurs purposefully, framing the loom metaphor at closure. Yet the final paragraph edges into thesis statement: "to magnify everyday magic, transforming the banal act…into a moment of transcendent awe" reads more like prompt echo than earned image. The piece avoids overt moralizing but Elara's epiphany ("microscopic miracles…in favor of macroscopic disasters") is articulated rather than dramatized through choice friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the shadow-merge, wider for the entity's motivation). However, diction drifts into elevated abstract register that clashes with urgency: "concentration of the ambient wonder," "spiritual texture of the encounter," "microscopic miracles." These phrases feel writerly rather than Elara-particular. Kael's single line of dialogue is serviceable but generic. The narrative voice often tells emotional state ("gasped," "jolt," "weeping…from the sheer intensity") rather than trusting embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean where used, but filter verbs ("felt unseen forces surge," "realized with a jolt") dull immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high in the opening (bedrock, symphonic resonance, bioluminescent pulse, obsidian gloom) but the middle section loops conceptually: "steadily unpredictable, fluctuating in a chaotic rhythm" repeats the same idea in adjacent clauses. Template cadence appears in the explanation paragraphs: "For the first time…sat frozen," "The entity inside…was not a demon or a god, but…," "Elara realized…that her visions had always…" — each opening with subject-verb-past and stacking abstract clauses. The phrase "bright darkness" is seeded early and charged at closure, a positive. Mixed metaphor: shadows as "doorway" then "loom" shifts vehicle mid-image. Stock phrasing: "a vessel of breath and blood." Apply −0.6 for template runs and synonym churn ("steadily unpredictable…chaotic rhythm"), −0.3 for register drift into thesis-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clairvoyant-blindsided premise offers a fresh ironic angle, and the shadow-geometry trigger is specific. However, the emotional arc—seer learns to value the mundane—is a familiar template executed competently but without a bold inflection. The "unseen forces" that broadcast everyday-joy images resolve tension by broadcasting the theme rather than testing Elara through a hard choice between competing goods. The cave-pearl object and bioluminescent setting are vivid but not transformed by character-specific perception. Transformation test: swap Elara for another "grand-vision specialist" and the arc functions unchanged. No close proximity to famous lines, but the piece reads more like a polished illustration of its premise than a risky synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (clairvoyant who didn't see it coming) is present throughout and her ironic blindness to the shadow-geometry trigger drives the inciting beat. She makes one key choice—withdrawing her hand—that breaks the shadow bridge and accepts the lesson, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. However, her decision feels more like acceptance of a revelation than a choice under pressure between competing costs. The trait is constrained to one beat (the withdrawal) with conceptual cost but minimal physical or relational price. Swappability: another "macro-focused specialist" could carry the arc with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4, but swappability −0.6, ornamental interiority −0.4 → lands mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cave pearl appears in three beats: Kael unwraps it, Elara reaches to accept it (shadow-merge trigger), and it remains "lit from within" at closure as "a permanent monument." Its specific properties—spherical, milky surface, geological memory—enable the shadow-projection mechanism. Removing it would break the closure logic. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows Elara's options by revealing unpredictable magic) +1.2, closure linkage (charged final image) +1.5, specificity +0.6. Total nudges ~+5.4 from a 3.0 base, but swappability concern (another "ancient artifact" could serve) −0.8, and the pearl is handled rather than used tactically in middle beats −0.4 → lands low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unseen forces are named explicitly and described as slipping through the shadow doorway to inhabit the pearl, shaping one key beat. However, they function more as thematic vehicle (the overlooked everyday) than as a constraint that narrows Elara's options. The concept is introduced late (second half) and resolves by broadcasting images rather than testing agency. Setup weak (implied early via "unseen" metaphor, explicit late), development functional (one beat), closure participation as backdrop. Late arrival −0.6, ornamental use (theme illustration rather than tactical pressure) −0.8, summary-only motivation ("primary motivation was simple yet profound") −0.5 → base 3.0 + one-beat involvement +0.4 + closure presence +0.7 − frictions ~−1.9 = low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is attributed to the pearl's magical signature, signaled early ("fluctuating in a chaotic rhythm that defied her structured perception") and paid off when Elara realizes it is "simply life itself—unscripted, chaotic, and beautiful." It constrains her ability to read the future in one beat and reappears thematically at closure. However, the trait is more thematic label than tactical cost—it does not visibly alter her tactics or force a trade-off on the page. Early signal +0.6, two beats (detection, realization) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but label-only in middle section −0.6, no visible tradeoff −0.5 → ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Inhabit" drives the central turn: unseen forces inhabit the cave pearl, transforming it into a vortex and broadcasting everyday-magic images. This action is specific, causal, and irreplaceable—without it, no closure. However, it occurs passively (forces act, Elara observes) rather than through protagonist agency, and the mechanics are told ("began to inhabit…turning the dull stone into a swirling vortex") rather than shown through sensory progression. Early signal (forces "surge," then inhabit) +0.5, two beats (inhabit, broadcast) +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, but summary-only −0.6, passive observation −0.5 → mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overlapping shadows are seeded early ("sharp, high-contrast silhouettes"), signaled as the trigger ("through overlapping shadows…the dormant power finally found its doorway"), and enable the climactic beat. The geometry is specific and irreplaceable: the shadow-intersection on the pearl's surface creates the portal. Removing this exact mechanism would break the closure. Early signal +0.7, two beats (shadow-merge, withdrawal breaks bridge) +0.9, causal pressure (constrains Elara's scrying, enables entity) +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost connection (withdrawal visible) +0.5 → strong high-7s push. Minor deduction for late explicit articulation of the rule (midpoint) −0.2 → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave is vividly anchored (Singing Geode, quartz formations, bioluminescent pulse, obsidian gloom, melodic humming) and constrains the shadow-geometry mechanism. The cave's living stones harmonize with the pearl at closure, charging the final image. Setup strong (first paragraph), development (sound swallows Kael's whisper, silhouettes stretch), closure (cave deepens, "bright darkness…the loom upon which this brilliant light was woven"). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables shadow-merge) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7 → pushes toward mid-7s, but the cave functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical constraint (Elara's choices are not shaped by access, proximity, or cave resources) −0.6, some postcard description ("massive quartz formations glowed") −0.3 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" frames the timeframe and is satisfied when Kael shuffles in. The arrival timing was foreseen by Elara ("visualizing the precise moment his boot would strike the cavern floor"), establishing ironic expectation. However, time does not tighten decisions or create a clock—the encounter unfolds without urgency or deadline. Setup clear +0.7, development (timeframe met, encounter unfolds) +0.4, closure participation weak (time does not reconfigure meaning at the end) +0.2, but vague tracking (no live clock, no tactical pressure from elapsed time) −0.5, swappable (could be "at dawn" or "during the pilgrimage") −0.5 → mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to magnify everyday magic" is attributed to the entity inside the pearl and articulated explicitly: "Its primary motivation was simple yet profound: to magnify everyday magic, transforming the banal act…into a moment of transcendent awe." This is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. The entity's desire is not tested against a cost or obstacle—it simply broadcasts images. Setup absent until midpoint, development (one beat: broadcast), closure participation (pearl remains lit, Elara acknowledges small things). Late arrival −0.8, label-only (motivation summarized, not enacted through friction) −0.7, ornamental (theme illustration) −0.5 → base 3.0 + closure presence +0.6 + one beat +0.4 − frictions ~−2.0 = low-3s, rounded 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" is seeded in the opening ("an atmosphere of bright darkness…devoid of sunlight…glowed with a bioluminescent pulse") and charged at closure ("The bright darkness of the cave deepened around them, the shadows acting as the necessary loom upon which this brilliant light was woven"). The oxymoron coheres across beats and modulates with pressure (static description early, active metaphor at climax). Setup strong +0.8, three beats (opening, shadow-merge, closure loom) +1.4, closure linkage (reweights the paradox as creative tension) +1.6, specificity +0.6 → pushes high-7s. Minor deduction for one stock phrase in middle section ("sharp, high-contrast silhouettes") −0.3 → 7.1.</comment>
