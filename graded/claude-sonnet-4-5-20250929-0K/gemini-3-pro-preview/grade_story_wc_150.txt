<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in diaspora displacement, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("desperate need to bridge the aching gap") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The embodied emotion is thin—"warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"—reads as labels rather than visceral states. The final choice (hoisting the gnomon) feels thematically coherent but arrives without visible internal conflict or a foregrounded cost that would elevate the moment. Minor issue: "wondering if the skull...belonged to a poet, a mother, or a potter" tells rather than enacts curiosity through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through image and reflection toward a final reweighting when the sundial casts its shadow. Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the restored sundial reweights "interrupted journeys" into continuum—but the cost is conceptual and retrospective ("proven that what was paused could be restarted") rather than an on-page forfeiture or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery → reconstruction → restoration), sufficient for this length, though the final beat leans declarative ("her faith...was solidified") instead of charging through image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, specific, and purposeful: roots "weave through the yellowed bones," the "fissure high above where the olive roots entered" supplies light for reconstruction, and the blocked exit mirrors exile. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent, wandering, and final restoration. The sundial's placement "at the very heart of the orchard" and its requirement for light directly constrain Elara's task, charging the closure when "the beam hit the restored stone." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a quasi-archaeological gaze, though the piece tilts visual at the expense of scent and touch in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith / bridge past to present) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through discovery (sundial fragments) and reconstruction, with one meaningful tightening: the act of reassembly becomes a literal "stitching a wound." Agency is present but passive—Elara's work is patient and deliberate rather than fraught with reversals or live trade-offs. The cost is conceptual (time, solitude, patience) but not legibly dramatized as a forfeiture on the page; we do not see what she sacrifices or risks losing during the week of sieving. No antagonist or external friction complicates the escalation, which under an Accumulative lens is acceptable, but the final turn ("the light had returned") resolves without visible price beyond effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (interrupted journeys, diaspora return, continuity) emerges organically from the sundial's breakage and the blocked exits, not from overt statement until the final paragraph. The ending offers a resonant image—shadow pointing "toward the true north of the tomb"—that reweights prior material (time paused / restarted, "the path home...a circle"). Subtext operates well in the physical relics (travel sack, half-carved inscription, sandals). Weakness: the closing lines tip into thematic summary ("proven that what was paused could be restarted") rather than trusting the image to carry meaning, and "a place of deep, vegetative waiting where life and death fed one another" reads as authorial philosophizing that dilutes the concrete work done earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and diction remains elevated throughout—appropriate for the quasi-archaeological, lyrical register. Perceptual signature is consistent (treating the space "less like a gravesite and more like a dormant library") and vocabulary fits an educated returnee. Weakness: under peak stress (final assembly), the narration maintains the same tempo and register without compression or cadence shift, and the closing paragraph drifts into exposition ("By mending the broken instrument, she had proven...") that tells rather than enacts the stakes. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with strong imagery ("roots...snaked between the limestone ribs," "dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight"). Rhythm varies purposefully across paragraphs. Minor template cadence in paragraph two: "She moved...She followed...She felt" stacks three identical subject-verb stems without variation. Overwriting appears in the final paragraph: "a surge of connection that traveled from her fingertips to the marrow of the earth" and "rooted now as deeply as the olive trees that drew life from the history beneath them" layer metaphors densely without adding pressure. No loops or causality breaks, but the closing beat could be tightened by half to increase impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The diaspora-returnee-restores-relic frame is familiar but executed with specific detail (catacomb orchard, sundial requiring light underground). The "interrupted journeys" motif and the physical sundial linkage feel organic rather than imposed. Freshness is moderate: the emotional arc (dislocation → restoration → belonging) follows a predictable trajectory, and the final realization ("the path home was not a straight line, but a circle") lands as tidy summation rather than a non-obvious synthesis. The setting (roots through bones) and the tactile reconstruction work provide memorable texture, but no bold risk elevates the material beyond competent execution of the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (diaspora returnee) drives all major beats: she descends, wanders, uncovers the sundial, reconstructs it, and hoists the gnomon. Her identity shapes her lens ("treating the subterranean space less like a gravesite and more like a dormant library") and the stakes (bridge past to present). Present in setup, middle reconstruction, and closure. Causal pressure is moderate—her choices enable the work but no on-page decision involves visible trade-off or cost beyond effort. Strong closure linkage when she "touched the cold stone" and feels connection. Deduction: the character observes and labors more than she decides under friction; no moment where being a returnee constrains a choice with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sundial base is signaled early ("trowel struck something solid"), handled across multiple beats (clearing loam, sieving for fragments, fitting stone, hoisting gnomon), and charges the closure when "the beam hit the restored stone, casting a sharp, dark shadow." Its unique property (requires light, now underground) is irreplaceable and shapes the entire reconstruction task. Cost is tied to the element: the week of patient work and the final restoration resolve the interruption motif. Strong setup, development across two beats, and decisive closure participation. Minor deduction: the sundial's symbolic weight is somewhat stated ("ultimate interruption of time itself") rather than purely enacted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is seeded early (travel sack, half-carved inscription, sandals pointing toward blocked exit) and structures the thematic question. The concept shapes Elara's motive (heal dislocation) and reappears in the final image ("what was paused could be restarted"). It does not constrain a tactical choice on the page—no moment where the concept forces a trade-off or alters her method. Strong thematic presence and closure resonance, but it operates as interpretive frame rather than live stake. Present in setup, echoed in closure; middle involvement is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" is mentioned once in paragraph two ("She felt warmly curious about the skeletons") and justified as "necessary" for faith restoration, but it does not constrain or enable a subsequent action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than enacted—no scene where curiosity leads her into risk, delay, or discovery that would otherwise not occur. Appears in setup only; no middle beat or closure linkage. Swappable with "patient" or "reverent" without structural change. Functional label, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Rebuild" (the sundial) is the central action: discovery triggers it, the middle week dramatizes it ("sieving through the dust, hunting for the missing fragments," "fitting jagged stone against stone"), and the final hoisting completes it. The act of reconstruction is irreplaceable—swapping it for "catalog" or "photograph" would collapse the thematic resolution. Strong causal pressure and closure participation. Cost is present (week of work, "slow and deliberate" patience) but felt rather than forfeited on the page. Deduction: the rebuild could have faced a complication (missing piece, structural failure) to raise stakes further; as written, it proceeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is signaled in paragraph two ("unorthodox...defined by purposeful wandering rather than rigid scientific grids") and shown when she "followed the thickest roots as they plunged through stone." The method enables the sundial discovery ("her trowel struck something solid"). Present in setup and linked to the inciting find, but it does not recur or shape tactics during the reconstruction phase—no moment where wandering vs. grid-search creates a trade-off or cost. Functional in one beat; no closure reprise. Swappable with "intuitive exploration" without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is established immediately, vivid and specific throughout: roots weave through bones, the fissure supplies light for reconstruction, and the blocked exit mirrors interrupted journeys. Setting pressures the central task—the sundial requires light, and the "single shaft of sunlight" makes restoration possible. Strong setup, middle constraint (dark space complicates assembly), and closure charge when "the beam hit the restored stone." The environment is irreplaceable; moving the scene above ground would collapse the symbolic and logistical stakes. Minor deduction: the orchard's micro-features (specific roots, ossuaries) could constrain navigation choices more actively during the wandering phase.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" and "the next week" anchor the timeframe. Setup occurs during the descent and initial excavation; the middle reconstruction spans a week of sieving and fitting; closure arrives when the gnomon is hoisted. Time does not tighten decisions—no deadline, no urgency that narrows options. The week is summarized ("She spent the next week") rather than tracked beat by beat, so the clock does not alter tactics. Present across all three gates but operates as backdrop rather than active constraint. Swappable with "over several days" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To restore lost faith" is declared in paragraph two and drives the entire arc: Elara's need to "bridge the aching gap" motivates the descent, the sundial's discovery crystallizes the method, and the final restoration resolves it ("her faith in her own belonging was solidified"). The motive is present in setup, structures the middle (reconstruction as stitching wound), and anchors closure. Weakness: the faith is told more than dramatized—no scene where belief wavers, no friction between wanting faith and doubting the method. Cost is conceptual (effort, solitude) but not tested by a competing desire or fear. Strong thematic coherence; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is signaled early ("moved through the shadows with a cautious enchantment") and maintained throughout: reverence for skeletons, trust in root-guided wandering, patient reconstruction. The tone modulates subtly—wonder during discovery, quiet intensity during assembly, resolution at closure—without jarring shifts. It charges the final image when "the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight seemed to align in anticipation." Coherent across beats and ending. Minor deduction: the tone remains static under pressure; peak assembly beat could tighten into urgency or doubt without losing the enchantment frame, adding dynamic range.</comment>
