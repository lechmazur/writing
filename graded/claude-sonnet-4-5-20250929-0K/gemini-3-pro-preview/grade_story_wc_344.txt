<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her choice to continue past the mirrors is purposeful, but her interior life relies heavily on metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The tactile reality anchor ("floor beneath her boots") and the final tool-packing moment ground embodied action. Her competence is slightly overbalanced—the repair proceeds without genuine struggle or error—and the absence of a visible cost at the peak choice (applying torque) keeps this from the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal chain: prophecy → schematic → mechanism → repair. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. The closure lands as Decisive Change (moon released, world rhythm restored) with a felt cost (solitary triumph, weight of last locksmith). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirrors force a navigational choice. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; it holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library's tactile details (rime, glacial mirrors, stardust-clogged gears) constrain navigation and the final tool use. The "hauntingly bright" moonlight creates a physical obstacle (weight pinning gears) that Elara must dissolve. Spatial choreography is clear across entrance → rotunda → Astrolabe → veranda. Sensory selection reflects urgency appropriately (ozone cuts through stale air at the critical beat). The body and tools function as micro-setting that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlock the stalled moon—is signaled early and tightens once when the mirrors test resolve. The climax turn (applying torque) is driven by protagonist action under the chosen lens. However, the resistance of the heavens dissolves in a single beat without complication, and no visible trade-off or omission alters tactics. The cost (solitary triumph, "last locksmith" weight) is felt but not materially tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: repair as rhythm, the architecture of the mind, decay versus peace. The final veranda image reweights prior material (darkness washing away, world waking) without a stated moral. The mirrors' "false histories" and "potential failures" function thematically, but Elara's passage through them is a single refusal rather than a sustained friction. No diagnostic label-speak or overt thesis mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and stable, with controlled psychic distance and a perceptual signature that favors craft metaphors ("bleached ribcage of a leviathan," "syncopated heartbeat"). Diction remains consistent and elevated without clashing with the locksmith's lexicon. No dialogue appears; interiority is filtered cleanly through Elara's focalization. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains single POV throughout. Slight register elevation at peaks (e.g., "receded cosmic tide") is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting is evident in the opening paragraph: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor ("driftwood nostalgia," "bleached ribcage of a leviathan," "receded cosmic tide") without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.5 in Q7. "Hall of mirrors" and "infinite regression of potential failures" also layer figurative density in adjacent lines. Paraphrase appears in the mirror sequence ("falling… shattering… wept"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully elsewhere, and the final paragraph breathes appropriately. Zero causality breaks or spatial incoherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith and frozen library offer a fresh synthesis, and the gears-as-cosmology conceit is specific. However, the emotional arc (solitary specialist fixes broken sky, world restored) fits a familiar quest-repair template without significant transformation. The mirrors as internal test and the twilight solvent provide inventive detail. Risk-taking in prose texture is evident but does not extend to plot structure or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is named, motivated, and present in all three gates. Her choices drive two key beats: navigating blindly past the mirrors (middle) and applying torque to the wrench (climax). The ending image shows her on the veranda, embodying restored rhythm. Her title frames expectation early and her final solitary stance carries visible cost. The element is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gear assortment is introduced early (setup), handled at two distinct beats (spreading tools, inserting new brass cog), and mentioned at closure ("packed her tools"). The brass cog's mesh with ancient teeth is specific and causal. However, the collection as a whole remains functional rather than indispensable; a generic toolkit could substitute with minor edits. The final "gentle clinking" reprises the object with tonal weight but not new causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors appears in the middle third and forces one on-page choice: Elara closes her eyes and navigates by vibration. This constrains tactics and tests resolve. The element does not appear at closure and its specific properties (soul refraction, potential failures) are not revisited. Setup is delayed past the first third (−0.3). Present in two of three gates; lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "hauntingly bright" moonlight is introduced at setup, functions as a physical constraint in the middle (sterile whiteness pinning gears), and softens at closure when the moon is released. The trait enables the climax action (dissolving calcified time under that light) and its transformation charges the ending. Cost is tied to the attribute: the brightness must be endured and then overcome. Specificity is high; the exact quality matters.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uncapping the vial of twilight solvent is the pivotal action that enables the climax turn. It appears in setup (vial introduced with tools), drives the middle beat (dripping onto the axle), and directly shapes closure (gears turn, moon released). The action is irreplaceable; no near-synonym fits. Visible cost: the solvent's ozone scent and the hissing dissolution are dramatized. Three gates satisfied with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The method is mentioned in the second paragraph ("scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner") and functions as backstory anchor for the schematic. It does not appear in the middle action or closure. The method enables the attempt but is summarized rather than dramatized. Present in setup only; no development or payoff. Swappable with "ancient map" or similar device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen library is named early, pressures navigation (rime, mirrors, rotunda), supplies the Astrolabe and glass dome as key resources, and frames the final veranda moment. The setting constrains multiple choices and charges the ending image (soft hush, world waking below). All three gates satisfied. Spatial specificity (obsidian peaks, jagged summit, crystalline tomb) is high. Irreplaceable; the altitude, cold, and isolation are integral.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "soft hush of a distant morning" appears only in the final paragraph as the eclipse washes away. It does not constrain middle action or signal setup. The element provides tonal closure but does not tighten decisions. One gate (payoff) satisfied. The phrase is lyric and charges the final image with conceptual repricing (decay → peace), lifting it into mid-band despite late arrival.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the rhythm of repair" is stated explicitly in the middle third and drives the tool selection and torque application. It reappears at closure ("rhythm was restored"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction or want-versus-cost tension. Two gates (development, payoff); setup is delayed. The phrasing is specific but not tested by competing desires. Causal work is present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "driftwood nostalgia" is named in the opening line and colors the imagery (bleached ribcage, receded tide, melancholic atmosphere). It modulates appropriately under pressure (sterile brightness at climax, gray and gold at closure). The tone charges the final image and coheres through turns. Present in all three gates. Slightly decorative in early mentions but earns credit through consistency and closure participation.</comment>
