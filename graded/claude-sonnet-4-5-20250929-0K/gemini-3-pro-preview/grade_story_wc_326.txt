<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is embodied through the pulse-counting ritual and his bureaucratic ghost status creates concrete constraints. The motivation to defragment his wife's final thoughts feels authentic and the porcelain shard anchor works well. However, the wife's digital ghost never contradicts or complicates his understanding—she simply confirms what he missed, which softens the internal conflict. The final realization about "silence they had allowed to fester" arrives cleanly but without the contradictory impulses that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors early (observatory, midnight, after static clears). The drive lens reads as Causal: Elias's bureaucratic ghost status enables access, the ink ritual triggers the projection, and the defragmented memory delivers the insight that reframes his grief. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the failure wasn't the fight but the prior silence—with felt cost in the "too late to save her, but just in time to save him" formulation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ink patterns resolve her confession, narrowing his understanding and foreclosing his purgatory of unanswered questions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The opal observatory walls and snow-covered dome anchor setting vividly, and the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that charges the closure. The shortwave receiver and sensor table provide tactile world-building. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain Elias's choices—the observatory is atmospheric but functionally passive. The final image returns to "opal reflections" but the environment itself doesn't shape the outcome, keeping this below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—extracting wisdom from his wife's death to escape unanswered questions—is clear and coherent. The ink ritual creates one meaningful turn when the static resolves and her confession emerges, tightening from confusion to clarity. The cost is legible: he gains understanding but cannot save her, and the "bitter pill" arrives "too late" for resurrection. Agency reads as attention and extraction rather than decision, which is valid for this lens, but the wife's ghost doesn't resist or complicate, which limits pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication failure, the gap between rightness and connection, and grief as navigation rather than resurrection. The porcelain shard and ink patterns avoid overt symbolism while carrying thematic weight. The final insight—"the silence they had allowed to fester"—reweights prior material without moralizing. However, "bitter pill of wisdom" and "purgatory of unanswered questions" drift toward abstraction, and the wife's confession arrives as revelation rather than complication, which softens the thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: the pulse-counting, "bureaucratic anomaly," and the specific tech-mysticism vocabulary. However, "opal reflections," "ephemeral patterns," and "digital afterlife" occasionally elevate diction beyond immediate urgency. The phrase "her lungs still held air" in retrospective context feels forced-literary. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled and the voice remains character-particular, but the register occasionally drifts upward in descriptive beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong concrete imagery: "curved walls...mimicking the interior of a precious stone," "conductive India ink," "figure woven from light and static." Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor issues: "the chaotic hiss of the shortwave receiver" and "the atmospheric interference had finally settled" restate the same condition across adjacent sentences (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "Seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven; he resumed the count" closes with clean specificity. No metaphor tangles or scaffold loops beyond the one slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bureaucratic ghost premise (death certificate error creating digital access) offers a fresh synthesis of mundane bureaucracy and mysticism. The ink-as-algorithm method and porcelain shard coordinate are specific and non-obvious. However, the core emotional arc—widower seeks closure from dead spouse's memory—is familiar, and the wife's confession resolves without complication or moral ambiguity. The tech-mysticism frame transforms the material enough to avoid template plotting, but the emotional resolution trends toward well-trodden ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias (death certificate error survivor) drives the central action: his ghost status enables backdoor access (setup), he initiates the ink ritual (middle), and he absorbs the lesson at closure. His choices create the key turn when he pours the ink and listens to the projection. The attribute matters causally across all three gates and his agency shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears early as "physical key" and "coordinate for grief," is placed on the sensor table to trigger the ritual (middle beat), and is described "drowning in the black pool" as Elias absorbs the lesson (closure presence). It returns with reweighted meaning: initially a fracture token, finally a submerged symbol of released grief. Three-gate presence with causal and lyric work elevates this solidly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The digital ghost shapes stakes (accessing his wife's salvaged consciousness), tactics (the ink ritual to defragment her), and delivers the closure revelation (her confession of fear). It's present in setup (cloud backup premise), drives the middle action (projection appears), and articulates the ending insight. The concept is indispensable—remove it and the entire premise collapses. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias counts heartbeats in the opening (41–43), the count is "momentarily suspended" during the projection, and he "resumed the count" (75–77) at closure. The trait frames the narrative and carries thematic weight (living man among ghosts), but it doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—it's more perceptual signature than tactical lever. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Defragment" is the stated goal ("defragment her final thoughts"), the ink ritual enacts it ("reorder the scattered packets of data"), the system processes it ("locking the disparate pieces of memory into a seamless loop"), and the result delivers closure ("her confession she had never been able to voice"). The action is causally central and irreplaceable—without it, the retrieval and insight don't occur. Strong three-gate involvement with clear cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (ephemeral patterns in spilled ink) is signaled early ("letting the chaotic fluid dictate the recovery algorithm"), executed in the middle ("ink continued to spread, finding the path of least resistance"), and completes at closure ("as the ink began to dry, the connection severing"). The ink's randomness bypasses "rigid logic" and the drying marks permanence. Specific mechanics shape the attempt and the ending, earning solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The opal observatory is vividly rendered (curved walls, glass dome, snow, high altitude) and anchors the scene early. The "sterile cold" contrasts with the ink's "pungent" smell, and the final image returns to "opal reflections." However, the setting doesn't constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome—it's atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint. Lyric reprise and strong sensory work, but no causal pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the radio static clears") is announced early and gates the action: Elias waits for the hiss to die, and "only after the radio static clears does the gateway...truly open." The static's clearing enables the ritual, satisfying setup and middle involvement. However, time isn't tracked as a live pressure during the projection sequence, and the ending simply notes "checked the time" without urgency. Two-gate presence with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to fetch wisdom from failure") is stated explicitly and dramatized through action: Elias performs the ink ritual, listens to the confession, and "absorbed the lesson." It's conflicted—"not about resurrection" but extraction—and the cost is clear: wisdom arrives "too late to save her, but just in time to save him." The desire drives all three beats and shapes the closure realization. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is coherent through the piece: the "high-altitude sanctum," "quiet chill," and the widow's ritual all carry solemn, contemplative tone. The tone modulates slightly when the projection resolves ("achingly familiar" voice, "sorrow he had missed") but remains within the solace register. The final return to pulse-counting and "quiet chill" charges the ending with measured calm. Coherent and purposeful, though static rather than dynamic.</comment>
