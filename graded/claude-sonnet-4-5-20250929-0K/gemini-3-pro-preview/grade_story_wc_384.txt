<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's internal contradictions are well-drawn—cowardice versus calibrated treason—and his peak choice (altering the writ) follows from prior motivation. The backstory occupies roughly 20% and directly primes the forgery decision. Interiority is concrete ("the phantom scent of roses," "wisely enduring the freeze") and the embodied ritual of slowing his heartbeat anchors physical pressure. However, the ten-year guilt is told more than dramatized in micro-choices during the alteration itself, and the final shift reads as relief rather than a renunciation with visible ongoing cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors within 120 words (Elian, roofless atrium, clepsydra, aurora). The closure is a Decisive Change—condemned→commended—with on-page cost (lifting the "n," grafting the stroke, risking magister detection). The thorn-and-key sequence creates a because/therefore chain that narrows options and makes the alteration legible. The final image ("phantom scent of roses") charges prior material but lacks a second visible price that would elevate cost beyond the forgery's completion; the stakes resolve cleanly without an additional forfeiture that shapes the departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary's cold, the clepsydra's drip, and the aurora's flare all pressure Elian's hand control. Spatial choreography is coherent (altar, basin, scroll, seal) and the pearl twilight filters perception throughout. The iron cylinder and rose thorn function as micro-setting—tools whose properties constrain technique. The marble hall and stalactites recur at closure to charge the final image, but the setting does not impose a second spatial constraint during the peak alteration beyond cold, leaving the 8.8+ gate unmet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the prince by altering the writ without triggering wards. The thorn-lift of the "n" and the iron key's magnetic suspension create a meaningful tightening that narrows options under Causal pressure. The cost is visible on the page (precision required, magister scrutiny threatened) and Elian's agency drives the turn. However, the resolution grants success without an additional on-page trade-off or visible loss during departure; the oppressive weight is "lifted" rather than replaced by a new constraint, capping the band below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—redemption through micro-intervention—emerges from the thorn's "sharp pain of the past" repurposed to "carve a future." The final image (phantom scent, no trace) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The "unfinished verse" motif recurs at closure with reweighted meaning. Yet the thematic reconfiguration hinges on the single-letter change; no persistent ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the victory, and the ending's lightness ("oppressive weight lifted") resolves neatly rather than charging a lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices micro-loops, solvent sheen, and aurora shadows in craft-specific detail. Diction is purposeful ("calibrated treason," "linguistic bond," "phantom scent") and rhythm modulates from slow ritual to the peak alteration beat. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "watching") are voice-motivated and sparse. The prose remains character-particular under pressure, though a few elevated constructions ("borders on the grave," "mineral tears") drift slightly above a scribe's internal lexicon during crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the forgery's mechanics. Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates during the thorn-lift. However, three loops appear: "silent" recurs (rivers of light, silent work), "the rose thorn" is named identically across four beats without pronominal compression, and "the heavy iron cylinder/rod" toggles weight descriptors. Register drift is minimal but present: "linguistic bond," "magnetic counter-resonance," and "fibrous heart" elevate diction beyond Elian's crisis state in adjacent lines, applying −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb/artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The calligraphy-forger premise is well-executed but recognizable (craftsman redeems past cowardice via micro-alteration under high stakes). The thorn-as-tool and iron-key mechanics add specificity, and the condemned→commended hinge is elegant. The aurora setting and pearl twilight are vivid but not structurally novel. No bold perspectival or moral risk complicates the victory; Elian's success is unambiguous and the ending grants closure without a persistent dilemma, placing the work in strong-familiar rather than high-risk originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's choice to alter the writ creates the key turn; his ritual of slowing heartbeat, dipping thorn, lifting "n," and grafting the stroke spans four distinct beats and drives the closure. Removing him breaks the story. Setup early (paragraph 1), middle development (paragraphs 9–16), and payoff (final paragraph). Causal pressure and cost are legible. Caps do not apply; positive signals (early +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.2) elevate from 3.0 baseline to ~7.3; no major frictions beyond typical protagonist integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn appears in paragraphs 8–9 (introduction), 10 (dipped), 15 (lifts "n"), and 16 (absorbs excess ink)—four beats. It enables the micro-surgery and returns at closure ("sharp pain… carve a future"). Setup, development, payoff present. Positives: early +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost +0.4 = ~4.8 from baseline 3.0; no major frictions. Indispensable to the forgery method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named in paragraph 7 and echoed at closure ("measured in microns"). It shapes the dominant stake (precise alteration without triggering wards) and constrains tactics throughout. Setup, development (paragraphs 11–17), and payoff present. Positives: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure +0.8, specificity +0.5 = ~3.7 from baseline 3.0; mild swappability friction (could substitute "surgical rebellion") −0.3. Drives the story's method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears in paragraph 13 ("wisely enduring the freeze") and anchors the heartbeat-slowing ritual, enabling precision under cold. It does not recur at closure. Setup (paragraph 13, late), development (one beat), no closure reprise. Positives: one beat +0.4, causal +0.6, cost +0.3 = ~1.3 from baseline 3.0; late-arrival friction −0.4. Contributes to one key beat but replaceable with "patient" or "disciplined."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unlink" is the central action: paragraph 7 frames it ("unlink the linguistic bond"), paragraphs 14–15 execute it (lifting the "n," grafting the stroke), and the closure hinges on it (new truth locked). Setup, development, payoff present. Positives: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7 = ~5.6 from baseline 3.0. Swapping "unlink" for "sever" or "break" would require only minor phrasing edits, applying mild swappability −0.3. Essential to plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The iron key/"cylinder" is introduced in paragraph 10, explained in paragraph 11 ("magnetic counter-resonance"), used in paragraph 12 (pressed to seal), held through paragraph 17, and removed in paragraph 18. Four beats. Setup, development, payoff present. Positives: early +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +0.8, specificity +0.6 = ~4.5 from baseline 3.0; descriptor toggle ("cylinder"/"key"/"rod") and slight ornamental phrasing −0.3. Indispensable to bypass the ward.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary anchors orientation (paragraph 1), supplies cold that pressures hand control (paragraph 13), and the aurora's flare threatens distraction (paragraph 14). Clepsydra and stalactites mark time. The final image returns to the hall. Setup, development, payoff present. Positives: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure +0.9 = ~3.2 from baseline 3.0; mild postcard friction (aurora described more than used) −0.2. Setting constrains but could be replaced with another cold, isolated locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" appears in paragraph 4 (clepsydra intro) and paragraph 19 ("continued their slow countdown"). Time is measured but does not tighten decisions after paragraph 4; the urgency is declared lifted in paragraph 18. Setup and payoff present; no middle development that narrows window. Positives: early +0.4, closure +0.6 = ~1.0 from baseline 3.0; passivity friction (clock observed, not pressing) −0.5. Time does not escalate choices during the peak alteration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is stated in paragraph 5 and dramatized in paragraph 11 (queen's eyes remembered), driving the alteration. The closure image ("forgive the unfinished cowardice") reprises it. Setup, development, payoff present. Positives: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +1.1, closure +1.2, cost +0.4 = ~4.2 from baseline 3.0; told-more-than-shown friction (guilt summarized in paragraph 11 rather than tested by a mid-scene choice) −0.4. Motivation is coherent but leans declarative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" opens the story (paragraph 1), recurs in paragraph 18 ("pearl twilight"), and colors the aurora descriptions throughout. Tone is elegiac, deliberate, and coherent. Setup and payoff present; middle development is atmospheric rather than modulating with pressure. Positives: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8 = ~2.3 from baseline 3.0; static mood (no tonal shift during peak beats) −0.3. Tone charges the final image but does not deepen during escalation.</comment>
