<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is strongly motivated by professional integrity and exhibits embodied tension ("tremor in his hands") and contradictory impulses (fortified vulnerability as lived stance). His final choice to defy Halloway feels earned through the progression from watchful compliance to active rebellion, foreclosing his career path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the maintenance worker's death functions more as plot mechanism than fully dramatized human cost, slightly abstracting the emotional weight Elias should carry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly on the page: Elias's upload is a Decisive Change that forecloses his advancement and reconfigures his relationship to institutional power, with the cost made explicit ("ending his advancement within the Agency"). The causal lens holds—his empirical findings drive the defiant choice. Orientation is swift (tunnel, investigator role, Halloway's demand by ~150 words). One meaningful tightening: the infrasound discovery narrows his options from rubber-stamp to genuine hazard declaration. Minor slip: the psycho-acoustic mechanism arrives somewhat late and resolves the investigative problem it introduces, reducing prior escalation slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly rendered ("weeping wound," oppressive humidity, dripping water) and the lantern serves as a concrete focal point. The environment constrains choice: the damp air conducts the psychic overlay, the subsidence reveals the artifact, and the site's properties force Elias's classification decision. Spatial choreography (kneeling, scanner, boots in ripples) is coherent. Small cap: while the setting pressures the closure, some descriptive phrases ("loudly, uncomfortably alive") lean slightly abstract without altering the strong overall integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (professional integrity versus career survival) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the data contradicts Halloway's narrative. The protagonist's agency drives the turn: Elias uploads the evidence before override, foreclosing his institutional path with on-page cost ("first time in years, it was his own silence"). The infrasound discovery raises stakes by making inaction dangerous to future crews. Minor friction: the maintenance worker's death functions as inciting mechanism rather than sustained pressure; Elias's internal conflict could have been tested more concretely before the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth versus institutional erasure; memory versus expedience) emerges organically through the lantern, the fleeing woman's trauma, and Elias's final choice to preserve both. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "leaving the lantern where it lay, a sentinel in the dark" and "stories he had finally refused to let drown" reweight the premise without moralizing. The psycho-acoustic hazard literalizes the cost of ignoring the past. No thematic echo in final paragraph; subtext operates cleanly in the "heavy silence" Halloway leaves. Enters high band through cumulative image work and thematic integrity at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elias's perceptual filter (investigator's empirical lens, sensitivity to "entangled memories") is consistent and character-specific. Distance control is clean, and the prose modulates effectively under pressure (steady voice reporting to Halloway, then the tremor confined to hands). Dialogue is sparse but functional, pursuing goals ("Negative, Director..."). Minor deductions: some elevated diction ("fortified vulnerability," "cognitive residue") borders on essayistic and slightly exceeds what the scene's urgency would allow; one or two filter phrases ("he felt her terror") could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is vivid ("weeping wound," "lightning rod for trauma") but becomes slightly dense in the vision sequence without clear pattern payoff. Minor deductions: "watchfully calm" and "fortified vulnerability" read as constructed rather than immediate embodied states; "hooked into the living" and "dual-layer existence" edge toward conceptual summary. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Overall strong craft with a few abstract phrases that reduce immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes investigator procedural, historical horror, and psycho-acoustic science in a non-obvious way; the lantern as conductor for trauma is a fresh inflection. Elias's professional stance (empirical observation versus psychic overlay) creates genuine tension. The piece commits fully to its hybrid-genre logic. Deductions: the "entangled memories" mechanism and infrasound-psychic interface feel slightly under-grounded, relying on assertion more than demonstration; the investigator-versus-corporation frame is familiar and not deeply transformed. Still, the ending's choice and image feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's investigator role drives every major beat: he conducts the scan, interprets the infrasound data, experiences the vision, and makes the defiant upload. His observational method enables the choice and his professional identity creates the stakes. Present early, active in middle data-gathering, and decisive at closure. The "preventable death" frame shapes his moral calculus throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lantern appears in the subsidence, Elias touches it to trigger the vision, and it remains as "sentinel" in the final image, reweighted as symbol of refusal to erase. Three distinct beats (discovery, contact/vision, closure reprise) with evolving function: artifact → catalyst → charged monument. Its unique historical properties (Underground Railroad, iron, trauma conductor) are irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is introduced mid-story, shapes the vision beat (woman's terror superimposed on present), and informs the psycho-acoustic ruling. It constrains Elias's choice by proving historical trauma is causally active. However, the concept arrives somewhat late (~40% mark) and its mechanics are asserted more than dramatized. It participates in closure (logging the site as heritage zone) but does not drive earlier tactics. Functional across two beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is established in the opening and tested when the vision threatens to "crack his professional armor." Elias's steadiness enables him to report findings without vocal tremor despite hand shaking—an embodied cost. The trait constrains how he processes horror and signals the fortified-vulnerability tension. Present early, active under pressure, and implicitly carried to closure. However, it functions more as tonal anchor than direct driver of tactics; swappable with "controlled" or "disciplined" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reverberate" is the story's hinge: the low hum in the tunnel walls is the infrasound that Elias isolates as the fatal frequency. It appears physically (ripples, shaking water), causally (bio-signature alignment), and thematically (past echoing in present). The action enables the ruling and cannot be removed without collapsing the investigative logic. Present in setup (oppressive atmosphere), development (waveform isolation), and payoff (site flagged for resonance hazard). Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Empirical observation is signaled early ("proceed through empirical observation rather than intuition"), executed on-page (multi-spectral scanner, waveform analysis, bio-signature isolation), and directly enables the ruling: hard data combats corporate fiction. The method contrasts with the psychic vision, creating productive tension. It shapes his attempts throughout and is indispensable to the closure choice—without the datapad proof, defiance would lack grounding. Three-gate integration with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is present early, exerts continuous pressure (humidity, dripping, subsidence reveals lantern, water conducts psychic energy), and directly enables the ruling (site flagged for closure). The setting's properties are irreplaceable: natural cavern history, modern infrastructure overlay, rising water table post-drought. It constrains Elias's investigation (oppressive conditions) and supplies the resonance mechanism. Micro-setting (mud, scanner, boots in ripples) alters tactics. Strong three-gate integration with causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-drought timeframe is established early and motivates the inciting condition: rising water tables unearth the lantern and activate the psycho-acoustic hazard. It shapes the investigative context but does not create ongoing time pressure or alter Elias's tactics mid-scene. The element participates in setup and thematic framing (celebration above, danger below) but does not tighten decisions at closure. Functional causal role in one major beat; not indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Breaking free from Halloway's control is the story's engine: established early (Director dictates narrative, "leash"), tested in the middle (pressure to comply, "no room for debate"), and resolved at closure (upload before override, "his own silence"). The desire is dramatized through contradictory impulses (career survival versus integrity) and the final choice forecloses advancement with explicit cost. Three-gate integration, causal pressure across beats, and indispensable to closure. The motivation drives every major turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is coherent and modulates with pressure: Elias remains outwardly steady ("voice steady") while internally affected (tremor, armor threatened). The tone charges key moments (vision sequence, defiant choice) and persists to the final image (his own silence, stories refused to drown). It reflects the investigator's necessary stance and supports thematic resonance. Minor deduction: the phrase itself reads slightly constructed, and tonal texture could be more varied across beats. Strong integration without full irreplaceability.</comment>
