<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobic origins drive her skyward refuge in a credible contradiction, and the interiority is concrete ("ghost physically holding her hand," "stretching contracted muscle"). The bunker-to-stratosphere arc structures her journey, though the final choice—capping the doll to "let the silence sprout again"—arrives with described intent rather than felt ambivalence. Backstory is purposefully anchored and tilts present stance. The micro-choice of sealing the doll forecloses risk, but the stakes of that cost remain more told than dramatized in peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors by ~30 words; the gravitational inversion provides the tightening window and the capping beat reconfigures prior material. Cost is legible—she traps radiance that once freed her—but the final image ("turning her small, cramped room into a palace") asserts transformation rather than showing the moment of release or its price on the page. One meaningful deepening lands; the RR form is valid but the closure sentence drifts toward summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Xenial Trellis functions as hospitable constraint ("metal vines shifting gently to cradle"), and the body (stomach rising, marrow shift, palms over ears) shapes the ritual. The stratospheric setting pressures every sensory choice and charges the final image of descent. Micro-setting elevation: the doll's hollow eyes and the inversion's "buoyant, upward-falling ocean" anchor world rules and tactic. One small slip: "weeping cloud layer" and "ravaged earth" are vivid but not leveraged in the present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest the Gilded Hush as antidote—signals early. The inversion provides the meaningful tightening; Elara's sensory-deprivation technique narrows her window and forces the cap before gravity snaps back. Agency is decision (sealing the doll), and the cost is legible: she imprisons the light to carry it home. The escalation is cleanly driven by the time constraint, though the final beat ("let the silence sprout again") shifts to assertion of future use rather than present friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—escape from claustrophobic past via collected silence—emerges from the bunker/stratosphere contrast and the concrete doll ritual. The Gilded Hush is embodied ("molten gold," "phantom roots") rather than abstracted. The ending offers a non-literal answer (trapped radiance becomes portable palace) without moralizing, and the final image reweights the opening's "suffocating fear." Minor: the last line tells the transformation ("turning her small, cramped room into a palace") instead of letting us witness the sprout's release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: "tangible presence of peace," "baptism," "cruel, crushing norm" all carry her fraught relationship with weight and space. Distance is stable, no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure ("visual whip-crack that made absolutely no sound"). One repeated syntactic stem slightly dulls momentum: "It was [noun]" used four times across key beats ("not a toy for play," "the hour when," "the Gilded Hush," "a baptism"). Otherwise, voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies and density is high; many lines serve double duty (the doll both trap and vessel, the trellis both welcome and constraint). Minor scaffold: "disturbingly intangibly tangible" muddles with contradictory modifiers; "the cramped dark" loops "cramped" within one beat; "presence bloomed" and "presence of peace" recycle the noun. Template-cadence runs ("It was…") across four sentences slightly flatten propulsion. No loops touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits total deduction to −0.8; base ~8.0 adjusted to 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—collecting silence flavors via gravitational inversion—synthesizes speculative physics, synaesthesia, and trauma processing into a non-obvious whole. The doll as trap, the sensory-deprivation technique, and the trellis's hospitality all feel specific to Elara's history. Risk: the porcelain-sprouting-light image is bold and earned. Minor: "flavors of different silences" as occupation reads slightly prompt-like but is transformed through bunker/Hush contrast. The ending's "palace of infinite, stretching sky" slightly retreats into metaphor summary rather than showing the uncorked moment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobic origin frames the opening and the ending's "cramped room" callback. Her sensory-deprivation choice (palms over ears, eyes shut) drives the mid-ritual turn. Appears in setup, middle technique, and closure payoff, with visible cost: she returns to earth to release what she trapped. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the final transformation is more stated than shown.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The porcelain doll appears in setup (checked in breast pocket), middle (mouth gaping to drink), cap beat (wax-sealed), and ending (to uncork). Its hollow structure enables the trap; its capping enacts the cost. Three distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage. High integration, though the "uncork" future action in the last line is promised rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Gilded Hush is the named object of the Harvest, shapes the sensory-deprivation tactic, and provides the light-sprouting payoff. It contrasts with the bunker's "stale and dusty" silence in setup, blooms mid-scene with embodied weight ("molten gold poured into the empty spaces"), and is sealed at closure with visible cost. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced at the gravitational shift ("disturbingly intangibly tangible, like a ghost physically holding her hand") and enables the paradox of physical silence. The trait constrains perception during the ritual. Appears in one key beat with clear causal function, but is not reprised at closure; middle-band for single-beat involvement with causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Sprout" is the verb for the doll's light-tendrils emerging ("translucent tendrils of white light grew from the porcelain, winding around Elara's floating fingers"), the climactic visual turn, and the promised future action ("let the silence sprout again"). It defines the impossible miracle, drives the capping choice, and charges the ending image. Three beats, high causal pressure, indispensable closure linkage, and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—limiting sensory exposure—is taught in setup ("precise, disciplined technique"), executed mid-scene (eyes shut, palms over ears, "sensory vacuum"), and causally enables the Hush's bloom. Two distinct beats with clear causal pressure. Not present in the final image but directly shapes the Harvest success; solid integration across setup and middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Xenial Trellis is named in the opening, physically cradles Elara during inversion ("metal vines shifting gently"), hums in sympathy mid-ritual, and holds her during the snap-back. It provides hospitality under pressure and safety constraint. Three beats, causal involvement (enables floating ritual), and contributes to closure stability. Strong integration, though the final paragraph shifts focus to ground-level intent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gravitational inversion is the event window, signals early ("the hour when gravity inverts"), pressures the middle (her weight returns "with a vengeance"), and creates the urgency to cap the doll. Time tracks clearly and tightens the ritual. Two beats with clear causal pressure, though the exact countdown is not foregrounded and the ending relaxes temporal urgency by shifting to future intent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Collecting silence flavors is established in setup, contrasts bunker silence with stratospheric Hush, drives the ritual technique, and motivates the capping choice with visible cost (she traps the light she longed for to carry it home). Appears across three beats with friction: the childhood terror versus the need to harvest. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the final line's promise slightly softens immediate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Stretching contracted" is embodied in the opening ("claustrophobic child"), mid-ritual release ("stretching contracted muscle finally allowed to lengthen"), light-expansion visual ("Every inch of the light that emerged pushed back the phantom walls"), and the ending's "infinite, stretching sky." Tone modulates from compression to expansion and charges the final image. Strong coherence and closure linkage, though the final line tells rather than enacts the stretch.</comment>
