<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is specific and embodied: the lens "hummed in his hands" and spirits are "merely loud in their terror," driving his selfish desire for silence. His inadvertent stubbornness—"once he started a burial, he simply could not stop"—constrains choices and aligns with his three-day descent. Internal contradiction is present (selfish rest-seeking versus dutiful undertaker service), though emotional progression remains somewhat linear. The final choice to restore the beacon is earned by prior setup, but the moment lacks a visible cost that complicates the satisfaction of achieved quiet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph (Silas, underwater library, post-package arrival). The drive lens reads Causal: package arrives → journey → beacon repair → silence achieved. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas slots the lens and the machine groans to life, ceasing the distress signals. Closure is a Decisive Change—the screaming stops, ghosts dissolve—with a felt cost (three days walking the ocean floor, "forcing his body through fissures"). The final image of "crushing quiet" reweights the opening pressure. Minor slip: the ease of the mechanical fix deflates some earned struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly particular: "rotting shelves," "dissolved ink," "salt-crusted gears," and bioluminescent glow create sensory specificity. The broken lens as a recurring object—hummed at arrival, heavy in transit, slotted at climax—constrains the final choice and charges the closure image when its "prismatic edges" catch light. Spatial choreography is clear (atrium → central dais). The impossible physics are flagged early ("occupying impossible spaces"), establishing world rules. Minor deduction: the setting pressures atmosphere more than choice; Silas could plausibly have performed this act in any submerged ruin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving silence to end psychic interference—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas slots the lens, forcing alignment with "impossible geometry," and the beam erupts to acknowledge the signal. Agency is present: his decision to repair the beacon, not merely witness it, ends the loop. Visible cost is the three-day journey and physical forcing of the mechanism. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than decision-driven; no live alternative or competing pressure complicates the climax, and the resolution feels mechanically smooth rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: distress signals persist until acknowledged, and rest requires an "address." The lighthouse lens as a motif shifts from parcel-burden to tool to beacon, reweighting from interference to release. Subtext operates in "the address was filed, the message received, and the occupants interred in the dark," which layers bureaucratic undertaker idiom with cosmic acknowledgment. The final image—Silas slumped in "crushing quiet"—offers a resonant answer to the opening's "crushing impossibility" without stating a moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing. The piece resists simplistic closure by leaving Silas's eventual return unresolved, honoring complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "psychic clamor," "fissures in the water," and undertaker-specific metaphors ("heavier than a granite tombstone," "closing a casket"). Diction remains consistent under pressure—"a whale dying in a cathedral" fits his weary, precise idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately: compressed syntax at the climax ("groaned," "shot upward," "cut by a sharp blade") accelerates without losing clarity. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "inadvertently stubborn" in exposition feels slightly intrusive, though the trait is later dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: "He was a weary undertaker, and he had traveled this far down into the dark not to seek treasure, but to bury a noise that refused to die" does multiple jobs. Figurative language is vivid and controlled—"like a whale dying in a cathedral," "velvet shroud"—without muddle. Minor loop: "The distress signals evaporated, the panic dissolving" paraphrases the prior "screaming...ceased." Template cadence in exposition ("He was...," "He approached...," "He pulled...") across consecutive paragraphs slightly dulls propulsion. No pronoun confusion or tense drift. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—underwater undertaker silencing ghosts by repairing a beacon—is specific and non-obvious. The occupying-impossible-spaces conceit and distress-signal logic avoid stock metaphysics. The undertaker's selfish motivation (personal quiet, not heroism) freshens the helper archetype. Emotional truth anchors the fantastical premise. Minor deduction: the core ghost-signal problem and beacon-repair solution echo familiar "unfinished business" templates; transformation arises more from specificity (lens geometry, fissures in water, bureaucratic idiom) than from moral or structural surprise. The risk of lyric compression pays off in coherence, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout, makes the key decision to slot the lens and twist the housing, and his inadvertent stubbornness drives the three-day journey. His choices create the climax and resolution. Cost is visible: physical effort, time, and isolation. Setup early, developed in transit reflection, and payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens is handled in three distinct beats: arrival (hummed, shivered), transit (heavy in satchel, "heavier than a granite tombstone"), and climax (slotted, prismatic edges catch light, beam erupts). Its "impossible geometry" and "fractured" state are irreplaceable properties that enable the closure. Visible cost: Silas must force alignment. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distress signals shape the stake from the start: the lens vibrates with "desperate frequency of distress signals," and the library is thick with "psychic clamor" from souls "broadcasting their panic in a relentless loop." The concept narrows options—Silas must acknowledge the signal to end it. At closure, the axiom "A distress signal only persists until it is received" directly drives the resolution. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure participation are evident.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inadvertent stubbornness is stated mid-text: "once he started a burial, he simply could not stop until the earth—or the sea—was flat again." It constrains his descent (three days) and his commitment to complete the repair. The trait is label-heavy in exposition but dramatized through the persistence of the journey and the final act of forcing the mechanism. Setup delayed to second third, developed in reflection, payoff implicit in closure action. Cost is time and effort.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Revitalization is the climactic action: Silas twists the housing, forces alignment, and the machine groans to life, erupting in light that acknowledges the signal and ends the haunting. The action is irreplaceable; removing it collapses the resolution. Setup (beacon is rusted, dormant), development (Silas approaches and prepares), and payoff (beam erupts, screaming ceases) are all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Occupying impossible spaces is signaled early: "Silas had long ago mastered the method of occupying impossible spaces...a subtle metaphysical trick of the trade." It enables the journey (walking ocean floor, forcing body through fissures) and explains survival under crushing pressure. The method is present in setup and development but does not constrain a choice at closure—it permits access rather than shaping the climax. Functional but somewhat passive; tactics are more about persistence than navigating the method's limits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater library supplies the beacon mechanism that Silas repairs and serves as the ghosts' anchored location. Its rusted, dormant state creates the problem (no acknowledgment signal) and its "ancient light mechanism" provides the tool for resolution. The library is present in setup, frames the journey, and houses the climax. However, the specific library features (rotting shelves, dissolved ink) are atmospheric rather than tactically constraining; the story could occur in any submerged structure with a beacon.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" is signaled and structures the sequence: arrival → journey (three days) → repair. The package incites the quest and the three-day duration adds weight to Silas's cost. However, time does not tighten decisions during the climax—no countdown or urgency reshapes tactics. The frame is present in setup and development but does not pressure the closure moment. Functional causal role, limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silas's motivation—"to give rest a permanent address so that he might finally enjoy the quiet of his own home"—is stated explicitly and drives every choice: the journey, the persistence, the repair. The selfish angle (his own sleep, not altruism) adds friction and specificity. The motivation is present in setup, frames the journey in development, and is satisfied at closure ("the silence finally returning"). Cost is the three-day ordeal. Slight deduction: the desire is stated more than dramatized through competing wants or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone of "chased stillness" is coherent throughout: the opening's "crushing impossibility," the journey's "immense, crushing quiet," and the closure's "peace he had manufactured" all modulate around the pursuit and achievement of silence. The tone tightens from oppressive noise to earned quiet, charging the final image. Diction (weary, heavy, velvet shroud) supports the tonal arc. The tone is present in setup, pressures the development, and crystallizes at closure with visible cost.</comment>
