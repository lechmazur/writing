<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is vivid and embodied through physical action—polishing with denial, breaking skin to bind the dream. Internal contradiction appears in the grinding effort against metaphysical inevitability, and the final release ("Fly") represents a credible choice with visible cost: he sends his grief away rather than hoarding it. Minor weakness: Elara remains a cipher, existing only as object of grief rather than as a person whose traits shape his choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: shadow detaches → memories leak → Elias polishes prism to trap dream → transforms it to crane → releases it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crane's launch crystallizes the paradox and his grief becomes a permanent orbit around the Basilica, foreclosing reunion but preserving her dream. Cost is legible in "luminous torment that would circle the glass spires forever."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden, gravity-glass chains, and Glass Basilica create a coherent fantastical geography. The prism "vanishing from sight" when perfectly polished is a striking micro-setting detail that constrains his method. The paradox of descending-while-ascending pressures the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across cottage, garden edge, and upward trajectory. Does not reach 9+ because the garden itself (tea table, jasmine steam) remains largely ornamental backdrop rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving Elara's dream before it dissipates—is clear from paragraph two and tightens through the ticking metaphysical clock. Agency is active: he chooses to bleed onto the gem, fold each crease with precision, and release the crane rather than keep it. The act of letting it go forecloses possession, a visible trade-off. One meaningful tightening (dream escapes, he catches it, transforms it, releases it) is sufficient for this length. Does not reach higher bands because the escalation is linear without a reversal or complication that tests his commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as craft and transformation emerges through concrete action—folding sorrow into aerodynamics, giving grief wings. The final image offers a non-literal answer: preservation requires release, and love becomes an eternal orbit rather than possession. The violet dream-paper and crane accumulate meaning from iridescent mist to "luminous torment." Avoids moralizing. Minor slip: "to fold grief into origami cranes" as stated motivation risks thematic echo, though the on-page folding dramatizes it with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization through Elias; perceptual signature (lantern-maker's craft vocabulary, "rhythmic, repetitive friction," "geometric constraints") remains consistent. Diction elevates under pressure ("scraping his throat," "paradoxical wind") in ways that feel voice-motivated rather than imposed. The single line of dialogue ("Fly") is purposeful and goal-driven. Minor density issue: "wisp-lights of the lower marshlands" and "gravity-glass" feel like worldbuilding tokens rather than Elias's natural idiom, creating brief register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative language: "light…scoured the eyes," "memories leaking…like iridescent mist," "sound like a breaking icicle." Rhythm varies and information density is high. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats: "terrifying precision," "luminous torment," and stacked metaphors ("diving downward to fall upward, a bright spark sinking into the blue sky") risk slight muddle. No loops or scaffold detected. Figurative density in most sentences of the transformation sequence triggers −0.4 deduction within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lantern-making craft applied to dream-catching and grief origami is fresh and specific; the paradox of spiritual weight increasing with physical ascent inverts expectation. The violet paper transformation from trapped dream to folded crane is a vivid, non-obvious vehicle for the theme. The piece commits fully to its fantastical premise without hedging. Risk-taking in metaphysics and the quiet, image-driven closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, and his craft (polishing, bleeding, folding, releasing) drives all major turns. Setup: introduced as "crafty lantern maker" in paragraph two. Development: his polishing traps the dream, his blood binds it, his folding gives it form. Payoff: his whispered command launches the crane. His choices narrow options (he cannot keep her, but can send part of himself) and the final release forecloses possession with visible cost. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high (only a craftsman could execute this plan).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Glass Basilica appears in setup (paragraph nine) as the "cold, mirrored prison" destination for the unshadowed dead, establishing the stakes. It returns in the payoff when Elias releases the crane toward it and watches "the light of the Basilica reflecting in his wet eyes." The reprise reweights the opening dread into a paradoxical goal: his grief will orbit the spires forever. However, the Basilica does not constrain middle choices or alter tactics; it functions as thematic anchor and visual target rather than active pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with charged reprise caps upper range near 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dream recording is introduced in paragraph seven ("a forbidden art") and shapes the entire causal chain: it requires a flawless surface, which drives the polishing; it explains why he traps the violet dream-wisp and transforms it. The concept constrains his method (must catch ephemeral visions before dissipation) and enables the resolution (the crane preserves her dream). Setup, development (catching and transforming the dream), and payoff (the crane as recorded dream) are all present. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (remove this concept and the story collapses).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The paradox "to reach that holy height, one's spirit descends while ascending" is explained in paragraph nine and charges the final image: the crane must "dive downward to fall upward." This attribute constrains the crane's flight path and intensifies the paradox theme. However, it does not constrain Elias's earlier choices or tactics; it functions as world-rule context and thematic resonance rather than active pressure in middle beats. Setup and payoff present; development participation weak. Two-gate presence with thematic charge places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Transform" (converting trapped dream-light into paper, then crane) is the story's hinge action. Setup: the goal to trap ephemeral visions. Development: the transformation sequence occupies paragraphs 13–17, where bleeding binds the dream and folding gives it aerodynamic form. Payoff: the crane launches, carrying his grief. Each step narrows options (can't undo the flattening, can't unfold once creased) and the final form enables the release. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection (blood, precision, renunciation). Remove transformation and closure fails.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced early (paragraph six) as Elias's method: "rhythmic, repetitive friction…velvet hem…sheer force of his denial." It shapes his attempt to create the flawless surface needed for dream recording. Development: the prism grows hot and vanishes, enabling the dream-catch. The method's mechanics (friction, blood as binding agent, geometric constraints) matter and are shown on the page. Payoff: the polished void catches the dream. Three gates present; strong causal pressure and specificity. Minor cap: once the prism is polished, the method gives way to folding, so its closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is named in the title and opening line, anchoring setting early. The wrought-iron table, jasmine steam, and cottage provide spatial clarity. The garden edge serves as launch point in the payoff. However, the setting does not constrain middle choices or supply resources that alter tactics; the polishing and folding could occur anywhere. Spatial choreography is clear, but the garden functions as stage rather than active pressure. Setup and payoff present; development weak. Two-gate presence with minimal causal pressure places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"The hour after the shadow detaches" is introduced in paragraph three and frames the entire urgency: Elara is "currently dissolving," her memories "leaking out…rapidly evaporating." The timeframe tightens all decisions—he must work fast. Development: the ticking clock pressures the polishing and folding. Payoff: the crane launches before complete dissipation. The clock is legible and shapes tactics (desperate speed, breaking skin rather than waiting). Three gates present; strong causal pressure. Does not reach 8.5+ because exact elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat, leaving urgency somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to fold grief into origami cranes" is stated in paragraph 15 but fully dramatized through embodied action: "Every fold was a sharp intake of breath, a physical compression of the agony that threatened to tear his chest apart." Setup: the goal to preserve her dream and send part of himself. Development: the folding sequence enacts the motivation with visible friction (trapping laugh, sealing scent, shaping beak). Payoff: the crane as grief given wings. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection (physical and emotional pain). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" appears in the opening line and closing sentence, framing the entire piece. The tone is consistently elegiac and fantastical, mixing beauty (violet light, jasmine, iridescent mist) with anguish (scoured eyes, breaking skin, scraping throat). Tone modulates with pressure: clinical craft focus during polishing, embodied pain during folding, quiet release at the end. The final image charges the tone by making torment eternal yet beautiful. Setup and payoff strong; coherent modulation through turns. Does not reach 8.5+ because the density of figurative language occasionally risks purple prose, slightly muddling clarity in peak beats.</comment>
