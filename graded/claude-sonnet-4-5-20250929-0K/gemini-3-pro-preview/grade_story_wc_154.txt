<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is embodied through micro-actions (seeking coral, tracing cast) and internal contradictions (translator who can't translate his own trauma). His motivation to rewrite the cast emerges from concrete tactile engagement rather than summary. The therapeutic vocabulary ("lotus-hearted ache," "unknot") occasionally edges toward label-speak but remains tethered to physical action. His final breathing in sync with the tide earns the renunciation of analytical distance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered examination of the cast, building density until the rewriting action shifts cadence and meaning. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (who: Elias; where: atrium; when: post-anesthetic). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias rewrites the artifact and thus symbolically cleanses memory before it settles, forecloses his analytical approach with the cost of vulnerability ("breathing in sync with the distant tide"). The because/therefore chain from examination to intervention is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium's mist, glass doors, and teak bench ground the scene immediately. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, then during rewriting) and charging the final transformation by grounding him "in the present moment." The clinical coldness giving way to warmth tracks emotional shift through spatial perception. Spatial choreography (bench, cast on knees, pen from pocket) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias intercede in Leo's trauma narrative before it calcifies? The tightening occurs when he realizes the mother's warning can be transformed, forcing the choice to alter the artifact. Agency is enacted through the pen strokes that change "hide yourself" into "hold yourself," forecloses his detached translator role, and accepts vulnerability as cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, with the price legible in his trembling hand and final breathing shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—trauma as transmissible text, healing as rewriting—emerges through concrete action (decrypting, revising cast) without thesis statements. The brain coral's "maze-like ridges mirrored the tangled neural pathways" risks overt symbolism but is rescued by tactile handling and the seed/stone shift. The final image (mist as blanket, breathing with tide) offers a non-literal answer: memory can be reauthored through present attention. The "lotus-hearted ache" phrase in paragraph three borders on precious but integrates as purposeful tonal pivot rather than label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias; distance tightens under pressure (trembling hand, rotating cast). Perceptual signature is strong: he sees signatures as codebreaker data, not sentimentality. Two minor slips: "shrewdly innocent gaze" tells rather than shows the tactic, and "lotus-hearted" is an authorial coinage that stretches Elias's lexicon during peak focus. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from analytical to tender.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or symbolic weight. Template opening (heavy doors, mist, silence) is generic but swift. Overwriting cluster in paragraph one: "debris of the procedure," "calcified texture," "tangled neural pathways," "manifestation of memories he could not erode"—four metaphoric vehicles in quick succession without pattern-teaching, risking density saturation (−0.5). "Lotus-hearted ache" is register drift (−0.3). Paraphrase loop: "unknot the tightness" and later "unknotted the narrative" recycles the same vehicle. Closure beat is clean. Deductions total approximately −0.8 within Q7 only, per Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Core synthesis—trauma artifact as editable text—is specific and non-obvious. The translator applying his skill to heal rather than report is a fresh inflection. Risk: the brain coral and cast both serve as nested metaphors for the same concept, which edges toward symbolic redundancy. The emotional particulars (trembling hand, pen strokes) rescue the frame from abstraction. The piece commits fully to its premise but the confluence of coral/cast/neural-pathways/maze trades some inevitability for decorative layering.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's occupation is signaled early ("translator for the Pacific conflict zone"), drives his analytical approach to the cast ("codebreaker," "decrypting"), and enables the climactic rewriting choice. Present across all three gates: setup (paragraph one), development (tracing signatures), payoff (pen revision). His professional skill narrows options (he sees what others miss) and the choice to graft new meaning is occupation-specific with visible cost (forsaking detachment). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment appears in two beats: paragraph one (seeking texture, comparing to neural pathways) and paragraph three (shifts from stone to seed during rewriting). Setup and payoff gates present; middle development is thin—handled but not causally active between first and final touch. The seed/stone shift reweights meaning at closure and charges the final grounding image. Lyric resonance qualifies for mid-6s, but limited beat involvement and the symbolic layering (coral = neural = cast = trauma) reduce irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shared anxieties shape the entire middle: Elias deciphers the cast as "catalog of shared anxieties," each adult inscribing "their own fear of death, their guilt." The concept drives his tactic (rewrite to cleanse collective terror) and alters Leo's options by symbolic intervention. Present in setup (recognizing the pattern), development (tracing each message), and payoff (transforming the warning). Causal pressure solid; cost is conceptual—he accepts the burden of reauthoring communal trauma.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is labeled in paragraph two ("feigning a child's curiosity to mask the analytical precision of a codebreaker") but the tactic itself—close examination—does not demonstrate a trade-off unique to this dual stance. The trait enables his reading of the cast but any careful observer could perform the same action. Setup present, mild development, weak payoff; no visible cost tied to the duality. Swappable with "careful" or "trained eye."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unknot" recurs three times: paragraph one (unknot tightness in chest), paragraph two (quiet work), final paragraph (unknotted the narrative from bone). The action is the story's central verb, structuring Elias's motive and the climactic pen revision. Present across all gates; drives the rewriting beat and charges the closure image. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; the literal unknotting (pen strokes connecting broken loops) enacts the metaphor with cost (trembling hand, vulnerability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method is signaled early ("decrypting smudged notes") and its mechanics matter throughout: rotating cast to catch light, recognizing dialect, tracing indentations. Present in setup (paragraph one: "perform his quiet work by decrypting"), development (paragraph two: forensic reading of ink), and payoff (paragraph three: pen connects broken loops). The specificity of the method (ballpoint indentations, dialect recognition, light angle) shapes his tactics and enables the transformation. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atrium at twilight is established immediately (glass doors, mist, filtration hum, dimming light) and the mist reappears at closure ("no longer a suffocating barrier but a blanket"). Twilight provides the light constraint Elias uses to read indentations. Present in setup, weak middle use (light mentioned once), strong payoff (mist reweighted). The teak bench and glass supply tactile anchors but do not alter tactics. Lyric reprise with cost at closure qualifies for mid-6s; limited middle pressure caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is noted ("just twenty minutes ago, the nurse had nodded") but does not tighten decisions—Elias works at his own pace with no urgency tied to Leo waking or the surgeon's return. The mention "before the surgeon returned" in paragraph one sets a vague boundary never tested. Present in setup, absent in middle escalation, weak at closure (Leo "will" wake, future tense). No live clock altering moves; swappable with any post-event window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized through embodied action: seeking coral texture, trembling hand, pen strokes that "graft new meaning onto old wounds." The phrase itself appears in paragraph three and the desire drives the climactic rewriting with visible cost (vulnerability, renouncing detachment). Present across all gates: setup (unknot tightness), development (decoding messages), payoff (pen revision and breathing shift). Strong causal pressure; the friction between analytical habit and tender intervention creates the story's central tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is clinical in paragraphs one–two (filtration hum, analytical precision, codebreaker) and shifts to tender in paragraph three ("lotus-hearted ache," "blanket tucked around the sleeping building"). The modulation tracks pressure: cold analysis gives way to warmth as Elias commits. Present in setup (silence, debris), modulates at the turn (trembling hand), charges closure (breathing in sync with tide). Coherent through beats; the "lotus-hearted" coinage is register-risky but intentional. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
