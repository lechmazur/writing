<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates concrete interior complexity—his professional detachedness masks esoteric motivation, embodied through trembling hands and chest-tightening. The trait "sensitively perceptive, cursed with empathy that extended to inanimate stone" functions mostly as label; it's told rather than shown constraining a choice under pressure. The final decision to carry the memories out is motivated by accumulated knowledge, but the emotional arc from detachment to burden-bearer could be more contradictory and embodied in the peak moment. No significant micro-choices with visible trade-offs appear on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered discovery (passage → library → hearth → diaries → negatives) that reweights the dominant stake (discovering what walls dream becomes carrying a crime's memory). Orientation is clean by paragraph one. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias accepts the burden and the final click returns "changed and somber," crystallizing his new role as keeper with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diarist's confession transforms his professional survey into moral witness. Cost is visible in "crushing reality" and the deliberate packing of evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage, moss-muffled corridor, roofless library with jagged slate overhang, and the preserved hearth anchor spatial progression clearly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "frequency of abandonment," "rain and rot," ash "solidified over decades." The sonic emitter and headphones ground Elias's profession in tactile use. The hearth as micro-setting constrains the discovery method (excavation) and the film strip held to pale light charges the final revelation. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering what walls dream—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when acoustic heaviness becomes confession of mass sacrifice. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of Seraphina's crime forecloses Elias's professional detachment, forcing him into the role of sole keeper. The film negatives narrow options by providing faces to the betrayal, transforming abstract history into particular victims. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to pack and carry the evidence out. Cost is legible on the page: "crushing reality," "burden was his now," and the changed echo at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—what walls dream, legacy's burden, preservation's moral cost—emerges through concrete particulars: sealed vaults, half-burned diaries, inverted faces on film. The final image (changed echo "finally revealing the tragic nightmare") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates through acoustic metaphor: "frequency of abandonment," "resonance of betrayal," "screamed in a loop of suffocating silence." The piece resists tidy closure; Elias gains knowledge but no redemption for Seraphina's victims. One minor slip: "what walls dream about" borders on whimsy and the phrase "tragic nightmare" in the final line edges toward direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance modulates purposefully (professional survey narrows to trembling excavation). Diction matches Elias's profession: "acoustic map," "microscopic fissures of the mortar," "topography of sound." The prose carries distinct texture through sonic vocabulary and ruin-surveyor perspective. Two minor slips: "esoteric" and "tangible manifestation of the legacy's burden" drift toward elevated register during peak moments. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound-driven observation layered with emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across survey (clipped technical) and discovery (denser, more reflective). Information density is high; most sentences advance through layered action-and-perception. Three penalties: (1) Paraphrase loop: "his true motivation was far more esoteric: to discover what walls dream about" repeats the concept without added pressure (−0.2). (2) Stock metaphor: "dark throat of the building" (−0.3). (3) Template cadence in paragraph four: "He found… The leather bindings were… The handwriting inside was…" runs three consecutive subject-verb stems (−0.4). The final image "changed and somber, finally revealing" is propulsive. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Overall clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Corridor echo cartography as profession-plus-obsession offers fresh synthesis of post-climate ruin-mapping and emotional archaeology. The sonic emitter grounds speculative skill in plausible use. The central turn—acoustic survey becomes witness to archive-preservation atrocity—feels earned and non-obvious. The film negatives (inverted faces, hope frozen before sacrifice) provide a specific, irreplaceable image that charges the ending. One friction: "what walls dream about" as framing phrase risks whimsy and the post-climate-shift setting is familiar dystopian furniture. Transformation is strong: tropes are inhabited through Elias's particular skill and the diaries-in-hearth method. Risk-taking (sonic cartography as emotional archaeology) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Corridor echo cartographer shapes early setup (sonic emitter, clicker, headphones ground profession), drives middle beat (acoustic heaviness leads him to library/hearth), and informs closure (final click returns "changed and somber"). The profession enables the discovery method and charges the ending image. Two beats: acoustic survey and final verification. Causal pressure: the skill constrains tactics (must follow acoustic trail) and the final click reweights prior mapping. Present in closure image. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = base ~7.2. Slight swappability (any ruin-surveyor could find the hearth) −0.4 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Film negative strip appears late (final third) but transforms prior material decisively. Two beats: discovery in canister and held-to-light revelation. The strip provides faces and hope to Seraphina's victims, reweighting the abstract crime into particular betrayal. The inverted-image detail (ghostly, reversed faces) is specific and irreplaceable. Present in closure paragraph and charges the final understanding. Late appearance −0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (reveals victims' identities) +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (inverted celluloid, champagne toast) +0.7 = 7.4, rounded to 7.3 for late entry friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is seeded early ("profession born of necessity"), developed through Seraphina's confession ("weight of this knowledge settled onto Elias"), and crystallized at closure ("burden was his now"). The concept shapes the dominant stake: Elias moves from mapping ruins to bearing witness to atrocity. Three beats: professional context, confession discovery, final acceptance. Causal pressure: the burden forecloses detachment and alters his role from surveyor to keeper. Present in closure action (packing evidence). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.3 = base ~7.7. Minor label-speak ("tangible manifestation of the legacy's burden") −0.3, slight abstraction −0.5 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive enables Elias to "hear the sorrow in a cracked lintel" and recognize "frequency of abandonment." The trait is seeded early, drives acoustic reading in middle beats, and informs the final changed echo. Mostly label-only; no on-page scene where heightened perception costs him something concrete (time, safety, misreading). The trait enables discovery but does not constrain a choice with visible trade-off. Early signal +0.6, two beats (acoustic reading, final click) +0.9, enables discovery +0.8, closure linkage +0.9 = base ~6.2. Label-only (no visible cost) −0.4 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glimpse (holding film to light, catching inverted faces) is the major turn that personalizes the crime and charges the closure. One beat, but decisive: the action redefines options by giving faces to the sacrifice. Traceable causality: glimpse leads directly to final burden acceptance and changed echo. Present in closure paragraph. Late appearance (final third) −0.7, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (redefines understanding) +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability (specific visual revelation) +0.7 = base ~7.4. Slight swappability (any reveal method could work) −0.3 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries in fireplace are signaled early (hearth setup), drive the major discovery beat (Seraphina's confession), and enable the film-strip find. Two beats: excavation and reading confession. The method matters: fire preserved some evidence, destroyed context, creating partial knowledge that intensifies burden. Shapes tactics: Elias must excavate ash, pry open brittle pages. Present in closure (packing diary fragments). Early signal (hearth introduced mid-story) +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (confession transforms stakes) +1.3, closure linkage +1.1, specificity (scorched leather, bled ink) +0.6 = 7.6, rounded down from slight late first appearance friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage frames opening, grounds spatial progression (passage → library → hearth), and returns at closure ("ivy" mentioned as Elias holds film to "pale light filtering through the ivy"). Three beats: entry threshold, spatial anchor during descent, and closure image. The passage supplies atmosphere and constrains access (moss muffles footsteps, vines must be pushed aside). Micro-setting at hearth (slate overhang protects evidence) enables discovery. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (slate preserves hearth, ivy filters light for film reveal) +1.0, closure linkage +0.8 = base ~6.9. Slight postcard description in opening −0.4, swappability (any ruin corridor) −0.3 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>After the climate shifts is seeded early ("great storms… redrawn maps, silenced coastal cities"), provides world context (rising water levels, sealed vaults), and informs the profession's necessity. Two beats: opening context and Seraphina's diary detailing floods. The timeframe shapes the ruins' state (decades of moisture, roofless library) but does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. Mostly backdrop. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, enables world logic +0.7 = base ~6.2. No on-page tightening of tactics or decisions −0.5, largely replaceable (any disaster timeframe) −0.3 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To discover what walls dream about is seeded early ("true motivation… esoteric"), drives the survey method (listening for emotional resonance), and reappears at closure ("finally revealing the tragic nightmare that the walls had been dreaming"). Three beats: initial motivation, acoustic heaviness recognition, final revelation. The desire shapes stakes but is not dramatized in conflicted choice; Elias pursues it without visible cost or friction until the end. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, shapes stakes +0.9, closure linkage +1.2 = base ~7.2. Told-only (no on-page friction between want and cost) −0.5, slight whimsy in phrasing −0.3 = 6.4.</comment>
