<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's central contradiction—pacifist by choice, violent by heritage—is clearly established and drives the shadow-integration arc. The embodied manifestation of his happiness through gravitational changes is vivid and specific. However, the "stitching shadow to heel" action lacks micro-choice granularity; the integration happens in a single wave of nausea and rage without visible hesitation or cost-bearing decisions that would foreclose alternate paths. The final acceptance reads more as completion of a mechanical task than an earned moral reckoning with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear causal arc: Elian must integrate his shadow to resonate with the relic and unlock the door. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the second paragraph without penalty. The closure—floating before the opened door—delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the agonizing integration) under a primarily Causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door that "remained impassive" finally "groaned in submission." The cost is legible in "agonizing" and "burning acceptance," though the physical act of opening the door feels somewhat anticlimactic after the psychic surgery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The *Cenotaph*'s patchwork construction and dying reactor hum create tangible atmosphere, and the blast door functions as a concrete constraint driving the entire arc. The "emergency lights" casting the shadow Elian stitches, and the "cold deck" he sits on, ground the ritual in spatial particulars. The ventilation shafts (scavenger evasion) and engineering sector anchor choices in layout. The setting charges the final image—"drifting into the impossible colors"—and the gravitational lightness pays off the established variable-gravity environment, though the "impossible colors" themselves remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlock the dimension—is signaled in paragraph two and remains coherent throughout. Pressure escalates through a single meaningful tightening: the door's prior rejection ("remained impassive") forces the shadow-work, which narrows options to integration or failure. The protagonist's agency drives the turn; the stitching action and acceptance of darkness are his choices, not luck. The cost is visible and felt ("agonizing," "nausea and rage"), and the resolution—levitation and door-opening—is earned by the integration. No secondary antagonist is needed; the locked door and Elian's own repressed violence supply sufficient opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: wholeness requires embracing the capacity for evil to give the choice of good meaning. The final image—Elian "suspended by his own enlightenment"—resonates without stating a moral. The "monster as a brother to the saint" phrasing risks overt articulation, yet it remains character-bound thought rather than authorial intrusion. The shadow-work specifics (stitching with crystallized grief) particularize the premise, and the door's recognition of "balance of light and dark" reweights the opening's "incomplete" label. The piece invites reflection on pacifism born of fear versus choice without collapsing into a tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("steadfast pacifist," "moral absolutist," "ghostly resolve") that suits the quasi-mythic premise. No dialogue appears. Elian's perceptual filter—"scattering of antique images," "spectral residue"—reflects his archival solitude. However, phrases like "deep shadow work" and "psychic surgery" drift into jargon that feels imported rather than organically Elian's lexicon under duress. The final paragraph's "radiant, burning acceptance" and "suspended by his own enlightenment" risk purple abstraction, though they serve the heightened closure moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several patterns create minor drag. "He had to integrate the darkness he had spent a lifetime repressing" is followed closely by restating the same idea in "acknowledge that the capacity for evil was necessary to give meaning to the choice of good"—a paraphrase loop. "Ghostly resolve" in the final line echoes the opening's tonal setup without adding new information. Stock phrases appear: "final witness," "species that had already resigned itself to dust," "raw, unfiltered emotion." The stitching sequence—"pierced the metaphysical space where his physical heel met...silhouette"—is dense but legible; however, the mixed metaphor of "solidified moonlight" for a tear slightly muddles the gem's nature. No line-level opacity blocks causality, and the prose generally serves pressure without scaffold stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—stitching shadow to body with grief-residue to achieve spiritual resonance—is specific and non-obvious, blending post-apocalyptic sci-fi with Jungian shadow-work and Buddhist iconography (Kwan Yin). The gravitational-happiness attribute and the "last human epilogue" timeframe offer fresh angles. However, the core template—lone seeker performs ritual to unlock mystical threshold—is familiar, and the piece does not fully transform it through lived detail or moral friction; Elian's pacifism is more told than tested on the page, limiting surprise. The "impossible colors of the new dimension" at closure remains generic rather than delivering a final image with durable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's pacifism is established early (scavenger evasion) and motivates the shadow-work: he fears his own violence and must integrate it. The trait participates in two beats—backstory evasion and the integration ritual—and the resolution (accepting "the monster as a brother") directly addresses it. However, the pacifism never constrains a live on-page choice; hiding in vents is summary, and no scene tests his refusal under immediate pressure. The character drives the ending, but the steadfast-pacifist element itself is more thematic backdrop than tactical lever at closure. Cap: late setup (second paragraph) and summary-only beat −0.3 each; two-beat involvement +0.9; causal linkage to closure +0.8. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is introduced in paragraph two, used in a prior failed attempt, then deployed at closure where it "flared, recognizing the balance." Three beats (prior attempt, setup, closure) with evolving function: rejection → acceptance. The gem's "solidified moonlight" appearance and "immense spiritual density" are specific, and its resonance requirement drives the shadow-work. Closure success hinges on the tear's recognition. Setup by para 2 +0.5; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (enables closure) +1.2; closure linkage +1.2; specificity +0.5. No major frictions. Total: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Shadow work is named explicitly in paragraph three and frames the entire middle arc: "integrate the darkness he had spent a lifetime repressing." The stitching ritual enacts it concretely—gathering grief-residue, binding shadow to body—and the success condition (door recognizing "balance of light and dark") depends on it. The concept appears in setup, drives the ritual beat, and is validated at closure. Setup by para 3 +0.4; two beats (ritual, door recognition) +0.9; causal pressure (gate to closure) +1.0; closure linkage +1.0; however, the phrase "deep shadow work" risks jargon (-0.3) and the concept occasionally leans toward theme-claim rather than embodied constraint. Total: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gravitational lightness when happy is signaled in paragraph one, constrains Elian's baseline state ("mostly trudged"), and culminates at closure: "his weight vanished, and he floated upward...suspended by his own enlightenment." The attribute enables the final physical levitation before the door, making it indispensable to the ending's image and logistics. Three beats (baseline, ritual transformation, closure float) with visible cause-effect. Setup para 1 +0.6; three beats +1.4; causal pressure +1.3; closure linkage +1.5; specificity +0.6; cost connection (joy's prerequisite is agonizing integration) +0.4. Total: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stitching is the core turn action: Elian uses a magnetized needle to bind his shadow to his heel with grief-residue, and this act triggers the integration wave that enables closure. The action is unique (not swappable), appears in the ritual beat and is named again at closure prep ("the final knot was tied"), and directly causes the enlightenment that opens the door. Setup para 4 +0.5; two beats (ritual, knot completion) +0.9; causal pressure (mandatory gate) +1.4; closure linkage +1.3; specificity (binding shadow to body) +0.7; cost connection +0.5. No swappability or ornamental risk. Total: 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—dried tears on photographs—is introduced in paragraph three and executed in paragraph four: Elian uses a monocle to see saline trails, then lifts crystallized grief with a magnetized needle. The method provides the coating for the stitching needle, directly enabling the shadow-work. Two beats (discovery, use) with early signal and closure participation (the residue-coated thread binds the shadow). Setup para 3 +0.5; two beats +0.9; causal pressure +1.1; closure linkage +1.0; specificity (saline trails, magnetized needle) +0.6. Slightly ornamental phrasing ("spectral residue") −0.2; otherwise tight. Total: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The *Cenotaph* is named and described in paragraph one (patchwork, dying reactor hum, ventilation shafts for hiding), and the engineering sector blast door is the concrete goal. The setting supplies the shadow (emergency lights), the cold deck for sitting, and the spatial constraint (labyrinthine vents). Three beats (baseline description, ritual location, door). The reactor hum and cold deck anchor the ritual physically. Setup para 1 +0.6; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (door is the lock, lights cast shadow) +0.9; closure linkage (door opened) +0.8; however, much description is atmospheric rather than tactically constraining, and the "impossible colors" dimension remains abstract. Swappability risk (generic spaceship) −0.4. Total: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Timeframe—after the last human is born—is established in paragraph one ("the silent era after the last human is born") and colors Elian's motivation (final witness, lonely epilogue). It provides existential stakes but does not create a live clock or tighten on-page decisions; the ritual proceeds without time pressure. One beat (setup) with thematic weight but no tactical constraint. Setup para 1 +0.4; thematic linkage to motivation +0.3; no middle development or closure participation beyond mood. Missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8 per gate model, but the strong thematic seed lifts slightly within the cap's neighborhood. Total: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—push open the locked dimension—is stated clearly in paragraph two and drives every subsequent beat: prior failure, shadow-work necessity, ritual execution, final door-opening. The desire is tested (door rejection), forces a cost (integration pain), and is fulfilled at closure. Three beats (setup, ritual justification, closure). Setup para 2 +0.5; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (entire arc hinges on it) +1.3; closure linkage (goal achieved) +1.4; cost connection (agonizing integration) +0.5. The motivation is slightly under-dramatized—why this dimension, what's inside—but the friction is present in the "incomplete" rejection. Total: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve appears as a phrase in the final sentence and as a tonal through-line: Elian's solitude, the spectral residue, the "faint shimmer" of tears, and the "impossible colors" all carry an ethereal, liminal quality. The tone modulates from heavy trudging (para 1) through visceral nausea (para 4) to "radiant, burning acceptance" and "suspended by his own enlightenment" (para 5), then closes on "ghostly resolve." Coherent arc with pressure-sensitive shifts. Setup implied early +0.3; tonal beats across paragraphs +1.0; closure charge (final line) +1.0; however, "ghostly resolve" as a label feels slightly imposed rather than emergent, and the phrase itself is somewhat abstract. Ornamental label risk −0.3. Total: 6.7.</comment>
