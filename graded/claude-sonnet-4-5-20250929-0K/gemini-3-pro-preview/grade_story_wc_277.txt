<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is signaled clearly and her method (proof by contradiction) is embodied through concrete action—retrieving the pen, examining ledgers, placing the call. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("orbits of regret," "gravitational coherence") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice feels more like executing a pre-formed plan than wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. No visible cost attends the decision; Sterling's embarrassment is reported, not felt as sacrifice or foreclosure for Eleanor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Eleanor, observatory, post-call timeframe). The escalation is clear: threat → examination → counterargument → call → resolution. Closure is a Decisive Change (the threat dissipates) with felt cost to Sterling and a tactical shift for Eleanor. However, the cost to Eleanor herself is not legible on the page—she ends exactly where she began, watching clouds with satisfaction. The rosewood pen and ledger memories enable the turn, meeting causal standards, but the ending lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed path for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and charged: "glass-walled rotunda," "horizon where the sky met a solid floor of cumulus clouds," and the "echoing" dome create a concrete container. The rosewood pen's cedar-and-iron scent and the velvet box ground object-work. However, the setting does not constrain Eleanor's choice—she could conduct this proof anywhere with access to the ledgers. The clouds and glass frame mood but do not alter tactics or charge the closure image beyond visual atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: protect the family legacy from false accusation. The piece tightens from threat to examination to rebuttal, and Eleanor's agency drives the turn. Sterling's silence and "realized embarrassment" signal a reversal. However, the cost is one-sided—Sterling pays, Eleanor does not. No live option is foreclosed for her; no trade-off between competing goods appears. The proof by contradiction method provides logical escalation but emotional and tactical risk remain low throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "orbits of regret" metaphor and the fire-safety receipts' ironic counterweight to the arson claim. The final image of "sending the regret spinning away into the dark" offers a purposeful reconfiguration. However, the thematic question—can logic redeem reputation?—resolves too cleanly without ambiguity or cost. The rosewood pen as "voice of the dead" borders on overt symbolism, and the piece never interrogates Eleanor's own complicity or blind spots, flattening moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct elevated register: "cold, amusing elegance of logic," "solemn playfulness." The dialogue ("I have done the math on your scoop, and I'm afraid your equation equals zero") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to exterior choreography. However, some diction ("gravitational coherence," "perigee of crisis") drifts into register that risks self-consciousness. The telephone exchange is told rather than dramatized with full beats, reducing immediacy at a peak moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with strong image work: "tearing paper" voice, "indigo ink dry," "mist in the morning sun." Sentence structure varies, and information density is high. Minor issues: "Being a woman devotedly observant" is an awkward participial construction; "smelled faintly of cedar and old iron" stacks modifiers without strong necessity; "the two actions were mutually exclusive" over-explains the contradiction already shown. The final paragraph loops slightly ("quiet once more" echoes the opening sanctuary motif without adding pressure). No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—heiress above the clouds uses formal logic to dismantle a journalist's accusation—offers a fresh synthesis of Gothic isolation and procedural reasoning. The rosewood pen nib and proof-by-contradiction method are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc is thin: Eleanor begins confident and ends satisfied, with no internal transformation. The "orbits of regret" concept and observatory setting risk ornamental cleverness without full integration into character stakes. The story commits to its premise but does not transform familiar vindication-plot mechanics into something fully singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's choice to intervene drives the central turn. She retrieves the pen, examines ledgers, constructs the proof, and places the call—each beat advances causality. However, her role as "reclusive heiress" is static; the newsprint empire context does not constrain her actions or add friction. She could be any educated inheritor defending a legacy. The attribute appears in setup and middle but does not shape the closure image or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: retrieval from the velvet box, dipping into indigo ink, and being placed back in its case at closure. Its "cedar and old iron" scent and wooden tip holding liquid in grooves are specific. Eleanor calls it the "voice of the dead," linking it to Archibald and lending thematic weight. However, the pen does not constrain her choice—she could construct the proof without it. Its function is symbolic resonance rather than causal necessity. Strong closure participation and specificity lift the score, but swappability for any writing instrument caps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" concept is introduced early and Eleanor applies it to Sterling's story ("the journalist… miscalculated… based on incomplete data points"). It frames her worldview and the central metaphor. However, it does not constrain her tactics or alter the proof's logic. The concept is thematic decoration rather than a causal mechanism. The final image ("shifted the orbit, sending the regret spinning away") reprises it but does not reweight prior stakes with new cost. Present across beats but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant of the smallest inconsistencies" is labeled once and demonstrated when Eleanor notices "the journalist's story lacked the necessary gravitational coherence." However, this trait does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it simply enables her to do what the plot requires. The attribute could be swapped for "analytically rigorous" or "detail-oriented" without structural change. No visible tradeoff between observation and action appears. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Intervene" is signaled early ("It was time to intervene") and drives the middle escalation: Eleanor constructs the proof, then calls Sterling. The action redefines the threat from live to neutralized. However, "intervene" is broad—she could intervene by denial, bluster, or silence; the specificity comes from "proof by contradiction," not from intervention itself. The action is essential to the plot but not irreplaceable as phrased. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is signaled early, its mechanics laid out on the page ("Assumption… If this were true… However… The two actions were mutually exclusive… Therefore, the assumption was false"), and it shapes Eleanor's entire middle sequence. The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally active—without it, the story collapses into generic rebuttal. It charges the closure call ("I have done the math") and embodies Eleanor's worldview. Strong setup, development, and payoff with visible cost to Sterling. Just shy of indispensable because Eleanor's own stakes remain low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The observatory is described vividly and frames the opening and closing images. However, it does not constrain Eleanor's choices—she could perform this proof in any private study. The clouds and glass contribute atmosphere but do not alter tactics or supply resources. The "echoing" dome amplifies the pen's scratch, a nice detail, but the setting's function is largely postcard. Present across beats but swappable for any isolated refuge without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist calls, but before the headlines are printed" is signaled early and creates urgency ("threatening to run the story by morning"). It tightens Eleanor's window and motivates her immediate action. However, the clock is not tracked on the page—no sense of minutes passing or dawn approaching. The ending simply declares "the threat had dissipated," with no race against publication. The timeframe shapes setup and middle pressure but does not charge the closure beat with visible time cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Motivated by a desperate need to discover hidden truths rather than merely defend a reputation" is stated early and distinguishes Eleanor's goal. However, this motivation is told, not dramatized—she defends the reputation by disproving the accusation; no hidden truth beyond the ledger facts is discovered. The distinction between discovery and defense does not generate friction or alter her tactics. The motivation is present but does not constrain choices or impose visible cost. Functional label without on-page embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is signaled ("a technique she found possessed a solemn playfulness") and visible in Eleanor's tone: the formal proof structure paired with light verbal jabs ("your equation equals zero"). The voice sustains this blend across beats. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—Eleanor remains composed throughout, never shifting cadence when stakes rise. The ending reprises the opening serenity without tonal transformation. Coherent but static; it does not charge the final image with new emotional weight.</comment>
