<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hiero's interiority is concrete and embodied through his interaction with the coins and his listening method. His motivation (preserving the past to seed the future) drives the scene consistently, and the closing moment shows "stellar doubt" pressing against his persistence without therapy-speak. The final gesture—gathering coins to continue despite doubt—demonstrates endurance with visible cost (the suffocating feeling, the weight of futility). Minor slip: the "quietly enthusiastic" trait is labeled rather than shown through gesture or micro-choice in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who, where, and when in the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a resonant reconfiguration at closure (Earned Stasis: Hiero continues casting lots despite cosmic futility, forecloses hope, accepts the cost). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—"he would continue to cast his lots until the final light went out"—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy loops and doubt intrudes, reweighting his task. No causality breaks; the single-scene window and single POV fit scope defaults cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck, the translucent resin, and the "crushing, uniform darkness" create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The coins (foreign, extinct empires) function as tactile anchors that constrain Hiero's method and charge the final image when he gathers them again. The sensory hierarchy—gold resin underfoot, cold metal tumbling, static bursts—reflects Hiero's professional focus and urgency. The environment subtly mirrors his isolation and the universe's contraction without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving history to justify the next Big Bang—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy loops and "stellar doubt" intrudes, narrowing Hiero's emotional options and forcing him to choose persistence over despair. The final act (gathering coins to continue) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: the suffocating weight of futility and the acknowledgment that "the cycle might simply end here." No explicit antagonist, but the collapsing universe and probability's chaos supply coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the coins of extinct empires, the backwards prophecy, the loop of coral-city histories. The ending resists moralizing; Hiero's choice to continue—"Even if the stars never returned"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question of purpose in entropy. The "money of ghosts" image reweights the opening without becoming symbolic convenience. Minor slip: "wavelength align with purpose" reads slightly label-like, though it is grounded in his receiver work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; distance is consistent, and perceptual signature is selective (he interprets static, reads coin scatter instantly). Diction stays within Hiero's technical-poetic lexicon without register drift. The prose reflects his focused, patient mindset: "He did not flinch at the noise; instead, he became quietly enthusiastic." No dialogue is present (correctly unmarked), and no head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under the weight of doubt in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: "foreign coins" immediately signals extinct empires and decoupled causality. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent phrasing: "It was a beautiful, tragic archive. Yet, as the transmission looped, a heavy, suffocating feeling…" reads as light paraphrase without added pressure. No figurative muddle or metaphor contradictions. One filter-verb stack: "He looked down… The doubt was vast… he forced his hand to move" could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination—cast-lots decision-making in a contracting universe using coins from erased empires—feels specific and non-obvious. The backwards prophecy (archiving the past for the next Big Bang) transforms familiar entropy tropes through Hiero's ritual and his conceptual stake. The final image (gathering coins despite futility) synthesizes character, method, and theme into an inevitable, earned gesture. Risk-taking in tone and setting (ambered station, probability as sole law) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cast-lots decision-making appears in setup (opening third), drives the middle beat (shaking coins, interpreting scatter, twisting dials), and shapes closure (gathering coins to continue). The method creates the key turn: static → coherent voice. Removing it would break the story's logic and Hiero's agency. Two distinct beats (initial casting, final gathering) with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collection of foreign coins appears in setup (opening third), is handled in two beats (initial cast, final gather), and charges the closure image ("money of ghosts"). The coins' specificity (platinum, electrum, oxidized copper; profiles of tyrants, scripts of silenced languages) is irreplaceable and ties directly to the theme of preserving erased history. Visible cost: Hiero must trust chance over logic, and the final gather signals his commitment despite doubt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is introduced early (first third), shapes the middle beat (the voice reciting water-planet history), and motivates Hiero's goal (encode past into next Big Bang). It constrains his method (receiving transmissions rather than predicting) and ties to closure (he continues despite doubt about the cycle). One strong beat involvement; causal linkage to motivation. Slightly more functional than transformative; could be swapped for "reverse chronology signal" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Quietly enthusiastic is labeled once ("a subtle brightness entering his eyes as he leaned into the dissonance") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No visible trade-off; the trait could be removed without altering choices or closure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distill (boiling away radiation to reveal the message) appears in setup, drives the middle beat (twisting dials to coordinates), and connects to closure (continuing the process). The action shapes Hiero's method and enables the major turn (static → prophecy). Removing it would weaken the logic of his role. Two beats with causal pressure; specificity moderate (could be "filter" or "tune").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts is signaled early ("unique method"), shapes the middle beat (he interprets the scatter, adjusts frequency), and ties to closure (preparing for the next burst). The method's mechanics matter: probability replaces logic, and the static-to-signal transformation is Hiero's core competence. One strong beat; causal linkage to his role. Slightly swappable with "decode noise" but specific enough to matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ambered observatory deck is present in setup (opening paragraph) and final image (looking down at coins "scattered across the controls" with "amber floor" below). The resin encasing and preservation field create atmospheric pressure but do not alter tactics. Lyric reprise (first → last) reweights the isolation theme moderately. Present in closure but not causally active; micro-setting role is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After the universe contracts is signaled in setup (opening paragraph), constrains the method (logic failed, probability remains), and motivates the goal (preserve past before singularity). The timeframe shapes the stakes (cosmic finality) and charges the doubt in closure. One strong beat (collapsing universe as pressure). Specificity moderate; could be "heat death" with similar effect, but the contraction imagery (squeezing, suffocating) ties to the amber encasement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To wavelength align with purpose is stated early, drives the middle beat (distilling static, encoding history), and charges closure (continuing despite doubt about the cycle's rebound). The motivation creates friction between Hiero's goal and the suffocating doubt, with visible cost (he forces his hand to move). Two beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. Slightly label-like phrasing but irreplaceable to his technical role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stellar doubt appears explicitly in the final third ("pervasive tone of stellar doubt," "vast, darker than the void") and modulates the prior calm focus into suffocating weight. The tone charges the final image: Hiero gathers coins despite futility. Coherent throughout (focused patience → existential dread) and essential to closure's emotional cost. Late explicit mention but the doubt accrues implicitly via the "crushing darkness" and "choking" universe imagery from the opening.</comment>
