<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's core motivation (reclaiming the missed doorway moment) is concrete and embodied, and his grim-optimist stance shapes the dice gamble. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("logical fallacy," "thermodynamic violation") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to step through the rupture feels inevitable given the setup, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains intellectual rather than viscerally contradictory. The backstory fragment (woman in doorway) anchors the present stake but occupies significant real estate without a dramatized micro-choice that alters his immediate tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early (Elian, infinite staircase); the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (mathematical proof + perpetual motion paradox). The closure unit is a Decisive Change: the rupture opens, Elian grasps the missed opportunity's texture, and the staircase crumbles. Cost is legible—he stakes "his continued existence on a theorem"—and the final image shows him clutching the second chance. One minor causality wrinkle: the chipped die's refusal to settle and emission of a "high-pitched whine" introduces new physics late without prior cue that dice can violate gravity in this reality, but the ending remains coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vivid and purposeful: "hazy vertical abyss," cold limestone, chalk lines, friction-less vacuum logic. The chipped die and chalk equations are tactile anchors that constrain Elian's method and charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (sitting step, standing, casting dice onto scribbled riser). The staircase's perpetual-motion logic is integrated into choice: it recycles exertion, forcing Elian to attack structural integrity rather than climb. The final rupture—color, memory, mundane world—reweights the setting as prison-to-portal with embodied texture (grainy fabric, rough warmth of doorframe).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is escape from the infinite staircase, braided tightly with reclaiming the missed moment. Pressure escalates cleanly: Elian diagnoses the perpetual-motion trap, crafts the mathematical proof, casts the dice, and the system buckles. The chipped die's wild spin is the pivot that forces the rupture. Agency is clear: his theorem and dice gamble drive the turn. Cost is stated ("stake his continued existence") and felt in the rupture's "stinging pain." One meaningful tightening suffices at this length. The final step through the breach forecloses the old path with visible price (staircase crumbles, reality reasserts).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of regret and second chances emerges through particulars: the missed three words, the doorway, the texture of opportunity made tangible. The infinite staircase as metaphor for regret-as-prison is legible but borders on overt allegory. The dice and mathematical proof serve as concrete vehicles for the theme of introducing chaos to break deterministic loops. The final image—grasping "the texture of the missed opportunity, grainy and real"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though "second chance" and "grip that would never let go" inch toward sentiment. No diagnostic label-speak in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elian's perception and interiority. Diction is elevated and concept-driven ("paradoxical architecture," "energetic loop," "axiom") which fits a protagonist crafting mathematical proofs but risks register drift under peak stress. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct philosophical texture, though sentence stems occasionally repeat ("He reached," "He finished," "He stood," "He shook"). Free indirect thought is clean. No dialogue to evaluate. Voice modulates minimally under pressure; the final beat maintains the same elevated register rather than compressing or fragmenting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; information density is high. Rhythm varies across paragraphs, though mid-story beats lean on template cadence: "He reached… He knew… He pulled… He defined… He finished… He stood… He shook." The opening and closing images are vivid. One paraphrase loop: "refusing to let… crush his spirit" echoes "grim optimist" without added pressure. Figurative language is purposeful ("monument to ascension," "trap disguised as a journey") but occasionally stacks ("hazy vertical abyss," "boundless confinement," "paradoxical architecture") in the opening beat. No major artifacts touch closure. Filter verbs ("knew," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—infinite staircase as perpetual-motion trap + mathematical proof + chipped die as chaos variable—is conceptually fresh and tightly integrated. The emotional anchor (missed three words to a woman) personalizes the metaphysical premise. However, the staircase-as-regret and dice-as-agency are familiar symbolic frames; the story executes them cleanly but does not transform them through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail. The chipped die's defect-as-weapon is a sharp particular. The ending's "texture of opportunity" made tangible is a strong metaphoric leap, though "second chance" and "grip that would never let go" are stock constructions. Risk-taking is moderate: the mathematical-proof method is signaled but not dramatized in granular choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian as "grim optimist" is signaled early ("crooked smile of a grim optimist") and shapes his refusal to despair and his daring theorem gamble. The trait drives two key decisions: defining the chipped die as a chaos variable and casting the dice despite existential risk. Present at closure when he steps through the rupture "with a grip that would never let go." Cost is legible (stakes existence). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The label "grim optimist" does most of the work; embodied contradiction (despair vs. hope acting simultaneously) is less visible in scene. +0.3 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 moderate swappability (could be "desperate optimist" with minor edits), −0.3 label-only in opening.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dice appear early ("most precious possession"), return in the climax (cast onto chalk lines), and the chipped die's defect drives the key reversal (refuses to settle, spins wildly, system buckles). The imperfection is framed as "a weapon" and enables the paradox that cracks the staircase. Present across three beats: withdrawal, setup (defining as chaos variable), climax (casting and spinning). Specificity is high: "chipped deeply on the corner of the six," "caught its damaged corner." Cost tied directly to the element: the dice gamble stakes Elian's existence. +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.5 causal pressure, +1.6 closure linkage, +0.7 irreplaceability, +0.5 cost connection. Minor friction: the chipped die's ability to emit a whine and defy gravity introduces late physics without prior cue, −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is signaled early ("functioned on the principles of perpetual motion") and shapes Elian's analysis: the staircase recycles exertion, making climbing futile. The concept constrains his method—he must introduce a logical fallacy rather than physical force. It drives the theorem (energy output exceeds input, thermodynamic violation) and the dice gamble. Present at closure when "the logic of the perpetual motion machine buckled." Setup, development, payoff gates met. +0.6 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity. Friction: the perpetual-motion mechanics are stated rather than dramatized through failed escape attempts or visible recycling of Elian's motion, −0.6 summary-only in places, −0.5 swappability (could be "causal loop" or "self-sustaining paradox" with edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" appears once as a descriptor of "strategy" rather than a trait embodied in Elian's choices. The dice gamble is daring (stakes existence) and arguably balanced (calculated theorem + chaos variable), but the phrase itself does not constrain or enable on-page action with visible cost—the daring and calculation are already motivated by his grim optimism and desperation. Setup gate met (described mid-story), development weak (label-only), payoff absent (not revisited at closure). +0.5 one beat, +0.4 moderate causal link, −0.6 label-only, −0.7 swappability (remove the phrase and the action remains identical), −0.4 late first appearance (second third).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rupture is the decisive turn: it opens when the chipped die's spin forces the perpetual-motion system to buckle, reveals the mundane world, and provides the portal through which Elian escapes. It is causally earned by the theorem and dice gamble, redefines all options (staircase crumbles, second chance grasped), and is present in the final image ("stepped forward into the rupture"). Irreplaceable: the story's logic requires a breach in the reality's fabric. Setup implicit (theorem predicts system crash), development (rupture tears open), payoff (step through). +0.5 setup, +0.9 two beats, +1.6 causal pressure (system buckle → rupture → escape), +1.8 closure linkage, +0.8 irreplaceability, +0.6 cost connection (stinging pain, staircase crumbles). No frictions.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Mathematical proofs" are signaled early (Elian's method is "precise, attacking… through mathematical proofs") and return at the climax (chalk equations, "final axiom," proofs "engaged with the physical anomaly"). The method shapes his approach: he defines the staircase as a function, introduces the chipped die as a chaos variable, calculates trajectory, and proves thermodynamic violation. Present across three beats: setup (scrawling equations), theorem articulation, climax (proofs engage). Setup and payoff gates met. +0.7 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +1.0 closure linkage, +0.4 specificity. Friction: the mathematical content is summarized ("complex equations," "theorem") rather than dramatized through granular problem-solving or visible trial-and-error, −0.8 summary-only, −0.5 moderate swappability (could be "symbolic logic" or "paradox construction").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is the dominant setting and central constraint: it stretches infinitely, recycles exertion, traps Elian in "boundless confinement," and forces his mathematical-proof strategy. It is tactile (cold limestone, vertical abyss, scribbled riser) and pressures every choice. Present from the opening line through closure (crumbles as Elian steps through rupture). Setup, development, payoff gates met. +0.8 early signal (opening line), +1.4 three beats, +1.5 causal pressure (perpetual motion forces theorem method), +1.5 closure linkage (crumbles, redefining the world), +0.7 irreplaceability. Minor friction: the staircase's perpetual-motion recycling is stated but not shown through failed climb attempts or visible motion feedback, −0.6 partial summary-only, −0.4 moderate swappability (other infinite prisons could substitute with edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the texture of a missed opportunity" is signaled early ("desperate need to capture the texture"), elaborated in backstory (three unspoken words to woman in doorway), and drives the final action (grasping the "rough warmth" and "grainy" texture through the rupture). It is specific, embodied, and shapes the gamble's personal stakes beyond mere escape. Present at closure when he clutches "the texture of the missed opportunity, grainy and real." Setup, development, payoff gates met. +0.7 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.6 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity. Friction: the backstory elaboration is substantial (~15%) but does not alter present tactics; the motivation primes the emotional charge but the dice gamble would proceed identically if he only wanted escape, −0.8 moderate swappability of motive, −0.4 backstory weight without micro-choice impact.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is signaled in the opening paragraph ("boundless confinement, a paradoxical architecture") and sustained through imagery: infinite space yet absolute prison, endless staircase that recycles motion. Tone charges the setting and Elian's method (attacking paradox with paradox). Present at closure in the juxtaposition of infinite staircase crumbling and mundane world opening. The phrase itself is overt but the execution—vertical abyss, perpetual motion trap, mathematical proof as escape—embodies the paradox. +0.8 early signal, +1.0 coherent modulation (tightens at dice cast, releases at rupture), +1.2 closure linkage (paradox resolved by paradox), +0.5 specificity. Friction: the label "boundless confinement" front-loads the paradox rather than letting it emerge through accumulation, −0.5 mild theme-echo rather than full dramatization, −0.2 moderate swappability (other paradox frames could substitute).</comment>
