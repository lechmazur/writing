<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation—volcanic tenderness for a dead world and for Kael—is embodied in her movements and choices. The narrative establishes her analytical intuition through concrete action (reading the statue's arm angle, connecting tapestry fragments). However, the final beat relies heavily on interpretive gestures rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible cost; she completes a circuit Kael built, but no live option is sacrificed. Internal contradiction is present (arsonist turned protector) but remains static rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal chain: sculpture → ventilation shaft → tapestry fragment → Rotunda → vandalized portrait → charcoal recontextualization. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Elara's charcoal work transforms the red smears from silencing into fire-speech, completing Kael's promise-circuit. Cost is conceptual and felt (the permanent soot mark, the acceptance of shared rage), though the final image leans heavily on interpretive reweighting rather than a decision that narrows live options. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal payoff; the transition holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive is rendered through concrete sensory detail: ancient paper taste, geo-thermal heat, twisted rebar sculpture, crumbling ventilation shaft, bone-crushing silence in the Rotunda. The setting supplies resources (the charcoal, the easel, the hidden alcove) and constrains movement (labyrinthine vaults, miles-deep descent). The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, its thread count and dye technique enabling Elara's deduction. The final image charges the space (the archive "exhales"), meeting the 9+ gate, but the occupational layer (arsonist skillset repurposed) remains suggestive rather than visibly constraining a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: rescue a forgotten promise by following Kael's trail to his hidden message. The piece tightens through three geographic descents (statue → shaft → Rotunda) and culminates in Elara's recontextualization of the vandalized portrait, which reweights the red smears from silencing to fire-speech. Agency is present in her charcoal work, which completes the circuit, but the act feels more like interpretive restoration than a choice between competing live options. The price—permanent soot on her fingertips, ownership of shared rage—is conceptual and felt but not a visible forfeiture of an alternative path. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length, but escalation remains accumulative rather than decisively narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the difference between borrowed lies and owned truth, the alchemy of destruction into creation, and the paradox of vandalism as preservation. The charcoal recontextualization is a non-literal answer to the central question—what does it mean to keep a promise to the dead?—and the final image (soot-marked fingertips, the archive's exhalation) resonates without stating a moral. The volcanic tenderness motif recurs purposefully, charging the ending. However, "lending libraries only loaned lies" flirts with thematic echo, and the phrase "the promise was kept" borders on summary rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable, lyric, and textured with purposeful compression ("stratum of reality," "volcanic tenderness," "vein of gold"). POV is single and controlled; Elara's perceptual signature (analytically intuitive, attuned to emotional logic) filters all observations. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the descent and opening during the final recontextualization. Elevated diction ("geo-thermal," "constellation," "deconstructed the chaos") fits the voice but occasionally drifts into register that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("recognized," "understood," "seemed to") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the descent sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or recontextualization. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She loved this dead world with a ferocity that could burn cities, just as she had loved Kael" restates the volcanic tenderness already established; "The hidden message revealed itself" + "Kael had not been hiding his face; he had been showing her" recycles the same realization. The final paragraph contains three consecutive summary sentences ("The message was received, and the promise was kept" after the image has already landed) that reduce momentum. Template cadence in the middle third ("She stopped... She climbed... She ran... She descended... She approached... She picked up...") stacks subject-verb openers without variation. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template cadence, totaling −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist-turned-archivist, vandalized self-portrait as message-cage, and charcoal recontextualization as promise-keeping offers a fresh angle on grief and preservation. The particular details (thread count, dye technique, rebar sculpture) anchor the world. However, the core premise—following an artist's breadcrumb trail to decode a hidden message—is a widely used template, and the transformation hinges more on interpretive reweighting than on a non-obvious choice or moral calculus. The volcanic tenderness motif and the reversal (destruction tool repurposed for creation) add specificity, but the emotional arc (decoder completes circuit, gains closure) follows a familiar groove without radical risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's identity as the Lending Library Arsonist frames the opening and her skillset (charcoal use, capacity for volcanic rage) enables the final recontextualization. She drives all on-page choices: climbing through the shaft, tracing the tapestry, interpreting the vandalized portrait, and applying charcoal to complete Kael's circuit. However, the arsonist identity itself does not constrain or alter a live tactic; her past informs voice and motivation but does not create a visible trade-off at closure. Two beats involve her choices (descent sequence, charcoal work), meeting the functional threshold, but the trait remains more thematic than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears twice: discovered in the hidden alcove (mid-story) and recalled in Elara's pocket during the final recontextualization ("seemed to vibrate, a tactile link to the history she had saved"). Its thread count and dye technique enable her deduction (matching the Rotunda banner), driving the descent. The fragment thus shapes one key turn (the connection that sends her to the Rotunda) and returns with modest reweighting at closure (tactile link to saved history). Two-beat involvement with causal pressure meets the 5.0–6.9 band, but the closure reprise is brief and the fragment does not constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is the story's conceptual and structural anchor: it motivates Elara's entire mission, appears as the hidden message in the Rotunda, and undergoes transformation through her charcoal work. The portrait's red smears are initially read as silencing, then recontextualized as fire-speech—this shift *is* the closure effect. The concept shapes stakes (rescue the promise by freeing Kael from imposed silence) and enables the ending's Conceptual Repricing. Three gates met (setup via "core concept," middle discovery, closure transformation); causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Cost is conceptual (accepting shared rage, permanent soot mark) and undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara's "analytically intuitive" trait is labeled early and demonstrated twice: reading the sculpture's arm angle (first third) and connecting the tapestry fragment to the Rotunda banner (middle). However, both uses feel like detective-work competence rather than a trait with visible cost or constraint. At closure, her charcoal recontextualization does not hinge on analytical intuition; it draws on her past as an arsonist and her emotional bond with Kael. The trait enables the middle beat but does not shape the final image or create a trade-off, capping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Portray" is signaled early ("she needed to portray the truth") and enacted on the page as the climactic action: Elara uses charcoal to shade negative space around the red smears, transforming the vandalized portrait from silencing to fire-speech. This act completes Kael's circuit and delivers the closure effect (Conceptual Repricing). The action is irreplaceable—swapping "portray" for another verb would break the logic (she does not restore, erase, or add; she recontextualizes through shading). Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor gap: the cost tied to the act is conceptual (soot-marked fingertips, ownership of rage) rather than a visible forfeiture of an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message" is signaled in paragraph six and structures the entire middle sequence: sculpture → shaft → tapestry → Rotunda → portrait. Each creation (rebar statue, tapestry fragment, vandalized self-portrait) constrains Elara's path and requires decoding. The method shapes two key beats (sculpture arm angle, tapestry connection) and delivers the closure object (the portrait). However, the mechanics are more breadcrumb-following than contested or costly; Elara's analytical intuition makes the trail legible without friction. Three gates met, two beats involved, but no visible constraint or cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Lost Civilization Archive is established in paragraph three and supplies resources (hidden alcove, Rotunda, charcoal) and constraints (labyrinthine vaults, miles-deep descent, bone-crushing silence) that shape Elara's tactics. The setting's sensory particulars (ancient paper taste, geo-thermal heat, twisted rebar) anchor every beat. The archive "exhales" in the final image, charging closure with environmental response. Three gates met; the setting drives the descent sequence and provides the tool (charcoal) that enables the climactic act. Minor gap: the archive pressures movement but does not force a choice between competing options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is mentioned in paragraph two (three years ago) but functions as backstory context rather than a live timeframe. No clock or deadline tightens Elara's choices on the page; the descent and recontextualization unfold without temporal pressure. The phrase "today" in paragraph five gestures toward a bounded window, but elapsed time is vague and never constrains tactics. The timeframe sets up the world state (Elara inhabits the archive, has had time to protect it) but does not escalate or cost anything at closure, placing it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To rescue a forgotten promise" is signaled in paragraph five and drives every on-page choice: following the trail, descending to the Rotunda, recontextualizing the portrait. The motivation is embodied in Elara's "volcanic tenderness" and her grief-charged actions. Friction is present—she must decode Kael's intent rather than receiving it directly—and the final act (charcoal shading) honors the promise by freeing Kael's intended message. Cost is conceptual (accepting shared rage, permanent soot mark) and felt. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor gap: the promise itself (what was said, when, how) remains abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is introduced in paragraph six and recurs at closure ("that overwhelming, volcanic tenderness"). The tone is consistent: fierce protectiveness mixed with grief, embodied in Elara's movements ("predator's grace," "sweeping strokes") and perceptions ("ferocity that could burn cities"). The oxymoron charges the final image (soot-marked fingertips, love that fuels survival) and modulates appropriately under pressure (tightens during descent, opens during recontextualization). The tone is irreplaceable; removing it would flatten the emotional logic. Three gates met; the tone shapes voice, action, and closure resonance. Minor gap: the label is stated twice rather than sustained solely through embodied action.</comment>
