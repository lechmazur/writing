<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to "integrate laughter into healing" is specific and drives the closure choice (the crocodile tooth reveal), but his interior texture remains somewhat spare—we get "modestly fearless" calm without much contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The General's transformation from rage to laughter is earned through the tooth's memory, showing internal conflict resolved by a visible shift in stance. Minor deduction: Elian's reactions to the spectral confessions and roaring are observed externally rather than felt as contradictory impulses; the "calm demeanor one might use to sweep a dusty floor" operates more as label than lived tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is on-page and legible: the General laughs, his chains shatter, and he fades—a Decisive Change with visible cost (release from eternal brooding). The piece follows a Causal lens; Elian's harp snagging the ghost and the tooth triggering the memory both narrow options and drive the turn. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by the first paragraph). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth shifts the General's memory from shame to mirth, foreclosing his spectral existence. Minor slip: the "luminous ache" and "beautiful pain" phrasing in the closure beat edges toward abstract summary rather than staying fully in concrete image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is anchored early with sensory detail (mists smelling of regrets, rock face, pebbles at his feet) and the setting constrains the encounter—the acoustic anomalies are integral to the harp method. The gorge's reaction (cold, pressurized air; spectral confessions arising from the depths) alters tactics and charges the atmosphere. The crocodile tooth functions as a micro-object that pressures the final turn. Minor gap: spatial choreography is clean but the gorge itself does not evolve causally after the General's release; no visible change in mist or temperature tracks his departure beyond "brightening."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: retrieve the General's soul by breaking his self-imposed gravity. Pressure tightens when the harp snags the ghost, escalates when Thorne roars and demands to be left alone, and culminates in Elian's choice to deploy the tooth—a tactic that forecloses the General's spectral existence with visible cost (the chains shatter, he fades). Agency is clear throughout; Elian's decisions drive each turn. The escalation is causal and protagonist-driven, satisfying the inferred Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of laughter as healing emerges organically through the General's memory shift from shame to mirth; the crocodile tooth is a concrete particular that transforms embarrassment into folly, and the closure image (motes of light spiraling upward) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gesture of holding up the tooth and the silence that follows. The final paragraph risks slight over-articulation ("satisfied with the work") but the "poignant, glowing sadness" and "wound finally closing" carry emotional honesty without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is present (Elian notices the gorge's acoustic anomalies, the General's military dress, the tooth's yellowed crack) and diction is controlled. The prose modulates with pressure: short beats during the harp-playing, longer sentences for the memory reveal. Minor slip: some filter verbs ("felt the heavy, resisting weight," "knew that Thorne was not trapped") slightly dull immediacy at key moments, and the final paragraph's "satisfied with the work" edges toward summary rather than staying in sensory immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines) but serves subtext and goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats; information density is high (each sentence advances character, atmosphere, or conflict). Clarity is strong with no pronoun confusion or tense drift. Minor deductions: the phrase "a sensation of luminous ache—a poignant, glowing sadness that signaled the final release. It was a beautiful pain, the feeling of a wound finally closing" contains paraphrase-loop elements (luminous ache → glowing sadness → beautiful pain → wound closing) that restate the same emotional content without added pressure. One template-cadence run: "The ghost roared... demanding... The General stared... trembling... A tremor went through..." uses parallel "[subject] [verb]..." stems across three beats. Total artifact load: −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "lost soul collector" premise is familiar, but the misaligned harp as a sonic friction tool and the crocodile tooth as a memory trigger offer specific, non-obvious inflections. The emotional turn—shame to laughter—feels earned in hindsight through the established premise (dignity as anchor, absurdity as release). The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Minor limitation: the spectral-collector frame and the "trapped by their own nature" arc are well-trodden templates; the transformation is solid but not boldly unconventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian appears in the opening, his choices (playing the harp, holding up the tooth, guiding the memory shift) drive all key turns, and he is present at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. His decision to deploy the tooth narrows options (the General must confront the memory) and his motivation to integrate laughter shapes the ending. Causal pressure is strong; the element is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crocodile tooth is introduced mid-story ("Slowly, Elian reached into his coat"), handled on-page ("held it up"), and its specific history (false evidence of wrestling a river beast, taxidermy prop exposure) is dramatized. It appears in two distinct beats: the reveal and the memory-shift moment. The tooth is causally irreplaceable—its exact history triggers the General's transformation from shame to laughter, directly shaping closure. Minor cap: late first appearance (after 40% mark) and the tooth does not appear in the opening third, limiting setup credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Spectral confessions arise immediately when Elian plays the harp ("a thousand voices whispering their sins simultaneously"), shaping atmosphere and setting stakes (the gorge is full of trapped souls). The concept is present in development (Elian ignores the cacophony to focus on his quarry) but does not directly constrain his tactics—he already knows his method. The confessions do not reappear at closure or change options in the final beat; the General's release is tied to laughter, not confession. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is labeled early ("his attribute was to be modestly fearless") and demonstrated on-page: Elian does not flinch when the General roars, his calm gaze anchors him against the spectral gale, and he faces the screaming voids with a calm demeanor. The trait enables his action (he can pursue the ghost without retreating) and is present at closure (he stands alone in the brightening mist). The cost is implicit (endurance of spectral pressure) rather than a visible trade-off, and the trait is slightly over-labeled rather than purely shown through action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Pursue" is signaled early ("his task was to pursue a specific entity"), drives the opening action (playing the harp to snag the ghost), escalates in the middle (the General roars, demanding to be left alone, and Elian persists), and shapes closure (the pursuit ends when the General is released). The action is irreplaceable; without the pursuit frame, the story has no forward pressure. Causal linkage is strong, and the element is present across all three gates with clear cost (time, focus, and the risk of spectral confrontation).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is introduced early ("a battered thing that looked more like debris"), its mechanics are explained on-page ("dissonance of these warped strings created a sonic friction that snagged on spiritual turbulence"), and Elian uses it in two beats: the initial snagging and the final "twisting note" before the tooth reveal. The method is causally irreplaceable—without the harp's dissonance, Elian cannot engage the ghost. The harp shapes tactics (he must play ugly sounds, focus on vibration) and is present in the closure sequence. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is anchored in the opening paragraph, its acoustic anomalies are integral to the harp method ("the spirit that had burrowed deep into the acoustic anomalies of the ravine"), and the gorge reacts to Elian's playing (cold, pressurized air; spectral confessions arising from the depths). The setting constrains Elian's approach (he must use the gorge's acoustics) and supplies resources (the echoing rock face amplifies the harp's dissonance). The gorge is present at closure ("the silence of the gorge no longer heavy, but peaceful"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the element shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears in the opening and "the light was struggling to breach the canyon walls" sets grey twilight. The timeframe reappears at closure ("spiraled upward toward the morning sky," "brightening mist") but does not constrain Elian's actions or create urgency—no live clock pressures his choices. The sunrise is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup and payoff gates are met, but the middle development gate is missing; the timeframe does not alter tactics or narrow options during the encounter.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation "to integrate laughter into healing" is labeled mid-story but dramatized through his choice to deploy the crocodile tooth and guide the General's memory from shame to mirth. The motivation is present in two beats: the articulation of his philosophy and the enactment at closure. It shapes the ending (the General's laughter breaks his chains) and is irreplaceable to the story's emotional logic. Minor limitation: the motivation is stated rather than shown through earlier micro-choices; we do not see Elian weighing other methods before choosing laughter.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears explicitly near closure ("a sensation of luminous ache—a poignant, glowing sadness") and is prepared by tonal modulation: the opening's "purgatorial twilight" and "old regrets," the middle's spectral confessions and roaring, and the ending's "beautiful pain" and "wound finally closing." The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image (motes of light, peaceful silence). Minor slip: the phrase "luminous ache" itself arrives late and is somewhat over-articulated; the tone is more consistently established through image (mist, light struggling, brightening) than through the label.</comment>
