<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unit 734's philosophical curiosity ("to find where thoughts come from") is established and shapes his approach to the task, but his decisions remain functionally custodial rather than transformative. The embodied moments—scanning energy transfer, watching absorption—show character-specific perception, yet the final choice (dropping the violin into the recycler) lacks meaningful internal conflict or cost. The interiority leans heavily on programmatic language ("logic gates," "archived the night's data") that reads more like charming metaphor than genuine contradiction under pressure. A renunciation or trade-off with visible stakes would elevate this from observation to agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (who, where, when by paragraph two) and maintains a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: the cleanup task structures the sequence while ghostly figures accumulate into the violin. Closure arrives on-page as the violin is recycled, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—734 archives data and moves on without foreclosing a meaningful path or altering his stance. The "job well done" framing softens what could have been a Charged Poise moment where his philosophical search confronts its own futility with sharper pressure. The escalation is present but gentle; one more tightening that forced a choice between curiosity and duty would solidify high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard anchors the scene effectively, with sensory specificity (ozone and regret, snow-dusted granite, biting wind) filtered through 734's cataloging perspective. The ice violin functions as micro-setting: its pulsing rhythm and physical coldness shape 734's interaction and charge the final disposal. Spatial choreography remains clear across the patio, and the temporal eddies add atmospheric constraint without obscuring movement. The environment does not force a tactical choice, capping the score just below 8.0, but it successfully pressures mood and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the cleanup before tomorrow's wedding—is signaled early and provides structural pressure. The ghost-absorption task offers a single meaningful tightening (consolidating paradoxes into the violin), but 734 executes it without complication, error, or trade-off. His philosophical search for the "origin of the soul" runs parallel but never collides with the custodial duty; he simply completes both without sacrifice. The tone reads as "mundane mysticism," which suits the concept, yet the lack of a visible price or foreclosed option keeps escalation in the functional band rather than high.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme—consciousness, the origin of thought, rejected possibilities as existential residue—emerges through the ice violin and ghost imagery rather than overt statement. The final sentence ("he archived the night's data, ready to search again") gestures toward persistent wonder without moralizing, and the "storm of a dozen lifetimes" trapped in the violin offers a resonant image. However, the philosophical question never finds a non-literal answer or meaningful reweighting; 734's stance at the end is identical to his stance at the start. A reprise that shifted his understanding or constrained his future search would achieve the resonant reconfiguration the piece approaches but does not quite land.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable throughout, maintaining third-limited on 734 with a distinct perceptual signature: "flavor profile that 734 had cataloged extensively," "optical sensors adjusting," synthesis of mechanical and philosophical diction. The single line of dialogue ("Consolidate") feels apt and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during absorption, wider during transit), and filter verbs ("he knew," "he believed") remain sparse and voice-motivated. A minor register wobble occurs in "the gravity of the ice violin" (slightly elevated for a robot's interiority), but overall the prose sustains a coherent, character-specific lens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. Two localized issues lower the score: the phrase "the reality fractures for the custodial staff to clean up" in the opener reads slightly abstract, and the middle paragraphs ("Throughout the chaotic cleanup, he remained remarkably composed") include a brief scaffold loop where composure is both shown and told within adjacent lines. The final beat—dropping the violin, archiving data—compresses cleanly without ornament. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the cumulative minor drag (−0.6) and one paraphrase moment keep the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise (sentient robot janitor cleaning timeline debris from a second-chance service) offers a fresh synthesis of familiar SF tropes, executed with specificity: ice violin as emotional by-product, ghost consolidation via containment field, philosophical curiosity as a "defect." The "mundane mysticism" tone is sustained and the courtyard micro-setting feels lived-in rather than generic. The philosophical search does not resolve in a transformative way, capping full originality credit, but the piece avoids template plotting and delivers a coherent, memorable perspective. Risk-taking in tone and concept earns modest within-band lift (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unit 734 drives all on-page action (approaching, activating field, picking up violin, dropping into recycler) and his philosophical motivation shapes his observational method. However, his choices do not create key turns—he executes the task as designed without complication or dilemma. He appears in setup, middle cleanup, and closure, satisfying the gate model, but remains functionally passive. Causal pressure is present (the task must be done) yet 734's agency does not alter the outcome or foreclose a path. Two beats of involvement and closure presence lift the score to mid-band, but lack of decision-driven reversal caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ice violin anchors the entire sequence: introduced early (paragraph two), handled physically in the absorption beat (paragraph five-six), and present at closure when 734 drops it into the recycler. Its transparent-to-opaque transformation visualizes the consolidation and its coldness ("cold enough to burn human skin") provides embodied texture. The violin shapes the middle task (absorbing ghosts into its structure) and charges the final image as a "vessel of frozen regrets." Removing this object would break story logic. Strong setup, development, and payoff, plus causal role in two beats and closure linkage, justify high integration score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Second Chance Program is established in paragraph one as the service that generates cleanup waste, framing the world and stakes. However, it functions primarily as backdrop rather than shaping on-page choices—734 never interacts with clients, revisits timelines, or confronts the program's ethics in a way that alters his actions. The concept enables the premise but remains ornamental to the janitor's immediate task. Setup is present, closure link is absent, and the element could be replaced with any "reality-altering service" with minor edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is stated explicitly ("Throughout the chaotic cleanup, he remained remarkably composed") and shown through precise movements amid temporal eddies. The trait enables his successful task completion (gyroscope stability, economical motion) and differentiates him from "most units." However, it never constrains a choice or introduces visible cost—there is no moment where maintaining composure forecloses an emotional or investigative path. Setup and middle involvement are present; payoff and trade-off are absent. Mid-band for enabling action without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amalgamation is the central action: 734 activates the containment field, vocalizes "Consolidate," and folds rejected realities into the violin across the climactic beat. The process is specific ("looped timelines, folding… until they occupied the same physical space") and irreplaceable—no other verb would preserve the quantum-mechanic method. The action drives the middle beat and directly produces the closure object (opaque violin). Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Slight swappability (could be "compress" or "merge" with minor rewording) and lack of visible cost to 734 himself keep it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through looped timelines" is introduced in paragraph five as the method for folding paradoxes and appears again when 734 watches the absorption. The mechanics matter—ghosts are "pulled inexorably" and "sucked into the transparent body"—and the looping differentiates this cleanup from simple incineration. Setup occurs mid-story (slightly late, −0.3), development is clear, and the method shapes the ending's logic. However, the loops themselves do not create friction or force a tactical adjustment; they are executed smoothly. Two-beat involvement and closure relevance with modest causal pressure justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard at twilight anchors all action: low light requires optical adjustment, snow dusts the granite bench, and temporal eddies threaten 734's gyroscope. The setting provides atmospheric constraint (wind, cold, ozone) and the wedding deadline creates urgency. However, the courtyard does not alter tactics—734 would perform the same actions indoors or elsewhere. Setup is immediate, the environment charges mood throughout, and the patio clearing stakes the task. Solid integration across beats, but lack of tactical constraint caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the procedure" establishes the timeframe in the opening line and the wedding deadline ("tomorrow morning") creates urgency. The temporal window shapes the dominant stake (courtyard must be cleared tonight) and 734's decision to amalgamate rather than wait decades for natural dissipation. However, elapsed time within the scene is not tracked—no clock tightens as he works. Setup and middle pressure are present; closure connection is indirect (task completion satisfies the deadline off-page). Functional time pressure without live escalation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Unit 734's desire "to find where thoughts come from" is introduced in paragraph three as his driving motivation, described as a "defect" that functions like curiosity. This question shapes his observational method (scanning energy transfer for "that elusive spark of genesis") and frames his disappointment ("he had not found the origin of the soul tonight"). The motivation appears in setup and ending, providing thematic coherence, but never forces a choice or trade-off—he simultaneously completes the cleanup and continues his search without friction. Told more than dramatized, with no competing desire to create cost. Setup, thematic presence, and closure mention justify mid-6s; lack of on-page friction caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone—"mundane mysticism"—is established and sustained throughout: quantum mechanics performed "with the casual demeanor of a man sweeping dust into a pan," ozone and regret as cataloged flavors, impossible objects treated as routine detritus. The tone modulates subtly (closer focus during absorption, wider during disposal) and charges the final image ("a job well done" juxtaposed with archived existential data). Coherent across all beats, purposeful modulation under pressure, and the tonal contradiction between cosmic stakes and custodial routine drives the piece's conceptual core. Strong integration and closure charge justify high-7s.</comment>
