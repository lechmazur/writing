<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior life is vivid and consistently filtered through his craft (dye master perspective on light/color/structure). The donor-heart premise drives his quest but the emotional contradiction—wild animal versus instrument of understanding—doesn't generate visible micro-choices under pressure; the climax relies on intellectual realization rather than embodied struggle. The final insight about being a prism is articulated clearly but lacks the visceral cost or competing impulse that would push this into high bands. Backstory (six months, donor adventurer) is economical and anchors present stakes without flattening momentum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/when in opening lines). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, tracking rituals, and the precisely timed experiment; the closure reweights the central question (magnetism as geometry/attention) via the successful dye and the world-leaning-in image. Cost is conceptual and perceptual (understanding achieved, paradigm shift) rather than decisive action or visible loss, which is acceptable under this lens but keeps the score from the highest band. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wing submerges and the reaction confirms his theory, reframing all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating tea house, sun-angle geometry, chalk lines on tatami, and the morpho wing's structural color all ground the experiment in tactile specificity. The setting constrains Elian's method (altitude, rotation, light timing) and the final image—mist parting to reveal the valley—charges the closure by externalizing his success. Sensory hierarchy reflects dye-master priorities (light quality, refractive index, color mechanism). The body and tools (tweezers, crystal bowl, solvent) are handled concretely across beats, elevating this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: learn why some magnetize stories, operationalized as capturing structural color in liquid form. Pressure tightens through the sun-tracking ritual and narrows to the precise instant of submersion. The experiment's success—pulse of cyan pressure, liquid blooming blue—delivers a visible result but the guild's skepticism and Elian's personal risk (failure = gray dust, wasted six months) remain abstract. The heart-as-prism realization reconfigures understanding but doesn't foreclose a prior option with on-page cost, keeping escalation and felt consequence in the solid mid-range under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (refract light vs. absorb it; magnetism as geometry/attention) emerges organically from the morpho wing's structural color, the donor heart's syncopated rhythm, and Elian's iridescent caution. The final line—"to live a life worthy of a story, one must be willing to refract the light rather than simply absorb it"—ventures close to explicit thesis but is grounded in the preceding experiment and image (world leaning in). The donor-adventurer contrast and the wing's non-pigment hue create layered subtext. However, the ending risks mild theme-statement rather than letting the cyan bloom and valley reveal carry full resonant weight without guidance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Elian's dye-master lexicon (iridescent caution, refractive index, structural color) consistent throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during interiority ("wild animal trapped in a cage of bone"), pulled back for ritual description. Diction under peak pressure (sharp exhale, syncopated rhythm, quietly explosive) stays controlled and voice-specific. No dialogue; the piece relies on filtered perception and technical vocabulary that fits the character's expertise. Perceptual signature is distinct—light, angle, structure dominate every observation—and rhythmic control holds through the climax without slipping into generic lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with high information density and purposeful figurative language (syncopated rhythm, iridescent caution, cyan pressure). Minor template cadence appears in mid-story descriptive beats ("He checked…," "He picked up…," "He realized…") but doesn't obscure causality. One paraphrase loop: "reaction was immediate and quietly explosive" followed by "sudden, expanding pulse" restates effect without adding new information, costing −0.2. The opening and closing images are strong; sentence variety supports rhythm. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; technical terms (refractive index, morpho wing ridges) read accurate and integrated. Overall propulsion is solid but the scaffold repetition and one synonym cycle keep this from the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—transplanted adventurer's heart teaching charisma via dye chemistry—offers a fresh synthesis of organ-donor trope and artisan craft. The morpho wing's structural (non-pigment) color as metaphor for magnetism is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (lonely craftsman seeks understanding → achieves breakthrough) follows a familiar template, and the donor-heart backstory functions more as atmospheric setup than a transformed exploration of identity/body horror. The sun-tracking ritual and iridescent-caution concept add ingenuity. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyrical register but doesn't destabilize reader expectation or force moral ambiguity, keeping originality in the solid mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Watchful dye master: present from the opening and drives the experiment across setup (tracking sun trails), execution (submerging the wing at the calculated moment), and closure (realizing prism insight). His observation shapes all beats and the final choice to proceed at the precise instant alters the outcome. However, "watchful" as a trait mostly colors perception rather than constraining a key decision with visible cost, limiting the score despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing: introduced early (paragraph 9), handled in two distinct beats (examination of ridges, submersion into solvent), and its structural-color property is causally essential—the experiment succeeds because of the wing's refractive mechanism. The wing's crumbling-to-dust alternative stakes the climax. Its meaning is reweighted at closure (from specimen to proof of concept). Slightly below indispensable because a different structurally iridescent object could theoretically substitute, but near-essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Iridescent caution: introduced explicitly mid-story ("mindset where he remained hyper-aware that his reality could shift…depending on the angle") and retrospectively applied to the donor adventurer. It frames Elian's experimental approach and recurs in the final insight about adjusting angle to catch brilliant light. Shapes one key turn (the decision to wait for precise alignment) but the concept is more thematic gloss than on-page constraint that narrows options with visible friction. Functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Quietly explosive: appears twice—once as description of the attribute itself ("reaction was immediate and quietly explosive") and once implicitly in the cyan pressure pulse that makes lanterns sway without sound. The trait enables the climactic transformation and distinguishes this reaction from a loud/violent one, affecting tone and sensory texture. However, it doesn't constrain a prior choice or generate visible cost; it characterizes the result rather than shaping protagonist tactics. Mid-range for functional presence at closure without strategic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Illuminate: the experiment's success depends on illuminating the wing's microscopic ridges "at the precise instant it touched the solvent." This action is set up via sun-tracking preparation, executed on-page ("The light hit the mark… Elian submerged the wing"), and directly triggers the cyan bloom. The verb "illuminate" itself is slightly generic (could substitute "expose to light"), but the specific mechanics (angle, timing, refractive index) make this action causally irreplaceable at the climax. Essential across setup and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>By tracking sun trails: introduced early (chalk lines on floorboards, "tracking sun trails across the tatami mats over the past week"), shapes middle preparation (calculating the exact moment), and proves decisive at climax (waiting for the beam to hit the mark). The method is specific, signaled, and causally necessary—without this multi-day tracking ritual the experiment could not succeed. The mechanics matter and constrain Elian's approach. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost (week of patient observation).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house: anchors setting from the opening, provides the altitude and rotation essential to sun-angle calculations, and supplies spatial constraints (open veranda, tatami mats, paper lanterns that sway during the reaction). The floating/drifting quality mirrors thematic drift and isolation. At closure, the mist parts to reveal the valley, externalizing success. The tea house's specific properties (altitude, mobility) enable the experiment but a stationary high-altitude structure could substitute with minor edits, keeping this below indispensable despite strong atmospheric presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>After receiving the donor heart: timeframe anchors backstory ("six months since the surgery") and motivates the quest (new heart = wild animal, donor's charisma a mystery to solve). It recurs in the closure insight (adventurer's heart as prism). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten present decisions—Elian's experiment unfolds over one ritual moment, and the six-month gap is static context rather than a live clock pressuring choices. Functional setup with thematic payoff but no tactical constraint on-page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>To learn why some people magnetize stories: explicitly stated as Elian's purpose ("came to this secluded altitude for a specific purpose: to learn why…"). The motivation drives the experiment (dye as proxy for charisma capture) and is answered at closure (magnetism = geometry/attention, being a prism). However, the desire is more intellectual quest than visceral need with competing costs; the story tells us this is his goal but doesn't dramatize friction between wanting the answer and fearing what it costs. Solid causal role but lacks embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder: established immediately (thick white vapor, muffled hush, shifting fog) and sustained through descriptive texture (piercing white light, cloud banks, swirling mist). Tone modulates with pressure—calm observation during setup, heightened focus at the climax (cyan pressure, lanterns sway), wonder crystallized when the mist parts to reveal the valley floor. The tone charges the final image and coheres across turns without static repetition. Strong atmospheric control that integrates with closure, nearing essential but not quite indispensable.</comment>
