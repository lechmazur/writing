<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn through his habitual desperation and the specific skill of reading dust, avoiding therapy-speak even under pressure. His choice to add the addendum is motivated by twenty years of witnessing neglect, and the micro-choice to preserve the dust shows a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present—reverence for records versus the impulse to editorialize—but the final action (writing the addendum) feels slightly inevitable rather than conflicted in the moment, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate: who (Elias), where (file room basement), and when (three weeks post-emancipation). The piece reads as accumulative/textural: dust patterns accumulate evidence, the button materializes the hypothesis, and the addendum reweights the file's meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Conceptual Repricing)—Elias salvages a "luminous truth" and the cost is conceptual (the boy's only inheritance is debris-born hope). One tightening occurs when the button transforms abstract dust into proof of love. Lens holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The file room and dust landscape are vivid and purposeful; the "chronological stratigraphy" of sediment is specific and POV-filtered through Elias's archival expertise. The micro-setting (dust on cardboard) constrains his method and charges the final image—he presses the file shut "to preserve the dust." The button, envelope, and oilcloth function as tactile anchors that alter his understanding and enable the addendum. Sensory detail is selective and professional-priority-driven, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: prove the child was not discarded. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button and dust confirm a hidden visitation, narrowing Elias's interpretation from bureaucratic neglect to covert love. The final choice (write the addendum) is protagonist-driven and forecloses a path—he commits evidence to the record with "tactfully hopeful" phrasing, accepting the risk of hypothesis over certainty. Cost is felt (offering "the only inheritance the boy had"), but the decision lacks visible friction or trade-off in the moment, keeping it shy of 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of invisible histories and the salvage of small kindnesses emerges from the dust patterns and button rather than assertion. The final addendum is a "hypothesis of love constructed from debris," answering the thematic question (can bureaucracy hold human connection?) through the button as non-literal proof. The word "Wait" reweights the abandonment narrative without moralizing. Minor slip: "singular, luminous truth" edges toward abstraction, but the button and dust anchor the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and professional-specific; Elias's perceptual signature (reading "silence between the facts through accumulated dust patterns") is distinct and maintained. Diction matches his archival expertise without register drift. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates well under pressure—careful in the dust reading, then trembling at the button. One minor slip: "he felt the familiar ache in his chest soften slightly" is filter-heavy and slightly generic for an emotional peak, nudging below 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, method, and character together. However, several ornamental phrases slow momentum: "navigated the narrow canyons of corrugated cardboard" and "spirit eroded by the relentless friction of documented tragedy against cold paper" are figurative but not propulsive. The phrase "accumulated dust patterns" repeats across paragraphs without variation. The final beat is clean, so non-closure deductions are capped at −0.4, but the decorative openings and one loop keep this mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist-as-detective premise using dust forensics is fresh and the button-as-promise is a non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of bureaucratic file into covert love token is earned. However, the emotional arc (broken-hearted archivist finds proof of love) follows a familiar redemptive template without significant risk or moral ambiguity. The specificity of the dust method and the war-era button prevent derivative scoring, but the setup lacks bold subversion.</comment>
