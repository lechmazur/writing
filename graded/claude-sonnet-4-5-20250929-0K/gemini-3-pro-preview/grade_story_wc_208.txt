<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is signaled clearly—she wants to "scaffold complexity with simplicity"—and her decision to use the lantern slide and sculpture to project a phantom map demonstrates agency under pressure. Internal experience is somewhat embodied (the "turbine-hum reverie," rain streaming down goggles), but interiority leans toward conceptual summary ("timewoven alliances," "layered meanings") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final action is earned by prior setup, but the character reads more as a vehicle for the concept than as a mind wrestling with genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening archway image and quickly establishes the stake: a freighter drifting toward the Razor Rocks. The closure is on-page and causal—Elara's projection guides the ship to safety—with visible cost in her physical effort and adrenaline expenditure. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative coloring (the sculpture's transformation, the layered interpretation of the slide). One meaningful tightening occurs when she rigs the arc lamp and the ship begins to turn. The ending recedes into reverie rather than charging the final image with unmistakable pressure, which softens the closure slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway and its magnetic generator are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the scene spatially and sensorially (wind, spray, turbine throb). The driftwood sculpture and iron grating constrain Elara's physical actions, and the environment (sea spray, rain) serves as the projection medium. Sensory detail is filtered through POV and supports urgency. The setting does not evolve causally within the scene—it remains static backdrop once established—which limits the highest band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the freighter—is clear early and drives all action. Pressure tightens when Elara receives the distress call and escalates as she drags the sculpture into the gale, rigs the lamp, and projects the map. The ship's turn is a visible reversal earned by her choices. One meaningful cost is legible: physical effort, adrenaline, and the risk of being "sucked out into the void." The resolution feels somewhat convenient—the projection works perfectly on first try—which slightly undercuts the felt price of the gambit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of "timewoven alliances" and bridging past and present emerges through action (using the antique slide to guide the modern ship), but the concept is also stated overtly ("This object was the key…timewoven alliances. She was forging a pact…"). The final image of leaning back into reverie offers a quiet close but does not reweight prior material with new ambiguity or cost—it restores equilibrium rather than charging the question. The piece resists overt moralizing yet leans toward illustration of premise rather than emergent complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual texture: "turbine-hum reverie," "the alphabet of a new language," "phantom map." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spirited driftwood sculptor," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") that reads more authorial than character-organic. Psychic distance is controlled, and narrative stance remains consistent. The prose rhythm modulates with action (short sentences during the rigging, longer ones in reflection), supporting pressure without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops in the opening third ("the dominant sound was…Its ceaseless rotation induced…This trance was…") restate the reverie concept across adjacent lines, and some figurative language stacks without earning its keep ("terrifyingly complex variables," "singular, elemental truth"). The climax beat—projecting the map—is clear and propulsive. Proofreading is clean, and no causality-breaking artifacts appear, but synonym churn around "complexity/simplicity" and conceptual labels slightly dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—using a 19th-century magic lantern slide to guide a ship through a magnetic storm—is fresh and specific, avoiding template plotting. The synthesis of driftwood sculpture, antique glass, and modern arc lamp feels organic to Elara's character and the post-GPS world. Risk-taking is present in the unconventional solution and the accumulative tone. The execution avoids stock turns, though the successful projection on first attempt and the return to reverie at the end trend toward satisfaction rather than sustained ambiguity, lowering the ingenuity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is established early as a driftwood sculptor and her decision to repurpose her sculpture into a projection device drives the climax. She appears in the opening, middle rigging sequence, and ending, satisfying setup/development/payoff. The character's occupation and philosophy shape the solution (using art as tool, interpreting layered meanings), demonstrating causal pressure and specificity. The attribute "spirited" is label-only and does not constrain choice, and her internal conflict is minimal, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is introduced in the second paragraph conceptually, retrieved from the velvet-lined box mid-scene, and then mounted into the sculpture's chest to project the harbor map at the climax. It participates in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and its unique properties—hand-painted harbor entrance from 200 years ago—are indispensable to the closure. The object is handled on the page twice (held up to light, rigged into the sculpture) and its meaning reweights from artifact to beacon. Cost is tied to it: without this exact slide, the projection would not work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is named explicitly mid-scene ("the key to the core concept of her survival philosophy") and shapes the solution—bridging the dead cartographer and the living captain via the antique slide. It appears in setup (workshop filled with survival testaments), development (interpreting the slide through layered meanings), and payoff (the alliance holds). However, the concept is told more than dramatized; it functions as a thematic label rather than a constraint that narrows options under pressure. Swapping it for "using old knowledge" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is mentioned early ("perpetually learning from the ocean, studying how the violent tides…") but remains a character trait asserted in exposition rather than enacted with visible cost. Elara's actions—repurposing the sculpture, interpreting the slide—could plausibly arise without this attribute. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic that another approach could not; it colors backstory but does not press the present. Missing middle development and closure participation; setup only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reimagine" is the hinge action: Elara transforms her sculpture "from a static representation of nature's wrath into a dynamic tool for salvation." This occurs mid-scene and drives the climax. The action is setup (she turns to her largest piece), developed (dragging, wedging, arranging branches as shutters), and pays off (the projection guides the ship). Removing "reimagine" and substituting "uses" would not break the plot, but the transformation from art to tool is thematically charged and causally central, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is signaled when Elara "interpret[s] the image through layered meanings" (physical, historical, symbolic). The method shapes her decision to use the slide and justifies the projection's success. It appears in setup (the interpretation), development (rigging the slide into the sculpture), and payoff (the ghostly map guides the ship). However, the mechanics are told rather than enacted—she names the layers but does not show how interpreting them changes her tactics. Swappable with "careful interpretation" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is introduced in the opening line, houses Elara's workshop (abutment), and provides the stage for the climax. Its magnetic generator creates the "turbine-hum reverie" framing device, and the iron grating wedges the sculpture base. The archway's shelter allows the projection while the gale threatens to suck her out, creating spatial pressure. It participates in all three gates and its specific properties (hollow abutment, grating, exposed lip) constrain her actions and enable the solution. Removing this setting would require fundamental rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" is established early as the era's defining constraint ("the time after the GPS fails…digital constellations had gone dark years ago") and motivates the freighter's peril (fried navigation computers, magnetic squalls). It appears in setup and pressures the middle action (the ship cannot self-navigate), but does not tighten the clock during the climax—Elara has no countdown, and the freighter's drift unfolds at an unspecified pace. The timeframe justifies the problem but does not shape moment-to-moment tactics, landing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to scaffold complexity with simplicity" is named explicitly ("Elara knew her motivation was to scaffold complexity with simplicity") and the text tells us she wants to "resolve [complex variables] with a singular, elemental truth." Her action—projecting a simple image to solve a complex navigation failure—enacts this desire. The motivation shapes the solution's nature but is not dramatized as a conflicted choice with visible cost; it reads more as a guiding philosophy than a friction-generating want. Present in all three gates but more told than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" brackets the story (opening paragraphs and final line) and recurs mid-scene ("the vibration intensifying her focused state"). The tone modulates under pressure—shortening sentences during the rigging, lengthening during reflection—and the return to reverie at the end reweights the opening trance with earned calm after exertion. The reverie functions as a perceptual anchor and charges the final image ("sinking back into her turbine-hum reverie, listening to the song of the machine"), demonstrating coherent tonal control tied to the dominant stake.</comment>
