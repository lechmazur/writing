<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "metabolize" stored remorse is established, and the action of placing coral on her tongue demonstrates agency. However, interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("culinarian of the psyche," "chef who can taste memories") rather than concrete embodied thought. The climactic moment—chewing and swallowing the coral—shows contradictory impulses (resolve versus physical pain) but the internal experience leans abstract ("blizzard of silent screams," "icy spike of guilt") rather than character-particular sensation. The transformation from brittleness to warmth reads more as thematic declaration than earned psychological shift with visible behavioral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear causal spine: storm reveals water pooling → analysis locates pavilion → excavation → physical contact → ingestion → atmospheric release. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fortress "no longer aching," ready for sun) with felt cost visible in Elara's "shuddering breath" and the neutralized coral. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the final image reweights the opening's "suspended history" into "melancholic" rather than "piercing." One Orientation Test concern: "at the close of an unspoken dream" and the boundary metaphor in paragraph one create brief disorientation, but spatial anchors (courtyard, three feet down) clarify by the second beat, so penalty is waived. Cost proof: the "shuddering breath" and prior "nearly knocked the wind out of her" make suffering legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress, wet stones, and courtyard are anchored early. The coral pavilion's "frost-rimmed eaves" and subterranean chill create vivid, purposeful sensory constraint—Elara's gloveless touch transmits despair, shaping her choice to proceed. The tidal-pool formations function as micro-setting that guides discovery. However, spatial choreography of the excavation (spade work, bowl placement, exact body position during ingestion) remains vague, and the "false tide" metaphor, while striking, doesn't fully ground how water behaves in sand. The final image—fortress standing silent under drying sun—charges closure but lacks one concrete environmental detail to anchor the atmospheric shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: neutralize the fortress's frozen remorse. Escalation proceeds through increasing physical and emotional cost—touch transmits despair, ingestion threatens to "freeze her blood" and "shatter" her spirit. The choice to place coral on her tongue is genuine agency with visible risk; her internal "warmth" must actively metabolize the toxicity, and the text shows struggle ("agonizing culinary act"). The resolution is earned: the coral "dulled in color, its malignant power spent," and the fortress atmosphere lifts. One persistent constraint (the contagious touch, the need to self-transmute rather than apply fire) shapes tactics throughout. Cost is legible: pain, near-collapse, and the "shuddering breath" that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—processing collective guilt through personal sacrifice—emerges from action rather than statement until the final summary ("smoothed the edges of the haunting"). The coral-as-remorse and Elara-as-alchemist structure is coherent and the closing image of melancholic wisdom versus piercing pain offers non-literal thematic payoff. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("sandpaper rough memories, smoothing the jagged edges") that edges toward overt thesis, and "metabolize its poison" / "dissolving the sharp crystals of the past into a palatable broth of wisdom" in the climax reads slightly didactic. The final paragraph's "she had smoothed the edges" and "ready to face the drying sun" narrate the thematic answer rather than fully trusting the image to carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a heightened, metaphor-dense register ("culinarian of the psyche," "pantry of the past") that maintains consistency but risks drifting above grounded interiority—Elara's perceptual signature is filtered through authorial lyricism rather than her own idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("she knew," "she began") are frequent. The prose's diction ("subsume the essence," "calcified reefs") reads more literary than character-particular, and under peak stress (the ingestion beat) the metaphorical density ("blizzard of silent screams," "icy spike of guilt") remains elevated rather than compressing into sharper, body-driven syntax. No dialogue present to judge. The narration is legible and purposeful but lacks a strong perceptual signature that distinguishes Elara's way of noticing from the authorial frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "shipwreck stranded on a mountaintop," "culinarian of the psyche," "pantry of the past," "blizzard of silent screams" all within ~600 words). Several metaphors lean abstract or mixed: "false tide," "thermal anomalies hiding beneath sand" (thermal reads odd for cold), "chewed slowly, breaking down the structure of the regret" (physical chewing of emotional construct). Template cadence appears in opening: "She was a chef... She did not come... Her eyes scanned..." Paraphrase loop: paragraphs three and four both establish that the pavilion houses frozen guilt. Clarity remains mostly intact, but overwriting in peak beats (the ingestion sequence) reduces propulsion. No major grammar errors; prose is polished but not economical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of chef-as-psychic-alchemist, coral pavilion, and literal ingestion of frozen remorse is imaginative and specific. The piece commits fully to its metaphor-made-literal premise and follows through without retreat. However, the core structure—lone specialist enters dangerous site, retrieves toxic artifact, processes it through personal sacrifice to heal a place—is a widely used template. Transformation is present in the culinary and sensory specificity (taste, chewing, metabolizing), and the coral-as-reef-of-guilt is fresh, but the emotional arc and plot beats feel familiar. The "close of an unspoken dream" frame is intriguing but underused. Risk-taking in metaphor density is bold, though it sometimes obscures rather than sharpens. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for commitment to the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character present from opening; drives all key turns (analyzing pools, digging, touching coral, ingesting shard). The ability to "taste memories" shapes her method and the climax hinges on her unique skill to "metabolize" remorse. Setup clear, middle and closure beats depend on this trait. Cost visible (pain, near-collapse). Swappability: another empathic specialist could replace with moderate edits, but the culinary framing is specific. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4, irreplaceability +0.5 = baseline 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0; −0.4 for modest swappability, −0.4 for trait partially label-driven rather than fully embodied across all beats = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Object discovered midpoint (three feet down), handled in contact beat (touch transmits despair), fragment chipped into bowl and ingested. Returns in closure: "coral in the pit dulled in color." Setup at ~40%, middle use (two distinct beats: touch and ingestion), closure state change. Causal: enables the central conflict and resolution. Irreplaceable: the coral's frozen-reef structure is tied to stored remorse thematically and mechanically. Score: setup +0.4 (midpoint), two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = baseline 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7; late first appearance (~40%) −0.3 = 7.4, but strong causal work and closure payoff elevate within band +0.4 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Concept introduced paragraph three ("stored remorse"), shapes Elara's goal and the pavilion's function. Middle: the contagious despair forces her method choice (self-transmutation). Closure: remorse is neutralized, oppressive weight lifts. The concept is the story's engine—remove it and plot collapses. Setup by first third, drives two beats (discovery/contact, ingestion/resolution), charges closure image. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5 = baseline 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6; −0.8 for being somewhat abstract/thematic rather than a concrete constraint with visible mechanics on every beat (the "how" of storage and metabolization is metaphorical), −0.9 summary penalty (the final paragraph tells theme rather than showing mechanics) = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Attribute established paragraph four: touch transmits "shockwave of weeping despair," nearly knocking wind out of Elara. This contagion constrains her choice—she cannot simply dig and transport; she must ingest and self-transmute. Setup clear, middle choice shaped by this trait, closure depends on her absorbing the toxicity. Cost visible (pain, risk of shattering). Score: early signal (first third) +0.6, two beats (touch, ingestion aftermath) +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = baseline 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9; −0.3 for modest label-only summary in setup ("emotionally contagious through touch" is told, though dramatized immediately) = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Action occurs in climax paragraph: Elara places coral shard on tongue, chews, swallows. This beat is the story's turning point—without it, no resolution. Setup (the need to "subsume"), middle culmination (the act itself), closure (atmospheric release follows directly). Irreplaceable: no other action could achieve the goal given established rules. Score: setup +0.5, climax beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.6 (the act is the mechanism of change), closure linkage +1.8, cost +0.6, irreplaceability +0.8 = baseline 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7; −0.6 for being enacted in one paragraph without prior failed attempts or visible tactical adjustment across beats (the action is described rather than unfolding with micro-choices) = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Method introduced paragraph two: Elara analyzes "tidal pool formations" and "thermal anomalies" to locate the pavilion. This beats drives discovery but its mechanics are vague—"swirled in tight, frigid spirals, drawn by a cold magnet" is evocative but not procedural. The method appears once, succeeds immediately, and does not shape later tactics. Setup present, one beat (discovery), no middle constraint or closure reprise. Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6 (enables the find), specificity +0.3 = baseline 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8; +0.5 for early signal and necessity to plot, +0.5 for thematic coherence (false tide / hydrography) = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting established opening: desert fortress, rain aftermath, wet stones, courtyard. The storm and pooled water enable the discovery (tidal analysis), and the pavilion is subterranean. Closure image: "fortress stood silent... ready to face the drying sun." Setup clear, middle use (water pools guide dig), closure state change (atmospheric lift). The fortress itself is more atmospheric container than active constraint—remove the desert and substitute another remote site, the beats hold. Score: setup +0.6, two touches (discovery, closure image) +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4 = baseline 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4; +0.5 for rain/water enabling the find (purposeful), +0.5 for closure image reweighting (silent, ready for sun) = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Timeframe mentioned opening sentence ("at the close of an unspoken dream") but never operationalized. No clock, no urgency tied to time, no decision shaped by temporal constraint. The phrase is metaphorical/atmospheric rather than a functional story element. Present in setup as ornament, absent in middle and closure. Score: baseline 3.0, setup mention +0.2, no beat involvement, no causal pressure, no closure linkage, ornamental −0.8, swappable −0.3 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation stated paragraph four: "to sandpaper rough memories, smoothing the jagged edges of history until they could be handled without drawing blood." This desire drives her choice to dig, touch, and ingest despite risk. Setup clear, middle action (the ingestion) enacts the motive, closure achieves it ("she had smoothed the edges"). Cost visible (pain, endurance). The motivation is somewhat abstract and told rather than shown through conflicting wants, but it coheres across all beats. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (dig/touch, ingest) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5, specificity +0.4 = baseline 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9; no deduction for abstraction since the cost is embodied and the goal is pursued with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone cued opening: "boots crunching with a sturdy brittle cadence." The juxtaposition of sturdy/brittle recurs implicitly (Elara's resolve vs. the threat of shattering, warm metabolization vs. icy coral). Tone is consistent—elevated, metaphor-dense, somber—and modulates with pressure (the ingestion beat intensifies to "blizzard," then "shuddering breath"). However, "sturdy brittle" as a two-word phrase does not explicitly return or charge the final image; the tonal effect is present but not foregrounded. Score: setup +0.4, coherence across beats +0.5, modulation under pressure +0.6, closure linkage (implicit in final breath/exhale) +0.5, specificity +0.3 = baseline 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3; +0.3 for implicit recurrence (resolve vs. fragility tension) = 5.6.</comment>
