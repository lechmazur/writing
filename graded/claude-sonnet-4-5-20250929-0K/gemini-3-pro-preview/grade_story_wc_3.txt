<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent: understand the physics of transition via linguistic metaphor. The character demonstrates embodied grief through methodical action—brushing soil with the same patience as ancient tablets—and makes genuine choices under pressure (planting the seed to stabilize the station). Internal contradiction surfaces when he both mourns and seeks comprehension, with the final choice to merge Aris into the arbor foreclosing personal recovery in favor of shared continuity. Minor slip: the "touching distance" final moment reads slightly abstract rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (Elian, translator, Magnetic Arbor, after Aris's death). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: linguistic metaphor patterns deepen pressure as the station decays, and the closure—planting the seed to "translate" Aris into the arbor—lands with visible cost (permanent separation reframed as dialect shift). One meaningful tightening occurs when the containment field flickers and Elian acts. The cost is legible: Elian accepts "forever just beyond the reach of his physical hand," a renunciation that forecloses bodily reunion. Charged Poise qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Magnetic Arbor constrains choice throughout: decaying orbit forces Elian to act, iron-rich soil and metallic roots enable the planting, and the weeping iron-willows signal stabilization. Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone and old paper scent at closure—and the arbor's pulse "mimicking a human heart" charges the final image. Micro-setting (the seed cradle, the soil bed) directly shapes the climactic action. All details are filtered through Elian's linguistic POV, with no tourist-catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: stabilize the drifting station while processing Aris's death. Pressure escalates via the flickering containment field and lurching gravity, forcing Elian's decision to plant the seed. Agency is embodied in the methodical planting action, which forecloses personal retrieval of Aris in favor of systemic integration. The cost—"touching distance, close enough to brush against his soul, yet forever just beyond the reach of his physical hand"—is legible and felt. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: translation as transformation, loss reframed as re-contextualization. The Knowledge fruit seed and linguistic metaphors (verb/subject, inscription/tablet) constrain the final choice organically. The ending image—pulse in the tree, warmth, touching distance—offers a resonant answer to "the physics of transition" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: Elian's tenderness "bridging the gap between engineering and burial" carries the paradox of intimacy and separation. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the peak beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV control is stable throughout; Elian's perceptual signature (cuneiform metaphors, grammatical analogies) remains consistent and character-specific. Distance is precise: "The verb must agree with the subject" is natural interiority for a translator under pressure. Diction stays within POV lexicon (syntax, stylus, dialect) with no register drift. One brief dialogue line ("The verb must agree with the subject") reads as whispered self-guidance, not exposition. Narrative modesty holds: inference reads as inference. The piece teaches its metaphoric pattern early and pays it off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances Elian's grief-work or the station's crisis. Rhythm modulates well: longer sentences in reflective beats, shorter in the activation sequence. Minor overwriting in paragraph one: "the physics of transition that had whisked his partner away" could be tighter, and "haunted ambitions" + "ghost of a fear" stacks metaphoric language without full integration. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative coherence mostly holds, though "heavy and cold" seed then "dense gravity of information" risks mild redundancy. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—translator solves tech crisis via linguistic metaphor—offers a fresh synthesis of grief narrative and speculative engineering. The magnetic arbor, bio-crystalline storage, and verb-as-anchor conceit read specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (methodical mourning, the tenderness that "bridged the gap between engineering and burial") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the extended linguistic metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction: "haunted ambitions" and "ghost of a fear" echo each other in quick succession, a minor proximity slip that doesn't fully transform the motif.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cuneiform translator shapes Elian's perceptual lens from the start (brushing sand from tablets, stylus into clay) and drives the key turn: visualizing the problem as translation error enables the planting solution. Present across all three gates: setup (paragraph one), development (linguistic visualization in paragraph three), payoff (final image of pulse and dialect shift). Choices are causally active; the trait is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed appears in paragraph two (picked up, felt), paragraph three (planted with tenderness), and paragraph four (sprout of light, pulse in tree). Each beat advances pressure: initial terror at its "silent weight," then active planting to anchor syntax, finally holographic growth that stabilizes the arbor. Charged at closure: Aris re-contextualized into the seed's output. Removing it collapses story logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Haunted ambitions appear in paragraph two ("driven by a ghost of a fear") and paragraph four ("grounded, growing into something sustainable"). The concept shapes Aris's backstory motivation and reweights at closure (madness → shared stability), but does not directly constrain Elian's on-page choices. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Solid lyric reprise with felt cost, but swappable with "obsessive drive" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kindly methodical appears in paragraph two ("movements kindly methodical") and paragraph three ("motion rhythmic and precise," "care of a scribe"). The trait enables the successful planting under pressure; hasty action would fail. Visible tradeoff: methodical patience accepts the station's drift risk while Elian works. Present across setup, development, and payoff; constrains action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reestablish drives the entire narrative arc: station decaying (paragraph two), Elian must "reestablish the circuit Aris had left broken," planting to restore syntax (paragraph three), stabilization achieved (paragraph four). All major turns trace to this action. Removing "reestablish" and substituting "escape" or "mourn" would require full rewrite. Present in all three gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Analogical thinking is signaled in paragraph one ("solved problems through analogical thinking, equating energy states with verb tenses") and paragraph three ("visualized the problem not as a failure of voltage, but as a translation error"). The method shapes the planting tactic: "The verb must agree with the subject" translates into physical action. Mechanics matter on the page; the analogy enables the solution. Present across all three gates with direct causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic Arbor supplies immediate pressure: decaying orbit forces action (paragraph two), iron-rich soil and metallic roots enable planting (paragraph three), stabilization visible in perked-up willows (paragraph four). Setting is micro-active throughout; spatial choreography (central pedestal, soil bed, trunk) guides Elian's moves. Postcard moments are minimal; every detail constrains or enables. Present in all gates with tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the spirit leaves" anchors paragraph one ("the quiet hour after the spirit leaves the body, but before the dust settles") and subtly pressures the planting: Elian acts before the transition window closes. The phrase recurs thematically in paragraph four ("physics of transition") and shapes the urgency of reestablishment. Clock is implicit rather than ticking second-by-second, but the window tightens tactics. Present in setup and payoff with moderate causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to understand the physics of transition" appears in paragraph one and drives every choice: picking up the seed to probe its mechanics (paragraph two), planting to test the translation hypothesis (paragraph three), sensing Aris's presence as data (paragraph four). Desire is dramatized through embodied action—not merely declared—and friction surfaces in the terror at the seed's weight versus the need to use it. Present across all gates with direct closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tone "touching distance" is coherent from paragraph one ("silent... absolute") through the ending's "close enough to brush against his soul, yet forever just beyond the reach of his physical hand." Modulates with pressure: cold terror (paragraph two), tender precision (paragraph three), warm presence at closure (paragraph four). The final image directly charges "touching distance" as the story's emotional resolution. Present in setup and payoff with strong closure linkage; indispensable to the ending's felt cost.</comment>
