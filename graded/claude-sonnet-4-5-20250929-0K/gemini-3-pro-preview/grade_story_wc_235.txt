<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is dense and particular—"feral nostalgia that tears at my throat with wolfish teeth" embodies contradiction effectively. The method of jealousy-as-hook that induces lucid flight is specific and motivated. However, the transformation or renunciation feels more reported than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure; the chronicler observes rather than decides at closure, capping the category below 7.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 3 (narrator, cabin, scroll). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through jealousy-triggered flight, culminating in the act of inscription as Earned Stasis—"by inscribing the dream onto the wood, I force the universe to acknowledge my presence." Cost is conceptual and felt (ghost haunting own history), legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (flight to writing) satisfies scope; the closure reconfigures the narrator's relation to time and presence with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cabin's cold, birch bark scroll's texture, and dream's purple sun and liquid starlight are vivid and POV-filtered. The scroll as recurring micro-object constrains and charges the final image: "charcoal scratches loudly in the silence" embodies the act of forcing linearity. Sensory selection reflects urgency (cold vs. warm wind), and spatial choreography remains clear across waking/dream shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—document the dream to anchor existence—is signaled early and sustained. The jealousy-to-flight sequence tightens options (dream fractures, "cold ash of reality"), forcing the chronicler to return and inscribe. Agency is renunciation (sated nostalgia, solitude with words), with visible emotional cost. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; escalation is driven by protagonist choice, meeting scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (existence versus erasure, memory as proof) emerges organically from the grave marker, flight, and inscription without thesis statement. The ending image—"I once knew how to fly"—reweights the entire narrative with non-literal resonance; writing becomes rebellion against the paradox. Subtext operates in gesture (charcoal scratch, winter dark) and the final line delivers conceptual closure without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and specific: "feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "velvet texture of the mind." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (cabin → dream → cabin), and diction remains character-particular throughout. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature—cynically noting "cracks in the sky's rendering"—is distinct and sustained under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each line advances state or image). Figurative language is concentrated but coherent: "wolfish teeth," "hook," "liquid starlight." Minor scaffold appears: "The wind howled" / "The wind rushes" is near-paraphrase, and "chronologically confused, unmoored in a timeline" loops the concept. These slips are brief and don't obscure closure, capping upward movement but leaving the category solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of jealousy-as-trance-inducer with lucid chronicling and self-authored grave is fresh and specific. The dream flight resists stock resolution; the narrator returns to inscription rather than epiphany. Risk is present (chronological confusion, grave dated in past), and the ending image—ghost writing evidence of flight—feels earned rather than template-driven. Transformation is clear; swapping elements would break thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler frames the piece, drives the jealousy-to-flight sequence, and performs the final inscriptive act. Present in setup, middle (flight navigation), and closure (writing as proof). The role shapes the arc but the final beat leans observational—"I am a ghost haunting my own history"—rather than a decisive turn, capping higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in beat one (pinned, "pale and peeling"), reappears at closure ("texture rough against my fingertips"), and its materiality anchors the final act of inscription. The scroll's physicality constrains the method (charcoal on bark vs. ephemeral thought) and charges the ending image. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage present; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named, embodied ("wolfish teeth," "savage, violent longing"), and operationalized as the jealousy-method that triggers flight. It shapes the dominant tactic (envy-as-hook) and reappears at closure ("nostalgia subsides, sated"). Present across setup, middle, and ending; causal role clear but the concept overlaps heavily with Method (9F), reducing unique necessity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is declared early, conditions the narrator's disorientation ("slurry of disjointed moments"), and justifies the need to inscribe linearly. It enables the flight-as-escape tactic but does not visibly constrain a climactic choice. Label is embodied in perception but lacks a pivotal trade-off or visible cost tied to confusion itself, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Soaring structures the middle third: "push off the phantom ground and soar upward," "rocketing past the peaks," flying over forests and rivers. The flight is the dramatized method-test of jealousy, and its collapse ("burns out, leaving only the cold ash") forces return and inscription. Essential to escalation and closure; removing it would break the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Getting jealous of past selves is signaled early ("my method for inducing the trance is specific and bitter"), operationalized in the middle ("envy becomes a hook"), and its exhaustion triggers closure ("jealousy...burns out"). The mechanics are shown on the page and shape the flight sequence. Three-gate presence, causal pressure, and closure linkage met; high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin anchors who/where by line 1 ("timber walls," "freezing cabin"), supplies the scroll and charcoal as tools, and frames the return ("damp chill...reasserts its dominance"). The cold contrasts with dream warmth, charging the ending. Setting constrains the narrator (isolated, winter dark) and provides resources (scroll, charcoal) that alter the final act. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" is established early (mossy stone marker, name, date two years past), drives the chronological confusion and existential stakes, and charges the closure image ("my grave argues otherwise," "ghost haunting my own history"). The timeframe shapes the narrator's urgency and identity paradox. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending; causal and thematic pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is declared in the opening beat ("desperate need to distill chaos into narrative before the sun vanished"), dramatized in the flight-and-return arc, and fulfilled in the final inscription ("by inscribing the dream...I force the universe to acknowledge my presence"). The motivation drives all major choices, sustains pressure, and lands at closure with visible cost (solitude, winter dark). Essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is embodied throughout: "vibrant...colors that the waking eye is too weary to perceive," "admire the majesty of a purple sun while cynically noting the cracks in the sky's rendering," "weary reverence." Tone modulates with pressure (cabin cold → flight warmth → cold return) and charges the final image ("nostalgia subsides...leaving me alone with the words and the winter dark"). Coherent, purposeful, and sustained.</comment>
