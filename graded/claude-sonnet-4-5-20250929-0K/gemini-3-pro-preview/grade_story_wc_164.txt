<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and singular, and her chirpy delight at "exquisite despair" establishes a distinctive trait. Her conjecture action ("It wasn't fear that hid the path... It was hope") is a micro-choice under pressure, and the ending reveals a change—she now knows the civilization became "background noise." However, the progression from curiosity to "giddy melancholy" feels gestural rather than earned; the stakes remain observational, and the cost of her discovery is implied sentiment ("delighted to know") rather than a visible trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is solid by the opening paragraph: who (sea-foam recollectionist), where (geode), when (during the harvest). The story follows a causal sequence: bird drops seeds → foam reacts → glass found → projection → gap identified → conjecture → revelation. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "They hadn't died; they had just become background noise"—reweighting her life's work with a quiet conceptual cost (her harvest is souls). The lens holds as Causal throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when she must act "within the timeframe before memory fades," but the final cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page, keeping this just below the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode setting is vivid and specific ("violet quartz walls," "amethyst floor") and constrains choice: the wall blocks her path, the foam is time-sensitive, the scattered seeds form an arrow. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's cheerful-morbid lens ("rainy funeral where everyone secretly hated the deceased but loved the sandwiches"). The crater glass's vibration and the projections of light charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. Environment actively shapes the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to discover why some paths disappear entirely." The timeframe ("before memory fades") creates urgency, and the tightening moment is clear when Elara realizes logic won't work and must conjecture. The conjecture is protagonist-driven and narrows options. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than visceral—she pockets the glass and hums, "delighted," without a visible trade-off or loss. The pressure coheres but lacks a felt price that would lift this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "missing pieces" emerges organically through the gaps in light, the incomplete narrative, and the final revelation that the path vanished by choice, not catastrophe. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "They hadn't died; they had just become background noise," reweighting Elara's work without moralizing. The tone ("giddy melancholy") and recurring motif of "beautiful endings" support the thematic question. Subtext operates in the conjecture moment and the pocketing of the glass. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement mars the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: Elara's morbid cheerfulness colors every detail ("delightfully morbid curiosity," "Oh, such exquisite despair"). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated. The dialogue fragment ("It wasn't fear... It was hope") serves the beat and advances the plot. Under pressure, the prose remains character-particular. One minor register drift: "transliterates emotions into visible spectrums" reads slightly elevated for the surrounding voice, but it's brief and doesn't harm clarity or the closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "ancient, vanished ocean" echoed in "ghosts of tides that had receded millennia ago"; "motivation was singular and obsessed" followed by the same idea rephrased. The metaphor "sharp grief... jagged streaks of indigo" and "fear... trembling waves of sick chartreuse" works cleanly, but "transliterates emotions into visible spectrums of light" stacks three abstract nouns in high-pressure beats. Template-cadence patterns in the middle third ("She picked up... It possessed... It began...") create a slight drumbeat. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence combined, per the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist premise is fresh and specific, combining a fantastical occupation with a philosophical question about erasure. The combination of crater glass that "transliterates emotions" and the revelation that a civilization chose to become vibrations is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. The tone of "cheerful gloom" and Elara's delight in tragedy avoid genre clichés. No close echoes of famous lines. The risk of a concept-heavy premise pays off through grounded sensory detail and a coherent ending image. One small deduction for the slightly elevated register around "transliterates" that pulls briefly toward wikipedia-voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sea-foam recollectionist: present by the opening line (setup gate); shapes the middle beat when she harvests/observes the foam reaction (development gate); and her realization at closure that she harvests trapped souls rewrites her identity (payoff gate). Her occupation enables the conjecture action and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = net ~6.2. Causal pressure is moderate; she discovers rather than decides under trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crater glass: introduced at the second beat (setup gate, no early-signal bonus); handled when she picks it up, feels it hum, observes the projection, and then projects hope at it (two distinct beats, development gate); present in the closure sentence "Elara pocketed the crater glass" and its vibration accepting her hypothesis shapes the revelation (payoff gate). Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (transliteration attribute) +0.7, two beats +0.9, minor late penalty −0.2 = net ~7.8. Its unique attribute is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Missing pieces: framed early in the opening paragraph ("why some paths disappear entirely," setup gate); drives the middle conflict when "gaps in the light" and "dark voids" appear and she cannot deduce the answer (development gate, causal pressure); and the closure hinges on filling in the missing pieces to reveal the voluntary departure (payoff gate). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.7 = net ~8.1. The concept shapes every key turn and is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transliterates emotions: attribute of the crater glass introduced at the second beat (no early signal); it enables the projection and the gap-identification (development gate, one beat); and Elara uses it at closure by projecting hope to fill the missing pieces (payoff gate). Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, two beats +0.9, late penalty −0.3 = net ~6.4. The attribute is necessary for the revelation but arrives late and is tied to the object rather than driving independent action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Conjecture: not mentioned until the climax beat ("she resorted to a risky action: conjecture," missing setup gate); drives the peak turn when she hypothesizes "It wasn't fear... It was hope" and projects that emotion (development and payoff gates combined). Causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7, one beat +0.4, late penalty −0.7 = net ~7.6. The major turn traces directly to this action; swapping it for "guess" would weaken but not break the logic. Late arrival and single-beat use limit the score despite strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Via scattered seeds: present early when the star-tern drops seeds (setup gate); the seeds cause the foam to react intensely, revealing the glass beneath (development gate, causal pressure); the seeds form an arrow pointing toward the wall, guiding her gaze (second beat); no direct mention at closure but the chain they started shapes the ending (payoff gate via chain). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, indirect closure linkage +0.5, minor ornamental quality (the arrow is gestural) −0.4 = net ~5.8. The method matters but feels partially incidental—a migrating bird's coincidence starts the chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Iridescent cave inside geode: anchored in the opening paragraph (setup gate); the violet quartz walls reflect the projection, the amethyst floor holds the seeds and glass, the wall blocks the path, and the foam's time-sensitive bursting creates urgency (development gate, multiple beats); the closing image places her "inside the dim iridescent cave" surrounded by souls (payoff gate). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (wall, foam timing) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6 = net ~7.3. The setting constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test, but the cave itself is somewhat replaceable—any enclosed space with refractive surfaces could serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Before memory fades: introduced at the climax ("within the timeframe before memory fades," missing setup gate, arrives at ~60%); tightens the decision when the foam begins to pop and hiss (development gate, one beat); implicit at closure when she pockets the glass before the last bubble bursts (payoff gate). Causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +0.9, one beat +0.4, late penalty −0.6, generic quality (any ticking clock would work) −0.3 = net ~6.7. The timeframe creates urgency but is not tracked beat-to-beat; the foam's bursting is visible, yet the phrase "before memory fades" arrives late and reads slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To discover why paths disappear: stated explicitly in the opening paragraph (setup gate); drives her scramble to the seeds, her transcription of the colors, and her conjecture action (development gate, multiple beats); and the closure answers this exact question with "The path had disappeared because it was never meant to be followed, only inhabited" (payoff gate). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, slight tell-only declaration in the opening −0.5, swappable phrasing (any curiosity-driven motive fits similarly) −0.4 = net ~7.1. The motivation is clear and shapes every choice, but the opening line "Her motivation was singular and obsessed" tells rather than shows, and the motivation itself is slightly generic for a mystery-solver character.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cheerful gloom: established in the opening paragraph with "perfect, cheerful gloom, like... a rainy funeral" (setup gate); modulates through "delightfully morbid curiosity," "Oh, such exquisite despair," and "giddy melancholy" (development gate, coherent across beats); and charges the final image when she is "delighted to know that she was surrounded by billions of trapped, happy souls" (payoff gate). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.3, specificity (distinctive oxymoron anchored in concrete image) +0.7, coherence under pressure +0.5 = net ~7.4. Tone is consistent, purposeful, and inseparable from character voice, meeting the high-band requirement.</comment>
