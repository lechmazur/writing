<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and her final choice—trading a week of her life for the sketch—carries visible physical cost (wrinkled hands, white hair). The pendant's attribute is embodied through repeated handling and its burning against her chest. Interiority remains specific to an illustrator's observational urgency, though the "esoteric motivation" phrasing momentarily drifts toward telling. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; the physical aging at closure earns the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with visible cost: Elara ages visibly, secures the sketch, and escapes the waking giant. The causal lens holds cleanly—borrowed time enables the climb, uncaging the echo creates the sketch, expiration forces retreat. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the giant's interrupted cadence cracks her temporal stasis, narrowing her window and forcing the final push.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system, suspended water droplets, and spire lattice are vivid and selective. The frozen world's grayscale palette and "solid wall" wind support the time-sculpting premise. The pendant as recurring object charges the final image (searing hot) and the geological shudder beneath constrains her window. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor slip: "purple shadows of twilight" is a stock phrase that momentarily weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the echo before the giant wakes—is signaled early and tightens when the interrupted cadence threatens the borrowed hour. Agency is clear: Elara activates the pendant, climbs, uncages the echo, and sketches under mounting pressure. The cost is visible (aging, hot pendant, chaotic tide). One meaningful escalation when her stasis cracks. No coincidental resolution; her choices drive every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of mortality-for-mastery emerges through the time-debt mechanic and the aging imagery, not overt statement. The final line—"stolen a masterpiece from the edge of oblivion"—resonates without moralizing. The echo as "pure vibration" and the pendant's "forbidden method" avoid prompt-label language. Slight thematic transparency in "the cost of the magic hit her physically" edges toward articulation, but the embodied aging rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; focalization remains within Elara's perceptual frame (illustrator's eye, urgency-driven observation). Diction is consistent and purpose-driven, though "esoteric motivation" and "biological glitch" momentarily drift toward elevated register. Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short beats during the stasis crack, longer during the climb. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature—seeing sound as "translucent entity"—is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance stakes or setting. Minor template-cadence slip in the opening sequence: "She navigated... She was driven... She gripped" uses repeated subject-verb stems. "Terrifying attribute that sculpts time itself" leans toward elevated exposition. Figurative language ("echoes are born," "stolen hour") is functional but accumulates in the middle third. No loops or major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "city built across a giant's nap" and "echoes born in a spire" offer fresh, specific angles on time-magic and urban fantasy. The illustrator vocation and the visual hunt for sound are non-obvious synthesis. Minor derivative pressure: time-debt magic and world-threatening sleeper are recognizable templates, transformed here through the sensory inversion (drawing sound) and the geological scale. Risk-taking in the frozen-time sequence elevates without obscuring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Illustrator identity frames her goal (capture the echo's likeness) and her methods (charcoal, sketchbook, visual observation). Present in setup, drives the middle climb and sketching beat, and shapes closure—she completes the drawing just as time expires. Swappable with another visual artist role, but the observational urgency is specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pendant appears in beat one (gripped against sternum), activates the time-sculpting in beat two, and returns in closure (searing hot, marking the cost). Functionally indispensable: without it, no frozen time, no climb, no sketch. The cold-then-hot progression tracks her borrowed hour's expenditure. High irreplaceability; the infinity symbol's thematic charge (endless loop, finite cost) enriches closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is seeded early (giant's snoring rhythm), complicates the middle (skipped beat signals waking), and cracks the temporal stasis at closure, forcing her retreat. It narrows her options on-page and creates the escalation beat. Visible cost: the cadence shift ends her borrowed hour prematurely. Cannot swap without breaking the tension structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Time-sculpting is demonstrated on-page (world turns grayscale, wind solidifies, droplets hang) and constrains her method: she can climb only within the frozen hour. The attribute costs her a week of life, visible in aging markers at closure. Not ornamental; the entire middle sequence depends on this trait. Slightly reduced by late first use (paragraph eleven), but causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Uncaging the echo is the climactic physical act: she slides the bolt, releases the vibration-entity, and sketches it before it dissipates. This action triggers the story's peak pressure and enables closure (the completed drawing). Present in setup as goal, executed in the final third. Swapping to another release mechanism would require rewriting the spire's function, so irreplaceability is moderate-high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Borrowing time is signaled early ("forbidden method"), enacted at the story's midpoint (paragraph twelve: "A week of her life vanished"), and its cost is paid at closure (wrinkled hands, white streak). The method's mechanics—trading future lifespan for a frozen hour—shape every beat after activation. The imperfect magic against the giant's scale adds failure risk. High integration; the time-debt is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rooftop canals anchor the setting early, provide the skiff transit, and return in closure when the waking tide surges. The canals pressure her speed (threatened capsizing) and frame the vertical climb to the spire. The system's connection to the giant's breathing integrates world-logic. Moderate causal role; the spire is more pivotal than the canal network itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The giant's nap is the enabling condition (paragraphs four, five: "dormant phase was the only safe timeframe") and its interruption drives escalation (skipped beat, waking groan, opening eyes). The timeframe constrains every choice and creates the closing chase. Visible cost: she must leave as the giant wakes or face destruction. Slightly abstract until the interrupted cadence makes it tactile.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Finding "the place where echoes are born" is stated early and drives her climb to the spire. The motivation is tested by physical danger and time pressure; she persists despite the cost. Closure fulfills it: she captures the echo's form. Slightly told-heavy in setup ("singular, esoteric motivation"), but the on-page pursuit and sketch demonstrate commitment with visible sacrifice.</comment>
