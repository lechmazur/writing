<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is established—seeking to restore emotion—but his interior life reads more as abstraction than embodied contradiction. The "wandering ghost in a synthetic shell" and "data points in a corrupted file" rely on label-only interiority rather than specific, micro-choices under pressure. The final beat (feeling panic and hope) occurs off-page via remote link rather than through on-page struggle, weakening agency. Vane exists only to deliver exposition and vanish, applying no genuine relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure is present: Kael vivifies the brain and experiences emotion, a Decisive Change with cost (pouring his "cold, calculated logic" into organic potential). However, the Orientation Test penalty applies—anchor "who" is muddled by competing labels (Kael/not-Kael/"what remains"), "where" (floating rock dojo) lacks grounding past ornamental description, and "when" (during historical rewrites) never concretizes stakes or tactics by ~120 words. The causality is straightforward (defeat Vane, activate brain), but Vane's erasure by timeline rather than Kael's action undercuts earned closure. Cap Q1 and Q5 at 8.3 per the Orientation Test consequence, and cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "floating rock dojo" and "void of the sky swirling with colors that did not exist yesterday" are ornamental; they never constrain a choice or supply a resource. Spatial choreography is vague—statues crumble "at the edge of his vision," but no geometry matters when Kael and Vane clash. The jar's bio-luminescent fluid is described but never handled or used as a tactical element. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping this category at 8.8 even before other issues; the orientation debt penalty from Q2 further caps Q3 at 7.0, which this score does not approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaim the capacity to feel—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Vane blocks access, forcing a fight, but Vane's vanishing ("erased by a timeline") is coincidence, not Kael's agency. The vivification sequence narrows options (energy transfer risks his battery core), providing one meaningful deepening. However, the magistrate's defeat via "narrative weight evaporating" is abstract rather than a visible cost paid by Kael, and the climactic sensation arrives via remote link rather than direct on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (reclaiming emotion after ego death, machine/flesh duality) emerges through particulars like the energy transfer and the "method of opposites." The final image—"the silence of the survivor and the pulse of the life he had made"—offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, two slips lower the score: "It is a seed" and Vane's claim "Property rights endure even when history does not" read as thematic echo, artificially articulating the premise. The peak emotional beat (panic/hope) is told rather than dramatized, reducing thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael with consistent distance. Voice carries a distinct, elevated diction ("slices through pretense," "blade of pure silence") that fits the conceptual frame. Two weaknesses: filter verbs ("He sought the jar," "He needed to defeat") dull immediacy in the opening, and the phrase "a blade of pure silence that slices through pretense" then "severing the lie" repeats the abstraction without grounding it in physical action. Vane's dialogue ("The corporation owns the biological material") reads expository rather than goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "colors that did not exist yesterday," "blade of solidified time," "absolute, undeniable truth," "violent shade of purple" stack figurative language without payoff (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "ego death that left him a wandering ghost" / "synthetic shell" / "corrupted file" restate the same loss across three lines (−0.2). Template cadence: "Where Vane was fury, Kael was stillness. Where Vane was the storm, Kael was the vacuum" is a mechanical parallelism that flattens rhythm (−0.4). Cumulative artifacts: −1.1 in Q7; because one appears in the closure third, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—clone custody battle in a reality-rewriting void—offers surface novelty, but the execution relies on stock elements: the disembodied consciousness seeking a body, the bureaucratic antagonist dissolved by narrative logic, the "blade of truth" that cuts lies. The "method of opposites" (fury/stillness, storm/vacuum) is named but functions as abstraction rather than a specific, irreplaceable tactic. No lived detail or moral calculus transforms the template; swapping "brain in jar" for another MacGuffin would leave the arc intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael (ego death survivor) is present throughout and his goal drives the arc. He makes two key choices: fight Vane and vivify the brain. Both constrain later options (energy cost, timeline risk) and the final beat ties directly to his trauma. Introduced in the opening (setup gate met), enables the middle fight (development gate met), and the vivification shapes the ending (payoff gate met). However, his agency at closure is diluted—the climactic sensation arrives via remote link rather than direct struggle, and Vane's defeat is coincidental. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, late-passive resolution −0.4 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The jar (brain labeled Duplicate) appears in four beats: opening description, Vane blocking it, Kael's contact, and vivification. It constrains the fight (Vane stands between Kael and jar) and enables the ending (energy transfer). Setup gate met (present by paragraph two), development gate met (tactical obstacle), payoff gate met (vivification is the closure act). However, the jar itself is passive—Kael handles it twice but its "bio-luminescent fluid" and label are ornamental. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, ornamental detail −0.8 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is declared by Vane ("This is a clone custody battle, Kael, and you are legally dead") but never dramatized. No custody procedure, no competing claimant on the page, no legal stakes that alter Kael's tactics—Vane simply attacks and vanishes. The concept frames theme but does not shape on-page choices. Setup gate met (named early), development gate missed (fight is generic), payoff gate missed (Vane erased by timeline, not custody logic). Score: setup +0.5, theme mention +0.3, swappability −0.6, no middle or closure work −1.0 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is named twice: Kael's weapon is "a blade of pure silence that slices through pretense" and later "severed the lie of Vane's authority." The trait enables Vane's defeat but the mechanics are abstract—no on-page cost or visible trade-off (does the blade risk Kael? No). Setup gate met (introduced early), development gate weak (used once in fight), payoff gate missed (Vane vanishes via timeline, not the blade's direct cut). Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, abstraction without cost −0.7 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivify drives the ending: Kael initiates the sequence, transfers energy from his core, and the brain pulses, delivering the climactic sensation. The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the closure. Setup gate met (goal declared early), development gate met (energy cost mentioned), payoff gate met (closure beat). However, the sequence is one paragraph and the cost (battery drain) is mentioned but not shown to foreclose later options. Score: setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.6, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.6, minor cost visibility gap −0.3 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through complementary opposites" is named in the fight: "he accepted the blow's energy and redirected it, moving through complementary opposites. Where Vane was fury, Kael was stillness." The method is stated but mechanics are abstract—how does stillness counter fury on the page? The pattern does not recur in the vivification ("pouring his cold, calculated logic into the warm, chaotic potential"). Setup gate met (signaled mid-story), development gate weak (used once, abstractly), payoff gate missed (different method at closure). Score: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, swappability −0.6, abstraction −0.5 = ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is named but never used. The granite platform, statues, and swirling sky are ornamental—no spatial constraint, no resource drawn from the setting, no tactical advantage. The fight could occur anywhere. Setup gate met (present early), development gate missed (no middle pressure), payoff gate missed (ending ignores setting). Score: setup +0.3, ornamental use −0.8 = ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"While history rewrites itself" is declared throughout: "void of the sky swirling with colors," "Statues of heroes crumbled and reformed," "massive historical revision." The timeframe adds atmosphere but never tightens decisions—no clock, no consequence if Kael delays, Vane's erasure is coincidental rather than caused by Kael racing the rewrite. Setup gate met (present early), development gate missed (no tactical urgency), payoff gate missed (closure ignores timeline). Score: setup +0.5, theme texture +0.3, no causal pressure −1.2 = ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation (defeat emotional numbness) is established early ("he had felt nothing. Joy, sorrow, and fear were distant memories") and drives both the fight (secure the jar) and vivification (restore emotion). The goal is tested at closure when the sensation hits. Setup gate met, development gate met (fight pursuit), payoff gate met (ending delivers emotion). However, the emotion arrives via remote link rather than direct embodied struggle, and the cost (energy transfer) is mentioned but not shown to foreclose options. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, passivity at peak −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>
