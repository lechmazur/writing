<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's arc from scholar to active speaker shows clear progression, with embodied reactions (trembling fingers, hitched breath) and internal pressure driving her choice to complete the symphony. However, interiority relies heavily on external action and ritual rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to speak the last words feels somewhat inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict; we see determination but not the cost of renouncing safety until after the act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archive opens, silence shifts from oppressive to expectant, and Elara begins writing with "the ink well's essence" lingering—options and stakes are crystallized with felt cost (the shattered ink well, isolation, uncertain path ahead). The causal lens holds: her decipherment → speaking the symphony → ink well shatters → voices answer → archive opens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the voice demands she "listen or turn away," forcing her final commitment. Orientation is swift (who, where, what within opening lines). Minor deduction: the Velyrian backstory and the curators' buried truth add texture but don't directly shape Elara's tactical choices on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive is vividly anchored as a "mausoleum of extinct syllables," and the glass ink well functions as both object and setting-constraint, its pulsing and eventual shattering altering Elara's options and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (desk, shelves, floorboards, doors) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's scholarly focus (fogging breath, iridescent shimmer, jagged shadows). The ink well's tactile presence—dipped quill, rippling surface, swirling storm—grounds the arc and constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the symphonies and undo erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the voice demands a choice ("listen or turn away"), forcing Elara's final commitment. That moment narrows options with visible cost: she shatters the ink well and stands alone in uncertain silence. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; the curators' buried truth and the Velyrians' self-silencing enrich context but don't generate on-page opposition or complication that Elara must navigate. The cost is felt but not tested by competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth earned through risk, trust restored by voice—emerges from concrete actions (speaking the symphony, shattering the ink well) without overt thesis. The final image (Elara writing with "the ink well's essence" in the air, doors open, silence expectant) offers a resonant answer: restoration is begun, not completed, and the cost is solitude and uncertainty. The Velyrian motif of "oaths that bound speakers to honesty" and the phrase "carefully reckless" enrich texture. Minor deduction: "Trust had been broken here" and the curators' bureaucratic silence are told rather than discovered through scene friction, slightly diluting earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual filtering through Elara's scholarly lens (words "curling like smoke," "linguistic harmonies"). Diction is elevated but consistent with her register. The ancient voice's direct-quote interruptions are clean and purposeful. Minor slips: "her heart pounding with cautious exuberance" in the final paragraph tells the tone element rather than embodying it, and "the moment before paths diverge" reads slightly abstract for peak pressure. Free indirect style is controlled, and psychic distance modulates appropriately from tense focus to reflective close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with vivid images (ink well pulsing, books sliding, light erupting) advancing pressure. Information density is high; most lines do double work. Minor patterns: "The archive [verb]" structure repeats (hummed, trembled, erupted, doors creaked) across key beats without taught payoff, creating mild template cadence. "She had spent years" and "for the first time in centuries" anchor backstory but edge toward summary in high-pressure moments. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure, which remains imagistically clean ("dipped her pen into the air").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The linguistic-magic premise (extinct language as binding covenant, symphonies of truth as equations) offers a fresh synthesis of archive scholarship and ritual restoration. Elara's scholar-as-resurrector role and the Velyrians' self-silencing add non-obvious stakes. However, the "last speaker died in this room" and "curators buried the truth" setup leans on familiar archival-conspiracy tropes, and the climactic sequence (speak forbidden words → magical response → transformative light) follows recognizable beats. The ending's restraint—"she had begun"—and the ink well's essence as ephemeral writing tool elevate the frame above template, but the core arc remains within expected contours for the subgenre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's scholarly expertise enables every major beat: she deciphers the script, unsnares syntax, speaks the symphony, and chooses to complete the final promise despite unknown cost. Her decision to continue when the voice asks "listen or turn away" creates the climactic turn. Present in setup (years deciphering), middle (unsnaring, speaking), and payoff (final words, writing with essence). Causal pressure is high; irreplaceable. Only slight deduction: her internal conflict over the choice is brief, so the cost of her decision is more demonstrated than struggled-through on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in six distinct beats: desk setup, first dip, pulsing response, glowing/cracking, shattering climax, and scattered remnants repurposed as ephemeral writing medium in the final image. It evolves from tool to oracle to sacrifice to essence, constraining Elara's ritual and charging the closure ("dipped her pen into the air, where the ink well's essence lingered like a promise"). Setup early, drives middle pressure (crack/voice), and its destruction is the climax's visible cost. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" are introduced early as "equations—linguistic harmonies that revealed hidden meanings when spoken aloud," shaping Elara's goal and the stakes (restore them to undo erasure). Her speaking the symphony triggers the climax (voices answer, archive trembles, ink well shatters). Present in setup, middle (she speaks fragments), and payoff (final promise sung without restraint). However, the mechanics remain abstract; we don't see how the harmonies alter specific tactics or reveal concrete hidden meanings on the page—they function more as thematic frame than operational constraint. Solid integration but not indispensable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is mentioned once as Elara's muttered echo of her mentor, framing her stance at the outset. It thematically licenses her decision to speak the symphony despite unknown cost, but the trait is not tested or demonstrated through a visible on-page tradeoff where caution and recklessness compete. The choice to continue is presented as determined rather than internally divided. Label-only mention; no middle beat where the tension between care and risk alters her approach. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears once as a verb: "She unsnared the first tangled thread of syntax," launching the speaking sequence that triggers the ink well's pulse and the voices' response. This action initiates the escalation and is causally necessary—without it, she does not reach the climactic choice. However, the single-beat presence and metaphorical framing make it somewhat swappable with "decoded" or "untangled" without major structural loss. Present in setup and middle development, causal role clear, but not irreplaceable in specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Interconnected promises" are referenced once in backstory ("oaths that bound speakers to honesty") and again when Elara speaks "the final promise—the one that bound all others." The method frames the Velyrian system but is not operationalized; we don't see how promises interconnect mechanically or how Elara navigates their links. It appears at climax as thematic closure rather than a tactical method shaping attempts. Late signal, summary-only, swappable with "covenant" or "vow." Functional theme element but does not drive beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is established immediately and pressures every choice: it holds the texts, the floorboard confession, the silence that dares Elara, and the shelves that slide when the room "wakes." The archive's oppressive-then-expectant silence bookends the arc, and its doors open in the final image, inviting the world—setting becomes a character of constraint and transformation. Micro-setting (desk, ink well, floorboards) anchors all action. Present in setup, middle (trembling archive), and payoff (doors open). Essential; the story requires this exact space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" is invoked once mid-story ("the moment before paths diverge, when a single step could lead to revelation or ruin") to frame Elara's climactic choice. The phrase heightens the sense of decisive threshold but does not function as a live clock or tracked deadline that alters her tactics. The story operates in a single continuous night with no time pressure tightening decisions. Thematic presence, lyric reprise potential, but not operationalized as temporal constraint. Mid-band for resonance without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to restore trust after silence" is stated early ("If she could restore even a fraction of that trust, she might undo centuries of erasure") and drives her choice to speak the final promise despite unknown cost. The ending acknowledges the friction: "She had not restored trust, not yet. But she had begun." Motivation is clear, shapes the climax, and the cost (solitude, uncertainty, shattered tool) is visible. However, the internal conflict between ambition and fear is more asserted than dramatized through competing on-page impulses. Strong integration with slight tell-over-show.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is embodied intermittently: cautious in "her fingers trembled," "breath hitched," and "hands shook"; exuberant in "pulse quickened," "voice ringing clear," and the final "heart pounding with cautious exuberance." The phrase appears explicitly only at the end, where it is told rather than shown. Tone modulates with pressure (dread → determination → wonder), but the final line labels the feeling instead of letting the image carry it. Coherent through turns, charges the ending, but the explicit tag undercuts full integration. Solid presence, not indispensable.</comment>
