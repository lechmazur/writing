<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curator's interiority shows specific embodiment ("fingers trembling," water "seeping into her bones") and her final choice to pursue rather than own the shell is earned by the progression of her inquiry. However, the epiphany in the bath arrives through abstract philosophizing rather than concrete scene pressure, and the "brightened disquiet" emotional label appears repeatedly without varied embodiment. The predecessor's cryptic note and the curator's obsession provide motivation, but the internal contradiction between scholarly caution and forbidden pursuit remains under-dramatized until the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the orchard's strangeness, the shell's blankness, and the curator's inquiry deepen through layered reflection until the bath scene crystallizes a Conceptual Repricing—the shell as vessel for nonlinear inheritance reweights the premise. Orientation anchors arrive late (gallery/asteroid/orchard locations clarify only after several paragraphs), triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit (realization that the shell is "waiting" and the orchard is a "ledger of possibilities") lands with conceptual cost (pursuit replaces ownership, bewilderment becomes awe), but the cost remains more told than shown in a decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard—trees rooted in cracked asteroid surface, branches twisting toward starlit sky, blossoms that hum and fruit that ripens in reverse—provides vivid, purpose-driven detail that charges atmosphere. The bathroom as micro-setting (water from underground springs, shimmering starlight) grounds the pivotal inquiry beat. However, spatial choreography between gallery and quarters is vague, and the orchard's physical layout (distance, access, window sightlines) remains unclear when the trees "bend toward her" at closure. The cap from Q2's orientation penalty applies, limiting this to 7.0 maximum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the pistachio shell's mystery—is signaled early and tightens when the curator moves from scholarly cataloging to active inquiry in the bath. The realization that "emptiness was the point" and the orchard's shift in response constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive rather than driven by external pressure or trade-offs; the curator faces no visible cost or foreclosed path until the final decision to "pursue" rather than "own," which reads as abstract stance rather than embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance emerges organically through the orchard's reverse-ripening fruit, the shell's blank potential, and the phrase "passing things up, through time." The bath epiphany—"knowledge that existed beyond the edges of what was allowed"—reweights the curator's obsession without moralizing. The final image of the orchard as "a path to walk" rather than "a mystery to solve" offers a resonant answer to the central question. Minor deduction for the predecessor's cryptic margin note ("Some things are simply complicated") which borders on thematic echo, and for "brightened disquiet" appearing twice as a thematic label rather than emerging fully from image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a lyric, contemplative register ("whisper of something forgotten," "veneer over something far stranger"). Perceptual signature is curator-specific: she notices artifacts, cataloging details, the orchard's "disquieting hum." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs," "brightened disquiet") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The bath-scene inquiry is purposefully reflective and anchored to sensory cues (warmth, water, starlight), fitting the Accumulative lens, but the phrase "inquire—not with her hands, but with her mind" over-explains the shift rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and supports the contemplative mood; figurative language ("each petal a fragment of time, each fruit a memory") is dense but mostly coherent. The piece suffers from mild paraphrase loops: "the shell remained, stubborn and silent, a puzzle that refused to be solved" echoes "the only object...that refused to reveal its purpose" without new information. Stock metaphor ("staring into the abyss and finding it staring back") and the recycled phrase "brightened disquiet" (used twice, including final paragraph) reduce freshness. Filter verbs ("she felt the weight," "she allowed herself") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Deduction of −0.6 for paraphrase/template issues plus −0.3 for stock metaphor, total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid and the pistachio shell cameo blank offer a fresh synthesis of scale (cosmic) and intimacy (tiny carved object). The premise of nonlinear inheritance as "passing things up" rather than down is a non-obvious inversion. However, the bath-epiphany structure and the curator-discovers-hidden-meaning arc are familiar templates, and the emotional progression (bewilderment → spark → awe) follows a predictable path. The orchard's specifics (reverse-ripening fruit, hum-on-touch blossoms) provide texture but do not fundamentally transform the discovery-arc trope. The final turn—from solving to walking—feels earned but not surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bewildered curator is present throughout and her choices drive key beats: she traces the shell's edges (paragraph 1), retreats to the bath to inquire (paragraph 4), and reaches for the shell at closure, triggering the orchard's shift (final paragraphs). Her bewilderment is embodied early ("fingers trembling") and late ("bewilderment giving way to something like awe"). However, much of her arc is contemplative rather than decision-driven; the bath scene is reflection-led, and the final "reach" is more symbolic gesture than embodied action with tactical cost. The character shapes the arc but observation and realization dominate over choice. Setup clear, middle development reflective, payoff present but abstract. Mid-band: functional across beats with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears in paragraph 1 (glass case, "refused to reveal its purpose"), is traced by the curator's fingers (paragraph 3), and is reached for at closure, triggering the orchard's shift (final paragraphs). Its blankness is thematically charged: "emptiness was the point," "waiting." The shell is not merely described but handled across three spaced beats and its meaning reweights at the end. However, the shell's specific material properties (smoothness, light-catching) do not constrain or enable a physical choice with cost; its role is symbolic anchor rather than tactical object. Setup strong, middle touch functional, closure participation clear but conceptual rather than causal. Eligible for mid-6s: essential across beats but lacks irreplaceable physical specificity or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is named in paragraph 3 ("weight of nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs") and explained in the bath epiphany (paragraph 5: "passing things up, through time"). The concept reframes the orchard's reverse-ripening fruit and the blossoms as "a ledger of possibilities...of choices not yet made." It shapes the curator's final stance (pursue, not own) and explains the predecessor's silence. However, it does not constrain on-page choices with visible cost; it functions as thematic lens rather than tactical pressure. The concept is seeded early, developed at midpoint, and pays off thematically at closure, but its mechanics remain abstract. Setup present, middle development strong (bath realization), closure participation thematic. Mid-band: shapes stakes conceptually but does not alter tactics with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears once as the predecessor's margin scribble (paragraph 3: "Some things are simply complicated"). The phrase haunts the curator but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. It functions as thematic echo rather than character trait or world rule. Late signal (second third), ornamental use, no causal pressure or closure linkage. Low band: present but does not shape choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inquire" is named and enacted in the bath scene (paragraph 4: "she allowed herself to inquire—not with her hands, but with her mind"). This action triggers the epiphany about the shell as vessel and nonlinear inheritance (paragraph 5). The method is specific (mental rather than physical inquiry) and the result reweights the curator's stance, leading to her return to the gallery and the orchard's response. However, the action is contemplative rather than goal-pursuit under external pressure, and it could be replaced with "reflect" or "meditate" without major structural loss. Setup mid-story, development strong (bath epiphany), closure shaped by its consequence. Mid-6s: drives a key turn but swappable method, conceptual rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bathroom as locus for breakthrough is signaled early (paragraph 4: "the only place...where the walls didn't echo") and its mechanics matter: water from asteroid springs, shimmering starlight, warmth that allows mental inquiry. The bath setting enables the pivotal realization (paragraph 5) and is causally necessary—the curator must retreat from the gallery's "disquieting hum" to think clearly. The method shapes the middle turn and its payoff (return to gallery, orchard shift) follows directly. Setup clear, middle use functional and specific, closure shaped by the method's consequence. Strong 7-band: essential to the key turn, specific mechanics, irreplaceable within this design.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid is present throughout: trees rooted in cracked surface, branches twisting toward starless sky, blossoms that hum and fruit that ripens in reverse (paragraphs 2, 4). At closure the orchard shifts, trees bending and blossoms unfurling into symbols (paragraph 7). The setting provides atmosphere and charges the final image, but it does not constrain the curator's choices with physical pressure or supply resources that alter tactics. The orchard is backdrop and thematic anchor rather than tactical environment. Setup strong, middle presence atmospheric, closure participation clear (orchard responds). Mid-6s: essential to atmosphere and ending charge but does not pressure choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is meta-commentary rather than on-page timeframe. The story spans "years" of cataloging, "months" haunted by the margin note, and "that evening" for the bath scene, but no live clock tightens decisions. Time is vague and does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. The phrase appears once in paragraph 6 as part of the orchard's symbolic language ("between the first and last page of every story") but does not function as narrative constraint. Ornamental mention, no causal role. Low band: present as image but does not shape story time or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to pursue forbidden knowledge is embodied in the curator's obsession with the shell (paragraph 1: "baffled her"), her years cataloging the orchard's strangeness, and her final choice to "pursue" the shell and walk the orchard's path (paragraph 8). The motivation is dramatized through her return to the gallery despite understanding why her predecessor left no notes ("Some knowledge wasn't meant to be recorded"). However, the friction between scholarly caution and forbidden pursuit is more told than shown in scene; no external authority or internal fear visibly resists her inquiry. Setup clear (obsession), middle development strong (bath inquiry), closure participation decisive (pursuit stance). High-6s: drives the arc and is conflicted in concept, but lacks visible on-page cost or resistance that dramatizes "forbidden."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears twice (paragraph 6 and final line: "with all its brightened disquiet") and is embodied in earlier images: orchard beauty as "veneer over something far stranger," blossoms that "hum" and unsettle visitors, the curator's trembling fingers and pounding heart. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (orchard as path, not mystery). However, the phrase itself is used as a label in peak beats rather than emerging fully from sensory detail, and its recurrence feels more thematic echo than tonal modulation under pressure. Setup present (disquieting hum, unsettled visitors), middle maintained, closure charged by the label. Mid-6s: coherent and charges ending, but label-reliance in final line reduces embodied specificity.</comment>
