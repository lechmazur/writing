<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by post-resuscitation dread of hollowness, but interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("unbosomed his deepest dread") rather than embodied contradiction. The turn at the mirror—reaching out to starve fear—lands with some agency, yet the advisor's aphoristic guidance does most of the conceptual work. Emotional progression from terror to relief reads schematic; the final smile and lighter chest feel mechanically resolved without sustained internal friction. No secondary character applies on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal-Situational hybrid: Elias enters to confront fear, the mirror lunges, he presses his palm, and the reflection recoils—a tightening that narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change (the mirror becomes inert, cloak discarded, face unmarred in the new photo) with visible cost (the advisor vanishes, the cloak left behind). Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. The turn feels neat; the reflection's terror and shattering ice deliver cost, but the ease of resolution—one touch silences the threat—undercuts escalation weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors, rust-and-sugar air, and the opera cloak clasp anchor setting with vivid sensory detail. The mirrors ripple and warp under pressure, subtly mirroring Elias's internal state. The cloak clasp reappears at closure (discarded, "staring up at him like an accusation"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The carnival frame remains largely decorative beyond the hall of mirrors; the setting guides the climax but does not constrain mid-scene choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: confront the fear that he is hollow. The mirror's lunge provides one reversal, and the advisor's aphorism ("starve it") shifts tactics. The resolution—pressing his palm and the reflection recoiling—feels abrupt; the cost is visible (cloak discarded, advisor gone) but light. No secondary constraint shapes the attempt. The tightening is legible but minimal; the mirror conflict resolves in a single gesture without sustained trade-offs or escalating price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the funhouse-as-lie and fear's self-deception, grounded in the mirror encounter and the paradoxical dream dictionary. The final image (torn photo, discarded cloak) offers a quiet answer without overt moralizing. However, the advisor's closing line ("You tricked it, Elias. You made it see itself") edges toward thematic echo, and the epiphany—fear believes its own lies—feels close to a stated moral. Subtext operates in the reflection's terror and the cloak's accusatory stare, but the resolution leans explanatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent gothic-lyric register ("warped by decades of neglect, yet somehow luminous"). The advisor's aphoristic voice is distinct. Diction remains elevated throughout ("unbosomed," "repulsive allure," "lingering luminance"), occasionally slipping into ornamental register ("threadbare murmur," "coiled around him") that distances rather than sharpens pressure. No dialogue between characters on the page. Perceptual signature leans toward atmospheric catalog; under peak stress (mirror lunge), syntax tightens slightly but retains the same lyric texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("silver where his features should have been," "elastic," "dying ember"). Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "lingering luminance" recurs as motif but also as filler; "whispering advisor's voice" is restated in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "He reached… He flipped… He stepped… He forced…" across four paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("rippling like water," "shattering ice") and elevated diction ("unbosomed," "coiled") in peak beats blur immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph retains the same ornamental register), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The haunted-funhouse frame and fear-confrontation arc are familiar; the twist—making the reflection see itself—offers a modest inflection. Emotional specificity is thin; the progression from terror to relief follows a predictable template. The paradoxical dream dictionary and opera cloak clasp add gothic texture but do not transform the premise. No bold structural risk; the piece hedges toward the safety middle with lyric ornamentation over lived friction. Transformation test: plot and arc could swap names/places with minimal rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears in four beats, offering aphoristic guidance that shifts Elias's tactics twice (read the dictionary, starve the fear by pressing the mirror). She does not make on-page choices herself; her role is catalyst. Setup early, middle development via advice, closure participation (her absence noted and her final line delivered). Swappable with any mentor-voice figure; no unique trait beyond aphorism delivery. Two-gate minimum met, causal nudge present, but no irreplaceability or visible cost tied to her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Opera cloak clasp appears in beat one (adjusted at throat, described as "weeping eye") and beat final (discarded, "staring up at him like an accusation"). Setup and closure linkage clear; no middle development—it is worn but not used or reweighted mid-conflict. Lyric reprise reweights the image (weeping eye becomes accusatory stare), charging the ending. Swappable with any symbolic garment fastener. Scores in the 5.5–6.3 lyric-resonance band: purposeful seed and reprise without mid-scene causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lingering luminance appears as: post-resuscitation blur, smeared-face Polaroid, and "lingering luminance in his vision fading like a dying ember" at closure. Present by setup, mid-conflict as internal sensation, and fading at end. The concept frames the curse but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elias never negotiates its mechanics on the page. Treated as atmospheric motif rather than causal force. Two gates (setup, closure fade-out) with mid-mention, but no cost tied to it and easily replaceable with any haunting-afterimage metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Photographically cursed Polaroid introduced early (captured the faceless moment), burned prior to story start (told in backstory), reappears mid-conflict as pocket object (not used), and final beat shows a new photo—clear, unmarred—which Elias tears in half. Setup, middle presence (pocket), and closure. The curse constrains nothing on the page; the new photo is proof of change, not a tool or cost. Swappable with any haunted keepsake. Functional reprise with closure participation, but no on-page trade-off or mechanics that shape a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Unbosom occurs once, mid-conflict: "Elias unbosomed his deepest dread—that he was already hollow—and the mirrors seemed to ripple in response." The act triggers the mirror's escalation (reflections stretch and snap), setting up the lunge. Causal beat; removes swappability since the specific verb and its mechanics (confession → ripple) matter. Not present at closure. Setup weak (the verb itself not primed), strong middle development, no closure reprise. Two gates with causal pressure in one key turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dream dictionary with paradoxical notes appears mid-conflict: Elias pulls it out, reads the funhouse entry, and the text ("mirrors show you what you fear, walls made of what you've already survived") informs his interpretation. Setup absent (not mentioned before use), middle development strong (reading shifts his frame), closure echo (the walls-as-survival insight colors his relief). Mechanics matter—paradoxical notes provide the conceptual tool—but late first appearance and no closure return weaken integration. Two gates (middle, conceptual payoff), but no setup and only oblique closure link.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival funhouse frames all action: collapsed ticket booth, rust-and-sugar air, hall of mirrors as labyrinth. Setup immediate, middle beat pressure (mirrors ripple and lunge, glass bends inward), closure (funhouse "just a place now," Elias exits to cleaner air outside). Setting constrains the conflict—mirrors supply the vehicle for fear's manifestation—and the exit marks resolution. Spatial micro-setting (mirror surface, glass contact) alters the key choice (pressing his palm). Irreplaceable; the funhouse's logic and atmosphere drive the arc. Three gates, causal constraint, closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the resuscitation" anchors backstory and motivates the curse (the Polaroid and luminance trace to that moment). Present scene is timeless; no clock tightens decisions, no urgency beyond thematic dread. Setup present (resuscitation mentioned early), no middle tightening, closure reference (doctors "pulled him back" recalled in final reflection). Functional context but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure on the page. Replaceable with any post-trauma frame. Two gates (setup, closure echo), no causal work, swappable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation to trick fear into revealing its weakness is articulated by the advisor ("Fear's weakness is curiosity. It can't resist being seen") and dramatized when Elias presses the mirror and the reflection recoils. Setup via advisor aphorisms, middle beat (pressing the glass enacts the trick), closure (advisor's final line confirms success). The trick shapes the climax choice and delivers the turn. Desire is told more than internally conflicted; Elias follows guidance without visible friction between want and cost until the final relief. Three gates, causal role in climax, but limited internal struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Repulsive allure operates in sensory details (rust-and-sugar air "clung to the back of his throat," mirrors "luminous in the dim") and modulates: dread at setup, intensified revulsion at the mirror lunge, dulled allure at closure ("air smelled different—cleaner, lighter"). Tone coherent through turns and charges the final image (funhouse laughter now "just an echo"). Setup strong, middle reinforcement, closure shift. The contrast (repulsive → clean) reweights the stake. Irreplaceable tonal signature. Three gates, closure charge, but the tonal shift is smooth rather than viscerally contradictory—repulsive and allure never clash in one beat.</comment>
