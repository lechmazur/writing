<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior life is embodied through action (kneeling, searching, fingers brushing soil) and the debt "gnaws...like a rat in the walls of her ribs" is concretely visceral. The memory-lacuna creates legitimate contradiction ("could not remember why"), but the final choice to accept remembering as repayment feels emotionally earned. Minor slip: the bride's relation to Liora shifts loosely ("sister, once, or her lover, or perhaps both") without clear dramatized friction that would make the ambiguity a live cost rather than ornamental blur.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora accepts the burden of remembering, and the debt is repaid with visible emotional cost ("the wound remained—lovingly venomous, forever open"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (bead, bride, blood-stained memory) and the final cadence shift reweights the debt's nature. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (greenhouse, Liora, winter solstice ritual), waiving the penalty. Minor causality slip: the vision of "another life" arrives without clear on-page trigger beyond holding the bead, which borders on convenient revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is concretely anchored (frosted glass, metallic tang of magic, gnarled apple tree roots) and constrains Liora's search among the rows. The bead—warm in a cold space—functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image and forces the memory-confrontation. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (scent of dormant blossoms, sight of ashen veil, tactile warmth). The setting's "time moved differently—slower, thicker" primes the recursive-memory logic without becoming expository.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repaying the debt) is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the bead triggers involuntary memory. The reversal—debt repayment is not gold but "the weight of remembering"—narrows Liora's escape and forces acceptance with felt cost. Agency is present: Liora closes her fingers around the bead, choosing to see the vision rather than flee. The bride applies pressure as silent witness rather than antagonist, which works under the Accumulative lens but means no direct confrontation escalates tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of debts born from love and violence emerges through the blood-stained vision, the bride's "terrible beauty" smile, and the paradox "lovingly venomous." The bead's spirals—pulsing, feeding on sorrow—anchor abstraction in concrete action. The ending avoids a stated moral: "the debt was repaid, but the wound remained" offers a resonant contradiction rather than resolution. Minor slip: "mournful elation" and "resonant awakening" risk label-territory in their phrasing, though the surrounding images ground them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is selective (she notices soil texture, warmth of the bead, the bride's bone-colored gown). Diction stays consistent and lyric without register drift. The bride's voicelessness ("only the echo of a voice...if her throat had been filled with thorns") is filtered through Liora's perception rather than omniscient assertion. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (vision sequence) without head-hopping. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("silver breath," "honey dripping from a spoon," "rat in the walls of her ribs," "eyes like dying stars") and functions under the Accumulative lens, but several crowd single sentences without clear payoff ("threads unraveling at the touch" immediately after "frayed tapestry" reads as synonym churn). The phrase "lovingly venomous, a wound given with a kiss" and its near-echo "lovingly venomous, forever open" at closure risk template cadence. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 10–11 restate that Liora has been running from the past. No major artifacts obscure closure, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-as-debt-collector frame is familiar, but the specificity of the alchemical orchard, the carved bead as memory-key, and the inversion (debt paid in remembering rather than forgetting) provide fresh angles. The ambiguity of sister/lover adds complexity without resolution. The bride's ephemeral appearances and mute presence avoid stock specter tropes. However, the lifecycle-debt premise and the symbolic orchard lean on recognizable templates; transformation is partial rather than complete.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride appears in three beats (initial sighting, hand-extension/bead-gift, final smile/vanishing) and her presence pressures Liora's choice to accept the bead and the memory. She does not make her own decisions on-page; her function is catalyst and witness. Her smile at the end reweights her earlier silence with "terrible beauty," but she remains more symbolic pressure than agent. Setup and closure participation present; mid-scene development is observational rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is handled in four distinct beats: initial gift in the bride's palm, Liora's murmured recognition, the warmth/spiral glow triggering the vision, and the final press to her lips. It enables the central turn (memory unlocked) and charges the closure image ("a second heartbeat"). Its spirals "feeding on...sorrow" give it unique, irreplaceable properties. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "resonant awakening" appears once (paragraph 4: "the bead hummed...a resonant awakening, a key turning in a lock"), signaling that the bead unlocks memory. The concept shapes the central mechanism—memory as debt repayment—but is stated rather than iterated across beats. The bead's hum and warmth do the causal work; "resonant awakening" remains more label than active pressure. Present and functional, but closer to thematic echo than stake-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute "lovingly venomous" appears twice: once describing the original wound ("the breaking had been lovingly venomous, a wound given with a kiss," paragraph 6) and again at closure ("lovingly venomous, forever open," final line). It characterizes the paradox of debt born from intimacy and harm, constraining Liora's ability to escape (she cannot simply reject the past). The trait is visible in the vision of blood-stained hands and the bride's begging. Setup and closure participation present; cost is felt but the attribute itself does not enable a distinct middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The action "ghost" is embodied in the bride's ashen-veil form and her silent appearances. She is central to pressure but does not perform a discrete ghosting action that Liora must navigate; instead, she simply is a ghost throughout. The ephemeral nature matters (veil of smoke, moonlight/mist form) but the story would not fundamentally change if the bride were a living figure with the same silent presence. Present and logically consistent, but swappable with minor edits to pronoun and descriptive detail.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The method "through ephemeral cameo appearances" is stated outright in paragraph 9 ("the ghost bride watched her through ephemeral cameo appearances") and matches the bride's pattern of fleeting glimpses. The bride appears three times on-page, each brief. However, the method is described rather than mechanically decisive—Liora does not attempt to time or exploit these appearances, and the bride's final vanishing is not a tactics-altering constraint. Present in setup and thematically noted at closure, but not developed as a shaping force across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early (paragraph 1) and provides the spatial frame for all action: Liora kneels among roots, the bride stands between rows of trees, the glass panes tremble during the vision. The "endless night" is implicit in the winter solstice and frosted darkness. The greenhouse's quality—"time moved differently...like honey"—primes the memory-recursion logic and charges the closure mood. It constrains Liora's search and supplies the tactile environment (soil, roots, cold air). Setup, middle choreography, and closure atmosphere all present; no single tactical choice hinges on a specific greenhouse feature, keeping it just below higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "over the hush of winter-cracked fields" anchors the scene in winter solstice (paragraph 1: "every winter solstice for seven years") and the quietude of dormant fields. The phrase "hush of winter-cracked fields" recurs as closure anchor in the penultimate paragraph. Time does not tighten decisions—the scene unfolds in one continuous beat without clock pressure—but the seasonal frame (dormancy, cold, solstice ritual) charges the atmosphere and the theme of cyclical return. Setup and closure participation present; development absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to repay a debt across lifetimes" is stated in paragraph 1 ("the debt gnawed at her"), dramatized in the vision of the original harm (paragraph 6: blood-stained hands, the bride's begging), and resolved at closure when Liora understands "this was the repayment...the weight of remembering." The debt drives her return each solstice and her acceptance of the bead's cost. Friction is present: she has "spent lifetimes running" yet returns compulsively. Setup, middle pressure (vision forces confrontation), and closure participation all clear with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone "mournful elation" is embodied in the phrase "mournful elation, the kind of joy that tastes like tears" (paragraph 8) and sustained through contradictory images: the bride's "terrible beauty" smile, the bead's warmth "seeping...like a second heartbeat," the final paradox of repaid debt and open wound. The lyric register and paradoxical phrasing maintain coherent melancholy-joy across turns. The tone charges the final image effectively, though it is stated mid-story rather than purely emergent. Setup, middle modulation, and closure charge all present.</comment>
