<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's grief-processing through "sandpapering rough memories" and her choice to share Kael's pain through touch show clear motivation, embodied through the salt-sting and phantom ache. However, the emotional contagion mechanic (feeling his daughter's drowning) arrives as fully-formed backstory rather than building contradiction on the page. The final choice—"remembering her without drowning in it"—edges toward therapeutic label-speak and lacks the visible cost of what Maren forfeits by taking on his burden. Kael's arc from stasis to motion is clean but his interiority remains thin; we see his grief described more than enacted in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Maren comes to "subdue" Kael, their contact transmits memories, and her sharing his grief enables his departure. Orientation anchors (desert fortress, Maren, Kael, pavilion) arrive early. The closure—Kael standing and walking out with Maren after her hand-squeeze and dialogue persuasion—constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (Maren's memories are "lighter now, as if sharing his had diluted their weight"). One meaningful tightening occurs when she reaches for his hand despite the prickle, narrowing her options. The pavilion's coral pulsing "warm for the first time in centuries" at the threshold supplies a charged image that reweights prior material, supporting Resonant Reconfiguration as well. Cost is legible but somewhat diffuse; the story tells us Maren's memories lighten rather than showing a specific forfeiture or later tactic change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress, rain, pavilion, and coral anchor the setting vividly and early. Maren's kneeling to press her palm and analyze tidal formations supplies one micro-choice constrained by environment. The pavilion's "frozen heart" and coral's warmth at the threshold charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure. However, spatial choreography inside the pavilion is vague—Kael is "curled against the pavilion's frozen heart" but their relative positions and the pavilion's interior dimensions remain unclear. The rain and desert pressure are atmospheric but do not alter tactics; the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than lived-in constraint during the central persuasion beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing Kael from grief that has "seeped into the very stones"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren chooses to grasp Kael's hand despite the contagion risk, and the contact floods her with his memories. The resolution is earned by Maren's active choice to share the weight, and Kael's standing and walking constitute a visible change. However, the escalation is primarily dialogic persuasion rather than a tested trade-off; Maren's own grief (mother's laughter, canyon walls) is mentioned but never brought into friction with Kael's. The cost—her memories "lighter" and his "eyes clear"—is stated rather than demonstrated through a later tactic shift or forfeiture. No persistent constraint (time, stamina, social credit) shapes their exchange beyond the touch-contagion itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tidal metaphor ("Grief isn't a monument...It's a tide") and the pavilion as both tomb and promise, cohering around memory, loss, and the choice to carry versus drown. The coral's warmth and tidal formations supply concrete particulars that accumulate meaning. The final image—"It's not a tomb...It's a promise"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the tide/drowning metaphor is stated explicitly by Maren rather than arising solely through image and action, and "sandpapering rough memories" edges toward abstraction. The piece avoids false equivalence (Kael's self-destructive stasis is challenged, not validated), and the fortress standing "sturdy brittle" supplies a non-literal encapsulation. Minor slip: "subsume" as a verb choice feels slightly elevated for the moment's emotional register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Maren is stable; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—tasting rain's memory, analyzing tidal patterns, sandpapering metaphor—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue ("You can't stay here" / "It's the only place that remembers her") is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Distance control is clean. However, "sturdy brittle" (used twice, once as narrative descriptor and once as dialogue tag echo) reads as authorial rather than Maren's interior idiom, and the phrase "subsume" in dialogue feels register-elevated for the scene's intimacy. Free indirect style is used effectively ("She'd learned long ago..."), and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor voice convergence: both Maren and the narrator use metaphoric diction at similar density, slightly flattening distinction between thought and narrative frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and specific ("adobe walls slick with the first rain in a decade," "hungry mouth," "coating her tongue with the taste of salt and regret"). Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. However, several loops and scaffold lines appear: "She could taste the rain's memory" is immediately restated as sensory detail; "His name was Kael, and his sorrow was emotionally contagious" front-loads exposition that could emerge through action; "The pavilion's entrance was half-buried, the coral's edges worn smooth" is followed by "Maren knelt, pressing her palm to the ground" without clear transition. The phrase "sturdy brittle" is repeated identically in two separate sentences, once as wall descriptor and once as voice quality. "Thick as syrup" and "grow teeth and claws" are competent but stock metaphors. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deduction to −0.8 for these combined issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of chef, emotional contagion through touch, coral pavilion beneath desert dunes, and tidal-analysis method offers surface novelty, but the emotional arc—stranger persuades grieving parent to leave memorial site—is familiar. The pavilion's impossible placement ("wasn't supposed to exist here") and Maren's memory-tasting ability are introduced but not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; they function as backdrop and vehicle rather than driving synthesis. The tide/drowning metaphor for grief is well-executed but conventional. "Sandpapering rough memories" supplies one fresh image. The final turn (coral warming, "promise" reframe) is earned in hindsight but predictable. No bold structural or perspectival risk-taking; the piece executes its premise competently within expected boundaries.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chef Maren is named and her ability to "taste memories" anchors early (rain's memory, salt from storm). The trait enables the key turn when she tastes Kael's "stored remorse, thick as syrup" through contact. However, her chef identity does not constrain or enable any on-page choice; the profession is label-only and could be swapped (e.g., "healer," "empath") without altering logic. The memory-tasting manifests as passive reception rather than active decision-making. Two-gate presence (setup, middle touch) without closure participation caps eligibility at ~6.0; the lack of chef-specific tactics or costs and swappability lower the score within that band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion appears early ("beneath the dunes, its frozen spires glinting"), is entered at midpoint (Kael "curled against the pavilion's frozen heart"), and returns charged at closure ("The tidal formations pulsed under her fingers, warm for the first time in centuries"). Three-gate presence and the warming coral at the threshold supplies closure linkage. However, the pavilion is described more than handled; Maren presses her palm twice but does not navigate its interior in tactile ways. The impossibility of coral ice beneath desert dunes is asserted but not leveraged as a constraint. Solid integration across beats and ending, but the specificity of "icebound" coral versus generic "frozen" relic is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Stored remorse" is named explicitly in the phrase "his stored remorse, thick as syrup, coating her tongue" at the key contact beat. It frames the stakes (Kael's grief has accumulated and "seeped into the very stones") and shapes Maren's tactic: she must share it to dilute its weight. The concept appears in setup (grief contagion), middle (hand contact), and closure (memories "lighter now, as if sharing his had diluted their weight"). However, "stored" as a descriptor is not functionally distinct from "lingering" or "accumulated" grief; the story does not explore unique properties of storage (e.g., retrieval, decay, compression) that would make the term irreplaceable. Three gates met but swappability and ornamental use of the exact term lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious through touch is signaled early ("one brush of his fingers, and she'd felt the weight of his daughter's drowning") and demonstrated twice: first as backstory (prior contact) and crucially when "her knee brush[es] his sleeve" and later "Maren reached for his hand, ignoring the way her skin prickled at the contact. His memories flooded her." The trait constrains Maren's approach (she hesitates, then chooses to grasp despite the cost) and enables the resolution (sharing dilutes weight). Visible cost: "phantom ache," "skin prickled," taking on his flood of memories. Three gates with causal pressure and cost. Minor dock: the contagion mechanism is told rather than discovered; we are informed of the rule before seeing it tested.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears once in dialogue: "But you can't let it subsume you." The verb is thematically apt (Kael is being consumed by grief) but does not drive a major turn; it restates what has already been shown (he's trapped, curled against the frozen heart). The word is replaceable with "consume," "drown," "swallow" without altering structure. It does not appear in the closure image or shape tactics. Late middle appearance (second half) and ornamental use cap the score; no distinct beat involvement beyond the single line of dialogue.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Analyzing tidal pool formations" is enacted on-page: "Maren knelt, pressing her palm to the ground, analyzing tidal pool formations etched into the stone. The patterns told her where the water had once been, where it had retreated, leaving only the ghost of its shape." The method signals Maren's expertise and connects to Kael's parallel act ("Kael had done the same...traced the absence of his daughter in the sand"). It appears in setup and middle. However, the analysis does not constrain a choice or shape tactics; Maren's persuasion proceeds through dialogue and touch, not through insights gleaned from the formations. The method is present but functionally ornamental; removing it would not break the story's logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain anchors early ("adobe walls slick with the first rain in a decade") and supplies vivid atmosphere. Rain's cessation marks the emotional shift ("Outside, the rain had stopped, the desert drinking the last of the storm"). The fortress walls return at closure ("standing sturdy brittle against the night") as a charged image. Three-gate presence and the rain-to-drought transition parallels the emotional arc. However, the fortress and rain do not constrain choices; the setting is symbolic rather than tactical. The rain could be swapped for any weather event that "ends" without breaking causality. Strong atmospheric integration but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" does not appear as a legible timeframe anchor. The story unfolds in linear present action (Maren arrives, finds Kael, persuades, they leave) with no sleep, waking, or dream motif present. Backstory mentions (mother's laughter, daughter's drowning) are memories, not dreams. No clock or urgency tied to this phrase. The element is effectively absent; score reflects minimal ornamental presence if "unspoken dream" is charitably mapped to the pavilion as dreamlike relic, but that reading is a stretch.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"To sandpaper rough memories" is Maren's explicit motivation: "She'd spent years sandpapering rough memories, smoothing the edges of her own grief until it was something she could carry without bleeding." The metaphor frames her approach and contrasts with Kael's festering grief. It appears in setup (implied by her role) and middle (stated). However, the desire is told in summary rather than dramatized through on-page friction; we do not see Maren actively sanding a memory or choosing between smoothing and preserving sharpness. The metaphor is vivid but the motivation itself does not drive a turn or closure choice. Two gates (setup, middle reflection) without closure participation cap around ~6.0; specificity of the sandpaper image adds a modest lift.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sturdy brittle" appears twice: once describing Maren's voice and again describing the fortress walls at closure. The oxymoron captures the story's tension (strength under fragility) and modulates with pressure. However, the tone is applied rather than emergent; the phrase is inserted as descriptor rather than arising from syntax, rhythm, or image density. The final use ("standing sturdy brittle against the night") charges the closing image but feels slightly forced—walls are typically sturdy or brittle, not both simultaneously without further grounding. Two-beat presence (middle, closure) with thematic resonance but somewhat ornamental application; the exact phrasing is more authorial flourish than narrative necessity.</comment>
