<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession and interior stance are established early, and her choice to walk away at the end shows agency. However, her motivations remain somewhat abstract—"salvager of echoes" seeking "something pure" reads more as atmospheric labeling than embodied contradiction. The decision to never tell lacks visible cost on the page; we see her exhale and leave, but no dramatized forfeiture of a concrete option or relationship. Internal conflict is asserted ("weaves truth carefully") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece infers a Hybrid lens (accumulative dream-fragments building toward a situational final encounter). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (shrine, glacier, snow globe). The closure—Mara's conversation with the red-coated woman and her decision to keep the secret—lands on the page, but the cost is more declared ("Some wrecks were meant to stay buried") than felt through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. The week of descendant visits compresses causality into summary, weakening the because/therefore chain that would earn the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candle-lit and carved into ice, anchors early and recurs (altar, ice groaning, walls fogging breath). The snow globe functions as micro-setting, handled twice (cupped in palms, placed back on altar) and the ripple/tear moment charges the final exchange. Sensory detail is purposeful: residual warmth, fogged glass, ice groaning. The setting constrains Mara's ritual work and the final image of her walking into "borrowed starlight" ties environment to theme, lifting this into solid high-6/low-7 range despite the week of travel being spatially vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging something pure, then discovering sabotage—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara realizes the red-coated woman was the saboteur. The dream-to-descendants arc provides accumulative pressure, but the week of interviews is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening escalation. The final choice to stay silent lacks a visible trade-off; no on-page consequence (a relationship severed, a tool abandoned, a future option foreclosed) makes the cost tangible. One meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of dramatized price caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth, silence, and the ethics of salvage—emerges from the snow globe, dream fragments, and the sabotage revelation without overt moralizing. The red-coated woman's final question ("Ask the ones who lived") and Mara's refusal to tell offer a non-literal answer to the central question. However, "Some wrecks were meant to stay buried" edges toward a thesis statement, and the piece leans on atmospheric labels ("windows of connection," "salvager of echoes") rather than letting all meaning arise from concrete action. The ending resonates but does not fully reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-gothic texture ("borrowed starlight," "thieves," "truth woven carefully into her bones") that fits the shrine-and-ice milieu. However, several phrases trend toward purple: "weaves truth carefully, never rushing" interrupts narrative with meta-commentary, and "salvager of echoes" reads as self-conscious branding. The dialogue in the final exchange is economical and carries subtext, but the narration occasionally tells interiority ("Mara realized") rather than embodying perception. Perceptual signature is present but not distinct enough to enter high 7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance; no major loops or template runs. However, several lines carry ornamental figuration without causal work: "ancient breath whispering back," "truth woven carefully into her bones," and the snow globe's tear "catching the light" are atmospheric but not informationally dense. The phrase "weaves truth carefully, never rushing, never assuming" interrupts momentum with authorial aside rather than grounding in action. A minor paraphrase loop appears: "The dead didn't speak in words. They spoke in symbols" restates without added pressure. These keep the piece in mid-6s despite generally clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer profession and dream-analysis method offer fresh genre synthesis, and the sabotage twist transforms the haunting premise. The glacier shrine and melted snow globe provide tactile specificity. However, the "salvager of echoes" frame and the moral of buried secrets trend toward familiar templates; the emotional arc (idealistic seeker confronts dark truth, chooses silence) is executed clearly but does not fully surprise. The snow globe's final animation (woman inside, tear sliding) leans on a stock haunting beat. Solid transformation of tropes, but not bold enough for high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara (wreck-diver ghost whisperer) is present throughout and makes the final choice to stay silent. Her profession shapes her visits to descendants and her ritual at the shrine. However, many beats describe her rather than showing decisions that alter tactics: she listens, collects fragments, places the snow globe back. The closure choice—to never tell—is on the page but passive (a refusal without visible cost or trade-off). Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development is observational. Causal pressure is light. Score: low 5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in paragraph one (setup), is cupped and examined (beat one), placed back on the altar (beat two), and ripples with the woman inside at closure (beat three). Its melted form symbolizes truth burned too bright, and the final tear reweights it as a window of connection. The object enables the dream and frames the final encounter. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (its melted state matters). Three gates, three beats, charged reprise. High 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named early as Mara's belief system and shapes her shrine work, but it functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint. The snow globe serves as one such window, but the concept itself does not narrow options or create a specific cost on the page. It echoes at closure ("Some windows of connection should stay closed") but remains abstract. Setup present, thematic participation at end, but no middle beat where the concept changes tactics. Two gates, one thematic mention. Mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears once as a narratorial aside ("She weaves truth carefully, never rushing, never assuming") but does not constrain an on-page action or create visible trade-off. The attribute is told, not shown through a choice where care costs time or safety. No setup as her trait in action, no middle beat where it shapes tactics, no closure linkage. Present as label only. Swappable. Low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Expose" appears explicitly: "This time, Mara would expose her." The action drives the week of descendant interviews and the discovery of sabotage (middle beat). At closure, Mara chooses *not* to expose the truth, reversing her stated goal. The action shapes two beats and the final stance, but the week of investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening causal pressure. Two gates (setup, closure inversion), decent beat involvement, but moderate swappability (could be "reveal" or "uncover"). High 5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is named early and structures the descendant interviews (baker's drowning hallway, fisherman's porthole, librarian's seawater). It enables the discovery that the red-coated woman is the saboteur. The mechanics matter: Mara collects fragments "like shards of glass" and fits them together. Three gates (setup, middle beats, closure causality). Beat involvement is strong, though the interviews are summarized. Causal pressure is moderate. Mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice is introduced in sentence one and recurs: Mara presses her forehead to the ice, the shrine hums, the ice groans, her breath fogs the walls. It functions as her "office, confessional, last hope" and frames both the opening and closing beats. The setting supplies the snow globe and constrains her ritual. The final image of her walking out ties the shrine to closure. Three gates, multiple beats, solid irreplaceability. The setting does not force a tactical choice under pressure, capping it in mid-6s rather than 7+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation—"to salvage something pure from the wreckage"—is stated explicitly and drives Mara's week-long search. At closure, she realizes "all she'd found was another layer of ruin" and chooses silence, a friction between want (purity) and cost (complicity). However, the desire is told rather than shown through a specific on-page micro-choice where purity conflicts with another need. The final renunciation lands but feels more thematic than viscerally dramatized. Three gates, decent friction, moderate felt cost. Low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears only in the final sentence, charging Mara's exit with a tone of transience and ethical ambiguity. The phrase coheres with the candle-lit, melted, and ice-bound imagery throughout (residual warmth, fogged glass, flickering shrine). Tone modulates: lyric-atmospheric in the shrine, more procedural during the interviews, quiet and elegiac at closure. However, the tone element itself arrives late and does not shape earlier beats. One gate (closure), strong coherence, but no setup or middle development. Mid-5s.</comment>
