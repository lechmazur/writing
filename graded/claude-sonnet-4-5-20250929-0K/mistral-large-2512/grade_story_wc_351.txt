<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's internal stance is clear—a shift from collector to modifier—but the emotional throughline relies heavily on reflective assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The woman-in-the-mirror encounter offers promising friction, yet Lena's final choice to preserve the cracks feels arrived-at rather than fought-for; the cost (inheriting the woman's unfinished dream) is told more than shown. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("helix-minded precision flickering between obsession and despair") without grounding the flicker in a concrete micro-choice that alters her present action. The renunciation earns partial credit, but the protagonist's internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene that would lift this into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "helix-minded" and "synaptic plasticity" remain abstract labels until near the end. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the mirror's fractures gather meaning through reflection and the woman's whispered advice, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Lena chooses preservation over repair. Cost is implied—she inherits the woman's incompleteness—but the final image ("her heart a quaking reverie") asserts emotional charge rather than anchoring it in a concrete, final sensory beat. The closure lands under the chosen lens with visible renunciation, though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon provides atmospheric grounding, and the mirror's fractures function as micro-setting that constrains Lena's choice at closure (she cannot erase them without erasing the memory). Sensory detail is selective—moonlight pooling, dust, the mirror growing cold—yet the canyon itself remains more backdrop than active pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (kneel, press mirror to wall, trace fractures), but the environment does not meaningfully limit her options or supply a resource that alters outcome; the final choice hinges on reflection rather than spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to modify or preserve the broken mirror—is signaled early and tightens through the woman's whispered advice ("You don't have to fix it"). The escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens: Lena's understanding shifts from technical repair to ethical witness, and the choice to retain the fractures forecloses the path of "making whole." Visible cost is present (she inherits the woman's certainty-loss), but the pressure remains largely internal and reflective; no external complication or second character tests her resolve, so the tightening lacks a second beat of friction that would push this into the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through the mirror's fractures as a recurring image: the story asks whether incompleteness should be repaired or honored, and Lena's final choice reweights the premise without stating a moral. The woman's voice ("Just remember it") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that avoids sermonizing. However, phrases like "archeologist of abandoned dreams" and "curator, a witness, a thief who stole nothing but the right to remember" drift toward thematic self-annotation, especially in the penultimate paragraph. The ending image—"her heart a quaking reverie"—reaches for emotional charge but leans on abstract assertion rather than a concrete sensory particular that would ground the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is poetic and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie") and purposeful compression in the mirror-vision beat. However, several phrases feel writerly rather than character-bound: "entangled memories clung to the mirror like static," "synaptic plasticity, though not in the way neuroscientists understood it," and "chaotically precise" read as narrative glosses rather than Lena's lived idiom. The final paragraph's self-definition ("She wasn't an archeologist anymore, not really. She was something else—") pulls the reader out of immediacy into meta-commentary. No head-hopping, and the focalization remains stable, but the register occasionally elevates beyond what the scene's pressure would warrant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "The fractures were part of the story now, part of the memory. To erase them would be to erase the woman entirely" restates the same idea across two sentences without added pressure. The opening's "helix-minded precision flickering between obsession and despair" is never concretely demonstrated on the page. Stock phrasing appears in peak beats—"her breath hitched," "her own certainty wavering"—and the final image ("her heart a quaking reverie") relies on poetic assertion rather than a concrete sensory anchor. Template cadence in the woman-in-the-mirror beat (three consecutive "she had" constructions) flattens rhythm. Figurative density is high ("shadows stretching like fingers," "moonlight into jagged constellations," "memories bled into objects") without always serving scene pressure, approaching overwriting in aggregate. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock beats, −0.4 for template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—a woman who modifies inherited memories through objects—offers a fresh angle, and the mirror's fractures as irreplaceable record is a strong choice. However, the core turn (preserve rather than repair) feels thematically predictable once the woman's whisper arrives; the piece does not surprise in its emotional arc. Phrases like "archeologist of abandoned dreams" and "synaptic plasticity" gesture toward originality but remain abstract rather than rooted in verifiable, lived detail. The transformation test is partially met—the canyon and mirror are specific—but the emotional calculus (unfinished work, inherited certainty-loss) could apply to many relic-finder stories without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena is identified as "helix-minded" (a stand-in for engineer-like precision) and her choices frame the story, but no decision visibly alters tactics under constraint. The shift from collector to modifier is asserted early, and the final choice (preserve the mirror) is made without on-page friction or a second option tested. The character drives the ending, but "helix-minded" remains a label without mechanistic demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror appears in four beats: discovery mention, the canyon-wall examination, the woman's vision, and the final tucking-away. Its fractures constrain Lena's final choice (erasing them would erase the memory) and charge the closure image. Early signal is present, it enables the peak vision beat, and the ending hinges on its broken state. Strong integration, though the mirror's periscope origin is never functionally used—any cracked reflective surface would work equally well, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Entangled memories are described ("memories clung to the mirror like static," "memories bled into objects") and the woman's face flickers as evidence, but the concept does not constrain a choice or generate visible cost. Lena's method is to "isolate the right frequency," yet no on-page attempt fails or forces a tactical shift. The concept flavors the premise and theme but remains passive; it does not alter options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" appears once as a descriptor of Lena's movements when adjusting the mirror. The trait is illustrated in that moment (deliberate yet instinct-guided), but it does not enable or constrain any decision with visible cost. The attribute feels ornamental—remove it and the scene plays identically. No setup earlier, no payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Modify" is Lena's stated goal early ("she wanted to modify, to reshape the past") and the closure hinges on her decision not to modify (preserve the fractures instead). The action frames the central question and the final renunciation. However, no on-page modification attempt is dramatized—she considers it, then declines—so the action's mechanics never shape a beat. Present in setup and payoff, but the middle beat involves observation rather than active modification trial.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" is mentioned as Lena's method midway through, but its mechanics are glossed ("not in the way neuroscientists understood it") rather than demonstrated. The mirror-pressing and frequency-isolating could be any mystical practice; nothing about synaptic plasticity as a specific means constrains her approach or differentiates this attempt from generic psychometry. Swappable with "psychic resonance" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is anchored early and provides atmospheric coherence. The moonlight pooling is used as a resource (Lena presses the mirror where light is thickest), and the canyon "hums" in opening and closing, creating a tonal frame. However, the setting does not pressure Lena's choice—she could make the same decision indoors—and spatial features (canyon edge, dust) remain scenic rather than tactical. The micro-setting (the mirror itself) does more work than the macro-environment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is declared early ("her period of profound transformation") and Lena self-identifies the shift from collector to modifier. However, the transformation is asserted rather than dramatized across multiple choices; we see only the final decision in this single scene. No live clock tightens tactics, and the "period" feels more like backstory context than an on-page pressure. Present but vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lena's desire "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated early and her final self-description ("curator, witness, thief") shows her wrestling with the role. The motivation drives her presence in the canyon and her engagement with the mirror. However, the desire is articulated more than conflicted—no friction between this goal and a competing want appears on the page. The ending affirms the motivation without testing its cost against an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" appears in the final line as a tonal anchor, and the prose maintains a dreamlike, reflective register throughout (lyric descriptions, the woman's whispered vision). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly—more urgent during the mirror-pressing, softer at the close—but the single mood (meditative wonder) persists without sharp tonal turn. The final image uses the phrase to charge the ending, earning lyric-reprise credit, though the effect is more asserted than embodied in sensory shift.</comment>
