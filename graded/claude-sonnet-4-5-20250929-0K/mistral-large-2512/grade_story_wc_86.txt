<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows embodied motivation through the drawer pull talisman and interior debate about untethering, but his characterization leans abstract—wisdom-recycling and father-house metaphors dominate where specific contradictory impulses in the moment would sharpen. Seris is largely label-functional ("uncommonly thoughtful" told more than shown). The final turn feels contemplative rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; Elias steps back but we don't see what he's renounced or gained in that retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly; the exchange setup is clear. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: mist, moon phases, drawer pull, and parapet recur to build atmosphere. However, closure is weak—the ending offers mood and motion ("turned toward the path") but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The prisoners never arrive on the page, the heirloom/spymaster swap dissolves into setup, and the final image ("Some mistakes were recycled into wisdom") is assertion rather than earned shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet is vivid and persistent: slick stones, mist, sea below, wind modulations. Moon-phase detail and the drawer pull anchor micro-setting. Spatial choreography (Elias and Seris stepping toward/away) remains clear. The setting pressures tone but does not constrain a tactical choice or charge the closure image in a way that would elevate into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prisoner-exchange stake is declared but never tested on the page—the spymaster and heirloom remain props, and the exchange itself occurs off-page ("The prisoners would arrive soon"). Seris and Elias trade tokens (drawer pull shown as proof, locket received), but these gestures lack friction or cost. No reversal narrows options; the scene ends before escalation pays off, capping pressure in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of mistakes-recycled-into-wisdom threads through reflection and the drawer pull motif. The parapet and moon-synchronization gesture at fragile peace and negotiation's precarity. Yet the ending states the theme ("Some mistakes were recycled into wisdom") rather than embodying it through a non-literal final image or realized cost. Subtext in the Elias/Seris exchange (brief contact, corrective "thoughtful") is present but underdeveloped, and the central question dissolves into contemplation rather than resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited holds steady; Elias's perceptual signature (salt/mist/father's house anchor) is consistent. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("They always do"). Diction fits the voice without drift. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess. The piece enters the 7-band on clean control but lacks the rhythmic tightening under peak pressure or elision-payoff structure that would push higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and clean: "parapet clung like a scar," "blade above the sea," "burned" contact. Rhythm varies; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor density loss in the middle (moon-phase exposition, repeated mention of untethering without new stakes) and the final paragraph's summary mode ("Some mistakes were recycled") soften momentum. Information density is good but not exceptional; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prisoner-exchange negotiation on a parapet is recognizable; the moon-synchronization and drawer-pull talisman add specificity but remain atmospheric rather than transformative. The uncommonly-thoughtful diplomat and recycled-mistakes framing echo negotiation-thriller and literary-redemption templates without a sharp, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional honesty is present but the premise does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is on the page as negotiator throughout; he chooses the parapet location and times the exchange via moon phases (setup + middle development). He makes no pivotal choice that alters the exchange or forecloses a path at closure—he steps back, the exchange remains pending. Two-gate presence plus causal setup work earns mid-5s; lack of decisive turn caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drawer pull appears early (pocket, traced, "talisman"), reappears mid-scene ("Proof"), and is pocketed with the locket near the end, then referenced in the final line ("warm in his pocket"). Three beats, reweighted from father-house relic to proof-token to carried wisdom. Participates in closure framing but does not causally shape the final choice, so caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Neutral territory (the parapet, "no man's land") is named early, shapes the choice of location ("Too high for ambushes, too exposed for secrets"), and remains the frame throughout. It enables the meeting but does not constrain a tactical choice or transform at closure—it stays backdrop. Setup + development present; closure linkage is thematic only, placing the score in low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is attributed to Seris in exposition ("he'd heard") and echoed once when she corrects "Clever" to "Thoughtful." No on-page action demonstrates the trait under pressure or trades it off against cost. Label-only mention trends low; the corrective moment adds slight function but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Untether" recurs: Elias "untethered himself from" his father's house (backstory), imagines untethering from this negotiation life mid-scene, and the concept frames his arc. Setup + thematic development present. However, no decisive on-page untethering action occurs—he turns away but the exchange is incomplete. Lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-5s but the action itself is not causally pivotal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase synchronization is explained mid-scene ("spent weeks synchronizing… ensuring neither side could strike under cover of darkness") and the locket's moon-phase etchings echo it at the end. Setup + brief closure nod. But the mechanics never constrain an attempt or alter a tactic on the page—it remains explained context. Two-gate presence without causal work places it in upper-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet is introduced immediately, dominates sensory texture (mist, salt, wind, stone), and Elias chose it for tactical reasons ("precarious balance… too high for ambushes"). It pressures staging (Seris/Elias movements), charges atmosphere, and the final departure ("path down the cliff") closes on it. Setup + middle tactical shaping + closure presence with atmospheric cost earns low-7s; lacks a choice-altering resource moment for higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" appears once as metaphor for the negotiation pause ("a space neither had dared to name"). It frames tone but no clock or deadline tightens tactics—dawn is mentioned but the exchange doesn't occur. Setup metaphor only, no middle or closure development, caps at upper-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recycle mistakes into wisdom" is Elias's stated motivation (early: "why he did this work") and returns in the final line. It colors his reflections (father, spymaster friendship) but does not friction a choice—no moment where recycling competes with another want under pressure. Setup + thematic close without dramatized conflict places it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears late ("the silence remained, a furrowed hush") but the tone—quiet, mist-soaked, wind-modulated—pervades from the opening and modulates subtly (wind howls, then dies). The hush charges the parting moment and carries into the ending. Coherent throughout with a final accent; late explicit phrase and lack of sharp pressure modulation keep it in mid-6s.</comment>
