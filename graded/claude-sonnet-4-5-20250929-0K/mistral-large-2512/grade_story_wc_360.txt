<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map emotion mathematically is signaled, but his interior contradictions remain largely told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The borrowed-personality trait operates as a label with atmospheric effects (the poet's voice, the mathematician's precision) rather than constraining a pivotal on-page decision with visible cost. The woman's arrival introduces a second character, but no relationship crucible emerges; her presence does not force Elias into a choice that alters their dynamic or his stance. Embodied emotion is present in the humming fragment and aching teeth, yet the final hollowing reads as summary rather than earned renunciation with legible foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and conceptual density increase through the press work, fragment hum, and borrowed voices, culminating in the dissolution and quiet finale. Orientation anchors (Elias, topaz workshop, stars vanishing) arrive early and hold. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias stands alone, hollow, equations waiting—but the cost remains oblique: the fragment dissolves, borrowed voices unravel, yet no prior option or tactic is visibly foreclosed on the page. The mathematician's line "The universe doesn't care about your feelings. It only cares about the numbers" gestures toward conceptual repricing, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or a felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and dying starlight are vivid and repeatedly invoked: refracted rainbows, pulsing walls, glass floor. The halo fragment functions as a micro-setting object that Elias touches and that hums, and its dissolution at the end charges the final image. The book *The Geometry of Grief*, ink-stained fingers, and the letterpress constrain Elias's physical actions and anchor his obsessive project. However, the workshop does not visibly constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—it remains evocative backdrop rather than a force that narrows options at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding emotion's mathematics) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs: the woman's arrival and the fragment's dissolution narrow the physical setup, but Elias's agency in that moment is passive—he borrows her voice, the fragment dissolves at her touch, not his decision. No on-page reversal or choice forecloses a live option with visible cost; the equations "still there, waiting" implies stasis rather than a reweighted path. Pressure accumulates texturally (humming fragment, borrowed voices layering) but does not escalate causally to force a trade-off that the protagonist enacts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—emotion as quantifiable versus ineffable, empathy as theft—emerges from the equations, borrowed personalities, and the fragment's hum rather than stated outright. The final image (Elias hollow, equations waiting, fragment dissolved) offers a resonant non-answer, but the conceptual cost is oblique: the protagonist's mind goes quiet, yet no prior particular is decisively reweighted. The mathematician's aphorism "empathy isn't a bridge—it's a theft" flirts with thematic echo, stopped short of the final paragraph but still close enough to reduce emergent discovery. Subtext operates in the fragment's hum and the woman's knowing arrival, yet the ending does not compel reflection beyond the immediate plot loop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: ink "that smelled of old parchment and copper," equations "like a predator's grin," fragment hum "like a choir tuning itself in a language without vowels." The borrowed-personality device creates purposeful register shifts (poet's smoke-drift metaphor, mathematician's dry precision), but those shifts are framed as external voices rather than Elias's own psychic distance modulation, which holds voice coherence. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with the woman); her lines feel functional but lack distinct idiom. The prose texture is lyric and compressed, but some figurative density risks decorative drift: "stars being unremembered," "joy's velocity," "topaz walls pulsed with light" cluster without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and figurative language is dense: "gaps like missing teeth in the cosmos," "love was a parabola and despair a descending asymptote," "equation that looked like a predator's grin." Clarity holds except where metaphoric vehicles pile without causal linkage (e.g., "transposed empathy" anchors ribs "like barnacles" adjacent to "variables refusing to hold still"). Paraphrase loop detected: paragraph 3 restates Elias's motivation ("to understand the mathematics of emotion") in adjacent sentences without added pressure. Artifact: "deliberate ambiguity was his method—he never explained, never clarified, because to name a thing was to kill it" reads as thematic summary mid-beat rather than dramatized action, stalling momentum. Filter-verb reliance ("He didn't know," "she said," "he wore") is moderate and voice-motivated, not stacked heavily in peak beats. Information density is uneven: the ∂f/∂t equation and halo fragment carry specificity, but the borrowed voices cycle through atmospheric metaphor without tightening the physical plot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress operator mapping emotion via equations, borrowing personalities, handling a halo fragment under dying stars—feels specific and non-obvious. The topaz workshop, *Geometry of Grief* title, and the differential equation ∂f/∂t = -k(1 - f²) supply memorable detail. However, the core arc (obsessive scholar touches mysterious object, stranger warns, object dissolves, scholar left hollow) follows a recognizable template without a decisive transformation: the ending resets Elias to solitude and waiting rather than forcing a non-obvious moral calculus or lived-in consequence. Risk-taking in voice (lyric density, borrowed-personality conceit) heightens atmosphere but does not fully cohere with causal escalation, leaving the piece between strong execution of familiar beats and a fresh stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his hands set type, touch the fragment, and borrow voices, but his decisions do not create key turns. The woman's arrival and the fragment's dissolution happen to him; he borrows her voice reactively. His final stance—standing alone, mind quiet—is an outcome rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Setup present, middle touches numerous (setting type, handling fragment), closure participation weak (passive witness). Causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (corner of workbench, embedded in book spine), is handled mid-story (Elias touches it, hum vibrates through bones), and dissolves at the ending, charging the final image. Three distinct beats. However, its properties (hum, glow, dissolution) remain atmospheric; no on-page choice hinges on the fragment's mechanics. Closure linkage strong (dissolution caps the arc), causal pressure moderate (enables the borrowed-voice crescendo but does not narrow tactics). Irreplaceability high (unique object), cost connection oblique (fragment gone, Elias hollow, but the trade-off is not legible as his decision).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named once ("the feelings didn't belong to him, yet they anchored themselves to his ribs like barnacles") and illustrated through borrowed voices (poet, mathematician, woman). It does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Elias does not face a choice between empathy modes or suffer a visible consequence for borrowing. The concept functions as thematic label rather than mechanical constraint. Setup minimal, development ornamental, closure absent (the ending notes his mind is "quiet," but empathy mechanics do not drive that shift).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The habit of borrowing personalities is signaled early ("Elias habitually borrowed personalities") and demonstrated in multiple beats: poet's metaphor, mathematician's precision, woman's voice twisted. However, no on-page action with cost hinges on this trait—it colors interiority and voice without constraining a pivotal choice. Setup clear, beat involvement high (three borrowed voices), causal pressure low (no trade-off or foreclosed option tied to borrowing). The trait is specific and irreplaceable within the premise but does not reach functional necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Disorientation operates atmosphically: the poet's phrase "made the workshop tilt like a ship in a storm," the woman's arrival "the workshop trembled," and the final quiet after unraveling. No major turn traces causally to disorientation as an action Elias performs; instead, he experiences disorientation from borrowed voices and fragment effects. The ending's hollowness reads as result, not a choice to disorient. Setup modest, development passive (things disorient him), closure weak (the effect is present but not Elias's enacted tactic).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is named mid-story ("Deliberate ambiguity was his method—he never explained, never clarified, because to name a thing was to kill it") but the mechanics do not shape on-page attempts or alter tactics. The borrowed voices and fragment hum remain ambiguous to the reader, yet that ambiguity is not Elias's chosen tool in a dramatized beat. Setup label-only, development absent (no choice constrained by maintaining ambiguity), closure not tied to this method. Swappable with "intuitive exploration" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is vivid and recurrent: glass floor, refracted starlight, pulsing walls, domed structure. It anchors the entire scene spatially and supplies the dying-stars timeframe. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias could pursue his equations elsewhere with minor edits. Setup strong (first paragraph), beat involvement high (workshop details weave through action), closure participation moderate (darkness falls, workshop goes dark, but this is coincident with fragment dissolution, not causal). Micro-setting note: the letterpress and workbench constrain physical action but do not force a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stars vanishing brackets the narrative: "stars blinked out one by one" opens, "the last star vanished" precedes final darkness. The timeframe supplies atmosphere and a loose countdown but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—Elias does not race the clock or alter his approach as stars fade. Setup clear, development untracked (no mid-story check of remaining stars), closure present (last star vanishes) but the temporal pressure is implied rather than felt. Lyric reprise (first line to ending) reweights mood without mechanically constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is named early and drives his three nights of typesetting equations. The borrowed personalities and fragment handling serve that goal. However, friction between want and cost is told ("the equations kept slipping") rather than dramatized through a pivotal on-page trade-off. Setup strong, beat involvement moderate (press work, fragment touch), closure weak (equations "still there, waiting" implies stasis, not a choice that forecloses the pursuit). The motivation shapes premise but does not force a visible sacrifice at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone blends lyric precision ("ink that smelled of old parchment and copper") with turbulent imagery (stars vanishing, workshop tilting, borrowed voices layering, fragment glowing). The tone modulates with pressure: calm workbench opening, crescendo through borrowed voices and woman's arrival, quiet hollowing at the end. Coherence holds through turns, and the final image (darkness, silence, equations waiting) charges the ending with lucid calm after turbulence. However, "lucid turbulence" as a descriptor fits the middle beats more than the resolution, which reads as earned stasis rather than sustained turbulence. Closure linkage strong, modulation present, tone specificity moderate.</comment>
