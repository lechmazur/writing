<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's claustrophobia and desire for space drive her onto the trellis, and her relationship with the doll provides embodied interiority. The boy's appearance dilutes focus without deepening conflict, and his recognition-grin feels unearned. Liora's final nod toward "next time" suggests endurance but the cost remains abstract—what path has she foreclosed by climbing, and what has she learned that changes her stance toward the bunker? The embodied fear ("walls pressed in like ribs") works, but the ending choice lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens: gravity inverts, the trellis appears, Liora climbs despite her father's prohibition. Orientation anchors (bunker child, inverted world, trellis) arrive early. The encounter with the boy and the doll exchange deepen her stance, and the final "next time" nod crystallizes her resolve to return—a Charged Poise moment where options are reconfigured. Cost is implied (she will endure the bunker knowing escape exists) but not viscerally demonstrated on the page; pointing to a specific sentence where the price lands is difficult, triggering a moderate deduction per the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inverted world is vividly rendered: clouds as ceiling, vines like fingers, silence that "tastes like ozone and possibility." The trellis itself acts as micro-setting, its spongy vines and groaning structure physically present under Liora's feet. The porcelain doll's growing weight and the shift in gravity pressure her movement. The sensory hierarchy (listening to "flavors of different silences") reflects her bunker-trained attention. The trellis constrains her path and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Liora's need for space versus her father's prohibition—is clear early. Her decision to step onto the trellis despite claustrophobia provides one meaningful tightening under the situational lens. The boy's dialogue and the doll exchange deepen her understanding but do not escalate pressure; his "next time" line is a micro turn, not a reversal. Gravity's inversion creates urgency, yet the cost of her choice (returning to the bunker, now knowing freedom exists) remains conceptual rather than viscerally demonstrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of confinement and first freedom: the bunker's crushing walls versus the trellis's open sky, the doll as maternal tether transformed into a burden Liora carries for herself. The boy's line—"maybe you were always the one who was supposed to keep it safe"—reweights the doll without overt moralizing. The final image (nodding, knowing there will be a next time) resists neat closure and offers a quiet answer to whether she can endure the bunker now that she's tasted space. The "gilded hush" and silence motifs accumulate without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Liora's sensory vocabulary: "listening to the flavors of different silences," silence that "tasted like ozone," the doll "intangibly tangible." Her perceptual signature (parsing echoes, thud, breath-hitching vents) is consistent and particularized. The boy's voice is distinct in cadence and ease, contrasting with Liora's hesitant interiority. Diction stays true to her bunker-trained awareness without register drift. The figurative density ("walls pressed in like the ribs of some great slumbering beast") is high but voice-motivated and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory specificity is strong ("spongy vines," "syrupy" whispers, "ozone and possibility"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "intangibly tangible, a ghost in her palm that refused to dissolve" restates the doll's paradox without added pressure, and "the world had tipped itself inside out" / "gravity inverted" paraphrase the same event. Template cadence appears in the doll-handling beats ("She didn't know why… only that"). The mixed metaphor of vines as "fingers… reaching not to pull her down, but to lift her up" is legible but borders on overwriting. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inverted-gravity trellis premise is fresh, and the claustrophobic child's first encounter with open sky offers a non-obvious angle on confinement narratives. The doll's transformation from maternal keepsake to self-kept burden is specific and earned. The "flavors of different silences" motif and the boy's unexpected presence synthesize familiar elements (threshold crossing, chance encounter) into a coherent vision. Risk-taking in the figurative density and situational design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a small within-band adjustment upward.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her decision to climb the trellis despite her father's prohibition and her own fear drives the central action. The choice is signaled early (father forbids, she climbs anyway) and shapes the middle beats (handling the doll, meeting the boy). Her final nod—"next time"—indicates resolve but the cost and tactical shift are not dramatized; we do not see her reckon with what returning to the bunker will now mean. Two gates (setup, development) are met; closure participation is implied but not causal. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice is hers but the stakes remain abstract at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The doll appears in the opening paragraph, is handled mid-scene when Liora pulls it out and offers it to the boy, and is tucked back into her pocket before the ending. The boy's line—"maybe you were always the one who was supposed to keep it safe"—reweights its meaning from maternal protection to self-reliance. Three gates (setup, middle use, closure participation) are met, and the object's meaning evolves. However, the doll does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is a carrier of theme rather than a tool under pressure. Score reflects solid lyric-resonance use without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gilded hush" is named once in paragraph six ("The gilded hush of the inverted world settled over her like a second skin") and echoed thematically in the silence motifs throughout. It does not shape stakes or constrain choices; Liora's actions (climbing, meeting the boy) would proceed identically without this phrase. The concept is ornamental, serving atmosphere rather than pressure. One-gate presence (middle descriptive mention) without development or closure linkage, plus swappability, caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" describes the doll in paragraph five: "its weight was intangibly tangible, a ghost in her palm that refused to dissolve." Later the doll "grew heavier with each step," suggesting the trait constrains her movement. Setup is clear; the middle beat (doll's increasing weight) hints at cost but does not alter tactics—Liora continues climbing regardless. No closure linkage beyond her tucking it back into her pocket. Two gates (setup, development) with modest causal pressure; the trait is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sprout" appears when the trellis is introduced: "The structure had sprouted overnight, or so the travelers said." This framing establishes the trellis as mysterious and organic, motivating Liora's curiosity and the world's strangeness. The sprouting recurs implicitly when vines twist "like living things." Setup and development are clear; the action primes the trellis's uncanny nature, which pressures Liora's choice to climb. Closure participation is indirect (the trellis sways as gravity shifts), and the sprouting itself is past-action reported. Solid two-gate integration with thematic charge but not irreplaceable—other origins would serve.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By limiting exposure" is mentioned once in paragraph nine: "By limiting exposure, she told herself, she could survive. One step at a time." It frames Liora's coping tactic but does not recur or shape the ending. The method is told rather than dramatized—no beat shows her withdrawing or pacing herself in a way that alters outcome. One-gate presence (middle self-talk) without setup or closure linkage, and easily swappable with any other incremental approach. Ornamental use without mechanical weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is introduced early (paragraph eight), dominates the middle action (Liora steps onto it, feels its spongy vines, hears it groan), and is present at closure when it "swayed beneath them, the vines creaking like old bones" as gravity shifts. The trellis provides the only path upward and constrains Liora's movement; its groaning and swaying create immediate physical pressure. Three gates met with strong causal and sensory integration. The "xenial" (hospitable) quality is implied through the boy's ease and the structure's role as bridge, though not explicitly dramatized. High score for indispensability and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion window is signaled in paragraph three and returns at closure: "She could feel gravity shifting, the world righting itself inch by inch." The timeframe creates urgency and pressures the meeting with the boy (he says "next time," acknowledging the window is closing). Setup and closure participation are clear. However, the middle beats do not track elapsed time or show Liora racing the clock; the hour functions as backdrop rather than live constraint. Two strong gates with moderate causal pressure; the timer matters but does not actively narrow tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to collect the flavors of different silences" is introduced in paragraph seven and reflected throughout her sensory attention: she parses echoes, notes the "ozone and possibility" silence, and tells the boy "the silence tastes different up here." The motivation is richly embodied and shapes her perceptual focus. However, it does not drive a key turn—her decision to climb stems from the need for space, not silence-collection. Three gates (setup, development, thematic closure) with strong specificity but indirect causal pressure. The desire enriches voice without forcing a choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone reads as compressed wonder with sensory density: "gilded hush," "voices frayed at the edges," "syrupy" whispers, silence "like honey left too long in the comb." The lush, distended descriptors ("stretching contracted") fit the inverted world and Liora's bunker-trained hypersensitivity. Tone modulates slightly when the boy appears (more conversational) but the figurative saturation holds steady without flattening under pressure. The final image (trellis swaying, boy's touch, Liora's nod) maintains the tone's charged, liminal quality. Coherent across beats and present at closure, though a single strong intensification rather than dynamic modulation.</comment>
