<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is visible—he's chasing signals—but his interior life remains thin; we see him hesitate and nod but not the contradictory impulses that would make the choice costly. The pilgrim is characterized almost entirely by her perpetual surprise, which functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action. The final decision to follow the call lacks visible forfeiture; we don't see what Elias is leaving behind or what competing need he's sacrificing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (observatory, Elias, pilgrim, dusk). The piece reads under a Situational lens: pressure accumulates as the chip pulses, the drone reveals the star trail, and the station appears, culminating in the pilgrim's invitation. Closure is Charged Poise—the call won't wait, options crystallize—but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what specific path Elias forecloses by powering down the drone and following her. The tightening is present but the price is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The observatory's brass teeth and ozone-and-parchment scent are vivid, and the dome's opening frames the action. The chip's warmth and glow constrain the pilgrim's handling and charge the final beat. However, spatial choreography between Elias and the pilgrim is vague—distance, posture, and movement are rarely specified—and the star cluster's appearance in the feed doesn't alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and tightens as the chip responds to the drone, the stars reveal patterns, and the station appears. The escalation is functional under the Situational lens, but agency is weak: the drone and chip do the work while Elias and the pilgrim watch. The final choice (powering down, following) feels more like acceptance than a decision with visible trade-offs. No on-page cost is shown—stamina, tool loss, social consequence—that would sharpen the commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—belonging as frequency rather than place—emerges through the chip's mechanics and the star-trail metaphor. "We're not lost, we're being called" reframes the search without stating a moral. However, the closing line ("The stars would wait. But the call wouldn't") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The pilgrim's perpetual surprise and Elias's dream-echo feel more like ornament than particulars that deepen the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (sharp eyes, rough voice, years pulling fragments) is present but not deeply textured under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext ("Not decode. Reveal.") and pursues goals cleanly. However, elevated diction—"perpetually surprised by everything, as if the universe had just whispered a secret"—clashes with Elias's rough interiority in several beats, and filter verbs ("watched," "felt") dull immediacy where embodied perception would sharpen it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "This was different. This was personal" in paragraph 3 restates without adding pressure; "You feel it too, don't you?" followed by "He did" recaps rather than advances. Template cadence runs appear in paragraph 4 ("Elias didn't answer. He had spent...") and paragraph 10 ("Elias didn't answer. He did."). The closure beat—"The stars would wait. But the call wouldn't"—reads as coda rather than image with propulsion. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, template stems −0.5, total −0.7 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—belonging as frequency decoded by star trails—offers a conceptual angle, but the execution leans on stock SF imagery: ancient observatory, drone goggles, hologram, glowing chip, mysterious pilgrim. The emotional arc (lone operator joins seeker) and the structure (reveal → recognition → invitation) follow a familiar template without specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The chip's foundry-matrix backstory is mentioned but never grounded in particular craft knowledge or social consequence. Derivative Premise adjustment: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias adjusts goggles, activates the drone, guides it, adjusts trajectory, zooms the camera, pulls it back, and powers it down. These actions span setup, middle, and closure. However, most moves are observational—he watches the feed—and the key choices (following the stars, powering down) are reactive rather than constrained by his sharp-eyed skill. The pilot attribute shapes staging but not the cost or outcome. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage (powers down) +0.7, swappability −0.6, observation-heavy −0.6, net ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The chip appears in paragraph 2 (setup), pulses in paragraph 5, grows warmer in paragraph 6, and is pressed to the receiver in paragraph 8 (middle and closure participation). It enables the frequency reveal and charges the final beat. However, its "type foundry matrix" property is ornamental—never explained or used—so the specific foundry detail is swappable. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, foundry specificity unused −0.8, net ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" appears in paragraph 2 as the pilgrim's phrase and recurs in paragraphs 9 and 11 as Elias's realization ("not out there...in here"). It frames the thematic question and reweights at closure. However, it never constrains a tactical choice or narrows options on the page; it functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping pressure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure absent −0.8, closure linkage (theme reprise) +0.8, label-only −0.3, net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The pilgrim is described as "perpetually surprised" in paragraphs 2, 5, and 7, and her surprise "deepens" and gives way to recognition in paragraph 9. The trait colors her presence but does not enable or constrain a choice with visible cost—she would perform the same actions (tracing the chip, pressing it to the receiver) without the surprise label. Early signal +0.4, three mentions in one beat cluster (no distinct functional beats) +0.4, causal pressure absent −0.8, label-only −0.3, net ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias "pulls" the drone back in paragraph 10, immediately before powering it down and committing to follow the pilgrim. This action concludes the star-trail sequence and pivots to the closure choice. However, "pull" here means "recall" rather than a physical struggle, and the move is reactive—he pulls back after seeing the station, not to test or resist. Early setup (drone launch) present, middle involvement (guiding/adjusting) present, closure participation strong +1.2, causal link to final choice +1.0, swappability (could be "recalled" or "brought back") −0.4, net ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Following star trails" is introduced by the pilgrim in paragraph 3, enacted by Elias in paragraph 6 ("following the stars"), and continues through paragraph 8 as the drone's camera tracks the cluster. The method shapes the middle beats and enables the discovery of the station. However, the mechanics are thin—point the drone at a breadcrumb cluster—without constraint or trade-off. Early signal +0.6, two beats (paragraphs 6 and 8) +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage weak (trail already revealed) +0.3, mechanics generic −0.5, net ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The observatory's dome opens in paragraph 1, its mechanisms groan in paragraph 5, and its "dim light swallow[s]" the pair in the final line. The brass teeth and ozone-parchment scent are vivid, and the dome frames the action. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Elias could operate the drone anywhere with a clear sky—and the micro-setting (walls, platform edge) is postcard description. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage (swallowed by light) +0.8, constraint absent −0.6, postcard elements −0.4, net ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" anchors the opening and drives Elias's recognition ("tonight was different"). The timeframe is continuous—dusk to darker—but the progression does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The final beat ("The stars would wait. But the call wouldn't") asserts time pressure that was not tracked on the page. Early signal +0.5, continuous frame +0.4, no tactical effect from elapsed time −0.8, asserted urgency at end without prior clock −0.6, net ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to decode the frequency of belonging" is signaled in paragraph 3 (his question to the pilgrim) and internalized in paragraph 7 ("a thread tugging at his chest") and paragraph 8 ("the sound of belonging"). It drives his engagement with the chip and drone. However, the motivation is told more than shown—he hesitates, then nods—without visible friction between competing wants or costs. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal link +0.7, closure tie +0.8, friction weak (no competing need dramatized) −0.9, told-heavy interiority −0.5, net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears in the opening (dusk, brass catching embers, stars blinking awake) and returns in the closing (dim light swallowing them). The tone—luminous but muted—modulates as the chip glows and the drone feed flickers, and it charges the final image. However, the tone label itself is never thematically weighted or used to constrain a choice; it functions as atmospheric coloring. Early signal +0.6, recurring through middle beats (glow, shadows, grainy feed) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, modulation under pressure +0.5, no causal pressure −0.6, label not dramatized −0.4, net ~5.1.</comment>
