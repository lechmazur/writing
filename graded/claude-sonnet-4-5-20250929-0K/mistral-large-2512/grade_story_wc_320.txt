<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her search is embodied through concrete actions (adjusting dials, pressing the fragment). However, her final "choice" to remain as the tower falls reads passive—she "didn't flinch" and "was already somewhere else" without an active decision or visible internal struggle at that moment. The epiphany "the beginning wasn't a moment to be found, but a state to be returned to" arrives as assertion rather than emerging from a contested choice under pressure. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("origins are illusions") rather than character-specific contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (radio tower city, lunar perigee, Mira). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through celestial signals → shard of hush → dissolution → vibration → final disappearance. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira adjusts from "searching" to "listening for the silence between." Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (she is "tuned to a frequency beyond sound, beyond time"), but the cost is implied rather than dramatically legible—she vanishes, yet the narrative insists she "found what she was looking for" without showing what was forfeited or what live option was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The suspended tower city and lunar perigee supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The tower's highest platform, groaning girders, and the gorge below create spatial pressure that culminates in the tower's fall. The Hollywood star fragment functions as a tool that constrains Mira's approach (she presses it to the input port, triggering the device's transformation). The perigee's pull operates as both setting and timeframe, warping signals and intensifying at the peak moment, directly charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the origin signal—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes "beginnings were just endings in disguise" and adjusts her method ("not by searching, but by discarding assumptions"). However, escalation is muted: the voice tells her the answer, she tunes differently, and the result arrives without visible cost or trade-off in tactics. The tower's collapse happens *to* her rather than being shaped by her choices, and coincidence (the perigee's peak timing) resolves the search rather than her agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—origins as illusions, beginnings and endings as one—emerges through concrete particulars: the fragment's dissolution, the "shard of hush," the vibration as "the universe remembering itself." The final image offers a non-literal answer (tuned beyond time) without overt moralizing. However, the voice's declaration "origins are illusions" and Mira's realization "the beginning wasn't a moment to be found, but a state to be returned to" edge toward abstract philosophizing rather than staying rooted in embodied consequence. The ending resonates but leans on stated insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person close, remains stable. Diction is distinct and controlled: "serenely electric," "shard of hush," "the universe remembering itself" create a specific perceptual signature. The voice stays consistent through turns, modulating from concrete action (adjusting dials) to lyric abstraction ("the silence between the signals") without jarring register shifts. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose under peak stress ("the tower trembled, its rusted bolts screaming") compresses effectively while maintaining internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure supports escalation. Information density is high ("the air thrummed with the echoes of old broadcasts and the whispers of distant stars" does three jobs: setting, atmosphere, stake). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("polished surface catching the moonlight like a mirror to another world"). Minor scaffold: "This was what she had been searching for" tells rather than shows the stakes shift, and "the tower groaned as if it, too, were straining to hear" anthropomorphizes without clear gain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signals, a Hollywood relic, and the suspended city over a gorge is specific and non-obvious. The premise—finding the beginning by discarding assumptions—transforms a familiar quest structure through the "shard of hush" and the frequency-tuning method. However, the emotional arc (seeker finds what she seeks through realization and vanishes) fits a recognizable template. The tower's collapse coinciding with Mira's transcendence feels convenient rather than causally inevitable. Risk-taking in diction and tone elevates the piece but does not fully disguise the arc's familiarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early, drives two beats (adjusting dials, pressing fragment to interpreter), and her interpretive stance shifts from searching to listening. However, her final "choice" is passive (she "didn't flinch" and "was already somewhere else"), weakening closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced early with backstory seed, handled twice (matched to anomaly on screen, pressed to input port), returns at closure ("lay in the wreckage, its glow fading"). Its geometry and dissolution enable the key turn, and its presence in the wreckage charges the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("shard of light pulsed"), recurs ("shard of hush"), and shapes the climax ("the shard of hush swallowed her whole"). It reweights the dominant stake (silence as origin rather than sound) and charges the ending. However, it operates more as metaphor than a constraint that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Appears twice as a descriptor ("humming serenely electric," "serenely electric glow") but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. It colors atmosphere without altering tactics or outcome; swappable with "steady," "tranquil electric" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (adjusting dials), drives the middle turn (she "adjusted the frequency, not to capture the first signal, but to listen for the silence between them"), and the final transformation hinges on this tuning action. Redefines her method and options at closure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled midpoint ("by discarding assumptions—letting go of the idea that the past was a fixed point"), directly enables the key tuning choice, and the ending validates the method (she found what she sought by listening rather than searching). Causal role is clear, though it could be compressed to "listening differently" with minor edit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Introduced early, supplies atmosphere and the physical constraint (rusted girders groaning, suspended over gorge). The tower's collapse at perigee peak creates the stakes and charges the final image (wreckage below). However, the gorge and suspension do not alter Mira's tactics; the collapse happens to her rather than forcing a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Present early ("tonight, the sky was alive with the perigee's pull"), recurs ("The perigee's pull intensified," "reached its peak"), and times the climax. It warps signals and tightens the window, but the clock does not force a visible trade-off in Mira's choices—she tunes when ready, and the perigee conveniently peaks as she succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stated early ("to find the beginning in every ending"), drives her cross-continental search, and is reweighted at closure ("beginnings and endings were the same"). The friction between wanting the origin and realizing "origins are illusions" creates thematic tension, but the cost of this realization is implied rather than dramatized through a contested choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Established early through diction ("serenely electric," "rusted girders," concrete tools and actions) and held through lyric turns ("the universe remembering itself") without jarring into pure abstraction. Tone modulates with pressure (from grounded observation to mystical dissolution) and charges the final image. However, the tonal shift from practicality to transcendence in the final third risks obscuring rather than deepening the stakes.</comment>
