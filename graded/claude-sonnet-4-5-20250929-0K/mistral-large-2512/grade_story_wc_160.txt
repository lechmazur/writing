<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to harmonize protection and honor is stated clearly but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The trembling hands are mentioned twice but function as labels rather than embodied degradation under stress. The climactic realization that "the floodgates weren't betrayal" feels delivered by the letter rather than earned through on-page struggle; her laugh arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal conflict remains conceptual summary rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the chain, envelope, and adhesive accumulate into a pattern that reweights Mira's understanding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance shifts from betrayal to continuation—but the cost is asserted ("past and present were no longer at war") rather than made visible in a forfeited option or tactical shift. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The letter's reveal provides the tightening, though it arrives via discovery rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater's "slow, rhythmic sigh of shifting stone" and "uneven, strained" breath create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Mira's internal state. The surveyor's chain as micro-setting object is handled twice and charges the final image when coiled around her wrist. Spatial choreography (steps, stage, dust) remains clear. The volcano's subterranean springs function as constraint shaping her floodgate work, lifting setting into active pressure rather than postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling protection with honoring the past—is signaled early and persists. The envelope discovery provides a meaningful turn, but it arrives through coincidence rather than Mira's agency. The resolution ("they were dancing") asserts harmony without showing a trade-off or visible price paid on the page. One tightening beat is present (reading the letter), sufficient for this length, but the final stance crystallization lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of balance versus control emerges organically through the floodgates and the surveyors' message. "The heart of the mountain is not fire, but water" reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The final image—Mira coiling the chain and deciding to "listen" rather than control—offers a resonant answer to the central question. "Encrypted compassion" as motif strains slightly (the notches and wax seal feel ornamental), but the core thematic arc holds without forcing a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent (calloused fingers, love of the amphitheater's breath). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("encrypted compassion," "slyly heartfelt") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The prose modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to the charged letter-reading beat. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she had always loved") appear but do not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops: "the amphitheater breathed" reappears in varied phrasing without added pressure; "trembling hands" cycles through label mentions. Template cadence in the letter-reading sequence: "She knelt... She traced... She pulled... She read." Stock metaphors: "silver river," "dried tears," "the way her pulse thrummed in her throat." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere without plot. Rhythm varies adequately outside the templated beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amphitheater-in-volcano setting offers a fresh spatial frame, and the floodgate-machinist role adds occupational specificity. The emotional arc—taming versus honoring—is familiar but grounded in tactile detail (brass gears, adhesive traces). The letter's message reframes her work without a twist, which feels earned rather than clever. "Encrypted compassion" as a phrase reads slightly abstract and prompt-driven. The synthesis of water-as-voice and floodgates-as-listening is coherent but does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira adjusts the floodgate lever in the opening beat and decides to "adjust the floodgates one last time" at closure, but the machinist role remains background competence rather than a constraint that narrows her options. The ingenious quality is asserted ("perfecting the mechanism") rather than demonstrated through on-page problem-solving.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in three beats: picked up and unspooled down the steps, traced to the envelope, and coiled around her wrist at closure. The final coil reweights it from historical artifact to worn talisman. It does not constrain a choice but charges the ending image with continuity between past and present surveyors.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is named in the text ("This was encrypted compassion") and the envelope's notches suggest coding, but the mechanics are ornamental—Mira reads the letter immediately without decryption labor. The concept shapes theme more than tactics; it does not alter her options or create friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once as a descriptor for her laugh near closure. It labels the tone of the moment but does not constrain an action or enable a tradeoff. The attribute could be swapped for another emotional adjective without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Trembling hands are noted twice: once when kneeling at the envelope, and earlier described as stilled by resolve. The tremble signals emotional weight but does not create a turn; her hands steady without cost. The action marks a threshold but is easily replaceable with another embodied signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Analyzing the adhesive is signaled early ("by analyzing the leftover adhesive, she could see the faint imprint") and provides the mechanism for discovering the wax seal and notches. The method matters to the discovery beat but does not recur or shape later tactics. Swappable with "examining the paper" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater inside the volcano is established in the opening line and its "breath" (stone shifts) mirrors Mira's internal pressure throughout. The setting's uneven exhalation signals the volcano holding something back, creating atmospheric stakes. The stage and steps provide spatial anchors for the chain and envelope. Setting actively pressures mood and charges the closure moment when it "exhaled...as if in approval."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" frames time poetically but does not function as a live clock. The breath is described as "slow, rhythmic" and later "uneven, strained," but elapsed duration remains vague. Time does not tighten decisions; Mira moves at an unhurried pace without urgency derived from the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Harmonizing conflicting values (protect the valley versus honor the past) is stated explicitly in the text and frames the opening tension. The letter provides the reconciliation, but Mira's desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The motivation is present across beats and shapes the closure realization, though friction between wants and costs is minimal on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone blends reflective mood (love of the amphitheater's history) with resolve (adjusting the floodgates). "Dappled resolve" as a phrase does not appear on the page; the tone reads more steadily contemplative with a single modulation at the laugh. The ending image (chain coiled, breath warm) coheres with the established register but does not dramatically charge or shift in response to peak pressure.</comment>
