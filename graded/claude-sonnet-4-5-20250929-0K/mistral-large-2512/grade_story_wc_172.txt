<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's amorality is established through concrete details (smuggling, engineered drought), and the sentimental drawer provides contradictory depth. However, the final reversal—opening the dams—feels unmotivated by prior on-page pressure; his internal contradiction is told rather than tested through a difficult choice that forecloses options. The embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority remains cerebral summary rather than visceral experience under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure unit is legible: Elias releases the drought and leaves the egg as monument, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where he forecloses further intervention. However, the decision arrives without meaningful on-page pressure or reversal; the dams open via phone tap with no dramatized cost or friction. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in design, but the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp cadence shift or pattern break that would charge the image with undeniable weight. Orientation is clear early; no penalty applied there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The salt flat is vivid and selective—crystalline crust, cracked riverbeds as map, sickly moonlight—and the convergence circle spatially anchors the climax. The egg's warmth and the static-laden air create sensory texture filtered through Elias's perspective. The setting constrains his route (following the crack-map) and stages the final placement, meeting the 9+ gate test for choice constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the extinct birds' echo—is signaled early and coheres through the piece. However, escalation is minimal: Elias walks, kneels, taps his phone. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; the dams open without friction, negotiation, or visible cost that alters later tactics. The accumulative lens cannot rescue the lack of pressure; the final act feels like execution of a plan rather than a choice forced by mounting stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the drought-as-vessel conceit and the paradox of erasing the world to hold its echo. The pressed flowers and sister's photograph enrich the motif without spelling it out. The final image—egg as monument, rain invited, Elias erased—offers a resonant answer to the cost of preservation. However, "the echo would remain. And that was enough" edges toward moralizing summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and often striking ("the way it still hummed with the ghost of a song no living ear had ever heard"). Distance modulates purposefully, drawing close for the sentimental drawer and pulling back for the engineered drought. However, register occasionally drifts upward ("manufactured sort, a slow, deliberate unraveling") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, and some lines ("as if the bird inside had only just stopped breathing") lean ornamental rather than voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and individual lines carry strong imagery. However, paraphrase loops appear: the opening's "promise of rain that never came" / "thunder that never broke" and later "the echo would remain" restated across two beats dilute momentum. Filter verbs ("he would have laughed," "he had done it") stack in reflective passages without urgency. The closure paragraph summarizes consequence ("let the rain come, let the salt dissolve") rather than dramatizing it, softening the final image's impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The manufactured-drought-to-preserve-echo premise is a fresh moral inversion, and the crack-map navigation offers a specific, non-obvious mechanism. However, the philanthropist-with-dark-secret and the sentimental-tough-guy tropes are familiar, and the reversal lacks the grounded lived detail that would make it feel inevitable rather than conceptual. The piece reads more as thesis-demonstration than as character-driven discovery, limiting its ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's amorality (smuggling, engineered drought) frames the premise and his decision to reverse it constitutes the climax. Present in setup, middle rationale, and closure action—all three gates. However, the choice itself is not tested on the page; it arrives as execution rather than contested turn, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The egg appears in his palm early, returns at the kneeling placement, and is left as monument in the final image—three beats, all gates. Its warmth and iridescent blues are specific. However, it remains symbolic vessel rather than tactile constraint; removing it would not break the logic of reversing the drought, only the thematic charge. Strong lyric reprise, but swappable with another relic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The manufactured drought is the engine of the story: Elias engineered it, the crack-map exists because of it, and reversing it constitutes the climax. Present in all three gates and causally central. It shapes his tactics (following the riverbeds) and the closure stakes (inviting the rain back). The piece's moral calculus hinges on this exact element; a natural drought would not carry the same culpability or agency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sentimental drawer (flowers, ticket stubs, sister's photo) is present in setup and colors his motivation thematically. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or visibly shape the reversal decision; it remains character color rather than pressure source. Label-only in function; "secretly sentimental" is asserted but not dramatized through a trade-off or micro-choice under stress.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The release (dam-opening via phone) is the story's climax and irreversible act, present in closure. It appears in setup as past engineering and middle as his plan, then executed at the convergence circle—all gates. However, the release itself is frictionless; no on-page obstacle or cost accompanies the phone tap. The act is essential to structure but lacks the dramatized price that would elevate it to indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The crack-map is seeded early (satellite study), guides his walk in the middle, and leads to the convergence circle at closure—all gates. Its mechanics (reading dried riverbeds as labyrinth) are specific and non-obvious. However, the map functions as atmospheric detail rather than constraint; no moment shows him struggling to decipher it or adjusting tactics when it misleads. Lyric reprise is present, causal pressure is not.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt flat anchors the entire piece spatially and conceptually: his boots sink into it, the cracks form his map, the convergence circle stages the climax, and its future dissolution under rain closes the story. Present in all gates, drives multiple beats, and the final image ("let the salt dissolve") depends on this exact setting. Removal would collapse both geography and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe (lull of distant thunder, night of static weight) is present in setup and closure, framing atmosphere. However, it does not tighten his decisions or alter tactics; no clock pressure or consequence of choosing this night over another is dramatized. The thunder remains ornamental backdrop rather than temporal constraint. Missing middle development gate; lyric bookend only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Preserving the echo motivates both the drought's creation and its reversal, present in all gates. The echo conceit is specific and drives his rationale across beats. However, the motivation is largely told ("he had done it for the echo") rather than tested through on-page conflict between preservation and another want. No visible friction or cost at the decision moment itself; the desire shapes setup and closure but not middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fractured grace coheres across the piece: polished boots sinking into crust, the cruel joke of erasure-as-preservation, the sentimental drawer, the kneeling placement, and the quiet exit. Tone modulates from cerebral calm to elegiac resignation without breaking. The final image ("let the world forget him. But the echo would remain") charges the tone with cost. However, the modulation is subtle rather than dynamic; pressure does not visibly intensify the fracture.</comment>
