<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains an observational presence rather than an agent making pressure-driven choices; her "cautious exuberance" is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The confidence man's watch and cipher function as atmospheric props rather than constraints that force micro-choices with visible cost. The final "set her free" moment lacks earned causality—no prior choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page, and the transformation from veiled to unveiled reads as assertion rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague—"glowing library in mist" offers no spatial grounding by ~120 words, and the dreamer's identity stays abstract throughout (−0.4). The closure unit presents a Resonant Reconfiguration ("The dreamer was no longer veiled"), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt; no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with pressure. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (mist, symbols, propagation delays as texture) and Causal (two letters framing action), never stabilizing, which prevents clean escalation judgment (−0.3 lens drift).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing library supplies vivid sensory texture (mist, pulsing spines, electric scent), and the watch functions as a micro-setting object handled twice with shifting meaning. However, the library never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the protagonist moves through it as a passive observer, and spatial choreography remains unclear (aisles appear and vanish without consequence). The cyclically reversed symbol and propagation delays remain decorative rather than functional anchors that guide action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or tightening that narrows options. The protagonist's actions (reaching for a book, reading aloud, penning the second letter) unfold without opposition or cost; no reversal or escalation forces a choice that forecloses a path. The watch's chime and the letter's completion feel coincidental rather than earned by prior agency, and the "set her free" resolution arrives without visible sacrifice or consequence shaped by the protagonist's decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (the watch, the cipher, the two letters, the unspoken as "waiting to be found in propagation delays") without overt moralizing, and the final image of the watch at midnight offers a non-literal answer to the central question of liminal knowledge. However, the thematic synthesis leans on abstraction ("Time is a story we tell ourselves") rather than concrete particulars that anchor universals, and the protagonist's internal arc—scholar of forgotten languages to unveiled dreamer—remains more asserted than earned through specific experience with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV distance and narrative stance remain stable in third-person limited, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture through word choice ("cyclically reversed," "propagation delays," "liminal hour"). The voice modulates purposefully with pressure—shorter sentences during the book-opening beat, longer during reflection—and perceptual signature is consistent (scholarly attention to symbols, patterns, inscriptions). However, the protagonist's perceptual filter remains generically curious rather than character-particular; a scholar of forgotten languages should notice linguistic detail with more specificity, and the watch's backward-forward motion is described identically in two beats without evolving insight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language (snake eating its tail, mist as canyon echo) is coherent without mixed metaphors. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The cipher in her mind unfolded with each step, its patterns shifting like the mist" and "Now, she traced the symbols in the air, watching as the books rearranged themselves to match" restate cipher-following across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear in the final third: "She smiled... She had seen... The first letter... The second..." (−0.4). Stock phrasing weakens closure: "set her free" and "the hour between two days, between two fates" lean on cliché rather than specific image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core premise—a scholar entering a library of unspoken words guided by a backward-running watch—offers a fresh synthesis of liminal-space fantasy and typographic mysticism. However, the confidence man's watch as a time-bending device and the cipher as a dream-given key echo familiar tropes without transformation through specific choice or world logic. The "propagation delays" concept (whispers causing aisles to appear) introduces a non-obvious mechanic but remains ornamental rather than driving escalation, and the two-letter frame structures the narrative without imposing meaningful constraint on tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout and makes decisions (reaching for a book, reading aloud, penning the second letter), satisfying setup and development gates. However, her choices do not create key turns—the library reveals itself through external mechanics (propagation delays, mist), and the final "unveiled" transformation occurs as assertion rather than consequence of a prior choice with cost. She observes and documents more than she decides under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in three beats: won in cards (backstory), pulled from pocket with hands spinning wildly, and still at midnight in the final paragraph. Setup and payoff gates are met, and the watch returns with reweighted meaning (from loop to stillness). However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; the protagonist never uses it to navigate the library or make a trade-off. The watch functions as a thematic marker rather than a causal tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher shapes the protagonist's approach—she memorizes it from a dream, traces symbols in the air, watches books rearrange to match—satisfying setup and middle development. The cipher "clicked into place" near the end, contributing to closure participation. However, the cipher does not constrain options or impose cost; the books rearrange cooperatively, and the protagonist's understanding arrives without struggle or sacrifice. The concept remains more atmospheric than mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cyclically reversed symbol (snake eating its tail, tail as head) is described once on a book cover and traced in the air, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The protagonist observes it without needing to decipher its reversal to proceed, and no choice hinges on understanding or applying its cyclical property. The attribute remains decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The protagonist documents in her notebook (habit from her old life as a scholar), and the act of penning the second letter occurs in the final third, shaping the closure moment. Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the documentation does not create a key turn—the library's demand for "participation" is declared but not dramatized through a choice that the act of writing enables or costs. The action could be swapped for "speaks aloud" or "touches the book" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Propagation delays are signaled early ("the library revealed itself through propagation delays, like echoes in a canyon") and appear in the middle beat (whisper causes aisle to appear/vanish), satisfying setup and development. However, the method does not shape attempts—the protagonist never adjusts her tactics based on delay timing, and the mechanic remains atmospheric rather than a constraint she must work around. The method is described more than used.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is anchored early, provides vivid sensory texture (pulsing books, electric air, shifting aisles), and persists through all beats to the final fade. The setting supplies the watch, the books, and the symbols, contributing resources. However, it does not pressure choices—aisles appear and vanish without forcing the protagonist to choose a path or pay a cost to navigate. The library cooperates rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe between two fateful letters is established in the opening paragraph (first arrived three days prior, second still unwritten) and bookends the narrative, with the watch marking "the hour between two days, between two fates" at closure. Setup and payoff are clear. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—the three days impose no urgency, and the protagonist never races a deadline or weighs time cost. The frame structures more than it pressures.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library of unspoken words is stated explicitly in the opening third and drives the protagonist's entry and movement through the library, satisfying setup and development. The desire is realized at closure ("she had seen the unspoken"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between the want and a competing cost or fear tests her commitment. The protagonist pursues the goal without obstacle or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is declared in the opening line ("her breath shallow with cautious exuberance") and modulates through the piece—hesitation when reaching for the book, trembling voice when reading aloud, final smile at closure. The tone is coherent and present across beats. However, it remains more asserted than embodied; the "cautious" and "exuberant" impulses do not act simultaneously in scene to create contradictory pulls on a choice, and the tone does not decisively charge the final image beyond the smile.</comment>
