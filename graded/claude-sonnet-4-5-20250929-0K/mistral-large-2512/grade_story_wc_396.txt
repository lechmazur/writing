<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's "shadow-laced peacekeeper" role and "calmly intuitive" trait remain label-only; no internal contradiction or embodied struggle emerges under pressure. The final act—hurling the fragment—lacks visible cost or prior setup showing why this particular choice forecloses a path. Motivation ("map empathy onto action") is told in one line but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. The child's reflection and the seer's dying words are pure exposition devices rather than pressure applied by a second character on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early enough. The closure—crystal shattering the beast—arrives on the page, but the cost is unclear: Elias exhales and his shadows recede with no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The lens reads as attempted Causal (fragment → beast dissolved) but the middle beats (mirrors showing visions, trees bending aside) function as situational complications without because/therefore linkage, creating lens drift. The child's final line ("You reconstituted the light") asserts thematic payoff without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes anchor the scene vividly with specific sensory detail (gnarled branches, salt and old paper, grinding floes). The mirrors constrain one choice (Elias presses the fragment, a path appears), meeting the micro-setting gate. However, the orchard's spatial choreography becomes vague during the run to the village, and the ice creature's breach lacks embodied scale or proximity that would pressure Elias's stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the village from the ice threat—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the ice creature breaches, but Elias's response (hurl the fragment) is not earned by prior tactical failure or a narrowed set of options; he simply tries it. No visible cost accrues: the fragment glows, the beast dissolves, and the villagers are saved without forfeiture. The coincidence of the path appearing and the fragment working without setup undermines escalation under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of light versus shadow and reconstituting what was lost emerges from recurring images (shadows, lighthouse beam, crystal fragment). However, the child's final declaration ("You reconstituted the light") is explicit thematic summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The seer's cryptic prophecy and Elias's "map empathy onto action" remain abstract labels without concrete particulars that test or deepen them through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias throughout. Diction wobbles between elevated register ("shadow-laced," "weighted silence before reply," "anomaly of his own courage") and simpler action beats, but the voice remains legible. Narrative certainty exceeds Elias's knowledge in places (the child's reflection "wasn't for herself" is asserted without dramatization). The phrase "weighted breath before reply" recurs as a frame device but its meaning and connection to the action remain opaque.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("clawing at the frigid air like skeletal fingers," "time seemed to thicken like molasses," "beam cutting through the dark like a blade"), creating register drift and rhythmic monotony without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "shifting ice floes" and "ice floes below were not just shifting, but *moving*" restate the same idea. Template cadence in the middle beats ("He pressed…," "He turned…," "He didn't hesitate") flattens propulsion. The phrase "weighted silence before reply" and "as if the world itself had taken a breath before reply" bracket the story but their function is unclear, reading as ornamental recurrence rather than causal or thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise combines familiar fantasy elements (peacekeeper, prophecy, mystical artifact, ice monster) without a fresh synthesis. The mirrors showing glimpses of possible futures and the reconstitution concept are gestured at but not developed into specific world logic or moral calculus. Elias's "shadow-laced" and "calmly intuitive" traits and the "courageous anomaly" concept read as prompt labels rather than transformation through lived detail. The ending—fragment defeats beast—feels like a stock quest resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes two visible choices (press fragment to mirrors, hurl fragment at beast), meeting Setup and Payoff gates. However, his "shadow-laced peacekeeper" identity does not constrain or enable those choices with visible cost; he could be any generic hero. Middle development is weak: the mirrors' visions prompt a run to the village but do not narrow his options or force a trade-off. The role is functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears early, is handled in two distinct beats (pressed to mirrors, hurled at beast), and shapes the closure action. Setup, Development, and Payoff gates are met. However, its mechanics—why pressing it to mirrors opens a path, why hurling it destroys the beast—are not established, reducing specificity. The fragment's "jagged edges catching moonlight" is repeated description without evolving meaning. It drives the ending but could swap for any mystical object with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is mentioned once in exposition ("the anomaly of his own courage") but never dramatized. It does not shape Elias's stakes, constrain his tactics, or alter his choices under pressure. The concept remains a thematic label without scene work. Missing Development and Payoff gates; present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" appears twice as a label ("his intuition, calmly intuitive, had guided him" and "he let his intuition guide him, calmly intuitive") but no on-page action shows the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Elias does not weigh competing intuitions or pay a price for following his gut. The trait is told, not shown. Missing Development gate; closure mention is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the seer's command, the child's closing line, and the ending's thematic claim. Setup and Payoff gates met. However, the action itself—hurling the fragment—does not dramatize reconstitution through visible assembly or repair; the crystal simply shatters and the beast dissolves. The verb is used as a thematic label rather than a specific on-page process. Middle development is absent: Elias does not attempt partial reconstitution or learn its mechanics before the climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors appear in the middle beat and enable one choice (pressing the fragment opens a path), meeting Setup and Development gates. Their mechanics—showing "glimpses of what could be"—are explained but not tested; Elias sees visions and acts, but the mirrors do not constrain his tactics or recur at closure. The method shapes one beat but is functionally replaceable with any scrying device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes anchor the setting early and the ice provides the threat that drives the plot. Setup and Payoff gates met. The orchard's trees bend aside to form a corridor (Development), but this environmental aid is coincidental rather than earned through Elias's knowledge or choice. The setting supplies vivid description and one causal beat but could swap for a similar liminal landscape without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" frames the opening and closing lines but its connection to time pressure is opaque. No ticking clock or narrowing window shapes Elias's decisions; he runs to the village, but the ice creature's breach timing is coincidental. The timeframe is poetic dressing without on-page constraint. Missing all three gates; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated once in exposition and echoed by the child's reflection, meeting Setup and Payoff gates. However, the motivation is never dramatized through a choice where Elias must balance empathy against another cost or impulse. His actions (run, hurl fragment) are heroic but do not show empathy conflicting with self-preservation or tactical calculation. Missing Development gate; told rather than shown under pressure.</comment>
