<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's blindness and trust in touch are well-embodied through concrete actions (fingers on ceramic, testing water refraction). His motivation to decode feedback is consistent, but the arc lacks meaningful internal conflict—he never doubts his method or faces a competing impulse. The final moment ("Some things don't need eyes to be seen") edges toward platitude rather than earned insight through struggle. Mara remains functional but flat, present only to witness and affirm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elias repairs the drone → releases it → it returns with decoded feedback, confirming his method. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: his trust in unseen feedback is validated), but the cost is thin—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made. The feedback "clear now" resolves too smoothly without a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, water basin, and sensory details (salt, machine oil, lantern flicker) are vivid and filtered through Elias's tactile priorities. The water feature constrains his method (refraction test) and charges the final image when the drone lands on his palm. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting actively shapes his verification process rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the drone's feedback before the ship's departure—is signaled early and tightens as the anchor lifts. However, escalation is modest: Elias never faces a meaningful reversal or complication that forces a trade-off. The resolution (drone returns, feedback clear) arrives without visible cost or a narrowed option set. The time pressure (maiden voyage beginning) is declared but not dramatized through altered tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of trusting non-visual perception emerges through Elias's craft and the water-refraction motif. The hummingbird's return with decoded feedback resonates without overt moralizing. However, the final line ("Some things don't need eyes to be seen") summarizes rather than deepening through image alone, and the feedback-as-direction metaphor is stated rather than left to reverberate. The piece avoids heavy-handedness but doesn't fully transcend its premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's tactile and auditory perception. Psychic distance is controlled; knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Mara's lines advancing the beat without distraction. Diction is consistent and apt ("compass," "second heartbeat"), though a few phrases edge toward the generic ("weight of the moment," "thick with something like awe"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. However, several phrases loop or edge toward stock: "the kind of smile that came from years of trusting" follows a familiar template, and "heart full" is generic. "Mist curled...like a living thing" and "magnetic" (in the final line) feel ornamental rather than earned by prior use. Momentum is steady, but a few scaffolding beats (e.g., "his breath steady despite the weight of the moment") could be cut. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blind artisan decoding sensory data through water refraction offers a specific synthesis of disability, craft, and tech. However, the emotional arc (trust validated without complication) and the feedback-as-direction metaphor follow a well-worn template: mentor figure trusts intuition, world confirms it. The hummingbird drone and depot setting are vivid but the overall trajectory—character's method works, doubt is absent, no surprise at closure—trends predictable. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, makes the key decision to release the drone, and his craft (repairing, testing refraction, interpreting feedback) drives all major beats. His choice to release the drone alters tactics (waiting for return vs. manual decode). He appears in the closure image (drone lands on his palm) with his stance validated. Setup, development, and payoff are all met. However, the choice to release is straightforward—no competing option or visible cost complicates it, capping the score below 7.0 despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone is introduced early (paragraph one), handled in repair across multiple beats (patching frame, adjusting balance, releasing it), and returns in the closure image to confirm decoded feedback. It is irreplaceable: the story's logic depends on this device's sensors and its final flight. Three distinct beats (repair, release, return) plus closure participation. Strong causal pressure and specificity, but the final image does not reweight prior meaning—it confirms rather than transforms—keeping it shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The repair shop setting frames Elias's work and the drone's broken state, shaping the opening stake (fix and decode). His tools and workspace are mentioned, and the repair action (patching, adjusting) drives the middle beat. However, the shop itself does not constrain a later choice or pressure the ending—the closure hinges on the drone's flight and return, not on shop resources or limitations. Setup and development present; payoff linkage is weak. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Blindness is signaled early ("years since he lost his sight") and constrains Elias's method: he relies on touch, sound, and the water-refraction test instead of visual inspection. At least two on-page actions (tracing the ceramic plate, testing the basin, releasing the drone by feel) show the trait enabling his craft. The attribute shapes his tactics and charges the thematic line at closure. Cost is implicit (he cannot see the flight) but felt. Setup, development, and payoff all clear; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Patch" appears in the repair work ("patching its fractured frame") and drives the middle section, but the climactic action is *release* rather than patch. The patching is preparatory setup, not the turn that redefines options at closure. The drone's success depends on prior repair, so the action has causal weight, but it is not the pivot moment. Setup and development met; payoff indirect. Mid-band: necessary but not the defining action at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Water refraction is introduced early ("examining the way the ripples bent the glow told him more than any blueprint") and used on-page when Elias dips his fingers in the basin ("testing the refraction one last time"). The method enables his verification step before release. However, the mechanics are stated rather than dramatized—we are told it guides him but do not see the decision pivot on a specific refraction result. Setup and development present; closure linkage weak. Functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The depot is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (mist, girders, salt, machine oil) and houses the water feature that Elias uses to test refraction. The environment supplies a resource (the basin) and the mist provides cover/atmosphere for the drone's flight. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting shapes his method and appears in the final image ("mist settled over the depot"). Setup, development, and payoff all met; the basin constrains his choice to release. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The anchor lifting and ship's maiden voyage are introduced early and create a deadline ("last chance to decode"). The distant anchor groan punctuates the middle and the ship's departure frames the ending. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page tactics—Elias's release and the drone's return are not shown to be compressed or altered by the clock. The time pressure is declared but not dramatically escalated. Setup and thematic payoff present; development weak. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Feedback isn't noise, it's direction" is Elias's stated motive, and decoding the drone's pulses drives his repair and release. The desire is present across beats but never conflicted—no moment where cost or doubt tests his commitment. The motive is told and pursued, but lacks friction or a visible tradeoff at closure. Setup and development clear; payoff (feedback now clear) is straightforward validation without complication. Solid presence, limited dramatic cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is evoked in the mist imagery, Elias's steady breath, and the final line ("calm and magnetic"). Tone remains consistent and modulates slightly as the anchor lifts (quiet urgency) then settles at closure. The calm supports the theme of trust and stillness. However, the tone does not charge the final image with new pressure—it mirrors rather than transforms. Setup and payoff present; development is static. Coherent but not dynamically integrated.</comment>
