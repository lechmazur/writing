<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interior life is rendered through sensory particulars ("tremor of certainty in her chest," "current of knowing"), and embodied perception anchors her motivation. However, she remains essentially static—no contradictory impulses emerge, and her agency consists mostly of observation and internal assertion rather than choice under pressure. The final act ("she stepped forward") reads as declarative confirmation rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses an alternative path. The lack of on-page conflict or trade-off caps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: atmosphere and image density build toward a final reconfiguration where the poet becomes "someone who had walked through the poem." The ice crack, hum intensification, and dimming light signal a shift, and the final image reweights her stance from seeker to transformed participant. However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeit or visible trade-off anchors the change. Orientation is clear early (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, cloud-shadow poet), and the lens holds, but the closure lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("veined with light like captured auroras," "light pooled like liquid cobalt"). Setting details recur and evolve: the ice cracks, the hum softens, the light dims, all reflecting the protagonist's progression. The quartz's vibration serves as both tactile anchor and metaphorical constraint on her perceptual frame. While the environment charges the final image, it does not materially constrain a choice or force a trade-off, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates via sensory intensification (the ice crack, louder hum, melting ice), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The poet's actions (tracing quartz, kneeling, paraphrasing with breath) are exploratory and ceremonial rather than decisions under opposition. The "tremor of certainty" functions as internal confirmation rather than friction, and the ending delivers transformation by assertion rather than earned cost, preventing entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete image work: boundaries, paraphrase, the dissolving line between poet and poem. The final reconfiguration—"not as a poet, but as someone who had walked through the poem"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract terms ("boundary dissolving," "vessel," "mouthpiece") and the closing lines drift toward philosophical summary ("for all who dared to listen") rather than anchoring resonance in a charged particular. The thematic idea is coherent but not indispensable to the scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register that remains consistent throughout. Diction is purposeful and voice-specific ("palimpsest," "lantern-moth hush"), and perceptual signature (sensory immersion, aesthetic framing) stays coherent. However, the narrative distance occasionally drifts into essayistic declaration ("This was why she had come") and the syntax shows repetitive stems ("She had come," "She had spent," "She closed," "She began," "She knew"). No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The voice is distinctive but not flawless under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("light pooled like liquid cobalt," "wax beneath her touch"), but several metaphors compete without reinforcing a single thread, and some border on self-contradiction ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush"). Template cadence appears in mid-story repetition: "She had come… She had spent… She closed… She began… She knew." Paraphrase loops also surface: the boundary-dissolving concept is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. The final paragraph strings together abstract claims ("tremor of certainty remained," "walked through the poem") that dilute the closure image. Combined artifact debt of −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—an artist seeking transformative encounter in a forbidden space—is familiar, and the execution relies on stock metaphors (poet as vessel, boundaries dissolving, ice melting as symbolic thaw). The lyric register and sensory detail add texture but do not fundamentally transform the template. The piece lacks a specific, non-obvious synthesis or earned turn that reweights prior material in hindsight. The aesthetic is competent but safe, avoiding bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>
