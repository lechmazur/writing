<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's contradictory impulses—isolation versus the pull of her scar—create genuine tension, and the moment she touches the child's scar earns the final shift. However, her interior voice leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("the cost of mercy," "bridges, thin and fragile") that dilutes embodied specificity under pressure. The child remains functional but flat, serving primarily as a mirror rather than exerting independent pressure. Motivation is present and the arc closes, but the peak beat relies on symbolic gesture more than dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the touch steadies breath and reweights the keeper's long refusal with visible cost. The knocking sequence builds density and the scar-link provides causal pressure. One structural seam: the child's arrival feels convenient (no prior signal of this specific visitor), and the phrase "teach suffocating to breathe" lands as prompt echo rather than earned discovery. Closure is legible and the lens holds, but the convenience and late thematic articulation prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary, doorknocker ring, and starlight lattice establish vivid atmosphere and recur with purpose. The scar functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when the keeper touches it. Spatial choreography is clean (threshold, door, child's outstretched hand). However, the setting remains largely decorative between opening and ending; the walls "press in" and the ring "clatters" but these do not alter tactics in the middle beats. The final touch charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but mid-scene passivity and one stock phrase ("edge of the world") hold the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to answer the door and re-engage—is signaled early and tightens when the child reveals the matching scar. The keeper's hesitation and the doorknocker's wild swing create pressure, and the final touch forecloses her isolation with visible cost (her own lungs expand). One meaningful deepening occurs when recognition links past and present. However, the child's arrival is coincidental (she "found you" without prior setup), and the keeper's agency at closure is reactive rather than a hard-won choice. Cost is felt but not fully causal; escalation is present but convenience dilutes it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely through the scar imagery and the keeper's learned lesson about severance versus connection. The final breath-steadying moment reweights prior material without stating a moral. However, two thematic statements risk over-articulation: "teach suffocating to breathe" reads as prompt label, and "The lesson had been hers to learn, after all" flattens the closure into summary. The piece resists tidy morals elsewhere, but these direct assertions in the final third pull the score down. Subtext operates in the doorknocker and scar imagery, but the ending leans toward explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; the keeper's perceptual signature (ashen walls, forgotten fires, silver starlight) is consistent and voice-particular. Distance modulates purposefully at the child's arrival. One dialogue exchange ("They said you could teach suffocating to breathe") carries plot but feels more thematic than natural speech. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she had expected") cluster in the backstory paragraphs but do not obscure immediacy at closure. Psychic distance tightens cleanly in the final beat. No head-hopping, and the prose texture supports pressure without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several images are striking ("silver dust," "creeping mold across a forgotten loaf"). Clarity is high and no major loops appear. However, three artifacts lower the score: (1) "burns bridges carefully" and "cutting off all contact" are near-synonym restatements within two paragraphs; (2) "suffocating" as a noun ("teach suffocating to breathe") is a strained nominalization that reads ornamental; (3) the phrase "linking through scars" appears twice in close proximity as thematic echo rather than propulsion. These do not touch the closure beat directly but create mid-story drag. Information density is good overall, and the final line avoids scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—a healer who fled her calling confronted by a child bearing the same wound—offers a recognizable template (redemption via mirror figure). The scar-as-bridge motif and the starlight-lattice sanctuary provide specific texture, and the breath-steadying climax avoids melodrama. However, the core arc (recluse reopens to the world through symbolic touch) follows a well-worn path without a non-obvious inflection. The child's arrival is not transformed by prior causality, and the final realization ("The lesson had been hers to learn") states rather than surprises. Competent synthesis, but insufficient freshness for high bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shadow keeper is present throughout, frames the opening, and makes the decisive choice to touch the child's scar at closure. Her hesitation and the knocking sequence involve her across multiple beats. However, her agency is reactive (the door swings open "before she could decide") and her backstory dominates the middle section without fresh on-page choices until the child's revelation. She shapes closure but does not drive turns earlier. Setup early, closure participation strong, middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in three beats: setup (cold, scarred surface), the knocking sequence (vibrating, runes flaring), and the wild clatter during the child's arrival. It recurs with reweighted meaning (once warm and hummed, now cold and pitted) and its final clatter contributes to the pressure. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource; the keeper never handles it, and the child's arrival bypasses it ("The door swung open"). Present across beats, charges atmosphere, but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "fading threshold" is named explicitly and staged physically (the door, the child on the threshold, the keeper's choice to reach across). It shapes the ending by literalizing the barrier between isolation and connection. However, the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint; the middle beats do not test threshold mechanics, and the phrase "fading threshold" itself appears only once as direct label. It participates in closure but does not alter options earlier. Setup present, closure linkage moderate, middle absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is stated in the opening as backstory summary but never shown on the page. No scene dramatizes her methodical severance, and the trait does not constrain or enable a present choice. It remains label-only, contributing to voice but not to causality or cost. Setup as exposition, no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Encroach" is signaled early ("the world had encroached, inch by inch") and drives the escalation: dreams, then knocking, then the child's arrival. The knocking sequence is the story's central pressure mechanism, culminating in the different rhythm that prompts the keeper to hesitate. The child's arrival is the final encroachment that forces the choice. Present in setup, powers middle beats, and directly enables closure. Causal across all three gates, though the child's arrival itself is coincidental rather than earned.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is named twice and dramatized once: the child reveals her matching scar, the keeper recognizes it, and the touch at closure connects them physically and causally (breath steadies). The scar is signaled in the keeper's hidden mark early, returns as revelation mid-story, and provides the closure mechanism. However, the mechanics are thin—no earlier attempt or failure, just label and payoff. Setup present, one middle beat (revelation), strong closure participation. Causal but light on development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary is described vividly in the opening and its walls "press in" during the climax, contributing to atmosphere. Starlight and the lattice roof recur as texture. However, the sanctuary does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource; the keeper could make the same decision in any isolated dwelling. It charges the tone and participates in the final image but remains largely postcard. Setup strong, closure linkage moderate (the walls press in), middle absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" anchors the timeframe early and sets up the keeper's isolation. The knocking sequence implies elapsed years ("She had not answered in years"), and the child's arrival breaks the silence. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency tied to duration. The "after" provides context but does not pressure tactics. Setup present, closure implied (the silence ends), middle absent as active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" is stated by the child and becomes the explicit stake at closure when the keeper's touch steadies the child's breath. However, it arrives late (second half) as prompt echo rather than emerging from the keeper's own interiority. The keeper's earlier motivation—to remain isolated—dominates most beats. At closure the teaching motivation is fulfilled, but it was not the keeper's active desire until the final moment. Setup delayed, closure participation strong, friction between wants and costs is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone of "loaded emptiness" is established immediately (ashen walls, blackened sanctuary, cold iron, silence) and modulates as pressure rises (runes flare faintly, walls press in, ring clatters). The keeper's breath catches and her lungs expand at closure, converting emptiness into air. The tone is coherent, charges the final image, and the breath motif transforms the initial void. Setup strong, sustained through turns, closure reweighted. One of the most fully integrated elements, though the phrase "loaded emptiness" itself never appears and must be inferred from imagery.</comment>
