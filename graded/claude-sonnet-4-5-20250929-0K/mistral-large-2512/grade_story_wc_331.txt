<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his odd-hour librarian persona shapes his perceptual lens, but his agency at closure feels passive—he follows the scarf rather than choosing under pressure. The woman's arrival in the void resolves her search via discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interior contradiction is minimal; his adjustment of glasses and reshelving gestures anchor him, but no micro-choice under stress reveals competing values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias and the woman stand together in the story-void, the scarf shifts from mystery to anchor, and "the world snapped back into place" signals a return with reweighted meaning. However, the cost is asserted ("the weight of the scarf now a comfort") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (library atmosphere, scarf touches, geometry motifs build density), but the final image relies on told warmth rather than a concrete, felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library's "scientific poetry library" conceit and hyperbolic-geometry threshold are vivid and purposeful. The scarf's texture ("cool against his skin," "rain and something metallic") is embodied and recurs. Spatial choreography is clean until the void materializes; the star-strewn expanse reads coherent but does not constrain Elias's choices—he steps through and the woman is simply there. The scarf charges the final image ("warm against his skin"), meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3, but the void itself remains a backdrop rather than a pressure or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks "the place where stories live." The scarf discovery and hyperbolic-geometry door provide one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is thin—no reversal tests his commitment, no visible trade-off alters tactics. The woman's appearance in the void and mutual hand-squeeze resolve the search through recognition rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is present but the price remains asserted ("the scarf… a comfort") rather than legible in forfeited agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (stories as living things, the longing to find their hidden chamber) emerges organically from the library's "scientific poetry" conceit and Elias's years-long search. The scarf as anchor and the woman's dual search create genuine complexity. The final image—"the world snapped back into place"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the "place where stories lived, where time unraveled and reformed like threads in a loom" edges toward overt metaphor that states rather than trusts the image, slightly weakening thematic subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; his perceptual signature (wire-rimmed glasses, "dust motes," "analog memories") is distinct and consistent. The woman's two brief lines of dialogue at the end feel earned and purposeful. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (close interiority → outward description → close again at closure). One slip: "Elias realized then that she had been searching too" tells the realization rather than showing it through gesture or implication, slightly flattening the discovery beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; figurative density is high ("scent that clung to the shelves like the last whisper of a forgotten dream") but mostly legible. Two artifacts lower the score: "The library itself was a scientific poetry library" is a paraphrase loop (library/library), and "the place where stories lived, where time unraveled and reformed like threads in a loom" stacks abstract clauses without concrete action, dulling momentum in a high-concept beat. Dialogue mechanics are clean; sentence openings vary. Information density is solid overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Scientific poetry library" and "analog memories" as residue on objects offer fresh synthesis. Hyperbolic geometry as threshold is specific and non-obvious. The scarf-as-anchor and woman-searching-for-the-way-back transform the "librarian finds hidden realm" template through dual-search stakes. Risk is present (void as literal story-space) and the closure commits to its premise without retreat. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would not work unchanged with different names/places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (odd-hour librarian) is present throughout, his routine sets up the disruption, and he makes the threshold choice to drape the scarf and step through the door. However, his final-beat agency is passive—he discovers the woman rather than choosing between competing costs. He appears in the closure image but does not drive the reconfiguration; the woman articulates the stakes ("You found it"). Two beats: scarf pickup, door crossing. Swappable with "night curator" or similar without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scarf appears in multiple beats: discovery on the chair, Elias drapes it and it guides him, it tightens "like a lifeline" in the void, woman identifies it as her anchor, and it remains "warm against his skin" in the final line. It enables the threshold crossing (guides him through hyperbolic geometry) and is explicitly the woman's tether. The reprise in the last line reweights it from mystery to comfort. However, the scarf does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it facilitates rather than pressures. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage elevate the score, but lack of causal friction (no risk in using it, no trade-off) caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Analog memories" is introduced as a concept ("traces of the past clinging to objects like static to wool") and applied to the scarf's residue of the woman's presence. It does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page; Elias recognizes it but does not manipulate or test it. The concept hovers as thematic atmosphere rather than a mechanic that narrows options or imposes cost. Present and functional but swappable with "psychic imprints" or similar without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is label-only: "his sanely eccentric nature was as much a part of the library as the dust motes drifting in the air." No on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice. His odd-hour preference and belief in living stories could illustrate eccentricity, but the phrase itself does no causal work. Ornamental mention without visible cost or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Reawaken" does not appear explicitly. The woman is found standing in the void, already present; no on-page revival or reawakening action occurs. If interpreted as Elias reawakening his search or the woman's reawakening to the world, both are told rather than shown. The element is either absent or deeply implicit, making it swappable or unnecessary without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through hyperbolic geometry" is signaled mid-story ("parallel lines diverged and angles bent like reeds in the wind") and enables the threshold discovery. The door materializes "between two shelves" as a direct result of this geometric shift. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized—Elias does not navigate competing geometries or test alternative paths. Present in the middle beat (door appears) and implicitly at closure (door vanishes), but the method does not constrain or complicate his approach. Functional but replaceable with "via psychic resonance" or similar arcane means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "scientific poetry library" frames the entire story, provides the scarf discovery locale, and houses the hyperbolic-geometry threshold. Book titles (*The Geometry of Longing*, *The Collected Equations of Emotion*) reinforce the concept. The setting shapes Elias's years-long search and the story-void revelation. However, the library does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias's success hinges on the scarf, not library-specific features. Strong thematic integration and closure linkage (library hums at the end), but lacks tactical constraint that would push the score into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" appears only in the concept statement; the on-page timeframe is "three in the morning" and the woman visits "every Tuesday at precisely 2:17 AM" until "the clock struck four." No patrons are present or browsing. The clock provides one beat (four o'clock marks the woman's departure and the snap-back closure), but the required element—browsing patrons creating time pressure—is absent. Cap at 2.8 per missing-closure-participation rule; actual score reflects that the stated timeframe does not match the text.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to find the place where stories live" is stated early and dramatized through his reshelving ritual, belief system, and years-long search. The scarf discovery and door crossing are motivated by this want. The closure unit delivers the goal: "the place where stories lived." However, internal conflict is minimal—no friction between wanting to find the place and the cost of reaching it. The motivation drives plot but lacks dramatized trade-off (e.g., what he gives up to cross the threshold). Two beats (setup, payoff) and closure linkage, but missing middle friction caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is coherent throughout: Elias alone at three AM, the silent woman, "the quiet hum of fluorescent lights," "no one ever questioned." Tone modulates subtly—calm opening, rising curiosity with the scarf, intensified solitude in the void ("vast, star-strewn expanse"), then shared solitude when the woman appears. The final image ("Together, they stood") reweights solitude into connection without breaking tonal consistency. The tone charges the closure by making aloneness a condition that the ending both honors and reconfigures. Strong modulation and closure linkage elevate the score into the 7+ range.</comment>
