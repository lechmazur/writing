<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to cultivate serenity is clear and drives her toward the seed despite warnings, but her internal contradiction remains abstract rather than embodied in simultaneous impulses. The grandmother's journal revelation provides motivation for the shift, but the epiphany arrives cleanly without the messy cognitive friction expected under genuine pressure. Old Nara's arrival and the journal handoff feel convenient rather than earned by prior causality. The final realization about waiting versus blooming is told rather than discovered through contradictory micro-choices in the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with mild Situational coloring. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (treetop village, evening, Mira's balcony). The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's insight that "serenity wasn't in the destination" reweights her obsession with the bloom—but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible on the page. The grandmother's journal arrives as a structural convenience in the final third without prior setup, weakening causal linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs (journal reveals prior failure), but the reconfiguration feels more like a thematic declaration than a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly rendered with swaying bridges, moss-lined balcony, and distant crash of waves, and sensory detail is well-distributed (olfactory sensitivity, visual horizon bleed, auditory rustle). The seed's texture and scent are handled on-page, and the village hum provides social texture. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the balcony does not constrain Mira's choices or enable a tactic under pressure, and the final image does not depend on spatial detail. Idiom is consistent, and spatial choreography (Nara at the balcony edge) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to cultivate the dangerous seed to bring serenity—is signaled early and clear. Pressure coheres around the elders' warnings and Mira's ambition, but escalation is minimal: Old Nara's arrival introduces a complication, yet the grandmother's journal resolves tension rather than tightening it. The protagonist's agency at closure is interpretive (she "understood") rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The seed "would take years to bloom, if it bloomed at all" defers stakes rather than crystallizing them, resulting in a diffuse rather than charged final moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—serenity in waiting versus destination—emerges through the seed, the grandmother's note, and Mira's realization, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's summary ("serenity wasn't in the destination—it was in the tending"). The grandmother's doodles and journal provide thematic texture, and the corpse flower's years-long bloom recurs with reweighted meaning. However, the final insight is stated rather than enacted in a charged image, and the line "for the first time, Mira understood that" tips into explicit articulation of the thesis. The premise of cultivating stillness within motion is evocative but remains abstract rather than tested through specific on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable throughout; Mira's perceptual signature (olfactory sensitivity, "nose twitching," scent as story) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue between Mira and Nara is natural and goal-driven ("You're playing with fire" / "I'm playing with life"), carrying subtext and advancing the confrontation cleanly. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("the turning of the tide's thought," "wildflower hush") that remains voice-motivated and legible. Minor register elevation ("olfactorily sensitive," "undercurrent of wisdom") fits the herbalist's intellectual framing without jarring. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks detract from clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is frequent ("swayed like a drowsy cat," "her ambition a quiet fire," "wind through the reeds") but generally controlled and coherent. However, several metaphors cluster densely without added pressure ("the turning of the tide's thought" is abstract and opaque on first encounter; "wildflower hush" is atmospheric but vague). The phrase "revealing the interior of the wrapping paper—a habit she'd inherited" is awkward and grammatically ambiguous (the habit is doodling, not revealing). Minor paraphrase loop: "her ambition a quiet fire that burned brighter" and "Mira's breath caught as she flipped through the pages" recycle intensity markers without new detail. No severe artifacts, but cumulative figurative density in the opening third slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The treetop herbalist premise is specific and the corpse flower seed offers a fresh stake, but the arc—ambitious protagonist warned by elder, receives ancestor's journal, gains wisdom—follows a familiar mentor-revelation template without transforming it through unexpected choice or moral calculus. The "serenity within motion" concept is evocative yet abstract, and the grandmother's failed attempt provides thematic symmetry but not a non-obvious synthesis. The doodling custom and olfactory sensitivity are particularized details, yet neither constrains a key choice or charges the closure image. Emotional truth is present, but the resolution's safety ("the seed would take years") avoids a risky, irreversible commitment that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes the decision to pursue the seed despite warnings, but her key choices (unwrapping the seed, journalizing, accepting the journal) are observational or receptive rather than high-stakes turns. The final realization is internal and conceptual, not a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is mild. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, mild causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage (internal realization) +0.5, swappability −0.5, observational mode −0.5 → base ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is unwrapped and handled in beat one, its properties (weight, texture, scent) are journalized in beat two, and it is present in Mira's final reflection ("the seed would take years to bloom"). It drives the elders' warnings and Old Nara's intervention, but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; Mira's decision to wait is conceptual rather than tactically shaped by the seed's mechanics. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure presence +0.8, irreplaceability +0.5, cost connection (deferred, not on-page) +0.2, ornamental closure mention −0.3 → base ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The undercurrent of wisdom" and "the turning of the tide's thought" appear in the opening paragraph as atmospheric framing and return thematically in the grandmother's note and Mira's final realization, but they do not shape on-page tactics or constrain a choice. The concept is evocative mood rather than a mechanism that alters options. Early signal +0.5, thematic echo at closure +0.5, no middle beat involvement, ornamental use −0.8, swappability (could be "inner knowing" or similar) −0.6 → base ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity is mentioned in the opening ("her nose twitching at the faintest shift in the air," "every scent told a story") and the seed's "faint, almost imperceptible scent of decay" is noted, but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Mira does not use her sensitivity to make a decision, avoid danger, or gain tactical advantage. Early signal +0.6, one beat (seed scent observation) +0.4, label-only trait −0.7, no causal pressure −0.5 → cap at 3.8 per swappability and label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in one sustained beat where Mira documents the seed's properties and sketches its contours, integrating the grandmother's doodling custom. It does not drive a major turn or redefine options; the grandmother's journal (received later) is causally separate. The action is specific and irreplaceable within the herbalist frame, but does not participate in closure. Early signal (implicit via satchel, explicit mid-scene) +0.5, one beat +0.4, irreplaceability +0.6, no closure linkage, swappability with "documenting" or "studying" −0.4, no causal pressure −0.3 → base ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is introduced when Mira unwraps the seed and appears again when the grandmother's journal is revealed to contain similar doodles and a frantic note. It provides thematic texture and connects Mira to her ancestor, but does not shape an on-page attempt or constrain a choice. Early signal (mid-scene, ~30% mark) +0.4, two beats (unwrapping, journal) +0.9, thematic resonance at closure +0.5, ornamental use (no tactical constraint) −0.7, late first appearance −0.3 → base ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The treetop village (Luminveil) is established early with vivid sensory detail (swaying bridges, moss balcony, distant waves) and provides social texture (children, elders, village hum). However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Mira's conflict occurs on her balcony and is interpersonal/conceptual. Micro-setting (balcony, seed, journal) does not constrain tactics. Early signal +0.7, one beat (stage for action) +0.4, atmospheric use without causal pressure −0.6, swappability (could occur in any herbalist's home) −0.5 → base ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" appears in the opening as metaphorical framing for the evening moment but does not track as a live clock or tighten decisions. The story unfolds in one continuous evening scene with no time pressure or deadline shaping Mira's choices. Timeframe is vague and atmospheric rather than causal. Early signal +0.5, thematic mood +0.3, no middle or closure involvement, vague tracking −0.8, no tactical constraint −1.0 → cap at 3.1 per ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to cultivate serenity within motion and calm Luminveil's restless inhabitants—is articulated early and drives her decision to pursue the seed despite warnings. The grandmother's note ("The stillness is not in the bloom, but in the waiting") directly reframes this desire at closure. However, the friction between want and cost is conceptual rather than dramatized through on-page trade-offs. Early signal +0.7, two beats (seed pursuit, final realization) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, thematic articulation rather than embodied friction −0.6, told-only at closure −0.4 → base ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" appears once in the final paragraph as tone descriptor for Mira's laugh. The overall tone is lyric, contemplative, and elevated ("drowsy cat," "wind through the reeds," "quiet fire"), cohering across the piece and modulating mildly with Old Nara's arrival. However, the specific phrase "wildflower hush" does not recur or charge the final image; it is ornamental. Tone coherence +0.9, modulation under pressure (Nara's warning) +0.5, single late appearance −0.8, closure mention without causal weight −0.3, label-only use −0.4 → base ~5.6.</comment>
