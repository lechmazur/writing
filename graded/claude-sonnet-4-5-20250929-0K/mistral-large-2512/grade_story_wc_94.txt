<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical register ("rarefied his anger," "cartography of scars") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. The photograph triggers contemplation but no embodied micro-choices that test competing impulses; he arrives to understand and leaves having understood, with the key shift ("some maps were never meant to be read, only carried") declared rather than earned through on-page contradiction or cost. Emotional states are labeled ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder") more than dramatized through perception and gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals a Conceptual Repricing lens—Elias seeks understanding of scars-as-map and concludes that carrying is the point—but the closure image (star visible, silence "full of things he could not yet name") asserts reweighting without demonstrable cost; we do not see what path he foreclosed or what tactical shift the realization forces. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The photograph revelation (scars form a map) occurs on-page but functions as confirmation of what he already suspected rather than a reversal that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the storm and lightning providing sensory charge. The darkroom timer and photograph are tactile anchors handled across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias could have this epiphany anywhere—and the storm operates as symbolic backdrop rather than forcing tactical adaptation. Spatial choreography (platform, railing, ledge) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—is signaled early but never faces meaningful resistance or cost. Elias arrives to wait and reflect, the photograph obligingly reveals its pattern during a lightning flash, and he departs with an insight that requires no sacrifice or alteration of prior stance. The darkroom timer beeps twice but does not tighten pressure or force a choice; it marks time without consequence. No on-page reversal narrows options or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scars-as-map conceit and the distinction between reading and carrying, avoiding overt moralizing until the final beat. The photograph'seback-turned posture and the "borders vs. land" question offer thematic texture. However, the ending delivers a thesis statement ("some maps were never meant to be read, only carried") that names rather than dramatizes the thematic answer, and the single star feels like symbolic punctuation rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction frequently elevates into lyric register ("rarefied his anger," "storm-kissed wonder," "lullaby") that feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated by a censored poet under stress. The prose carries a distinct textural signature but risks authorial ventriloquism; phrases like "furiously tranquil" and "vigil in pause" read as crafted rather than perceived. Free indirect style is clean when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence ("forgotten god's watchtower," "scars across skin," "moon lit rivers," "sky close enough to touch"). Many images are vivid but several verge on mixed or strained: "rarefied his anger, distilled it...like the edge of a scalpel" conflates gaseous, liquid, and solid metaphors within one move. Template openings recur ("He had come here," "The storm outside"). Paraphrase loop: the vigil/waiting concept is restated multiple times without added pressure. The closure beat is not obscured, capping deductions at −0.8 for density and −0.4 for loops, totaling roughly −1.2 within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The scars-as-map premise offers a fresh angle on exile and survival, and the censored poet's occupation integrates thematically. However, the execution follows a familiar contemplative arc: arrival, reflection, symbolic revelation, departure with insight. The photograph's delayed revelation (scars form a deliberate pattern) feels prepared for the protagonist rather than discovered through his agency. The darkroom timer and observatory setting are vivid but do not transform the underlying template of solitary epiphany.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation (censored poet) informs his approach to the photograph, but his key "decision"—to carry rather than read the map—is a realization rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a visible path. He observes, reflects, and departs; no competing option is dramatized on the page. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure, but agency remains contemplative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timer appears in paragraph five, is turned over and examined, beeps twice (marking cycles without consequence), and is noted at closure as completing its cycle. It is handled across three beats but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its function as exposure-measurer is thematic rather than mechanical. Reweighted meaning (measuring "the space between what was said and what was felt") is asserted but not demonstrated through action. Intro after ~20%, multiple touches, thematic link, but no causal pressure or closure linkage beyond cameo mention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named in paragraph four and echoed in the waiting posture throughout, but functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The vigil has no live clock, no contested duration, no cost for continuing or abandoning it. Elias waits, the storm provides atmosphere, and he leaves when insight arrives; the pause does not narrow options or force a choice. Present as concept, not as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" describes the storm in paragraph three and is reprised as "storm's fury now a lullaby" at closure, functioning as atmospheric paradox rather than a character trait that constrains or enables action. The descriptor applies to setting, not to Elias's attribute, and does not create an on-page tradeoff or choice. Lyric early-to-late reprise without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once in paragraph seven ("rarefied his anger, distilled it into something sharp") as metaphor for Elias's emotional processing. The term describes an internal state rather than driving a turn; the anger's transformation does not alter his tactics or create a visible cost. No middle beat or closure participation. Swappable with "crystallized" or "focused" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in a bus timetable is introduced in paragraph five, signaling mystery and urgency (no return address, ink bled at edges). The method of delivery primes the photograph's significance and the question it poses, which triggers Elias's journey to the observatory. The envelope is repocketed at closure, "pressed against his chest like a second heartbeat," charging the final image. Present in setup (~31% mark is late but within tolerance for a trigger), drives the middle contemplation, and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Does not constrain a choice but enables the central question and participates in the ending's emotional charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is introduced in the opening line and provides vivid atmospheric texture (lightning, glass dome, platform, railing). The setting enables the lightning flash that illuminates the photograph's pattern and offers symbolic resonance (above clouds, close to sky). However, the observatory does not constrain Elias's choices or provide a resource that alters tactics; he could conduct this reflection anywhere with a light source. Present across all three gates with strong sensory detail but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is named in paragraph seven as the time Elias came to the observatory, describing a moment of performative collapse. The timeframe does not create urgency, tighten decisions, or track as a live clock; the storm provides duration without deadline. The phrase functions as thematic descriptor rather than temporal constraint. Mentioned once without shaping tactics or closure timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The desire "to understand the cartography of scars" is articulated in paragraph seven and governs Elias's contemplation throughout. The motivation is consistent and thematically rich but never faces friction or cost; understanding arrives via lightning flash and internal realization without sacrifice or competing want. The shift from "understand" to "carry" at closure reframes the goal but does not dramatize tension between what he wants and what it costs. Present across setup, middle, and closure with thematic coherence but minimal on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storm-kissed wonder appears in paragraph fifteen as tone descriptor and is sustained through the atmospheric intensity (lightning, howling wind, violet/gold sky) and the final image (star revealed, silence "full of things he could not yet name"). Tone modulates from expectant stillness to illumination to quiet resolve, supporting the Conceptual Repricing arc. The phrase itself is late (final fifth) but the tone it names is established earlier through setting and rhythm. Coherent modulation with closure linkage; the tone charges the final image without becoming static.</comment>
