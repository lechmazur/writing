<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear (outwit tricksters) and her choice to use subsonic frequencies is on-page, but her interiority reads generic—"trembling fingers," "breath fogging glass"—without contradictory impulses or character-particular perception. The final micro-smile and "cautiously hopeful" label appear as told states rather than embodied cost. Voss shifts from smug to awed too smoothly, without internal friction or a visible trade-off that would earn the change. The decision to activate the signal carries stakes but no genuine struggle or foreclosed path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causality is clean: Mara detects the anomalies, devises a counter-signal, and activates it; the subsonic pulse smooths the charts and diffuses campus tension. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community tension dissipates, Mara is "cautiously hopeful," and she acknowledges wars yet to come. However, the cost is more asserted than shown—"the weight of the night pressing down"—and the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the tricksters simply lose their hold off-page. Orientation is immediate (university radio station, Mara at the controls, tonight), and the lens is causal with a clean midpoint turn when she decides to interfere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio station setting is anchored early (observation booth, dials, broadcast tower) and the subsonic generator is a functional tool that Mara handles across beats. Sensory detail—static hum, fogging breath, red warning lights—supports atmosphere but remains somewhat generic. The charts constrain her diagnosis and the generator enables the solution, meeting the micro-setting standard for 600–800 words. However, the campus quad and tower exterior are described rather than used to pressure choices, and no spatial choreography shifts under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stop the tricksters before reality unravels) is signaled early and the subsonic activation is a decisive on-page choice. The tightening occurs when Mara moves from analysis to interference, and Voss's skepticism briefly tests her resolve. Yet the escalation is modest: no genuine reversal or trade-off beyond Mara's internal steadiness, and the tricksters are defeated off-page with no visible cost beyond her exhaustion. The "if you're wrong? Then we're already lost" exchange gestures toward stakes but does not dramatize a price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme—cunning over force, whispering over shouting—is stated overtly: "not by shouting, but by whispering." The tricksters as chaos-feeders and the subsonic silence as counter-strategy offer a coherent concept, but the final paragraph moralizes ("human ingenuity… human stubbornness") rather than letting the image resonate. The astronomical charts recur but do not shift meaning; they remain diagnostic tools. No ambiguity or non-literal answer emerges—the solution works cleanly, the tension lifts, and Mara's cautious hope is declared rather than earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a consistent register (academic-laced, crisis-tinged). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, with Voss's skepticism and Mara's resolve advancing the beat. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the spaces between the stars," "the fabric of the universe") without grounding in Mara's specific perceptual signature. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; the voice is clean but not distinctive under pressure. Mara's internal texture does not compress or sharpen when she activates the signal—the prose remains at the same register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence structure. Minor loop: "Mara closed her eyes, listening to the static, the hum of the generator, the distant murmur of a world on the brink" recycles the list cadence from earlier beats without adding pressure. Stock metaphors appear—"powder keg," "distant stars," "mist"—but do not muddle clarity. Information density is acceptable; the subsonic generator introduction is efficient. The final paragraph leans on summary ("the weight of the night pressing down") rather than concrete image, and "cautiously hopeful" is repeated as a label. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (cosmic tricksters vs. subsonic counter-signal) offers a fresh angle on signal-interpreter stories, but the execution defaults to familiar beats: lone scientist detects anomaly, devises solution, skeptical colleague witnesses success. The tricksters remain abstract; their laughter "echoes in the spaces between the stars" without specific tactics or personification. Mara's subsonic insight is clever but arrives without prior groundwork—no earlier mention of whale song experiments or frequency theory to earn the aha moment. The resolution is tidy and unambiguous, with no bold risk or transformation of the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's role as celestial signal interpreter anchors the premise, drives her diagnosis of the anomalies, and enables her subsonic solution. She appears in every beat, makes the key decision to interfere, and activates the generator at the climax. Her expertise is essential to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The astronomical charts are handled in at least three beats: Mara traces erratic pulses, notes the shifted patterns, and observes them smooth after the subsonic pulse. They constrain her diagnosis and charge the resolution ("glowed in the dim light, a map of battles won and wars yet to come"), though the final metaphor is told rather than shown through evolving use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core concept "power plays" is present as the tricksters' chaos versus Mara's cunning, but it remains thematic rather than shaping on-page tactics. Voss's skepticism hints at interpersonal maneuvering, but no one's status or leverage shifts under pressure. The concept is echoed rather than enacted in specific choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is declared twice—once mid-story when Mara proposes her solution, once at the end. It labels her stance but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible trade-off. The attribute describes her state rather than driving an on-page action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the action that structures the plot: Mara moves from observation to intervention, designs the subsonic counter-signal, and activates it. The decision to interfere defines the turn and the climax. Without it, the story would lack agency and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The subsonic frequency generator is introduced as a "relic from the station's early days" and its mechanics—embedding a counter-signal below human hearing—are explained before use. Mara activates it at the climax, and the method is causally necessary to the resolution. However, it arrives suddenly without prior groundwork (whale song experiments are mentioned only when the tool is introduced), limiting its score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The university radio station provides the subsonic generator, the observation booth workspace, and the broadcast tower. The setting enables Mara's profession and supplies the tools she needs. The campus quad and fracturing community apply time pressure but do not constrain her tactics. The setting is functional and necessary but does not evolve or recharge meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the community divides" is established early (arguments in the quad, factions forming) and provides urgency ("the campus was a powder keg"). However, no ticking clock or escalating consequence pushes Mara's decision timing. The division dissipates after her intervention without dramatizing what would have happened if she had waited. The timeframe sets context but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to outwit the tricksters drives her choice to use subtlety over brute force and her selection of the subsonic method. The motivation is stated clearly and shapes her approach ("They expect noise. I'll give them silence"). However, no internal friction or competing desire complicates the choice—she is steadily resolved throughout. The tricksters remain abstract, reducing the felt cost of the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tone blends cosmic menace ("the spaces between the stars," tricksters' laughter) with grounded technical detail (dials, subsonic generator, charts). The balance of ethereal imagery and practical problem-solving is consistent across beats. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—Mara's internal register remains steady whether diagnosing anomalies or activating the signal—and the final image ("glowing charts, a map of battles won") leans abstract rather than charging the closure with grit.</comment>
