<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior is vividly established—conflicted, lucidly watchful, yearning—but his agency largely stays observational. The encounters with the woman, boy, and protagonist-ghost pass as visions rather than forcing micro-choices that visibly alter his tactics. The ending pivot ("let them pass through him") reads as epiphany rather than earned renunciation with on-page cost; we don't see what he forfeits by wading back. His embodied fear and attraction to the mist anchor him, but the closure lacks a credible choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~80 words (who, where, what he seeks). The lens reads accumulative/textural: sensory density and cameo pattern build pressure toward the protagonist-ghost confrontation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias accepts that hopes are fleeting and commits to watching—but the cost is asserted ("All he had to do was keep watching") rather than dramatized. The river's insistence and the protagonist's demand ("Then learn") gesture at stakes, but the final wade-back lacks visible forfeiture or a tactical shift that makes the before/after legible with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The feral nexus is vividly rendered: mist that curls "like a living thing," river flowing against itself, air smelling of damp earth and old paper. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias wades deeper, figures emerge and vanish, he turns back—and the liminal atmosphere charges every beat. The setting does not constrain a choice in the middle (the river "urges" but doesn't block), preventing entry to 8+; it does charge the final image of wading against current, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting ephemeral hopes to give them weight—is signaled early and braided with his unfinished novel. Pressure accumulates through three cameo encounters, each vanishing before he can act, and the protagonist-ghost's rebuke ("You never let me be anything more than a sketch") tightens the meta-conflict. The ending pivot lacks a visible trade-off or forfeited option; Elias's acceptance ("let them pass through him") is told rather than tested on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but escalation stops short of forcing a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—the fragility and multiplicity of hope, the artist's struggle to shape the unshaped—emerges organically from the cameo structure and the spiral seashell's hum. The protagonist-ghost's accusation and Elias's admission ("I didn't know how") are specific and dramatically earned. The final image ("keep watching") gestures at an answer but remains abstract; the piece resists moralizing yet the ending leans toward statement ("that was the point—not to hold onto them") rather than offering a non-literal, resonant answer grounded in concrete action. The seashell and mist motifs recur purposefully without forcing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and maintained: literary, precise, slightly archaic ("cloying," "solemnize," "lucidly watchful"), filtered through a novelist's habit of seeing the world as text ("like sentences half-formed," "the whisper of closing pages"). Psychic distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (perceiving mist as narrative, characters as drafts) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the boy's plea and the protagonist's rebuke both advance pressure. One brief filter stack ("he realized") is voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sensory detail is vivid and selective ("mist curled... like a living thing," "hollow chambers echoing"). Two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "This was how it worked... through ephemeral cameo appearances" immediately followed by "This was the problem with hope... it was never just one thing"; and "the shapes of different hopes" is restated without adding pressure. Template-cadence run in the boy encounter: "the boy asked... Elias shook... The boy's face fell... he, too, faded" (four consecutive stems). Information density is high elsewhere; these artifacts lower the score from 7.5 to 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The meta-fictional frame (novelist confronting his unfinished protagonist in a liminal space) is executed with care but not fresh; the riverbank-of-unwritten-stories appears in craft workshops and MFA collections regularly. Specific details—spiral seashell fragment humming with the novel's echo, cameo figures as textual ghosts—give the premise texture. The emotional core (artistic paralysis, the cost of holding on versus letting go) is universal but not transformed into a non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, lifting it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his conflicted state is richly drawn, but his novelist identity functions primarily as lens rather than driver of key turns. He observes, wades deeper, and finally turns back—choices that advance the sequence but do not alter tactics or foreclose options with visible cost. The protagonist-ghost's rebuke momentarily challenges him, yet the admission ("I didn't know how") doesn't trigger a causal shift. Setup and closure present; middle development weak. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle causal work; modest beat involvement and lyric reprise lower to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The spiral seashell fragment appears in beat one (tucked in pocket, humming when pressed to ear) and returns at four key moments: he clutches it when the boy fades, reflects on it mid-sequence ("the novel he couldn't finish"), grips it tighter after the protagonist dissolves, and thinks of it in the penultimate paragraph. Setup, development (he uses it to anchor his mission), and closure participation all present. It does not constrain a choice—he never presses it to his ear on-page, never sacrifices it—so causal pressure is low. Two-gate minimum met; purposeful recurrence across beats; swappable with another talisman. Score 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Against the current" is signaled early (river bends unnaturally, current pushes against him) and literally enacted twice: Elias wades deeper despite the river's insistence, then turns "against the current" to wade back. The concept shapes his tactics (he moves oppositionally by habit) and charges the final image. Setup, development (he "had always been a man who moved against the current"), and closure all present. Causal pressure modest—it describes his stance rather than narrowing options. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, beat involvement (two) +0.9; swappability −0.5. Score 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is introduced as summary trait early ("that vigilance served him as he scanned the mist") and recurs in the final line ("All he had to do was keep watching"). Setup and closure present; middle development absent—his watchfulness does not enable or constrain a middle choice with cost. The trait remains label-only; we see him observe but not trade off watchfulness against another need. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate; closure reprise +0.5, early signal +0.3, label-only −0.6. Score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Solemnize" appears once as his stated mission ("to solemnize them, to give their shapes weight before they dissolved") and is implied in his clutching the seashell and wading deeper. Setup present (~25%); middle and closure participation weak—no on-page act of solemnizing occurs, and the ending pivots to letting hopes pass through rather than solemnizing them. The action does not drive a turn; it frames intent without dramatization. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates; early signal +0.4, summary-only −0.3, ornamental −0.6. Score 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is taught early (woman vanishes, "ephemeral cameo appearances, the hopes of others revealed themselves") and structures all three encounters: woman, boy, protagonist-ghost all appear and fade. Setup, development (each cameo advances his understanding), and closure (the final paragraph acknowledges "the hopes, fleeting and fragile") all present. The mechanics matter—each disappearance raises the cost of contact—but the method does not constrain his choices; he cannot hold them regardless. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5, cost connection +0.4. Score 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral nexus is established in the opening line and present throughout: river bending against flow, mist swirling in sentence-like patterns, liminal space where boundaries blur. Setup, development (mist thickens and current pulls harder as pressure rises), and closure (he wades back "toward the shore") all present. The setting does not constrain a middle choice—Elias wades freely—but it charges the final image and supplies the structural metaphor (narrative space collapsing). Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.6, no middle constraint −0.8. Score 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"The whisper of closing pages" appears twice: mid-sequence ("leaving Elias alone with the whisper of closing pages, the sense that time was running out") and in the final paragraph ("the whisper of closing pages growing louder behind him"). Setup (~40%), closure present; middle absent—the timeframe does not tighten a middle decision. The metaphor is vivid but does not function as a live clock; Elias does not race it or sacrifice speed for thoroughness. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate; closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5, ornamental −0.5, lyric reprise +0.3. Score 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to collect the shapes of different hopes") and dramatized through his wading deeper and clutching the seashell. Setup and development present; closure weak—he shifts to "let them pass through him" without visible cost. The desire is conflicted (tangled with his own unfinished novel) but not tested in a choice that narrows options. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.4, told-only friction −0.6, swappability −0.4. Score 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is established immediately—mist curling, "thick and cloying," air "smelled of damp earth and old paper"—and sustained through every beat: hushed dialogue, figures vanishing "like a page turning," river's insistent whisper. The tone modulates subtly (quieter when the boy speaks, denser when the protagonist confronts him) and charges the final image ("the mist would always be there"). Setup, development, and closure all present. Coherence across turns, modulation under pressure, and closure charge all strong. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.5, beat involvement (full) +1.4, specificity +0.6. Score 7.4.</comment>
