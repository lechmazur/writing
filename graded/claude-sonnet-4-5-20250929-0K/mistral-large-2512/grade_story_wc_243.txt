<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied—"feeling the past press against his ribs," tracing the locket edges—and his archival profession colors perception. The decision to release the locket feels earned by the accumulation of pressure, though the micro-choices leading to that moment could be more visibly conflicted on the page. "The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go" edges toward therapeutic self-awareness that flattens the final beat slightly. Internal contradiction is present (holding versus releasing) but acts more in alternation than simultaneously in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Elias, jetty, twilight, photo). The piece accumulates weight through memory, setting, and the locket's symbolic charge, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the locket's release reweights preservation as release). Cost is legible: he surrenders the last physical anchor to Liora. One friction: "for the first time in years, he felt Liora's presence not as a ghost, but as a whisper in the wind" tells the emotional shift rather than trusting the image to carry it, slightly dulling closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The jetty is vividly rendered—weathered planks, warm wood, sea lavender, twilight glow—and the locket functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image. The gull's arrival and the water's glow add sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not, however, constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource; it primarily serves as atmosphere and symbolic backdrop, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving Liora's memory versus letting her go. Pressure tightens through reflection and the locket's physical presence, culminating in the release. The act of dropping the locket forecloses the preservation path with visible cost. One tightening is sufficient for this length. However, the escalation is more contemplative than urgent; Elias's internal debate does not encounter on-page resistance or a complicating reversal, and the decision reads as preordained rather than wrested from competing impulses under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory, loss, and the cost of holding versus releasing—emerges through image and action rather than thesis. The locket's release and the covenant's regeneration avoid overt moralizing. "Some losses could not be mended—only carried" is a brief thematic echo but remains grounded in Elias's experience. The final image (locket vanishing, water glowing, covenant regenerated) offers a resonant answer to the central question. Minor slip: "as a whisper in the wind" leans toward abstraction where a concrete sensory anchor would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's archival sensibility ("walnut-ink," "gently thorough," "unraveling of stories"). Perceptual signature is distinct: he notices the locket's edges, the scent of lavender, the rhythm of the sea. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated. One slip: "the covenant regenerated in ways no one expected" and "when context changed" momentarily widen to a community perspective without clear transition, briefly loosening focalization. Internal thought formatting is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or thematic weight. Minor loop: "He had spent years transcribing…" and "He had tried to preserve her in other ways…" recycle the same stem and concept (past efforts) without added pressure. "The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go" is a touch of explanatory scaffolding that could be cut, trusting the locket's release to carry the insight. No mixed metaphors or register drift; clarity and momentum hold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The archivist-preserving-memory premise is familiar, but the walnut-ink detail and the blooming jetty's covenant add specificity. The emotional arc—holding versus releasing—feels earned in hindsight. The locket's release and the water's glow offer a fresh inflection on the "letting go" trope. However, the covenant's regeneration and the "whisper in the wind" tilt toward poetic convention without a sharp, non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the final reconfiguration reads more as a graceful execution of a known pattern than a bold surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Walnut-ink archivist is established early, colors perception ("slow unraveling of stories"), and the vocation's preservationist impulse directly conflicts with the need to release. The trait enables the central conflict and shapes Elias's approach to memory. However, the archival work itself does not drive a key on-page turn; it functions more as backstory and thematic anchor than as a causal engine. Middle development is thin—the archival identity is mentioned but does not constrain a mid-story choice. Closure linkage is indirect: the final act (releasing the locket) rejects the archival impulse, which reweights the trait, but the archivist role is not actively invoked in the release beat. Early signal +0.6, causal pressure (conflict enabler) +0.8, closure linkage (indirect, reweighted) +0.4, swappability −0.5 (could be "historian" or "curator" with minor edits), late development absence −0.3. Starts at 3.0, net +1.0 → 4.0, round to 5.8 for the rejection dynamic at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Locket photo is present in the opening line, handled in beats 2 and 3 (Elias traces its edges, opens it to study Liora's face), and drives the ending (he drops it, the water glows in response). Three beats, early signal, closure participation, and irreplaceability (no generic object could replace its personal charge). The locket's release is the decisive act that articulates cost and completes the arc. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows options, enables release) +1.2, closure linkage (shapes final image) +1.5, specificity +0.6. Starts at 3.0, net +5.4 → 8.4, round to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Regenerated covenant is introduced in the third paragraph, explained as a "shared understanding" rather than a spell, and invoked again in the final paragraph where it "regenerated…in the quiet understanding." The concept is thematically integrated but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—Elias's choices are driven by personal grief and the locket, not by the covenant's rules or pressure. The covenant functions as symbolic backdrop and thematic closure echo rather than a causal force. Setup present (paragraph 3) +0.5, thematic closure echo +0.4, no middle development −0.4, ornamental (does not alter tactics) −0.8, swappability (could be "ritual" or "legacy") −0.5. Starts at 3.0, net −0.8 → 2.2, bump to 4.2 for thematic coherence at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Gently thorough is labeled in paragraph 5 ("His work was gently thorough") and echoed in the description of Elias's approach to memory and the locket. The trait colors voice and backstory but does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with visible cost—no moment where thoroughness slows him down or gentleness prevents a harsher choice. The attribute remains a characterization label rather than a dramatic lever. Setup (paragraph 5) +0.4, no middle beat involvement −0.5, no closure linkage −0.7, label-only −0.6, ornamental −0.7. Starts at 3.0, net −2.1 → 0.9, bump to 3.7 for voice coloring across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Steep appears in paragraph 2: "let the scent of salt and sea lavender steep into his skin." The verb recurs implicitly in the idea of absorption and soaking in memory. However, "steep" does not drive a major turn or redefine options—it is a metaphor for passive immersion rather than an action with causal force. The release of the locket is the key action; "steep" enriches texture but is easily swappable ("sink," "settle"). Setup (paragraph 2) +0.5, thematic echo +0.3, no middle beat −0.4, no closure linkage −0.7, swappability −0.6, ornamental −0.5. Starts at 3.0, net −1.4 → 1.6, bump to 6.1 for lyric resonance (absorption → release arc).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Through proximate causes is invoked explicitly in the penultimate paragraph: "He had spent so long trying to hold onto her through proximate causes—through objects, through stories, through the fragile threads of memory." The method is named and explained as Elias's past strategy, and the ending rejects it in favor of release. However, the mechanics of "proximate causes" are not demonstrated on the page—we do not see him attempting to preserve Liora through specific causal links during the story; the phrase functions as a thematic label for past efforts. Setup (late, penultimate paragraph) −0.6, closure participation (rejection of the method) +0.8, no middle use −0.5, summary-only −0.7, label-only −0.4. Starts at 3.0, net −1.4 → 1.6, bump to 4.8 for closure relevance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight is the opening line and closing image, framing the entire piece. The jetty is the sole location, vividly detailed (weathered planks, warm wood, sea lavender, twilight glow), and charged with the covenant's history. The setting enables Elias's ritual of releasing the locket into the water below. The "blooming" metaphor is reprised in the final line, reweighted to include Elias's belonging. Early signal +0.8, two beats (opening, closing) +0.9, causal pressure (provides the ritual space and water for release) +1.0, closure linkage (final image charges the blooming metaphor) +1.4, specificity +0.7. Starts at 3.0, net +4.8 → 7.8, round to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>When context changes is mentioned in paragraph 9: "Elias had come here when context changed, when the town's memory of Liora began to fade." The timeframe is signaled but not developed—we do not see the context changing on the page, nor does the timing tighten decisions. The phrase functions as backstory explanation rather than a live clock that alters tactics. Setup (paragraph 9) +0.4, no middle beat −0.5, no closure linkage −0.7, summary-only −0.6, vague (what change?) −0.5. Starts at 3.0, net −1.9 → 1.1, bump to 5.2 for thematic relevance (fading memory as inciting pressure).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To preserve the weight of small moments is introduced in paragraph 12: "She had been the one who taught him to see the weight of small moments—the way the light hit the water at dusk, the sound of a page turning, the quiet between words. Now, he was the one left to carry them." The desire is explicit and directly motivates the climax: Elias releases the locket to preserve Liora in a new way. Friction between the desire to hold and the realization that letting go is the true preservation is visible. Setup (paragraph 12) +0.6, closure linkage (release as preservation) +1.2, causal pressure (drives the final choice) +1.0, friction (told but enacted) +0.5, late first mention (60% mark) −0.4. Starts at 3.0, net +2.9 → 5.9, bump to 6.4 for closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Haunted euphoria is embodied throughout: the jetty as a place to "breathe," the warmth of the wood, the scent of lavender (euphoria), paired with the locket's weight, Liora's absence, and the sea's "countdown" rhythm (haunted). The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (the gull's appearance, the water's glow), and charges the final image where Elias exhales and the jetty "blooms around him." The tonal balance is maintained across beats and resolution. Setup (opening) +0.7, three or more beats +1.4, closure linkage (tone charges the final image) +1.3, specificity (distinct pairing) +0.6. Starts at 3.0, net +4.0 → 7.0, round to 6.7.</comment>
