<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear—she wants the letters to spark a revolution—but her interior life reads more as competence display than genuine internal conflict. The "calmly inventive" trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to light the torch and leave feels mechanically executed rather than earned through visible psychological cost; we see capability but not struggle or genuine foreclosure of alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~120 words. The story follows a causal arc: Mira discovers the parchment → realizes the governor's plan → lights a signal torch → leaves. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Mira simply executes her plan and walks away with no on-page consequence or meaningful reconfiguration. The revolution is asserted to "burn on its own," but we don't witness a decisive change in Mira's options or stance—she completes her task cleanly and exits. The final image ("Somewhere, a lock clicked open. Somewhere, a spark caught.") gestures at thematic resonance but remains abstract rather than grounding cost in Mira's body or immediate choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent moss, brass goggles, and bronze quill holder provide vivid sensory anchors. The fort's corridors function as a lived-in space Mira knows "better than her own reflection," and the unlit torch in the armory becomes a tactical resource. The moss-light filters perception throughout, and the spatial choreography (governor's room → armory → twilight exit) remains coherent. The setting pressures Mira's choices by limiting visibility during the blackout and offering the armory torch as a signal mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—obtaining the governor's letters to enable a revolution—is signaled early. Pressure escalates when the aide leaves a new parchment revealing the governor's timeline. However, Mira faces no meaningful obstacle or trade-off; she retrieves the parchment unopposed, lights the torch without resistance, and departs. The story delivers one tightening (the aide's arrival), but Mira's agency never forecloses a live option with visible cost. The resolution reads as smooth execution rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—revolution through silence and cunning—emerges organically from Mira's actions and the fort's atmosphere. The locked spaces, coded sundial, and spark imagery accumulate purposefully. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("The revolution would burn on its own") and the ending leans on stock revolutionary rhetoric ("a spark caught. And the world held its breath") rather than a fresh, particular image that reweights prior material. The thematic question is present but not answered with resonant specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in limited third throughout. Mira's perceptual signature—"years memorizing every tumbler"—colors her attention to locks and vaults. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "winking hush," "coiling in her chest," "gears snapping together." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the parchment discovery. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Minor strain: "her thoughts snapping together like gears" edges toward mechanical metaphor, but the voice remains distinct and the prose modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively and most lines carry double duty (e.g., "She had seen the coded angles in the half-painted sundial outside his window—an old cipher, one only a few could read" delivers world detail, character knowledge, and plot setup). A few phrases edge toward ornamentation without adding pressure: "her breath steady, her mind calmly inventive" tells rather than shows the trait, and "the world held its breath" is a stock closer. The prose is clean and propulsive with no major loops or template cadence, but the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("Somewhere, a lock clicked open") slightly dulls the closure image's concreteness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent fort and coded sundial offer fresh textural details, and the "vigilant lock sentinel" role is specific. However, the core plot—discovering evidence of a conspiracy and lighting a signal to spark a revolution—follows a familiar template without substantial transformation. The emotional arc is smooth and conflict-free; Mira executes her plan without meaningful friction or trade-off. The half-painted sundial cipher and bronze quill holder add color but don't generate non-obvious choices or reweightings that surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as lock sentinel is signaled in the opening third and her specialized knowledge ("every tumbler, every false keyhole") frames her access. She makes two key decisions: retrieving the parchment and lighting the torch. However, her choices are not deeply constrained by the sentinel role itself—any skilled infiltrator could perform these actions. The trait appears in setup and beats but does not drive a turn with visible cost specific to her sentinel expertise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in setup (governor's desk description), middle action (aide deposits parchment, Mira retrieves it), and is referenced at closure as the source of the revolution's spark. It enables two beats and carries reweighted meaning (innocuous → dangerous). However, its specific bronze materiality doesn't constrain choice; any container would serve the same function. The holder is structurally important but lacks irreplaceable physical properties that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" appears as quoted text in the retrieved parchment and echoes thematically in the final image ("a spark caught"). It frames the governor's plan and Mira's counter-move, shaping the story's central stakes. However, the phrase functions more as thematic shorthand than a concept with on-page mechanics that alter Mira's tactics. It's present in setup and closure but doesn't constrain middle choices or introduce a visible cost tied to its specific logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is asserted once in the opening third ("her breath steady, her mind calmly inventive") but never demonstrated through on-page problem-solving under pressure. Mira's actions—waiting, retrieving, lighting a torch—are competent but straightforward; we don't see her invent a solution or navigate a constraint that tests calm resourcefulness. The trait is label-only and could be removed without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intrigue" permeates the story: Mira spies on the aide, decodes the sundial, interprets the parchment, and plants a signal. Multiple beats trace to secretive maneuvering. However, "intrigue" is broad; swapping it for "espionage" or "subterfuge" would not require structural edits. The action shapes the tone and several turns but lacks a unique mechanic that makes it indispensable to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial and its coded angles are mentioned in setup as the mechanism that pointed Mira to "tonight, to the blackout." The element signals early and primes the inciting situation. However, we never see Mira decode the sundial on the page or use its mechanics to alter a middle choice. It functions as backstory setup rather than an active method that constrains tactics or reappears at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The luminous fort is anchored immediately and recurs throughout: bioluminescent moss casts light during the blackout, corridors are a maze Mira knows intimately, the armory supplies the signal torch, and the fort's glow frames the final image. The setting pressures Mira's choices (blackout creates opportunity and constraint), supplies resources (unlit torch), and charges the ending ("the fort's glow at her back"). The fort is visually distinct and functionally integral across setup, beats, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blackout is established in the opening line and enables the entire plan: "the moment when the fort's defenses would be blind." Mira counts seconds and references "the third watch" from the parchment, showing time awareness. The blackout tightens the window for action and shapes Mira's tactics. However, the timeframe doesn't escalate pressure mid-scene—no clock races against her—and the ending doesn't hinge on the blackout's duration. Present across beats with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "spark a silent revolution" is stated early and drives her decision to retrieve the letters and light the signal torch. The motivation shapes two key beats and frames the ending. However, it's never dramatized as conflicted—Mira doesn't hesitate, weigh personal cost, or face friction between revolutionary goals and self-preservation. The want is clear and purposeful but lacks internal contradiction or a visible trade-off that would elevate it into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears as a phrase once ("Mira smiled, a winking hush of a thing") and colors the overall atmosphere of secrecy and subtle action. The tone is coherent—quiet, sly, controlled—and modulates slightly when Mira strikes the flint. However, the phrase itself doesn't recur or charge the final image; the ending shifts toward grandiose rhetoric ("the world held its breath") rather than maintaining the intimate, conspiratorial tone established earlier. Functional but not fully integrated into closure.</comment>
