<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's decision to "let go" rather than control emerges from her three-year practice and the physical evidence (bark yielding, branches twisting), but the shift feels more narrated than embodied—"understood then" arrives as statement rather than visceral realization. Her initial reluctance is signaled (crouching, hesitating), yet the final surrender lacks a painful trade-off or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("half gasp, half laugh") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (nursery, storm season, sapling distress). The closure unit—Mara kneeling and surrendering control as the sapling transforms—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharply legible on the page: no concrete forfeiture of her pruning tools, no explicit choice to abandon a specific cultivation method. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density increases through discovery → transformation → surrender), yet the final image feels more like mood confirmation than a reweighting that narrows options or deepens stakes with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and damp earth anchor the opening; the sapling's iridescent bark and silver-sheened leaves supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through Mara's expertise. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional priorities (soil coolness, leaf curl, bark texture). The trellis setting shapes her decision to step outside and the rain intensifies during the final beat, yet the environment does not materially constrain her choice—she could kneel in the greenhouse with similar effect, so the micro-setting falls short of charging the closure image indispensably.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to control or surrender to the sapling's transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the bark softens under her touch. One meaningful reversal occurs (branches twist toward her, forcing the realization), but the escalation lacks a visible price: Mara's surrender feels atmospheric rather than a trade-off between competing professional commitments or a tangible loss of method. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres, yet the final cost reads as conceptual rather than dramatized with on-page consequence that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of transformation vs. control emerges through concrete particulars (pruning practice, bark splitting, leaf warming) without overt statement. The sapling's "circuitously sincere" metamorphosis and the linden leaf's mirrored curl create a pattern that reweights Mara's three-year cultivation ethos. The final image (kneeling in mud, hands cupped) offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though the phrase "stop trying to *reconstruct* the world in her image" edges toward thematic articulation rather than pure dramatization. The grandmother's texts risk convenience, but the folkloric cue is brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is horticulturalist-specific (leaf veins, bark texture, soil temperature). Diction stays within Mara's expertise without unmotivated register drift. The phrase "circuitously sincere, this metamorphosis" reads as narrator overlay rather than Mara's idiom under pressure, a brief voice slip. Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and the closing rhythm ("The rain fell harder, but she didn't move") controls pacing effectively. No dialogue present; focal distance tightens appropriately during the transformation beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and vivid with controlled rhythm; sentence openings vary and figurative language (bark "like warm wax," leaves "darkening as if singed") serves without overwhelming. Minor paraphrase appears: "She had spent years trying to control… but this—this was something else entirely" restates the control/surrender tension without adding pressure. Filter verbs ("watching as," "She had seen") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. No template cadence or loops that obscure causality; information density is solid, though the closure beat leans slightly toward atmospheric summary rather than taut propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—botanical expert confronts plant that defies her control paradigm—transforms a familiar "nature resists human mastery" trope through Mara's specific horticulture practice and the iridescent, animate sapling. The linden leaf as invitation and the grandmother's folklore texts risk convenience, yet the synthesis feels purposeful. The final image (kneeling in mud, storm intensifying) offers a fresh inflection on surrender, though the "something older" phrasing nods toward familiar fantasy registers. Risk-taking in the metamorphosis detail elevates without obscuring; the emotional arc avoids template but does not fully surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's nursery-owner identity frames her control ethos and primes the choice to release. She makes the pivotal closure decision (kneeling, surrendering), present in setup and payoff. Middle development is thinner—her expertise observes and interprets but does not face a mid-story tactical constraint tied specifically to her nursery role. The profession shapes stakes but does not drive a second distinct beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The linden leaf appears in setup (pressed into ledger, deliberate message), reappears at closure (grows warm, edges curl), and its vein-pulse detail recurs. Two distinct beats with evolving meaning. Yet the leaf enables recognition rather than constraining a choice with cost; Mara could reach the same surrender without it. The specificity (linden, veins pulsing) elevates but does not make it indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis shapes the dominant stake and the sapling's transformation on the page. The concept drives Mara's tactical shift from control to surrender and charges the closure image. "Reluctant" is embodied in the sapling's "pained" splitting and Mara's hesitation; "metamorphosis" is physical (bark, leaves, branches). Present in setup, middle (bark softens, branches twist), and payoff. Not easily swappable; the story logic depends on transformation resisting human imposition. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere" appears once, mid-story, as narrator descriptor rather than constraint on Mara's action. The phrase colors the metamorphosis but does not enable or prevent a choice with visible cost. Label-only use; no second beat or closure reprise. Present functionally but swappable with "indirect," "gradual," or similar modifiers. No gate for middle development or payoff participation as a lived trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" appears late (final third) in Mara's realization phrase, summarizing her prior pruning ethos retroactively rather than being dramatized as a key action. She does not physically reconstruct anything on the page; the verb functions as thematic label. Missing setup and middle development beats. Could be replaced with "control" or "shape" without structural change. No causal work or closure mechanics tied to the specific action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method "releasing control" is signaled early (her pruning practice, the sapling "didn't need her guidance"), shapes the middle beat (hesitating before touching, then exhaling tension), and defines the closure act (kneeling, letting go). The mechanics—physical relaxation, intentional surrender—matter and alter the outcome. Present across all three gates with visible cost (foregoing her three-year cultivation approach). Strong causal pressure; removal would break the resolution logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mossy trellis frames the opening (Mara steps outside to it) and supplies atmosphere during the closure (rain, damp earth). It motivates the spatial move but does not constrain the transformation choice—Mara could kneel by the sapling anywhere. Present in setup and payoff, missing middle development where the trellis itself alters tactics. Lyric reprise (opening anchor → closure image) keeps it functional, but the setting remains backdrop rather than active resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Storm season anchors the timeframe from the opening line and intensifies at closure ("storm rumbled overhead," "rain fell harder"). It primes urgency and shapes Mara's mood (humidity, upheaval), but does not impose a ticking-clock constraint that alters her tactics in real time. Present in setup and payoff; middle beat acknowledges "storm season was always like this" without dramatizing a time-driven choice. Functional across gates but not indispensable to decision mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to study plant behaviors" is established early (three years cultivating, documenting responses to weather) and drives her observational approach. It conflicts with the sapling's demand for surrender, creating friction at closure. Present in setup and payoff; middle beat involves her interpreting the transformation through her expertise lens. The motivation shapes the stakes but is not tested by a mid-story choice with visible cost. Strong thematic role; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of "sustaining transformation" coheres through measured pacing, lyrical diction, and the slow-build metamorphosis. It modulates with pressure (wonder at the bark softening, quickened pulse, calm exhalation) without breaking into melodrama or flatline. The final image (kneeling, rain intensifying, "only the first of many transformations") charges the ending with forward momentum. The tone is consistent across gates and supports the closure effect, though it risks atmospheric generality in places ("something older").</comment>
