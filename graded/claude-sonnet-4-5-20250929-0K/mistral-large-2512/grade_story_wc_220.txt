<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by clear past trauma and his hands shake—embodied emotion—but the final choice to "walk into the dark" lacks on-page cost or visible consequence that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is present (running from vs. being called back by the dead), yet the ending decision feels more like setup than earned agency. The backstory dominates without sufficient present micro-choices to tilt his stance with visible trade-off. Reflection exceeds ~30% without interleaved present alterations that change options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with atmospheric/textural layering, but closure is deferred: Elias packs and prepares to descend, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—cost is anticipated, not paid. The riddle and phonograph cylinder provide information but do not narrow options or force a crystallized stance with felt consequence. Orientation is anchored early (scrapyard, Elias's truck, post-war wasteland), so no penalty there. The piece teaches its premise but stops before delivering closure with legible cost under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard and Elias's hollowed transport truck are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (maps of the dead, rusted oil drum, moonlight on grooves). Sensory selection reflects his professional past and present isolation. The autumn leaf and phonograph cylinder function as charged micro-objects, yet the environment does not meaningfully constrain the final choice—Elias packs and leaves without spatial or resource friction. Strong atmosphere but just shy of the 9-band gate because setting does not alter tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to answer the call and search for the missing—is clear, and the phonograph message tightens pressure by revealing survivors. However, the story ends at the threshold: Elias decides to go but does not face an on-page reversal or pay a visible price that narrows options. The tightening occurs (message → decision) but lacks a second beat or felt cost at closure to meet high-band escalation standards. Agency is present but not yet tested under meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of presence, memory, and the gap between distance and closeness emerges through concrete images (leaf, maps, phonograph grooves as "secret texts"). "Tinted revelations" operates as subtext via distorted fragments of truth. Yet the ending does not offer a non-literal, resonant answer—it states intent without reweighting prior material through a final image or action. The autumn leaf "pulses" but does not charge the closure beat with new meaning. Theme is present and coherent but not deeply earned at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elias's perceptual signature (bloodhound instincts, maps of failure) is distinct. Diction is controlled with consistent register ("phonograph needle skipping grooves," "perfume of the world before the fires"). One minor slip: "tinted revelations" as a phrase feels slightly authorial rather than character-particular. Distance modulates well under pressure, and the voice carries a noir-inflected weariness that supports tone. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, strong internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats (phonograph discovery, Vey's message). However, several figurative phrases cluster without full integration: "carcass," "belly," "fingers of a corpse," "veins darkening like cracks in old bone" appear within close proximity, creating slight density fatigue. The final paragraph lists actions ("packed his bag… knife… courage") in flat sequence without propulsion. Minimal loops or scaffolding, but the closure beat does not accelerate—it settles into summary. Strong craft overall with minor slips in peak-beat propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The bloodhound-turned-hermit premise is familiar noir territory, but the phonograph cylinder as coded-message medium and "secret texts in grooves" offer a fresh mechanical detail. The scrapyard and Resource Wars setting are vivid yet not deeply transformed beyond post-apocalyptic conventions. Emotional specificity (trembling hands, maps of failure) elevates character work. The riddle and leaf motifs feel purposeful but not yet synthesized into an inevitable, non-obvious whole. Solid execution without breakthrough originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his past as a bloodhound frames expectation early. His decision to pack and descend is motivated by that history, but the choice does not create a key turn with visible cost—he agrees to the call without on-page resistance or trade-off. Present in setup and ending, but middle development lacks a moment where his bloodhound skills or trauma constrain/enable an action under pressure. Functional but replaceable with "retired detective" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The autumn leaf appears in three beats: desk introduction with backstory, pulsing during the phonograph message, and mentioned as packed at the end. It returns with slight reweighting (veins darken, pulse) but does not drive a choice or alter tactics. The wax preservation and soldier's dying gift are evocative, yet the object remains symbolic rather than causally active. Lyric resonance is present (early seed → final reprise) but lacks the charged specificity or cost linkage to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" is named once in narrator commentary ("truths that came not in clear glass, but in stained, distorted fragments") and echoed thematically via phonograph distortion and the riddle. It does not shape stakes or constrain on-page action—Elias listens and interprets without the concept altering his options. Present as theme but not as tactic or pressure. Swappable with "fragmented truths" or similar phrasing without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is implied through Elias's perceptual habits (noticing the phonograph's grooves glinting, reading coded messages) but never explicitly constrained or enabled a choice with visible cost. His intuition leads him to the cylinder and he decodes it, yet the trait is label-only—no on-page moment where descriptive intuition forces a trade-off or fails under pressure. Functional but replaceable with generic "observant" or "skilled" without edits to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The riddle appears early (slipped under door, answered immediately as "echo") and is referenced once more ("the riddle's answer echoing in his mind") at the end. It frames theme (presence/absence, voice without body) but does not drive a major turn—Elias solves it off-page and it does not constrain or enable his phonograph discovery or final choice. Present in setup and closure reprise, but middle causal work is missing. Swappable with any thematic object or message without altering the plot's spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder is signaled early (found in oil drum), used actively in the middle beat (Elias places it, adjusts speed, hears Vey's message), and its mechanics matter—grooves hold coded messages that reveal The Hollows and shift his stance. It drives the story's central information turn and shapes his final decision. Present across setup, development, and ending; causal pressure is clear. Just shy of 7.0+ because the mechanics do not constrain a second choice or face resistance—Elias succeeds in playback without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is anchored early with vivid detail (rusted carcass, skeletal machines, wind through scrap) and houses Elias's truck and the oil drum where the cylinder is found. It provides atmosphere and a single resource (the drum), but does not constrain tactics or shape the final choice—Elias could pack and leave from any base. Setting is present across beats and integral to tone, yet it does not alter outcome. Strong atmospheric work but lacks the micro-constraint or tactic-shaping friction for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The post-war timeframe is established early ("after the last Resource Wars," "final battle," "years running from the dead") and colors all action—scrapyard ruins, coded military messages, hidden survivors. It creates context but does not tighten decisions on the page; no live clock or deadline forces Elias's hand. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure. Present in setup and thematic coloring, but missing the causal development or closure urgency to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to translate distance into closeness, to make the dead feel less far away" is stated early and echoed at the end ("if he wanted to bring them closer, he'd have to walk into the dark"). It frames his arc and the phonograph message offers a concrete path. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices—he agrees to the call without visible friction between wanting and cost. Present in setup and ending with thematic tie, but lacks middle beat where the motivation forces a trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful: "wild hush" is named once and enacted through wind-whisper imagery, the phonograph's "thin, strained" voice, and Elias's quiet solitude. The tone modulates slightly when the message arrives (chill, trembling) but remains controlled and somber. It supports the final image without charging it decisively—the ending maintains the hush rather than breaking or reweighting it. Present across beats with steady atmospheric work, just shy of higher bands because tone does not shift under peak pressure or crystallize at closure.</comment>
