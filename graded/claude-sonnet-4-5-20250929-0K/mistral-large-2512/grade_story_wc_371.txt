<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn as a "creeping normality noticer" with distinct perceptual habits, and his interior life feels specific rather than generic. The woman at the tea house remains too thinly sketched—her "heuristically gentle" voice and knowing demeanor verge on archetype without embodied contradiction. The planting gesture at the end offers modest agency, but the choice feels muted rather than forcefully earned by prior contradiction. Interiority is clean and free of therapy-speak, though the epiphany about "stubborn persistence" hovers near summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: frost, city, bakery's absence by paragraph two. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrue (bakery, bread, courtyard, seeds, planting) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias plants seeds, enacting "absolution" as "grown" with conceptual cost (accepting erasure, choosing small persistence). The cost is legible in the act and the image of "tenuous" hope. No causal break mars closure, and the tightening from observation to action is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard, ivy, moss, and tea house are vivid and filter through Elias's professional gaze. Spatial choreography is clear: path, courtyard, tea house interior, window. The seeds and soil—micro-setting elements—constrain the final planting choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail (scent of yeast, damp soil, steam) is selective and anchored to stakes. No awkward telescoping or floating-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding absolution/the sacred amid erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman offers seeds and Elias moves from passive observation to active planting. The cost is conceptual—accepting that restoration is small, stubborn work rather than grand gesture—and is legible on the page ("tenuous," "first green shoot"). No antagonist or multiple reversals, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and the ending reweights prior material. Agency reads as decision with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (the sacred in stubborn persistence, absolution as growth) emerges through bread, seeds, and the final planting without overt moralizing. The woman's line "Absolution isn't given... It's grown" risks statement, but the gesture answers it concretely. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration: weight becomes "tenuous... like the first green shoot." Subtext operates in the bread-as-offering and the silent planting. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: he catalogs slippages and gaps. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with register matching an observant, reflective character. The woman's dialogue is economical and goal-driven, though her voice lacks strong idiom to distinguish from Elias's internal register. Filter verbs ("he thought," "she said") are minimal and conventional. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the planting beat. No artifice or template phrasing in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language ("ghost of something he couldn't name," "steam curling like a question") is purposeful and fresh. Minor register drift: "heuristically gentle" in the woman's introduction feels slightly imposed rather than earned by her speech or action, though it does not obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or scaffold. Propulsion is steady, with strategic telling compressing transit between bakery and courtyard.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" archetype is freshened by Elias's specific catalog (river's edge, clocktower chime) and the bread's persistent warmth. The guerrilla-gardening frame is familiar but grounded in the tea house setting and the woman's quiet authority. The final image—seeds planted beneath the window—synthesizes the elements without novelty but with earned coherence. No proximity echoes of famous lines; emotional specificity (the bread's warmth, the weight in his chest) elevates execution. Risk-taking is modest; the story commits to its quiet register without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias notices slippages throughout (bakery, river, clocktower) and his observation drives him to the tea house. The planting choice at the end alters tactics from passive cataloging to active intervention. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal role in two beats (seeking, planting). Swappability is moderate—another sensitive observer could fill the role, but the specific slippage catalog personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bread appears in three beats: carried in satchel, broken absently, placed as offering. It seeds Elias's link to the vanished bakery and reappears at the tea house to frame the exchange. The bread's persistent warmth is a specific property that charges its presence. Missing strong closure linkage—it sits on the table but does not directly shape the planting. Causal role in one beat (the offering gesture); setup and middle presence secure ~6.0 floor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Absolution is the stated motive, discussed explicitly ("I think I'm looking for absolution"), and the woman reframes it as growth. The planting enacts "tenuous absolution" in the final image. Stakes and tactics shift when Elias moves from seeking to growing. Present in setup (his search), middle (dialogue), and closure (planting = absolution). Causal role in final beat; conceptual repricing makes it undeniable. Slightly abstract—more grounded in gesture than in constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" describes the woman's voice once in paragraph sixteen. It colors her demeanor but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. No middle development or closure participation; label-only use without demonstrated trade-off. Present in setup but ornamental thereafter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears once: "He uncloaked the truth then, not with words, but with his hands." It frames the planting gesture as revelation, but the verb itself is swappable ("revealed," "enacted"). The action it describes (planting) is central to closure, but "uncloak" as a method is not uniquely integral—the planting would carry the same weight under another framing. Late first appearance (final third) and moderate swappability cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is named and explained by the woman in the middle beat, then enacted by Elias at the window. Mechanics: planting what's needed where it isn't wanted. Present in setup (implied in search), middle (dialogue), and closure (planting). Causal role in final beat; the method shapes the act and the thematic repricing. Slightly generic—any planting method could serve, but the "guerrilla" framing charges the defiance implicit in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tea house in the overgrown courtyard is signaled early, provides spatial anchor for the exchange, and supplies the soil beneath the window that enables the planting. Present in setup (paragraph five onward), middle (conversation space), and closure (window soil). Causal role in two beats (meeting, planting); the setting's specific state (overgrown, hidden, rich soil) makes the final act possible. Irreplaceability is high—remove the tea house and the planting loses its charged context.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" appears in the opening (frost) and once more ("birds had long since flown south"). It sets seasonal mood but does not tighten decisions or tactics. No clock pressure; time is static backdrop. Present in setup and middle but absent from closure. Late-season setting adds thematic resonance (barrenness, waiting for spring) but lacks causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias seeks "the sacred" explicitly in paragraph thirteen and enacts it by planting seeds—finding persistence as sacred. Desire is dramatized in his choice to walk to the tea house and then to plant. Friction exists between grand expectation and small act, though the trade-off is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Present in setup (implicit in his cataloging), middle (stated), and closure (enacted). Causal role in final beat; cost is undeniable in the "tenuous" image.</comment>
