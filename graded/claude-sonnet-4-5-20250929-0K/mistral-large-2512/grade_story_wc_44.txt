<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand shadows is established, but her interior life relies on generic gestures ("fingers tightening," "breath fogged") and label-only emotional states. The final choice to "turn the key in the air" lacks the earned internal conflict or visible cost that would make it feel inevitable—she simply executes the guardian's instruction. No contradictory impulses act in scene; the progression reads more like puzzle-solving than character pressure. The "sealed awakening" backstory occupies significant space without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens through the key-mechanism-guardian sequence, and the mirrors-shattering moment offers a Decisive Change with shadows restored. However, the cost remains abstract: what does Liora forfeit or risk by closing the loop? The guardian's "Then close the loop" instruction arrives without prior setup of what that phrase means, creating a minor causality gap. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure lands on the page, but the felt or visible price—required for high-band entry—is not legible in a concrete sentence or image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating isle, nocturnal observatory, brass telescope, and spiral staircase are vivid and coherent. The key fits "perfectly" into the dais, a moment of micro-setting that enables the descent, satisfying one choice constraint. However, the mirror chamber and the noon sun's appearance at closure do not pressure tactics—they illustrate the resolution rather than shaping it. Sensory hierarchy is present (ozone, cold, flickering lantern) but remains decorative in peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and sustained. The descent and mirror-chamber discovery provide one meaningful tightening. Yet Liora's agency at closure is limited: the guardian tells her what to do, she complies, and the shadows return. No live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the loop closes mechanically rather than through a choice that trades competing goods. Escalation is present but the cost legibility required for 8.0+ is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The shadow-vanishing question and "relearn what they are" frame a coherent thematic inquiry. However, the final paragraph's direct statement—"The loop was closed"—moralizes rather than letting the image resonate. The mirrors reflecting "parts of her that had been lost to the light" edges toward on-the-nose symbolism. No non-literal answer emerges from concrete particulars; instead, the text asserts the theme. The "sealed awakening" and "spoons bent reality" worldbuilding remains ornamental, not thematically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and matches a scholarly observer: "latent energy," "warping space," "ozone and old metal." The guardian's voice—"wind through a cracked window"—carries some distinctness, though brief. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear in peak beats without undermining immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent (rune-scholar lens) but not deeply character-particular. No major voice leakage or mechanical template cadence, though the prose lacks a strong rhythmic signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffolding appears: "She exhaled, her fingers tightening" and similar gestural fillers recur without adding pressure. The phrase "wavering shadows on the walls" and "shifting like smoke" are stock figurative moves. The final beat—"The loop was closed"—is clean but declarative. No paraphrase loops or template runs touch the closure, so artifact penalties remain modest. Clarity and propulsion are adequate; the prose does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The floating isle, rune scholar, and clockwork key combine familiar fantasy tropes without transformation. The central image—shadows absorbed by light and reclaimed—is conceptually tidy but not surprising. The "spoons bent reality" detail is quirky yet ornamental; it does not inflect the plot or character arc. The guardian's "Then close the loop" instruction arrives as a late rule reveal rather than growing from prior particulars. The piece reads competent but safe, with no bold risk or non-obvious synthesis that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout and drives the search, but her choices are reactive: she descends when the key fits, turns the key when the guardian instructs. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, she does not make a key turn that narrows options with visible cost—she executes the puzzle's solution. Swappable with another curious scholar archetype. No irreplaceability or causal pressure that transforms the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (foundation discovery), handled in two distinct beats (examination in opening, insertion into dais at midpoint, turned "in the air" at closure), and causally active: it unlocks the descent and "bridges" the shadow restoration. The mechanics—"teeth forming a pattern she couldn't decipher"—matter on the page. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied. Specificity (clockwork, teeth pattern) gives it some irreplaceability, and the closure image directly involves it. Causal pressure is clear; cost connection is implied but not deeply felt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Mentioned in backstory ("sealed awakenings") and the guardian is "a prisoner, of the sealed awakening," but the concept does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It remains a label for what the guardian represents rather than a mechanic that alters Liora's choices. Setup and closure participation are weak; no middle development beat where the concept constrains action. Ornamental; could be replaced with "dormant guardian" or similar phrasing with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute appears once as a narrative tag: "her movements quietly deliberate" when examining the key. No on-page action where deliberateness constrains or enables a choice with cost. It does not recur or shape the descent, mirror encounter, or closure. Setup gate barely met; development and payoff gates missing. Label-only; swappable with "careful" or "thoughtful" without altering plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The guardian's instruction—"relearn"—and Liora's realization ("shadows didn't vanish—they were absorbed") frame the closure turn. Setup in journal ("relearn what they are"), development in her weeks of study, payoff in the mirror chamber. However, the "relearn" action is executed off-page (her study) and summarized rather than dramatized. The final beat is consequence, not active relearning. One causal beat (understanding enables the key turn) but not indispensable; a simpler "unlock" or "release" could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Signaled in backstory via journal puzzle, invoked by the guardian ("close the loop"), and executed at closure when the key turn "closes the loop" and shadows stretch "unbroken." Setup, development (puzzle-solving weeks), and payoff gates met. The mechanics—mirrors shattering, shadows rushing back—matter on the page. However, "closing loops" as a method is introduced late and remains somewhat abstract; the specificity of what constitutes "closing" is asserted rather than built through prior attempts. Causal role in one major beat (closure) but swappable with "complete the circuit" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Floating isle and nocturnal observatory are established early, provide the dais mechanism and spiral descent, and the observatory dome splits at closure to reveal the noon sun. Setup, development (descent enabled by observatory architecture), and payoff gates satisfied. The setting supplies the puzzle-lock and underground chamber, constraining Liora's path. The final image—dome opening, shadows unbroken—charges the resolution. Specificity (floating, nocturnal, highest peak) gives moderate irreplaceability. Causal pressure across two beats (dais unlock, closure reveal) and closure linkage push this into the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After spoons bent reality" is worldbuilding flavor mentioned in backstory (cutlery warping space, mirrors reflecting moments) but does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics. The "time after" does not function as a live timeframe constraint—no countdown, urgency, or temporal mechanic that alters Liora's choices. Setup gate barely met (mentioned early); development and payoff gates missing. Ornamental; the story's logic would hold unchanged in a generic post-cataclysm setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The question "where do shadows go at noon" is introduced in childhood memory, drives her years of study, prompts the key search, and is answered at closure when shadows no longer vanish. Setup, development (weeks puzzling, descent to find answer), and payoff gates satisfied. The motivation shapes her arc and the ending reweights it. However, the internal friction between wanting the answer and risking consequence is minimal—she faces no dramatized cost or competing desire that tests her commitment. Causal across multiple beats and closure-linked, but lacks the on-page struggle required for higher scores.</comment>
