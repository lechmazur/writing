<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nabu-sharru's frugality and devotion to knowledge are established early and shape his theft of the tile, but his internal contradictions remain mostly told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The dialogue with the twilight figure shows some values hierarchy, but the astronomer's shift from seeking understanding to accepting preservation feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; the "trembling finger" and bowed head are the primary physical markers in a story that otherwise operates at high philosophical register. The final choice—accepting the covenant—lands without a legible cost that forecloses another path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when); the timeframe "between regimes" is signaled and used to justify the astronomer's window of access. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens tilting Accumulative/Situational: the tile's glow, the figure's appearance, and the star-mirror build pressure through intensifying images rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the astronomer clutching clay while the mercenaries arrive crystallizes his success—knowledge preserved—against the collapsing regime, with cost implied (he may be captured, the tile is now "unremarkable"). The cost is felt but oblique; pointing to "hands clutching a single, unremarkable shard" as the proof moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The palace setting is vivid and specific: lapis lazuli tiles, cracked urns, myrrh, the throne room's oculus. The "between regimes" frame applies pressure by opening the space temporarily and making scavengers and mercenaries imminent threats. The tile as micro-object constrains the astronomer's actions (he must uncloak it, recite over it, place it in the figure's hand) and charges the final image when it becomes an "unremarkable shard." Sensory selection is strong—dim light, flickering surfaces, dusky air—and filtered through the astronomer's scholarly attention. The mercenaries' approach provides spatial urgency without overwhelming the quieter ritualistic core.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving knowledge across regime collapse—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained through the tile's use and the figure's test. One meaningful tightening occurs when the figure challenges "You seek to bind what cannot be bound" and Nabu-sharru must clarify his intent, narrowing from binding the heavens to sealing a covenant with the future. The star-mirror revelation deepens the stake by reframing success (scholars in an unborn age) rather than reversing it. Agency is present but passive: the astronomer's final "let it be sealed" is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost on the page. The mercenaries' arrival supplies external pressure but does not test the astronomer's commitment in a way that alters his tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as devotion, preservation across chaos—emerges organically from the astronomer's frugality, the tile's schematic power, and the "between regimes" liminal moment. The star-mirror image reweights the premise: the tile was never for binding gods but for safeguarding what matters when empires fall. The ending resists moralizing; the "unremarkable shard" is a resonant non-literal answer that honors specificity. "Your devotion is encrypted in your frugality" risks thematic echo but is spoken by the supernatural figure rather than narration, and it dramatizes the astronomer's values under scrutiny. The piece invites reflection on knowledge as inheritance without collapsing into platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and maintains appropriate distance for the astronomer's scholarly register. Diction is elevated—"empirically ironic," "dusky harmony," "encrypted devotion"—which fits the ancient-mystic frame but borders on over-wrought in peak beats ("liquid silver," "starlight veil"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the astronomer's lines pursue understanding and the figure's responses apply pressure, though both voices share a formal, nearly interchangeable register. Filter verbs ("understood," "followed its gaze") are present but not excessive. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's shift to omniscient observation ("they found only") slightly weakens focalization at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"cracked bronze gates," "stars' true names," "wind through reeds," "liquid silver"—creating texture but occasionally muddling propulsion in peak beats. The phrase "dusky harmony of forgotten rituals" and "encrypted devotion" are evocative but veer toward purple. Sentence openings vary well; paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative design. Minor paraphrase loop: "The tile was empirically ironic: a tool of divination that defied logic, its patterns rearranging" restates the same idea across two clauses. No major scaffold or loops, but the elevated register throughout flattens urgency in the throne-room sequence where clarity would serve escalation better. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "between regimes" frame and the scholar-mystic encounter offer a fresh angle on preservation-across-collapse, and the tile's shift from binding tool to preservation vessel is earned in hindsight. However, the core premise—wise figure tests seeker, grants boon—is familiar mystical-encounter territory, and the astronomer's passive acceptance limits bold risk. The star-mirror and "unremarkable shard" images are specific and resonant, lifting the piece above template. Emotional specificity is present in the astronomer's measured devotion, though the dialogue's formal register and the figure's archetypal inscrutability reduce memorability. The ending's quiet transformation is thoughtful but does not radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Nabu-sharru is present throughout and his frugality/devotion frame the theft and the covenant. His key choice—accepting the figure's redefinition of the covenant—occurs near the end ("Then let it be sealed") and shapes closure by enabling the tile's transformation and his survival as knowledge-bearer. However, his agency is largely reactive; the figure drives the revelations. Early signal is strong (paragraph one). Two beats: theft/uncloaking and the covenant dialogue. Closure linkage is solid (his final posture and the shard). Swappability is moderate; another scholar-mystic could perform the role with adjustments. Cost is implied (risk of capture) but not visibly paid on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tile is introduced in paragraph five, handled in paragraph nine (uncloaked, traced, recited over), and placed in the figure's palm in paragraph thirteen, then dissolves and reappears as a shard in the final beat—four distinct touches across setup, middle use, transformation, and closure. It enables the astronomer's goal (proof of celestial patterns) and is reweighted at the end (preservation tool, not binding tool). Causal pressure is strong: without the tile, no covenant. Specificity is high (magic square, shifting numbers, glowing grooves). The shard's "unremarkable" state charges the final image with irony. Cost is tied to its transformation (he loses the original artifact but gains its purpose).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" appears twice as a phrase: paragraph four ("the heavens' encrypted devotion") and paragraph fourteen ("Your devotion is encrypted in your frugality"). It operates more as thematic echo than stake-shaping force. The concept colors the astronomer's motivation—his frugality as cipher for commitment—but does not constrain tactics or create a dilemma on the page. The figure's line makes it explicit, which reduces subtlety. Present in closure dialogue but as commentary rather than active pressure. Swappable with "hidden" or "encoded" dedication. Closure participation is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is applied once to the tile in paragraph five: "a tool of divination that defied logic." The label describes the tile's paradox but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It's a descriptive flourish rather than a functional trait. No beat involvement; the astronomer's choices (theft, recitation, acceptance) proceed without this attribute shaping tactics. Introduced mid-story. Swappable with "paradoxical" or "contradictory." Does not appear in or shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Uncloak" occurs in paragraph nine: "He uncloaked the tile in the throne room's dim light." This action initiates the ritual sequence—glowing numbers, incantation, the figure's appearance—and is the pivotal turn from preparation to engagement. Without uncloaking, the covenant sequence does not begin. The action itself is brief and functional; the causal weight rests on what it triggers. Early middle placement supports escalation. Not swappable (revealing the tile is specific and necessary). Closure linkage is indirect; the tile's final state (shard) traces back to this moment. One strong beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" is referenced in paragraph four: "If the tile's schematic representations held the key to the stars' true names." The tile's glowing map (paragraph sixteen) visualizes this method, showing the future sky. The method enables the astronomer's proof-seeking goal but does not shape his attempts or constrain tactics; the figure performs the transformation, and the astronomer is passive observer. Present in setup (paragraph four) and payoff (star-mirror), missing active middle development. Swappable with "symbolic patterns" or "encoded charts." Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace is established in paragraph one and sustained: cracked gates, lapis tiles, myrrh, throne room, oculus. The "between regimes" state (paragraph three) opens access and supplies urgency (scavengers, mercenaries). The throne room's emptiness and dim light enable the ritual's privacy, and the oculus frames the star's descent. Mercenaries' approach pressures the timeline. Specificity is strong (Ishtar Palace, cedar oil, courtyard echoes). The setting constrains choice (he must act now, in this unguarded window) and charges the final image (throne room as future scholars' hall). Two-plus beats across entry, ritual, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is signaled in paragraph three and repeated in paragraph twelve ("between regimes, when the world is neither one thing nor the other"). It opens the narrative window, justifies the palace's accessibility, and applies external pressure (mercenaries are coming). The timeframe tightens the astronomer's choices—he must act in this liminal interval—but elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat. The mercenaries' arrival at the end closes the window, adding urgency to the final image. Two beats: setup framing and dialogue emphasis. Causal pressure is moderate; the window enables but does not constrain tactics within the ritual. Cost is implied (he may be caught) but not paid on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The covenant motivation is introduced in paragraph four ("seal a covenant that would outlast the coming chaos"), voiced in dialogue (paragraph twelve: "to seal a covenant that does not demand blood, only truth"), and realized in the ending (paragraph eighteen: "Then let it be sealed"). The desire drives the theft, the ritual, and the acceptance of the figure's terms. Friction appears when the figure redefines the covenant (not with the unknown, but with the future), forcing the astronomer to adapt. Cost is acceptance of redefinition and risk of capture. Three beats: setup, challenge, resolution. Causal pressure is solid; the motivation shapes all major choices. Swappability is low (covenant-seeking is specific to this character and frame).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears once in paragraph three: "its halls hummed with the dusky harmony of forgotten rituals." Tone throughout is hushed, formal, and mystic—dim light, whispered steps, murmured dialogue—consistent with this phrase. The tone supports the liminal timeframe and sacred atmosphere, but does not modulate with pressure; peak beats (tile glowing, figure's challenge, mercenaries' arrival) maintain the same elevated register rather than tightening or fragmenting. The final image sustains the quiet, almost elegiac mood. Coherent but static. Charges theme more than closure action. Swappable with "twilight stillness" or similar. Present in setup, absent from middle beats, implicit in ending.</comment>
