<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear—bound by curse, driven by guilt over past failures—and her final choice to guide via nuts rather than direct contact shows agency with visible cost (she must trust the system and watch from distance). Interiority is concrete ("guilt sat in her chest like a stone") and her micro-choices (pocketing the nut without thought, scattering them quickly) reveal character under pressure. Internal conflict between her lack of love for the lost and the curse's demand for balance creates contradictory impulses that drive the scene. The man's desperation and shift to understanding when he sees the nut adds secondary pressure, though his presence is brief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (orchard, cliff, Mira kneeling) and the causal chain is clean: curse binds her → she finds blueprint → realizes nut marks a path → scatters nuts → man follows them to escape. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira secures one more night's balance, the curse holds, and she returns to tending the orchard with visible cost (she remains bound, the fruit will never ripen). The inferred lens is Causal with situational undertones; the tightening occurs when the man appears and Mira must execute her plan under immediate pressure. One ellipsis (how she moved from blueprint discovery to nut-scattering) is brief and motivated by urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cliffside orchard, mechanical birds, and labyrinth create a coherent high-stakes arena; spatial choreography is clear (Mira at maze edge, man stumbling into view, birds circling above). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "damp soil," "brass wings glinting," "frost creeping over stones" all reflect urgency and the ticking clock. The nuts as micro-setting objects constrain Mira's choice (she must place them where birds won't notice) and charge the final image (she turns back to the heavy-fruited trees). The mechanical birds function as environmental pressure that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save a traveler before frost or another life is lost—is signaled early and tightens when the man appears and birds dive. Mira's agency (scattering nuts, pointing rather than leading) drives the escalation and the man's survival demonstrates visible cost: she risks exposure, works quickly under time pressure, and must trust her indirect method. The mechanical birds provide external opposition that raises urgency. The resolution is earned by Mira's realization and action (assembling the nut-trail) with a trade-off: the curse holds, but she remains bound to the orchard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between direct intervention and subtle guidance, isolation and responsibility, curse and choice. The final image—Mira turning back to the trees with fruit that will never be eaten—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she is bound to stewardship without harvest, balance without freedom. Subtext operates in her gesture (pointing rather than leading) and the nut markings that make the traveler think discovery is his own. No overt moralizing; the piece resists tidy resolution by leaving Mira still cursed, still guilty, still tending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays tight to Mira's perception; psychic distance modulates effectively (close during the man's arrival, slightly withdrawn in the final image). Voice carries distinct texture: "Her breath a cloud in the cold air," "rough as bark," "heavy and unyielding" ground the narration in Mira's embodied experience. The man's single line of dialogue ("Help me") and Mira's response ("Follow the nuts") are spare, goal-driven, and carry subtext—she refuses rescue, offers only a clue. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices practical details (shears, blueprint measurements, bird patrols) filtered through her curse-bound role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere, but some phrasing edges toward the decorative: "clung to the cliff's edge like a beggar's grip" and "swallowed by the earth or the birds' hunger" are vivid yet slightly overwritten for the urgency. Information density is high in action beats (nut-scattering, man's escape) but the opening two paragraphs carry more setup than pressure. No loops or scaffolding; grammar and sequence are clean. The final line ("branches heavy with fruit that would never be eaten") recharges the opening image effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and breadcrumb nuts as micro-maps offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of the "guide lost travelers" trope through indirect method (impressions without touching) and the tension between Mira's reluctance and the curse's demand add fresh inflection. The blueprint-as-labyrinth-key and the nut markings as miniature maps show inventive specificity. However, the cursed-caretaker and mechanical-guardian elements trend familiar; the piece elevates them through grounded choices (Mira's guilt, the frost deadline) rather than radical reimagining.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as reluctant caretaker shapes every beat: her binding to the orchard motivates the search for a solution, her past failures generate urgency, and her final choice (scattering nuts, pointing) directly drives the traveler's escape. Present in opening, middle realization, and closure. Specific cost: she remains bound, the guilt persists, and she must return to fruitless tending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nut appears in three distinct beats: pocketed absentmindedly, recognized as a miniature map, scattered as breadcrumb trail, and pointed out to the man. Its warm shell and markings are specific and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the solution. It enables Mira's indirect-guidance tactic and charges the closure (man's understanding, Mira's return to the trees).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blueprint discovered in the shed provides the causal link: Mira traces its offhandedly exact measurements and realizes the nut markings match. It shapes her tactic (scattering a map-trail) and appears in setup and middle development. However, the blueprint itself does not return at closure; the nuts carry forward its function, making the blueprint somewhat replaceable once decoded.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" appears twice: in the blueprint description ("offhandedly exact measurements") and the nut markings ("the same offhandedly exact lines"). The trait signals precision that seems casual but proves deliberate, enabling Mira's recognition that the nuts are maps. It constrains her method (she must read the markings accurately) and lends specificity, but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assembling the pieces (blueprint + nuts = breadcrumb trail) is the story's central action: Mira's realization midpoint drives the scattering sequence, and the man's survival depends on following the assembled path. Present in setup (blueprint discovery), middle (nut-scattering under deadline), and closure (man escapes, curse holds). Removing "assemble" would require a different mechanism for guidance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method—leaving impressions without touching—is signaled early ("hints so subtle they'd think the path was their own discovery"), executed in the nut-scattering beat (pressing into earth where birds won't notice), and validated at closure (man traces the lines, turns toward the next one). Its mechanics matter: Mira cannot lead directly, so she stages discovery. Specific and indispensable to her tactic and the theme of indirect stewardship.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds supplies continuous pressure: Mira must move between patrols, scatter nuts where birds won't see, and work before frost. The birds' beaks and glass eyes, the maze's edges, and the frost timeline all constrain her tactics. Setting is active in setup (patrol rhythms), middle (nut placement under bird threat), and closure (birds dive, man navigates). Removing it would eliminate the urgency and danger.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frost deadline is signaled early ("before the night frost formed"), tracked midpoint ("first tendrils of frost creeping"), and reaches closure ("The frost settled over the orchard"). It tightens Mira's scattering sequence (she works quickly, wind tugging sleeves) and gives the man's arrival urgency. The clock is live and alters moves, though exact elapsed time is not granular.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to guide lost travelers—is dramatized through her guilt over past failures, her lack of love for the lost (most are fools), and the curse's demand for balance. The friction between reluctance and obligation drives her choices: she doesn't move to help the man directly but points to the nut, trusting the system. The cost (she remains bound, the curse holds) is visible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone blends beauty (gnarled roots, silvered leaves, brass wings glinting) with harshness (curse, mechanical beaks that snap bone, guilt like a stone). The diction is elevated yet grounded ("rough as bark," "swallowed whole"). Tone modulates with pressure: lyric in the orchard description, urgent during the man's arrival, quiet and resigned at closure. "Graceless beauty" coheres across beats and charges the final image of heavy, uneaten fruit.</comment>
