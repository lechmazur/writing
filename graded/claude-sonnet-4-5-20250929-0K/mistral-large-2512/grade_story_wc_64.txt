<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His actions—humming, organizing, planting roses—remain blithe and consistent without internal friction or cost. The ending gesture (planting roses around Margaret's niche) reads as continuation rather than transformation, and no visible path is foreclosed. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("velveteen gloom," "quiet persistence of roots") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are delayed: the silo's function and Elias's role emerge gradually, but "who, where, when" coalesce past ~120 words without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern. The chess-clock phrase is seeded but never reweights options on the page; it remains metaphorical. The ending offers a gesture (planting roses, listening to echoes) but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing—Elias's stance and options read identical before and after the tapestry discovery. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece oscillates between accumulative texture (threads, names, objects) and a causal investigation that resolves into contemplation rather than closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly anchored through sensory detail ("damp earth and old metal," "velveteen gloom," "cold light pooling in hollows"). Setting supplies props—niches, wall carvings, riverbank—that Elias moves through, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; Elias's path through the silo and to the river is exploratory rather than pressured by access or proximity. The silo functions as atmospheric backdrop more than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering Margaret's story—is signaled early but remains investigative rather than escalatory. Elias encounters blue, red, and gold threads in sequence, each leading to a new artifact, but no reversal narrows his options or imposes cost. The ending beat ("Tomorrow, he would plant roses... Tonight, he would listen") is a continuation of his gardener's care, not a tightening or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed, and the protagonist's agency does not drive a meaningful turn under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—the persistence of intentions beyond death, echoes waiting to be heard—is coherent and emerges from objects and Elias's reflections. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting: "let them shape his own intentions" is a declaration rather than a dramatized shift in stance. The tapestry's code resolves into a love story (M.V. + J.H., the note, the locket) but this discovery does not reconfigure Elias's prior understanding with visible cost. Subtext is thin; most meaning is stated directly in Elias's interior monologue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with clean focalization on Elias. Voice carries a distinct textural register ("velveteen gloom," "lapped at the shore like a cat at a saucer of milk") that sustains tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("blithe care of a gardener who saw beauty in the quiet persistence of roots") that feel more authorial than character-grounded. Perceptual signature is consistent but generic—Elias notices names, objects, threads—without idiosyncratic bias that reveals his particular way of seeing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean, but several patterns recur: "The X threads [verb]" template across three consecutive paragraphs (blue, red, gold) creates mechanical cadence. Figurative language appears frequently ("velveteen gloom," "pooling in hollows," "cat at a saucer of milk") without cumulative pressure, trending decorative. The chess-clock phrase and "uncharted echoes" are seeded but not paid off in the closure beat—they remain thematic labels rather than images that constrain or charge the final moment. Information density is moderate; some sentences (e.g., "He hummed as he worked...") add atmosphere but do not advance situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a gardener decoding a tapestry to uncover a dead woman's story—synthesizes mystery and memorial in a specific setting. However, the core structure (clue → artifact → revelation) follows familiar investigative beats without a fresh inflection or non-obvious turn. The ending (planting roses, listening to echoes) resolves into contemplative stasis rather than a reweighting earned by prior particulars. Emotional territory (love and separation, waiting and loss) is treated gently but without complexity or ambiguity that would invite counter-readings.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role as gardener frames the investigation, but his choices do not create key turns. He follows the threads in sequence without encountering obstacles or making trade-offs. His "blithe care" is consistent from opening to close; no decision alters his tactics or stance. The character is functional but replaceable—any curious caretaker could perform the same actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sovereign case is found early (between headstones), opened to reveal the sovereign and tapestry, and returned to at the end when Elias tucks items back inside. It appears in three beats (discovery, examination, closure gesture) and serves as container for the puzzle. However, its antique brass and velvet qualities are described but do not constrain or enable a choice—the case could be any container without changing the investigation. Closure participation is passive (a repository), not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is named in Elias's reflection ("What if they lingered, uncharted echoes waiting to be heard?") and repeated in the final line ("listen to the uncharted echoes"). It frames the thematic question but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—Elias's investigation proceeds through concrete clues (threads, names, objects) rather than by engaging with echoes as a method or pressure. The concept remains metaphorical, not operational.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears once in the opening ("tenderly organized rows of names") to describe Elias's care for the silo's inscriptions. The trait is shown through this early detail and implied in his patient untangling of the tapestry, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The attribute colors Elias's manner but remains label-level; removing "tenderly" would not alter his choices or the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Untangle" appears twice: Elias "set about untangling [the tapestry] with the same patience he used to coax roses" and later "By decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border, he began to see the story." The action is central to the investigation and spans the middle third, but the untangling itself is summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. The mechanics (how he reads the code) are elided, and the action could be replaced with "deciphering" or "reading" without structural loss. It shapes one key turn (understanding the threads' meaning) but does not drive escalation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method ("by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border") is signaled early when the tapestry is discovered with "threads...knotted in patterns that begged to be read." Elias decodes blue, red, and gold threads across three beats, and each thread type points to a different artifact or name. The method is functional and present in the middle investigation, but its mechanics (how knots encode meaning) are not shown on the page—the decoding happens off-stage between paragraphs. Setup and development are clear; closure linkage is weaker (the tapestry is tucked away rather than reweighted).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (rusted curves, damp earth, cold floor) and returns in multiple beats (niches, wall carvings, smooth corner). The setting provides spatial structure for Elias's investigation and the river excursion adds a second location. However, the silo does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Elias moves freely through it without obstacles, and no environmental constraint alters his tactics. The silo functions as atmospheric container rather than active setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" is seeded in Elias's memory of an old man's words and appears again as a date scratched on the silo wall ("the day the chess clock ran down"). The timeframe is metaphorical and retrospective (the story Margaret and J.H. lived) rather than a live constraint on Elias's present investigation. No clock tightens his decisions or tactics; the phrase functions as thematic motif, not temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to discover the shape of intentions") is stated explicitly in the fourth paragraph and drives his investigation of the tapestry and artifacts. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs—he pursues the puzzle without friction, and the ending does not show a trade-off or foreclosed path tied to this motivation. The motivation is told and functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is established in the opening ("a velveteen gloom that clung to everything like a second skin") and sustained through descriptions of the silo's interior, the cold starlight, and the quiet investigation. Tone is coherent and modulates slightly—contemplative in the silo, more expectant at the river, muted again at the ending. The tone charges the final image ("Tonight, he would listen to the uncharted echoes") by reinforcing the atmosphere of stillness and persistence. However, the tone does not shift decisively with pressure; it remains steady rather than dynamic.</comment>
