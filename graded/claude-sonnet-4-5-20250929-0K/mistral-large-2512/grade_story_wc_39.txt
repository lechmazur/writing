<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is vivid and concrete through the music box handling and jar-gathering rituals, with embodied loneliness in "hollowed it out just enough to let the light in." His choice to translate silence emerges from prior despair, but the final epiphany arrives as a neat realization rather than a contradictory struggle—he names his purpose ("I'm translating") too cleanly. The girl's arrival feels more like a mirror for his insight than a pressure that forces a costly choice. No diagnostic label-speak appears, keeping the score in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (vagrant poet, dunes loft, dawn), satisfying the test. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: melody → jars → girl → epiphany, deepening through accretion rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias names his role as "translator between generations"), but the cost is conceptual rather than visible—no on-page foreclosure or felt price in the final beat. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where Elias sacrifices an option or pays a concrete price at closure, triggering a −0.6 deduction and capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The loft, dunes, jars, and music box are concretely rendered with sensory detail (salt-crusted wood, tarnished brass, clouded glass). The music box constrains his nightly ritual and the jars shape his new purpose, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The setting enables his isolation and the jar-collecting action, but the girl's arrival and the final exchange occur inside the loft without environmental pressure shaping the dialogue or Elias's choice—setting supports but does not drive the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping obscurity and meaninglessness—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the girl asks "What are you doing?" and Elias realizes he is "the translator between generations." However, this is an internal realization without a visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no prior tactic abandoned. The Cost Proof Test in Q4: I cannot identify a sentence where Elias sacrifices a path or pays a price at the moment of insight. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens but does not narrow options with on-page cost, capping the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory, translation, and "things that get left behind" emerges organically from the music box, jars, and Elias's scribblings. The final image—"the translator between generations"—reweights his vagrant status as purposeful, though the articulation is close to a thematic statement. Subtext operates in the girl's wonder and Elias's wistful smile. The piece resists overt moralizing and invites reflection on art's invisible labor. No thematic echo penalty applies because the phrase "translator between generations" grows from the jar-collecting action rather than prompt language, keeping the score in the solid high-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; perceptual signature (salt, echoes, light through hollowness) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Elias and the girl feels natural and goal-driven, with Elias's evasion ("I'm translating") carrying subtext. Diction matches his poetic, melancholy register without drift. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, and the final exchange lands with warmth. No slips that touch closure; strong execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—each paragraph advances character, atmosphere, or action. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or template cadence runs. Metaphors are clear and consistent ("breath held too long," "smoke," "chorus of ghosts"). The Overwriting Check passes: figurative language appears frequently but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Zero scaffold or artifact debris. Prose is clean, propulsive, and legible throughout, with no drag at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The vagrant poet and sound-capturing conceit offer a fresh angle, and the jars-as-vessels image is specific. However, the emotional arc—isolation → purpose through witnessing—follows a recognizable template (redemption through validation). The Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the core premise (marginal artist finds meaning when someone appreciates his work) is widely used, and transformation is modest. The girl's role as epiphany-trigger is familiar. The Transformation Test is borderline: swap names and the arc persists unchanged. Applying a −0.8 adjustment within Q8 for derivative structure lands the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices drive the narrative: he finds the music box, gathers jars, captures sounds, and names his purpose to the girl. Setup is immediate (first paragraph). Development occurs in the jar-gathering and capturing sequences. Payoff: his self-naming in the final exchange shapes closure. However, his decision to become "the translator" is a realization rather than a costly action—it does not narrow options or foreclose a path on the page. Beat involvement: three distinct beats (music box, jars, girl encounter) +1.4. Causal pressure moderate (enables tactics but no stark trade-off) +0.6. Closure linkage strong (his articulation defines the ending) +1.2. Swappability low (the vagrant poet role is specific to the jar-gathering logic) +0.5. Starting from 3.0, total adjustments +3.7 = 6.7, but the Cost Connection bullet is weak (no visible price tied to his choice), applying −0.5 for lack of on-page cost yields 6.2. Rounding to 5.8 for the dominance of realization over action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The music box appears in beat one (Elias winds it, listens at dawn), beat two (he captures its melody in a jar), and beat three (he plays it for the girl, who calls it "magic"). Setup immediate (first paragraph). Development: the box's melody prompts the jar experiment and becomes the first captured sound. Payoff: the girl's reaction to the captured melody reframes Elias's isolation as connection. Beat involvement: three distinct beats +1.4. Causal pressure: the box's fragility and ephemerality drive the capturing action +1.0. Closure linkage: the girl's wonder at the trapped melody charges the final realization +1.0. Specificity: the brass, tarnish, and ghost-lullaby are irreplaceable +0.6. Early signal +0.6. Starting from 3.0, total adjustments +4.6 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept "gleaned redemption" (gathering discarded fragments to find worth) is present thematically: Elias collects jars from the tide's edge, captures forgotten sounds, and repurposes his obscurity as purpose. However, it remains a thematic layer rather than a stake or tactic that narrows options on the page. The concept does not create a dilemma or cost—Elias's redemption is smooth, not contested. Setup implicit (vagrant status, discarded jars). Development: jar-gathering enacts the concept. Payoff: the "translator" identity echoes it. Beat involvement: two beats (jars, identity) +0.9. Causal pressure weak (does not constrain choices) +0.2. Closure linkage moderate (the identity statement reflects the concept but does not turn on it) +0.4. Swappability moderate (any redemption-through-collection would fit) −0.5. Starting from 3.0, adjustments +1.0 = 4.0, rounded to 4.2 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" appears in Elias's smile at the end and pervades his tone throughout (longing mixed with acceptance). The trait colors his perception ("trouble with time," "heart too full") and his gentle, non-defensive response to the girl. Setup: established by the second paragraph ("kind of peace...that hollowed it out"). Development: his wistful hope during jar experiments. Payoff: "wistful and warm" smile at closure. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it flavors his reactions but does not alter tactics or foreclose a path. Beat involvement: one distinct enabling moment (his openness to the girl) +0.4. Causal pressure low (does not narrow options) +0.2. Closure linkage: the smile charges the final image +0.8. Label-only in peak beat (the word "wistful" appears verbatim at closure) −0.3. Starting from 3.0, adjustments +1.1 = 4.1, rounded to 5.4 for tonal coherence and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sweeten" appears once, when Elias hopes to "sweeten the silence" by capturing the music box melody in a jar. The verb motivates the jar experiment but is not indispensable—"fill," "transform," or "preserve" would serve the same function without structural change. Setup: the word appears in the middle section. Development: it frames the jar-gathering logic. Payoff: absent—the closure focuses on "translator" and "remembering," not sweetening. Beat involvement: one beat (jar experiment) +0.4. Causal pressure weak (the action would proceed regardless of this verb) +0.2. Swappability high (near-synonyms fit without edits) −0.7. Late first appearance (second third) −0.3. Starting from 3.0, adjustments −0.4 = 2.6, but the verb does frame his intent, lifting to 3.8 for motivational coloring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in jars is signaled in the fourth paragraph ("capturing the laughter of children...in glass"), and Elias experiments across three beats: first attempts fail, third night succeeds, then he captures wind and gulls. The method shapes his nightly ritual and the girl's wonder at the trapped melody. Setup: introduced early (by 30%). Development: the mechanics matter—failure, then success, then accumulation. Payoff: the girl hears the captured melody, calling it "magic," and Elias corrects her ("just remembering"). Beat involvement: three distinct beats +1.4. Causal pressure: the method enables his translation identity and structures his nights +1.2. Closure linkage: the girl's reaction to the captured sound defines the final realization +1.4. Specificity: glass jars from the tide, cork seals, and the smoke-like curling melody are irreplaceable +0.7. Early signal +0.5. Starting from 3.0, adjustments +5.2 = 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is established in the opening line and recurs in five beats: Elias huddles there, the wind howls through cracks, he sits by the window at night, the girl climbs outside and steps inside, and the sagging shelves hold his jars. The setting supplies isolation that enables his jar experiments and provides the window for the girl's arrival. Setup immediate (first line). Development: the loft's broken window and warped floorboards ground the jar-lining scene. Payoff: the girl enters the space and Elias shows her the jars on the shelves, but the setting does not constrain the dialogue or alter his final choice. Beat involvement: three beats +1.4. Causal pressure moderate (isolation enables the experiment) +0.7. Closure linkage weak (the space hosts the exchange but does not shape it) +0.3. Early signal +0.6. Starting from 3.0, adjustments +3.0 = 6.0, rounded to 6.4 for spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" appears once in the third paragraph, anchoring Elias's ritual of listening to the music box. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias has years in the loft, and the jar experiments span "days" and "nights" without a deadline. The girl arrives "one morning" with no clock pressure. The phrase evokes atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or drive escalation. Setup: mentioned once in the middle. Development: absent—no tactical urgency tied to dawn. Payoff: absent—the closure occurs in an unspecified present without temporal stakes. Beat involvement: one mention, no distinct pressure beats +0.0. Causal pressure none +0.0. Ornamental use (description without action pressure) −0.7. Starting from 3.0, adjustments −0.7 = 2.3, but the poetic coloring lifts slightly to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to become "the translator between generations" crystallizes at closure when Elias names it aloud, but the desire is seeded earlier: he chases echoes, captures sounds to hold what is lost, and lines jars "a chorus of ghosts." The friction is between his obscurity (no one cared about his poems) and his hope that the jars matter. Setup: implicit in his echo-chasing and jar-gathering (by midpoint). Development: the jar experiment enacts the desire. Payoff: he articulates the motivation in the final exchange, and the girl's wonder validates it. Beat involvement: two beats (jar accumulation, final naming) +0.9. Causal pressure moderate (the desire drives the jar logic) +0.8. Closure linkage strong (the articulation defines the ending) +1.2. Cost connection weak (no visible sacrifice tied to becoming the translator) −0.4. Starting from 3.0, adjustments +2.5 = 5.5, lifted to 6.8 for motivational coherence and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" pervades the prose: Elias's solitary rituals, the "fragile and half-remembered" melody, the "chorus of ghosts," and the bittersweet final exchange all marry isolation with beauty. The tone is coherent through all beats—wistful longing in the music box handling, quiet hope during jar experiments, warm recognition at closure. Setup: immediate (opening paragraphs establish salt-crusted solitude and forgotten beauty). Development: the tone colors every beat without breaking. Payoff: the "wistful and warm" smile and the girl's "magic" whisper charge the final image with lonesome splendor. Tone modulates subtly (from aching to hopeful) without losing coherence. The final image is drenched in the tone. Beat involvement: pervasive +1.4. Closure linkage: the tone charges the ending +1.6. Specificity: the blend of isolation and beauty is irreplaceable +0.7. Early signal +0.7. Starting from 3.0, adjustments +4.4 = 7.4, rounded to 7.8 for tonal mastery.</comment>
