<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias functions as a single POV with consistent interiority—"midnight pattern seeker" colors his perception of bark as Braille, clouds as patterns. His motivation ("preserve trust under pressure") drives the climb with embodied cost (buckle biting, shallow gasps), and the final pull upward after the snap earns the endurance. However, the backstory blocks (parachute fall, years of observation) occupy ~25% without clearly tilting a present micro-choice until the harness knot, flattening urgency in the opening third; the "watcher's burden" label recurs without dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elias, arbor, post-static night). Drive lens reads Situational: coherent pressure (stranded, branch groaning, snap) forces stance crystallization (keep climbing). Closure is Earned Stasis—he pulls himself back and continues—with visible cost (buckle bite, gasps, heavier burden). The snap at 85% provides one meaningful tightening. Deductions: the parachute-fall backstory arrives late (paragraph 5) and resolves the "how did he get here" question it did not establish early, creating mild causality friction (−0.3); the final image ("kept climbing") lacks a charged reconfiguration that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, reading more as continuation than decisive change or resonant repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arbor is concretely rendered—blackened branches, leaves whispering, grooves in bark, vine testing—and constrains choice (harness knotting, branch groaning, snap forcing the catch). The buckle as micro-setting object matters: threaded through vine teeth, it anchors him at the snap. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (wind rattling, branch groaning at peak). The city below functions as distant stake marker but does not pressure present moves. Spatial choreography is clean across the climb. No occupational depth is required here; the arbor's physics govern tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: survival and proving patterns matter. Pressure accumulates (wind picks up, branch groans, snap) and one reversal (the fall and catch) tests the makeshift harness, narrowing options with visible cost (buckle biting, gasps). Agency is present—he knots the vine, adjusts grip, pulls back—but the cost is physical sensation rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative path. The city's "promise" remains abstract; no secondary pressure from below alters his tactics. The snap delivers urgency, but the resolution (pull up, keep climbing) extends the situation without decisive closure of the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of observation versus action, trust rebuilt through bodily effort, emerges from particulars (fingers tracing bark, buckle as talisman, patterns studied versus puzzle solved). The parachute-fall backstory provides thematic setup ("trust was the first casualty") but arrives mid-story without on-page dramatization of the original failure. "Watcher's burden" recurs as a phrase rather than accumulating pressure through images. The ending offers a concrete action (reaching, pulling) but no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer—he simply continues the climb, leaving the thematic question ("are the patterns real?") unresolved on the page. No overt moralizing, but the final gesture lacks charged ambiguity or repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable psychic distance, and distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices veins as Braille, clouds as slow-motion storm, lights as dying stars—pattern-seeking lens remains consistent. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in "Trust had been the first casualty" fits voice. Filter verbs ("wondered," "had to move") are sparse and voice-motivated. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiom (midnight pattern seeker, attentively inventive) without register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short fragments at the snap: "It held"). The "soundless echo" tone recurs but feels more decorative than integrated into rhythm or perception under stress. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is controlled (arbor as cathedral, clouds churned, buckle glinted). Information density is high in action beats (knot, tug, thread, clasp). Clarity is strong; no pronoun drift or time confusion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "climbed here for the silence" / "nocturnal arbor" restate refuge without added pressure; "adjusted it absently" / "adjusted his grip" recycle gesture stems. Template cadence in paragraph 2 ("his fingers," "each ridge," "Elias had climbed") and paragraph 13 ("Elias tightened," "He had to move," "He began to climb") stack similar syntactic openings across three+ lines without pattern-teaching. Stock metaphor "dying stars" and "second spine" lack specificity. Deductions total ~−0.8 for loops and template stems, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stranded-climber premise is familiar; the parachute buckle as talisman and makeshift anchor offers a specific, grounded detail that personalizes the scenario. "Midnight pattern seeker" and "watcher's burden" provide fresh idiom, but the emotional arc (passive observer forced to act) follows a recognizable template without bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis. The city-below contrast (years observing, never part of it) sets up thematic potential but does not transform through the climb; the ending reaffirms his determination without fresh inflection or hindsight inevitability. The arbor and buckle are particular, but the story could function with different survival stakes and setting without fundamental change. No derivative clichés, but no bold originality either.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias ("midnight pattern seeker") appears early, traces bark veins (observation), knots the vine (decision), and pulls himself back after the snap (decision altering tactics). Present in setup, middle, and closure. However, the "pattern seeker" label does not constrain his choices on the page—any stranded climber would knot a vine and test a branch. The trait colors perception but does not create a visible trade-off or cost tied to his specific way of seeing. Two beats (harness, recovery) with causal involvement, but the character's unique trait is more descriptive than mechanically essential. Cap at ~6.0 for two gates plus beat involvement; deduct ~−0.8 for swappability and ~−0.4 for label-only use of the core trait in key beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Parachute buckle introduced paragraph 5 (late; −0.3), threaded through vine in paragraph 15 (middle beat), catches him at the snap (closure participation). Three touches across distinct beats with causal pressure: it anchors the harness and prevents the fall. Specificity is moderate—any metal clasp could serve the same function, but the parachute origin ties to backstory. Visible cost at closure (biting into his side). Present in all three gates; causal involvement and closure linkage elevate. Deductions for late arrival and moderate swappability keep it mid-band; no unique property makes this buckle irreplaceable over a generic fastener.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The watcher's burden" appears as a phrase (paragraphs 9, 24) and thematic echo but does not shape on-page tactics or alter options. Elias's years of observation provide backstory context, but the climb itself does not dramatize a choice between watching and acting with visible cost—he simply acts. The phrase recurs without mechanical pressure; removing it would not break story logic. Ornamental thematic claim without causal work. Setup present (phrase introduced early), no middle constraint, no closure participation beyond cameo mention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is claimed (paragraph 16), then demonstrated: he tests the vine, knots it, threads the buckle. One middle beat with visible action tied to the trait. However, the actions (testing, knotting) are universal survival moves, not uniquely enabled by attentive invention—any climber would do the same. The trait is more label than constraint; no trade-off or cost specific to this attribute. Setup (claimed), development (one beat), no distinct closure tie. Functional but replaceable; cap ~6.0 for two gates, deduct ~−0.4 for label-only and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Revise" appears explicitly ("had to revise everything," paragraph 12; "revising his plan," paragraph 22) and implicitly (adjusts harness, adapts to arbor's whims). Present in setup, middle (plan revision during climb), and closure (adapts after snap). However, the revisions are reactive adjustments any climber would make; the action does not create a major turn or redefine options—he continues the same goal (descend) with minor tactical tweaks. Removing "revise" and substituting "adapt" would not break story logic. Two gates plus beat involvement, but no unique causal pressure or cost tied to revision itself. Mid-band for presence across beats, capped by swappability and lack of a decisive turn traced to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Remembering through muscle memory" appears once (paragraph 7: "hands moving with the precision of muscle memory, remembering the way he'd yanked the cord"). Backstory-only; no on-page choice or tactic shaped by this method in the present climb. The harness-knotting could have invoked muscle memory but does not. Setup absent (not present by end of first third in a functional way), no middle beat, no closure tie. Ornamental mention; removing it changes no outcome. Cap at ~3.4 for missing development gate; slight credit for one mention prevents floor score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor above the clouds anchors the entire story: blackened branches, groaning limbs, vine, leaves rattling. Setup immediate, constrains every choice (climb, knot, test branch), and participates in closure (branch snaps, he pulls back onto "the arbor's spine"). Environment supplies the resource (vine) and hazard (snap) that drive the ending. Specificity high—removing the arbor breaks all story logic. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability. Strong integration across all gates with visible cost tied to setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" appears once (paragraph 4) as atmospheric backstory anchor; no on-page clock or time pressure tied to this moment. The climb's urgency derives from physical instability (branch groaning, wind), not elapsed time since the static cleared. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Setup present as a phrase, no middle or closure involvement. Ornamental temporal marker; removing it changes no story logic. Cap at ~2.8 for missing closure gate; deduct ~−0.4 for decorative use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To preserve trust under pressure" stated explicitly (paragraph 19), backstory context (trust lost in the fall, paragraph 8), and dramatized through the climb: he trusts the vine (tests it), the harness (threads buckle), and himself (pulls back after snap). Present in setup (trust as casualty), middle (harness creation as trust-building), and closure (he doesn't let go, trusts his grip). The motivation drives choices with visible cost (buckle biting, gasps). However, "preserve trust" could be reframed as "survive" with minor edits; the trust angle is thematic overlay rather than mechanically essential. Three gates, causal involvement, closure tie; deduct ~−0.5 for moderate swappability and slight abstraction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears in the phrase "his progress" and as descriptor for silence/wind rhythm (paragraphs 4, 21). Tone is quiet, tension-modulated (wind rattles, branch groans, breath in gasps), and consistent through turns. The phrase recurs but does not charge the final image—ending reads as continuation without tonal shift or repricing. Setup present (silence/echo established early), middle development (tone tightens with wind/snap), weak closure tie (final line is action, not tonal resonance). Two gates; coherent modulation without final charge. Mid-band for presence and coherence; deduct ~−0.5 for lack of closure intensification and ~−0.3 for partial swappability with "quiet urgency."</comment>
