<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The undertaker's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout ("legs heavy with the weight of what he was about to do," "hands no longer trembling"). His arc from trembling hesitation to steady purpose is earned through specific micro-choices: packing, wading, reading aloud. However, the trait "inadvertently stubborn" is mentioned once but never dramatized as a constraint or trade-off that complicates a choice. The final transformation feels clean but lacks the contradictory impulse acting in scene that would elevate to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through density increase (package → wading → library → desk → lenses glowing → reading → light returns) and a cadence shift at closure when "the light returned" and he "felt still." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the undertaker accepts the role of keeper and gives rest to the drowned city, foreclosing his prior isolation with visible emotional cost ("For the first time in years, he felt still"). Orientation anchors arrive early (undertaker, workbench, package). One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers the logbook and understands the promise. Cost is legible: he closes his eyes and accepts the burden, a micro-choice that ends his prior restlessness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly particular: "stained glass windows glowing faintly, as if lit from within," "shelves lined with books that had never known the touch of sunlight," and the water parting at the threshold. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the undertaker's professional calm. The recurring lens object charges the final image when placed on the desk, triggering the chorus and glow. The setting pressures his choice by revealing the logbook and broken lenses, making the environment indispensable to closure. Spatial choreography is coherent across the wade and interior moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—answering the distress signal and giving the drowned rest—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: each beat (package arrival, memory, wade, library entry, logbook discovery) deepens understanding and narrows options until he must act. The protagonist's agency drives closure: he places the lens, opens the book, and reads aloud, actions that revitalize the light. However, the story lacks a visible trade-off or friction; the undertaker encounters no resistance, and the cost remains emotional rather than a tactical sacrifice that alters his circumstances. One meaningful tightening (logbook reveal) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the broken lens as distress signal, the drowned city's promise of rest, the undertaker's gift for "occupying impossible spaces" and "fitting the dead into coffins too small." The final image—light as a glow "seeping into the forgotten places"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor the drowned without stating a moral. The word "Revitalize" is set off as a single line, which risks thematic echo, but it functions as a realization rather than a sermon and the scene immediately enacts it. Subtext operates through the lens-as-beacon metaphor and the undertaker's professional identity reshaping into cosmic keeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the undertaker notices funerary details ("coffins too small," "prayers into ears that no longer heard") and interprets the lens through his professional lens of distress signals and rest. Diction is elevated but consistent ("the thought settled in his chest like a stone," "the city holding its breath"). No head-hopping. However, the narration occasionally slips into mild exposition ("Occupying impossible spaces had always been his gift") that tells rather than dramatizes. The prose modulates well under pressure, tightening at the logbook discovery and expanding into lyric calm at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative design: longer contemplative sentences early ("It was cold, heavier than it should have been...") compress into shorter declaratives at closure ("The light returned"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor scaffold appears: "He knew distress signals when he heard them" over-explains what the prior sentence shows, and "Then he saw it" is a stock transition. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("pulse of the city beneath his fingertips"). The final paragraph shifts to lyric register without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—an undertaker answering a drowned city's distress signal through a broken lighthouse lens—synthesizes gothic setting, occupational specificity, and thematic resonance in a fresh combination. The "occupying impossible spaces" frame feels specific to this character and transforms the familiar drowned-city motif. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications: the undertaker's professional identity as one who gives rest extends seamlessly into cosmic keeper. However, the lack of friction or complication (he encounters no obstacle, physical or moral) keeps the arc predictable. The final image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weary undertaker is present throughout, drives multiple beats (deciding to go, wading in, placing the lens, reading aloud), and his final choice to restore the light is the story's climax. Setup: introduced in the opening line. Development: his memory of the prior visit and decision to return shape the middle. Payoff: he performs the ritual that restores the light, directly enacting closure. Causal pressure: his professional identity and stubbornness propel every choice. Irreplaceability: a different profession would not carry the thematic weight of "giving rest." Cost: he accepts the burden and "felt still," foreclosing his prior restlessness. Deductions: late-story exposition about his gift (−0.3) and minimal visible trade-off (−0.4). Strong integration across all three gates and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens appears in the opening beat, hums as a distress signal, drives the undertaker's decision to return, and is placed on the desk at closure, triggering the light's revival. Setup: paragraph one. Development: its humming compels the journey; he carries it in his satchel. Payoff: "The moment it touched the others, the humming swelled into a chorus, the lenses glowing like embers." Three distinct beats. Causal pressure: the lens initiates and resolves the central conflict. Closure linkage: its placement is the story's turning action. Specificity: its fractured edges and hum are irreplaceable properties. Minor deduction for the intermediate beats (wade, library entry) where it is carried but not actively handled (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distress signals are named early ("He knew distress signals when he heard them"), frame the undertaker's interpretation of the lens's hum, and the logbook confirms the city has been signaling for centuries. Setup: paragraph three. Development: implicit in his decision to answer the call. Payoff: the restoration of light answers the distress. The concept shapes his motivation but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off; it functions more as thematic framing than a dramatized stake. Deductions: mid-story introduction as explicit concept (−0.4), no tactical friction or cost tied directly to the signal itself (−0.5), and the undertaker never questions or resists the signal's pull (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is stated once in paragraph six but never dramatized as a constraint that complicates a choice or imposes a cost. The undertaker's decision to walk to the shore despite heavy legs could reflect stubbornness, but the text does not frame it as inadvertent or as a trait that traps him. Setup: present by first third. Development: no visible beat where the trait enables or constrains action. Payoff: absent from closure. Deductions: label-only mention (−0.8), no on-page cost or trade-off (−1.0), easily swappable with "determined" or "persistent" (−0.6). The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is the story's conceptual hinge: the undertaker realizes the lens wants purpose, not repair, and enacts revival by reading aloud, which restores the light. Setup: the concept seeds early (the city "preserved by some unseen magic"). Development: the logbook frames the need. Payoff: the single-word paragraph "Revitalize" crystallizes the turn, and the subsequent action (reading from the book) fulfills it. The action redefines the problem from repair to purpose and drives closure. Causal pressure: without this realization and action, the lenses remain dark. Irreplaceability: no other verb captures the dual meaning (restore function + give new life). Minor deduction for slight thematic-echo risk in the single-word presentation (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is stated as the undertaker's gift and illustrated through his professional acts (fitting dead into small coffins, whispering into unhearing ears). The phrase recurs when he enters the submerged library, but the mechanics are not dramatized—he simply wades in and the water parts. Setup: paragraph eight. Development: the library entry could be an example, but the mechanism is unexplained. Payoff: the phrase does not return at closure. Deductions: late explicit statement (−0.5), told rather than shown through specific impossible-space navigation (−0.7), and the trait does not constrain a tactic or shape the ending (−0.6). The method is more metaphorical than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city library is introduced early (paragraph nine as memory), becomes the story's primary location, and supplies the crucial resources: the doors, the shelves, the desk, the logbook, and the broken lenses. Setup: seeded in memory by first third, entered in second half. Development: the library's interior choreography (doors groaning, desk at center, logbook open) structures the climax. Payoff: the setting houses the ritual that restores the light, and its "stained glass windows glowing faintly" charge the final image. Causal pressure: without this exact setting, the undertaker cannot discover the logbook or complete the lenses. Irreplaceability: no other locale supplies these story-specific constraints. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" anchors the story's present and drives urgency: the package arrived "that morning," and the undertaker's decision to go happens "now." Setup: opening paragraph. Development: the walk and wade occur in a compressed window, and the tide being low creates a tactical opportunity. Payoff: the ritual occurs in the story's present, and the light returns before the piece ends. The timeframe tightens decisions (he goes immediately rather than delaying) but does not function as a live countdown or impose a tactical cost (e.g., rising tide). Deductions: no escalating clock pressure (−0.6) and minimal friction from time constraint (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To give rest a permanent address" is dramatized through the undertaker's professional identity (arranging the dead, whispering prayers) and culminates in his ritual that gives the drowned city rest. Setup: implicit in his occupation from the start, made explicit when he understands "the drowned would not be forgotten." Development: the logbook's plea ("The last keeper is gone. The light must not go out") reframes his motivation. Payoff: he reads aloud to restore the light, enacting the promise, and "felt still" himself—achieving rest. Causal pressure: the desire propels every choice from opening the package to entering the library. Cost: he accepts the keeper's burden. Minor deduction: the phrase "permanent address" does not appear verbatim, so the motivation is inferred rather than directly tied to that exact wording (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" is embodied in the undertaker's trembling hands at the start and his final achievement: "For the first time in years, he felt still." The tone is elegiac and patient throughout, modulating from restless ("his legs heavy") to meditative (the library's "thick" air) to lyric calm ("warm and golden, seeping into the forgotten places"). Setup: trembling and motion establish the chase. Development: the tone tightens during the wade and library entry, then expands at the logbook. Payoff: stillness is named and felt in the final beat. The tone charges the ending image and coheres under pressure without static mood. Minor deduction: the phrase "chased stillness" is not explicit on the page, so the tone is inferred (−0.3).</comment>
