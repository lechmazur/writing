<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias exhibits consistent traits (steady routine-keeper, thirty-seven years of muscle memory) and his discovery of the key tag triggers a clear shift from hollow routine to purposeful action. The woman's arrival introduces relationship pressure, but her exposition ("You've been lighting the lamps for years, but you've never asked why they still matter") flattens what could be embodied tension. The final gesture—pressing the Lumen tag into her hand—reads as closure, but the leap from "I understand" to handing over the key lacks visible internal conflict or cost: no dramatized struggle between keeping the legacy and passing it on. Interiority at peak beats ("his pulse quickened") leans on physiological shorthand rather than character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors WHO (Elias Vey, lamplighter), WHERE (pier, then sunken SS Marigold), and WHEN (tonight, leading to midnight lantern release) within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative: Elias is drawn by an unexplained key, wanders to the wreck, meets the woman, witnesses the lanterns, and "understands" his legacy—a series of revelations rather than because/therefore linkage. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the luminous vow as generational debt) plus a micro-turn (handing over the tag), but the cost is asserted ("a debt, a legacy") rather than dramatized: we don't see what Elias loses or forecloses by passing the key. The woman's line "You're late" and her exposition about truth introduce a secondary stake that competes with the dominant "discover the color of sound" without clear convergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pier, harbor, and SS Marigold are anchored with vivid, purpose-driven detail: algae-slick ladder rungs, warped shelves, moonlight through a porthole. The library's airtight survival and the open book on the reading desk both guide Elias's choices and charge the final sky-lantern tableau. Sensory selection (salt, old paper, liquid-gold glow) reflects the POV's professional lamplighter attention to light and decay. The lantern release operates as both timeframe and micro-setting, constraining the window and supplying the visual proof of "color of sound." Minor slip: the woman's silhouette "framed by the dim light" in the dark library interior reads spatially unclear after the single moonbeam setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "the color of sound"—is signaled late (midpoint, via the book) and competes with the unexplained key-tag mystery and the woman's "truth you've been hiding behind." Pressure accumulates through Elias's wandering and the woman's cryptic prodding, culminating in the visual epiphany: lanterns pulsing in sync with the harbor bell. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias perceives the synesthetic phenomenon, but the resolution lacks visible cost: he hands over the key without on-page hesitation, loss, or tactical constraint. The woman's exposition ("That's the color of sound") tells rather than dramatizes the realization, and "understood then" summarizes the turn instead of showing the internal shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (legacy, vows written in light, the interplay of memory and promise) emerges from concrete particulars: the worn key tag, the preserved book, the lantern tradition's wartime origin, the synesthetic color-sound moment. The closing image—"The last lantern rose into the sky, its glow fading into the meteor hush of the night"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Minor thematic echo: "The truth he'd hidden behind was never his to keep. It was a debt, a legacy, a luminous vow passed down through the generations of lamplighters" reads as near-thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, diluting the image's work. The prompt concept "luminous vows" is woven through action (the book, the lanterns) rather than asserted, but the phrase "luminous vow" appears verbatim at closure, reducing subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays cleanly with Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at the ladder descent, wider for the sky tableau). Perceptual signature is present: a lamplighter notices light qualities, warped wood, the key's "undeniable" weight. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("You're late." / "For what?"), though the woman's exposition ("You've been lighting the lamps for years, but you've never asked why they still matter") tilts toward thesis statement rather than subtext. Voice remains consistent under pressure, but diction at peak beats ("his pulse quickened," "the words struck him like a bell") leans on stock embodiment. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he noticed") appear frequently but fit the meditative register. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and supports momentum through the descent and revelation sequences. Information density is high in the library beat (book title, vow mechanics, woman's arrival compressed into five paragraphs). Minor loop: "Tonight, though, the usual rhythm felt hollow" and "the thought of standing still made his skin prickle" restate restlessness without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph 2: "Elias had always watched from the pier, but tonight, the thought… Instead, he wandered purposefully…" and paragraph 10: "She wore a coat like his… and in her hand was another key tag…" recycle "X like Y, and in Z" structure. Stock metaphor: "struck him like a bell" and "burning against his chest" appear at peak beats without fresh embodiment. No clarity breaks; propulsion is steady but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lamplighter routine, sunken-ship library, synesthetic vows, and generational key-passing is specific and non-obvious. The wartime origin of the lantern tradition and the preserved book in an airtight wreck add verifiable texture. Risk: the two-character nocturnal revelation and the mystical woman-with-matching-key setup echo mentor-reveals-hidden-truth templates (cf. magical realism tropes), though the color-of-sound conceit and the pier setting personalize it. The ending image (lantern fading into "meteor hush") is fresh, but the phrase "meteor hush" is also the required tone element, reducing its organic feel. Transformation is partial: the core arc (restless guardian discovers secret purpose, passes mantle) could transpose to other settings with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's occupation frames every beat: his thirty-seven-year routine, his hollow feeling at the lamps, his purposeful wandering, his reading of the light-vow book, his perception of the lantern colors. His decision to follow the woman and to hand over the key tag drives the ending. Setup immediate, development across all beats, payoff in the final gesture. Causal pressure is moderate: the lamplighter identity enables him to perceive the synesthetic phenomenon, but the choice to pass the key feels more like acceptance than dilemma. Cost is asserted (a "debt" passed on) rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Lumen key tag appears in paragraph 3 (early setup), triggers Elias's wandering, and returns in the final gesture when he presses it into the woman's hand. Two beats: discovery/catalyst and transfer. The woman's Veritas tag creates a paired-object motif. The tag's "undeniable" weight and worn brass edges supply texture, and the single-word inscription "Lumen" ties to the luminous-vows theme. Middle development is weak: the tag is carried but not handled or consulted during the library or lantern beats. Closure participation is clear but passive: the handoff reweights the tag as legacy token, yet the cost of relinquishing it is told ("understood then") rather than shown through hesitation or embodied loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" is named in the book title at midpoint, explained via the passage ("vows written in light… seen under the glow of a full moon or the flicker of a lantern"), and enacted in the sky-lantern tableau where Elias perceives color-sound synesthesia. The concept shapes the thematic question and supplies the epiphany, but it does not constrain tactics: Elias does not attempt to create, read, or refuse a vow on the page. The woman's exposition ("The vows are written in the sky tonight") tells rather than dramatizes the mechanics. Closure linkage is strong (the final image of the fading lantern is a luminous vow in action), but the lack of mid-scene friction or cost tied to the concept itself keeps it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is asserted by the woman ("the truth you've been hiding behind") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables Elias's actions. We do not see him evade, rationalize, or confront a difficult truth through on-page micro-choices. The phrase appears once, late (second half), and functions as exposition rather than embodied character work. No setup, no middle development, weak payoff: the "understood then" summary claims realization without showing the internal shift or cost of facing what was hidden. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Signify" is enacted in the sky-lantern tableau: Elias watches the lanterns and perceives their colors as signals (red = loss, blue = memory, gold = promises). The woman explains, "That's the color of sound," and Elias "understood." The action shapes the thematic epiphany but does not drive a plot turn or alter tactics. First appearance is late (final third), and the revelation is told via the woman's line and Elias's summary understanding rather than through a choice or renunciation with cost. The action is swappable: "interpret," "decode," or "recognize" could replace "signify" with minor edits. Closure participation is clear but passive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is signaled early (paragraph 2: "he wandered purposefully toward the old docks") and shapes the entire middle: Elias moves from pier to wreck to library to deck without a map or stated goal, yet each step narrows toward the revelation. The method's paradox (aimless with intent) is embodied in his prickling skin and the pull of the key tag. The woman's arrival and the lantern timing reward the wandering with discovery. The method constrains tactics (no direct plan, no consultation) and charges the closure: the purposeful drift leads to the generational handoff. Mechanics are clear, present across beats, and integral to the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken SS Marigold library is introduced at paragraph 8, dominates the middle sequence, and supplies the pivotal book that explains luminous vows. Setup is late but functional; the library's airtight preservation and the open book on the reading desk are specific, plausible details that enable the discovery. The setting pressures choice by offering knowledge and by staging the woman's appearance between the shelves. Spatial choreography (algae ladder, warped shelves, single moonbeam, porthole) is vivid and constrains movement. Payoff: the library anchors the thematic turn, and the return to the deck frames the final tableau. The wreck could be replaced with another hidden archive (lighthouse attic, locked pier shed) with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sky lantern release is scheduled for midnight and announced in paragraph 6; the lanterns rise during the final tableau ("The lanterns above them began to rise," "The last lantern rose"). The timeframe creates a loose deadline and times the visual epiphany, but it does not tighten on-page decisions: Elias explores the wreck and talks with the woman without clock pressure or risk of missing the event. The midnight marker is told rather than tracked (no on-page countdown, no urgency cues). Closure participation is strong: the lanterns supply the color-sound proof and the final fading image. One distinct beat (the tableau) with lyric reprise (opening mention → ending enactment), but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover the color of sound" is named at midpoint via the book's cryptic line ("To see the color of sound, one must first listen with their eyes") and fulfilled in the lantern tableau when Elias perceives synesthetic hues. The motivation is told rather than dramatized: we do not see Elias yearn for this discovery before reading the book, and the phrase is not seeded in his interiority. The woman's prompt ("Watch") and Elias's compliant observation read passive. No friction between desire and cost: the revelation arrives without sacrifice, doubt, or competing want. Setup late, middle development weak (the motivation is received rather than pursued), payoff clear but unearned. Swappable with "understand his purpose" or "see the hidden meaning."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in the final sentence ("its glow fading into the meteor hush of the night") and colors the nocturnal, liminal atmosphere throughout: quiet pier, dim library, whispered dialogue, the "hollow" rhythm. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (restless → exploratory → hushed revelation). The phrase's late-breaking appearance as a metaphor weakens setup, but the mood it names is present from paragraph 1. The tone charges the final image by framing silence as cosmic and transient. Minor friction: "meteor hush" as a coined phrase feels slightly ornamental rather than inevitable, and its single use limits beat involvement. Closure linkage strong; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>
