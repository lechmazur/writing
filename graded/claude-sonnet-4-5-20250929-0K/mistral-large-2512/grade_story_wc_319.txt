<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's dimensional homesickness and uncertainty-seeking are established early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("dimensional homesickness," "waiting her whole life") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final choice—ceasing to wait—lacks visible cost; the text asserts change without showing what path she foreclosed or what she traded. Minor win: the pendant's cold weight and her kneeling to the book provide concrete anchors, but peak beats drift into therapy-speak ("make friends with uncertainty") that flattens pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertones. Orientation is delayed but functional by ~200 words. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she "didn't feel the need to wait"), yet cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no clear path foreclosed, no visible tradeoff on the page. The garden-as-mind metaphor and the blank-then-inscribed book are evocative, but the guardian's disappearance and Mara's standing feel like soft resets rather than earned shifts under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden, skeletal trees, and mist are vivid and filter consistently through Mara's longing. The pendant's cold weight recurs and the book's blank-to-inscribed transformation constrains the final beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent (hedges, clearing, frost underfoot), and the "damp earth and old parchment" scent anchors early. The setting pressures Mara's stance and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's search for answers and relief from dimensional homesickness—is signaled early. The encounter with the guardian and the inscribed book provide one meaningful tightening, but the guardian's exit and Mara's shift ("didn't feel the need to wait") lack a visible price or trade-off. Uncertainty as constant and the pendant's role complicate but do not escalate into a choice that narrows live options with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (dimensional homesickness, uncertainty, boundaries) emerges from image and event rather than statement. The inscribed line "I am homesick for a place I've never been" and the guardian's "some boundaries are meant to be crossed / But not all of them should be" approach moralizing but remain concrete enough to avoid sermon. The final image—Mara standing, book closed, no longer waiting—offers a quiet, non-literal answer. Minor deduction: "interiorizing exteriors" appears as a prompt label without full dramatic grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent lyric-mythic register. Diction ("skeletal trees clawing," "pages turning whispered") is purposeful and voice-specific. The guardian's dialogue ("voice like paper tearing") and Mara's spare responses maintain tonal coherence. Minor slip: some elevated phrasing ("boundaries of light," "interiorizing exteriors") risks register drift, but the internal texture holds under pressure and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sensory detail (frost, mist, cold pendant) is selective and advances atmosphere. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor density loss: adjacent lines in paragraph four ("The pendant had been a gift—or a curse" and "Now, as the mist thickened") restate arrival/threshold without added pressure. No major loops or scaffold, and figurative language (ink-stained fingers, galaxies in eyes) remains coherent. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The feral library guardian and dimensional homesickness offer fresh inflection on quest-for-knowledge arcs, and the garden-as-mind metaphor is specific. The inscribed-book moment (words bleeding into existence) feels earned in hindsight. However, the core emotional arc—loneliness resolved by ceasing to wait—risks abstraction common to prompt-driven pieces, and the cultist/pendant backstory remains lightly sketched. Solid synthesis but not yet inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The guardian beckons Mara forward, offers cryptic guidance ("You write what you fear"), and vanishes—three distinct beats. Setup is immediate, middle choice (leading to the clearing) alters tactics, and the guardian's final line ("Some boundaries are meant to be crossed / But not all of them should be") reweights the closure. Swappability is moderate; a different guide could deliver similar beats with minor edits. No visible cost tied specifically to the guardian's nature (ink/instinct) constrains Mara's final stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The pendant appears in three beats: neck-weight early, the guardian's notice ("That's not yours"), and growing colder at the inscribed book. Setup is strong, middle beat functional, but closure participation is passive—it grows colder without altering Mara's final choice. Cost is atmospheric, not causal. Introduced early but resolves no problem it helped create.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The boundaries of light" appears once as a cultist's phrase and echoes thematically in "some boundaries are meant to be crossed." It does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Mara never tests or navigates a boundary as a live constraint. Present as theme claim, absent as structural pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dimensional homesickness is named early and motivates Mara's journey. It recurs in the inscribed line ("homesick for a place I've never been") and frames the closure shift (no longer waiting). Setup and payoff are strong, but middle development is summary-only; no on-page action or tradeoff dramatizes the trait's cost during the encounter. Label-heavy use lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Wait" drives the arc: Mara has been "waiting her whole life," the guardian says "You've been waiting," and the closure is "she didn't feel the need to wait." Early seed and final reprise clearly reweight the dominant stake. Middle involvement is thin—waiting is asserted rather than dramatized in a choice under pressure. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; cost is felt but not causally tied to a specific forfeited path.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is mentioned once as a cultist's phrase explaining "this place was not just a garden, but a mind, a memory, a wound." It does not shape Mara's attempts or tactics; the method remains a thematic gloss rather than a dramatized mechanic. Ornamental use; swappable phrasing would leave the scene intact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden is established immediately and recurs across all major beats: mist, hedges, clearing, frost underfoot. It expands ("trees growing taller, paths multiplying") to signal transformation and remains present in the final image ("still frozen, still silent"). The setting constrains movement (Mara follows the guardian through specific terrain) and charges the closure shift. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in one line ("as if she were walking through the veil of sleep") to describe the mist's effect. It does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time; the encounter unfolds without temporal pressure. Present as atmosphere, absent as constraint. Functional metaphor but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Making friends with uncertainty is named explicitly ("her motivation for years") and reappears in the closure logic (uncertainty as "the only constant"). Setup and payoff are clear. Middle beat is thin: Mara's hesitation before touching the book hints at friction, but the text tells rather than dramatizes the want/cost trade-off. Label-reliant; visible struggle under pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is sustained throughout: dreamlike imagery (mist, skeletal trees, shifting guardian form) paired with concrete sensory anchors (frost crunch, cold pendant, ink bleeding). Tone modulates with pressure (wonder → unease → quiet resolve) and charges the final image ("still frozen, still silent, but something had shifted"). Coherent through turns and legible at closure.</comment>
