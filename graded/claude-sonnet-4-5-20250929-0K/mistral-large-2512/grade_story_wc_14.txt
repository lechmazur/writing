<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stationer's interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("earnestly studious," "patience," "longed to understand") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character observes and records but makes no micro-choices under pressure until the final writing moment, which arrives without prior conflict to earn it. The mysterious notepad entry and train whistle create atmosphere but don't force the protagonist to choose between competing goods with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the "peace" at closure feels asserted rather than dramatized through physical state or perceptual shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers descriptive particulars (bonsai, lamp hum, notepad pages, town silence) toward a final image of resonance, but the closure unit lacks visible cost—the stationer feels "at peace" and hears a train whistle without forfeiting a live option or facing friction. The mysterious handwriting and lamp hum suggest stakes around connection to past lives, yet no before/after is legible: he writes, feels peace, the story ends. Orientation is clear early (mountaintop, dawn, empty shop), and the two-shard structure (shop backstory, mountaintop present) is legible, but the ending image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bonsai forests, mountaintop labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and gilded-leaf paper are vividly anchored and return multiple times. The lamp hum pulses in time with heartbeat and curiosity, creating sensory texture that reflects urgency. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the ending—props decorate rather than pressure. The body and tool (pen, notepad) are handled but don't force a tactical shift. Spatial choreography is coherent; the piece avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting textures of different times—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options: the stationer writes, discovers mysterious ink, writes more, feels peace. The mysterious entry and train whistle gesture toward a haunting presence but don't force a trade-off or decision with visible cost. The closure moment ("The stationer's shop is never truly empty") is a thematic assertion without agency-driven pressure. Coincidence (the found page, the whistle) complicates atmosphere but does not escalate stakes or test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of invented histories and the weight of silence emerges organically through bonsai metaphor, notepad entries, and the empty town. The final line "The stationer's shop is never truly empty" offers a resonant reconfiguration of presence/absence, but the move is somewhat on-the-nose—articulating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it. The lamp hum and train whistle create dramatic irony (past echoing into present), and the piece avoids moralizing, but the ending wisdom arrives as assertion rather than from a specific, costly struggle on the page. No thematic echo penalty applies; the piece resists sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature (gilded paper "like captured sunlight," histories "twisting like branches"). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, voice modulates little under the minimal pressure—the reflective register and metaphoric density remain uniform from opening to closure. The piece teaches a lyric, meditative pattern early and holds it, so the steady texture is legible rather than a flaw, but the lack of rhythmic shift or compression at the peak moment (the final writing) limits the sense of stakes charging the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with vivid imagery ("frames thin as the veins in the bonsai leaves," "gilded paper in the dawn light") and good sentence variety. Two paraphrase loops appear: "a place of bustling trade" / "Now, the shop stood empty" restates the same contrast without adding pressure, and "he had always been drawn to the quiet" / "Today, he sought to refract time" cycles the motivation. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "The hum…grew louder" / "He turned…and began to write" / "He wrote of the stationer" shows stem repetition across three beats. The loops and templates dull momentum in the middle third; apply −0.6 in Q7 for patterned artifacts. Line-level clarity is otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mashup of gilded-leaf stationer, bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp hum, and invented histories creates a distinctive surface, but the emotional arc and closure (solitary figure finds peace through writing) follow a familiar contemplative template. The mysterious handwritten fragment and train whistle add atmospheric texture but don't transform the underlying shape. The piece commits to its lyric premise and avoids safety hedging, yet the final image and thematic gesture feel predetermined rather than earned through surprising character choice. Specificity in objects and setting provides freshness; the lack of a non-obvious synthesis or stakes-driven risk limits originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer is present throughout and writes at the end, but his choices are observational and reflective rather than decision-driven. He notices the mysterious ink, writes "one final line," and feels peace—no on-page cost or tactic alteration. Present in setup, middle, and ending (all three gates), but functional rather than causal. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.3, but no causal pressure or cost linkage; swappability −0.5 (any solitary recorder could fill the role). Base 3.0 + 1.7 positive - 0.5 swap = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears in the opening beat, receives the mysterious handwriting mid-story, and "lay open on the bench" with "pages filled with stories" at closure—three distinct beats with evolving use. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8 (the filled pages embody the collection motive), specificity +0.4 (battered, pages rustling). No visible cost tied to the notepad itself and the object could be replaced with another recording medium (journal, scroll) without breaking logic; swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.1 - 0.6 = 5.5, round to 5.5; however, the notepad's mid-story mysterious entry and final "filled with stories" create two distinct pressure points, lifting to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Invented histories are named in the opening ("invented histories he so diligently recorded") and the ending ("pages filled with stories that were no longer just his own"), framing the stationer's method. The concept shapes his occupation and the mysterious handwriting moment, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics—he writes throughout without friction. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure thematic echo +0.3, but label-only and told rather than dramatized −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.7 - 0.6 = 4.1; the lyric reprise at closure lifts slightly to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is applied once in the opening paragraph as a descriptor. It colors the character's demeanor but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—he writes methodically, but any diligent recorder would do the same. Setup present +0.3, one beat +0.4, label-only −0.6, swappable −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.7 - 1.1 = 2.6; bump to 3.8 for minimal functional work (it justifies his presence on the mountaintop).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Refract" appears twice: "sought to refract time itself" in paragraph 4 and implied in "stories could too—bending, shifting" in paragraph 6. The action is named as motive but not enacted—there is no on-page demonstration of how the stationer refracts time through lamp-charting or writing, and the effect does not turn plot or constrain choice. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, thematic echo +0.3, but summary-only and swappable (any metaphor for transformation would serve) −1.0. Base 3.0 + 1.7 - 1.0 = 3.7; lyric coherence lifts to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Charting the lamp hum is introduced in paragraph 4 ("filled the first few sheets with observations: the way the hum rose and fell"), appears in paragraph 5 (hum grows louder), paragraph 6 (hum pulses), and paragraph 8 (hum fades into silence). Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.5 (hum's fade coincides with peace). The method shapes multiple attempts but does not narrow options or create cost; the hum is atmospheric rather than tactical. Specificity +0.4 (fluorescent, dawn, heartbeat rhythm), but the mechanics are vague and the hum could be replaced with any ambient phenomenon −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.9 - 0.5 = 5.4; the three-beat involvement and closure fade lift to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is vividly described in paragraphs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8, framing the stationer's work. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure image +0.7 ("bonsai forests stood tall…leaves shimmering like gilded paper"). The setting creates atmosphere but does not pressure choices or supply resources—the stationer could perform the same actions indoors. Specificity +0.5 (mountaintop, miniature world, twisting branches), but postcard description without tactical constraint −0.7. Base 3.0 + 3.2 - 0.7 = 5.5; however, the setting does not meet the two-beat causal test cleanly, so 4.7 is more accurate given decorative use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is established in paragraph 1 ("the town below had gone silent long before") and returns as emotional weight in paragraphs 4, 6, 7, 8. The silence frames the stationer's solitude and ties to the closure theme, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—time passes without urgency. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, thematic closure linkage +0.5 (the silence becomes "a presence"). No tactical constraint or ticking pressure −0.8. Base 3.0 + 2.5 - 0.8 = 4.7; the lyric reprise lifts to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to collect textures of different times is stated in paragraph 1 and paragraph 4, drives the lamp-charting and notepad-filling across paragraphs 4–7, and shapes the final writing moment. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.6 (the filled notepad embodies the motive). The desire is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs—he collects without obstacle or internal conflict. Told-only −0.7. Base 3.0 + 2.6 - 0.7 = 4.9; the multi-beat involvement and closure embodiment lift to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone is restrained, meditative, and lyric throughout, with imagery ("gilded leaf," "miniature world," "shimmering") carrying quiet intensity. The tone modulates slightly from observational (paragraphs 1–3) to introspective (4–6) to hushed resolution (7–8), charging the final image with the lamp's fade and the train whistle echo. Coherent through turns +1.2, modulation with pressure +0.8, charges the final image +1.0, but single static register without sharp compression at the peak −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.0 - 0.4 = 5.6; the fade and whistle at closure lift to 6.4.</comment>
