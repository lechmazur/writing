<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows consistent interiority—his reflections on glassblowing and mother's warnings are embodied through concrete objects (bookmark, furnace). However, the final "choice" to flip switches feels symbolic rather than earned by prior contradiction; he moves from freeze to flow without a visible on-page trade-off or forfeited path. The internal conflict between isolation and connection is told more than dramatized in micro-choices. Backstory exceeds ~20% but anchors to present stimuli (bookmark, melting ice) and tilts his stance toward action, so BRR expansion applies without penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (control room, Elias, present winter thaw) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: sensory and reflective density builds toward the final switch-flipping as symbolic closure. However, the closure image (machines whirring, thaw continuing) offers reconfiguration without a clear visible cost—what path does Elias foreclose by activating the panel? The orb he never finished and the studio he left are mentioned but not dramatized as lost options at the ending beat. Cost proof test fails; apply −0.6 in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The control room is vividly rendered: rust, old paper, dormant dials, flickering bulbs. The melting ice functions as both atmosphere and motif, mirroring Elias's internal thaw. The console and switches constrain his final action—he must stabilize power, adjust dials—so setting shapes the closure beat. Meets the 9+ gate criterion (setting constrains choice at closure), but sensory detail occasionally drifts into catalog mode (eaves dripping, breath fogging) without tight POV filter, capping below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled: Elias seeks to repair "something deeper" and craft safe inquiry zones. The tightening occurs when he narrates the panel calibration, metaphorically linking pressure balance to his internal state. However, escalation is conceptual rather than causally driven—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by prior failure. The final switch-flip is an enacted metaphor, not a decision with visible cost. One meaningful deepening (calibration metaphor) meets minimum, but cost clarity is weak; band guidance for 8.0+ requires a trade-off that forecloses a live option, not met here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of thaw-as-vulnerability emerges through ice imagery, the cracked bookmark, and the unfinished orb. The final line ("ready to shape something new") risks stating the theme, but the prior calibration metaphor ("too much pressure…too little") offers non-literal resonance. However, the orb remains abstract—never dramatized as a specific failure or resumed as a concrete act. The ending reweights prior material but leans toward summary rather than a charged image with undeniable cost. Quiet endings qualify, yet this one explains rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance remains consistent. Voice carries distinct texture: "the heat of the furnace would burn away the parts of him that needed people," "old ghosts." The dramatic narration passage ("First, the power must be stabilized") introduces a purposeful shift into performed monologue that reflects his glassblowing pedagogy. However, the phrase "thoughtfully spirited—too curious for his own good" reads as externalized label rather than enacted perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (glass artist's eye on cracks, calibration) is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("dying bees," "chorus of old ghosts"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the bookmark's cracked state is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure, and "the thawing heart of the world" is named twice in near-identical phrasing. The orb description ("half-formed," "too fragile, too exposed") recycles the same idea. Template cadence in the calibration passage ("Now, the temperature regulators…And here, the final calibration") is voice-motivated but borders on repetitive. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loops; no artifacts touch closure beat, so no 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—solitary craftsman seeks emotional repair in an abandoned site—follows a familiar template (contemplative return, symbolic object, metaphorical thaw). The glassblowing detail (molten silica, refraction, pressure calibration) adds specificity, and the performed narration offers a fresh inflection. However, the transformation test is weak: swap glassblowing for pottery or woodworking and the arc holds unchanged. The ending ("Let's see what happens when the heat meets the glass") echoes the craft metaphor without deeper surprise. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −0.8 within Q8 for template use with moderate transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout; his choice to flip switches occurs at closure. However, his decisions are symbolic (enacting a metaphor) rather than constrained by prior turns. He observes and reflects more than he acts; the switch-flipping feels like a ritual conclusion rather than a high-stakes choice that narrows live options. Meets functional use (present, closure action) but lacks causal pressure across beats. Gates: setup ✓, development (weak: no middle choice altered by his trait), payoff (symbolic action). Two gates → eligible to ~6.0, but swappability and lack of middle development lower score. Apply −0.5 for ornamental mid-story presence and −0.3 for summary-only craft backstory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in three beats: opening (traced, remembered origin), middle (placed on console), final (picked up again, thumb over worn surface). Its cracked state mirrors Elias's self-concept ("cracked, yes, but still functional"). However, its physical presence does not constrain a choice—he could complete the same arc without it. The lyric reprise (first → last) reweights meaning but lacks causal pressure. Gates: setup ✓, development (placed but not used), payoff ✓. Two gates plus lyric reprise → eligible to ~6.3, but swappability and lack of middle causal work lower score. Apply −0.4 for ornamental middle use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"The thawing heart of the world" shapes the dominant stake: Elias must let barriers melt. The ice melting outside is tracked across beats and explicitly linked to his internal shift. The concept drives the final action (he no longer fears the thaw) and reweights the orb metaphor. However, the concept is more thematic engine than tactical constraint—it does not narrow options so much as frame the emotional arc. Gates: setup ✓ (ice melting introduced early), development ✓ (mirrors his internal state), payoff ✓ (final line anchors to thaw acceptance). All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate (shapes tactics via metaphor). Apply +0.8 for beat involvement (three beats), +0.6 for closure linkage, −0.3 for some ornamental repetition ("thawing heart" stated twice in near-identical phrasing).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited—too curious for his own good" is stated once as backstory label. It does not constrain or enable any on-page choice with visible cost. The trait could describe his reflective narration style, but no specific action hinges on being "too curious" versus cautious or pragmatic. Gates: setup (mentioned mid-story), development ✗, payoff ✗. One gate → cap 4.6. Apply −0.8 for label-only use and −0.5 for late introduction (appears past 40% mark in a retrospective aside).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elias "abandoned his journal on the console" mid-story, a minor physical act. He also abandoned the glassblowing studio (backstory) and the unfinished orb (summary). The journal abandonment does not create a turn; the studio/orb abandonment are told rather than dramatized and do not alter present tactics. The word "abandon" recurs in the setting description (abandoned control room, abandoned decades ago), but these are scene facts, not protagonist actions. Gates: setup (control room abandonment frames setting), development (journal placed, but no consequence), payoff ✗ (not revisited at closure). Two weak gates → eligible to ~5.0. Apply −0.6 for summary-only studio/orb use and −0.3 for the journal action being a setup without payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is signaled and enacted in the calibration passage: Elias performs his switch-flipping as if "reciting an epic" for an "unseen audience," complete with quoted monologue. This method shapes the closure beat (the final switch-flip concludes the narrated sequence) and reflects his glassblowing pedagogy. However, the method appears only in one extended beat; it does not recur or constrain earlier choices. Gates: setup ✗ (appears mid-story), development ✓ (dramatized in calibration passage), payoff ✓ (final switch-flip completes the performance). Two gates → eligible to ~6.0. Apply +0.5 for specificity (pedagogy-rooted monologue style) and +0.4 for closure linkage, −0.4 for late first appearance (past midpoint).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The control room is present throughout: it frames the setting, provides the console/switches that Elias manipulates, and its "abandoned decades ago" status mirrors his isolation. The room's physical constraints (power breakers, dials, temperature regulators) enable the final action. It functions as both macro-setting and tool-space. Gates: setup ✓ (opening description), development ✓ (dials adjusted mid-story), payoff ✓ (machines activated at closure). All three gates met. Apply +0.9 for two-beat involvement (description, calibration, activation span three beats), +1.2 for causal pressure (console mechanics shape the closure act), +0.5 for specificity (rust, dormant dials, old systems), −0.3 for some postcard description ("eaves dripping") that does not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"During ice melting" is signaled early (ice dripping from eaves, "slow, deliberate taps") and recurs at closure ("The ice outside continued to melt"). The timeframe is seasonal (winter → thaw) rather than a live ticking clock; it provides atmosphere and metaphor but does not tighten decisions. Elias could complete the same actions in any season with minor re-theming. Gates: setup ✓ (ice melting mentioned early), development (ice as motif, not tactical constraint), payoff ✓ (referenced at closure). Two gates → eligible to ~6.0. Apply +0.4 for lyric reprise (first → last), −0.6 for lack of tactical pressure (no clock that alters moves), −0.4 for swappability (any seasonal shift could serve the metaphor).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To craft safe zones for inquiry" is stated explicitly mid-story ("a place to craft safe zones for inquiry, to ask questions without fear of shattering"). The control room embodies this desire, and the final switch-flipping enacts his willingness to risk shattering. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no scene shows him attempting inquiry and failing, or choosing between safety and risk with visible cost. Gates: setup (implicit in his refuge-seeking), development ✓ (stated and linked to orb metaphor), payoff ✓ (final action accepts risk). Two strong gates → eligible to ~6.0. Apply +0.4 for closure linkage (final line "ready to shape something new" reflects this motive), −0.5 for told-only (no friction dramatized in choices), −0.3 for late explicit statement (past 40% mark).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is coherent: the prose balances serious themes (isolation, fear of shattering) with lyric imagery (glass orbs, dying bees, old ghosts) and a final note of readiness. The calibration monologue introduces performative levity ("reciting an epic") that tensions the somber atmosphere. Tone modulates with pressure: introspective early, more active at closure. However, the ending risks tipping into uplift ("no longer feared the thaw") without sufficient on-page cost to charge that lightness. Gates: setup ✓ (established in opening diction), development ✓ (monologue shifts register), payoff ✓ (final line balances resolve and openness). All three gates met. Apply +0.7 for coherent modulation and +0.4 for closure charge, −0.5 for the final line veering toward summary rather than a charged image.</comment>
