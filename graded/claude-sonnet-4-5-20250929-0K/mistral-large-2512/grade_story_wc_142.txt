<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lan's motivation is clear and her dual allegiance creates internal pressure, but key choices feel more told than embodied. The ending moment with Old Man Vey—"The raft survives because we choose it"—arrives as validation rather than a turn earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her organizational tactics (blocking surveyors, slow food service) read as competent problem-solving without visible struggle or costly tradeoffs that foreclose a path. The "culture shock absorber" trait remains largely label-only; we don't see her actively translating between worlds under pressure with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The closure moment—Lan believing for the first time that "the raft survives because we choose it"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The privatization vote looms as a deadline, yet the night-before timing doesn't narrow her options or force a painful choice; Old Man Vey's appearance feels like external validation rather than a decision she earns through prior causality. The inferred lens is Situational with Causal elements, but the final beat doesn't deliver the felt price the setup promises.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The raft city is vivid and purposeful: "wooden planks groaning," neon signs, the undersides of bridges and vendor carts all ground the action. The foundation stone chip returns at the ending ("pressed into her palm"), charging the final image with symbolic weight. Spatial choreography is clear throughout—carnival sections, archives, the raft's edge—and the floating setting creates inherent instability that mirrors the gentrification threat. The setting constrains Lan's tactics (graffiti placement, path-blocking) and supplies the resources (carnival performers, cooks) she uses to resist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the raft's autonomy against investors—is signaled early and sustained. Lan's tactics (notes, sabotage, counter-graffiti) show agency, but the escalation feels more like a list of moves than a tightening that forecloses options. The privatization vote is declared urgent ("the night before"), yet no on-page reversal tests her commitment or forces a trade-off between competing goods. The final moment offers belief rather than a choice with visible cost. The pressure coheres but doesn't narrow decisively under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the raft's precarity and Lan's dual allegiance: resilience, belonging, and the cost of bridging worlds. The foundation stone chip shifts from relic to key to talisman, carrying thematic weight without overt symbolism. Old Man Vey's line—"The raft survives because we choose it"—borders on thematic statement but is rooted in his character and the moment. The story resists easy answers: gentrification wears a smile, and Lan's actions are small-scale resistance rather than decisive victory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of survival through collective will.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and voice is consistent, filtering the carnival through Lan's dual perspective. Perceptual signature is present: "She could slip from the raucous chaos... to the quiet precision of the raft's hidden archives." The graffiti decoding and tactical orchestration reflect her orderly-intuitive lens. However, some diction drifts into elevated register ("perpetual revelry," "bacchanal") that feels slightly external to a sixteen-year-old's immediate thought. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping, and narrative certainty matches what Lan can know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and purposeful, with strong images: "circling like vultures," "dream half-remembered," "streaks of gold and crimson." Some template cadence appears: "She was a culture shock absorber... She was orderly intuitive... she was one of them" (three consecutive "She was" openers stacking trait labels). Minor paraphrase loop: "trust was a currency she spent carefully" immediately follows "a bridge... who could be trusted," restating the trust concept. The graffiti symbols and carnival choreography are concrete, but a few lines ("burden she carried like a second skin") lean toward stock metaphor. Momentum is steady; no major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The raft city carnival and gentrification frame offer a fresh synthesis, and the graffiti-as-resistance method adds texture. However, the "dual allegiance" and "orderly intuitive" traits read as prompt fulfillment rather than organic character discovery; they're labeled more than dramatized. The foundation stone chip as symbolic relic is a familiar device, and the "night before the vote" deadline is conventional. The emotional arc—outsider girl finds belief in collective resilience—is earnest but not structurally surprising. Specificity in setting and the graffiti network elevate the execution, yet the core beats could be transposed to other gentrification narratives with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lan is identified as a "culture shock absorber" and her ability to translate between carnival and outsiders is described, but the trait is label-heavy and not dramatized in a key choice. She orchestrates resistance tactics, yet we don't see her actively mediating or absorbing tension between worlds in a scene that turns the conflict. Present and functional, but the exact character type is swappable with "bridge-builder" or "mediator" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in the archives early, returns when Lan traces its edges in her pocket, and is "pressed into her palm" in the final beat. It shifts from relic to key to talisman, accumulating symbolic weight across three beats. However, it never constrains a choice or enables a tactic on the page; its presence is atmospheric rather than causal. The final reprise reweights its meaning (resilience → belief), earning mid-range credit for charged return, but it remains more symbol than plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Dual allegiance" is signaled early and named explicitly: "To the carnival, she was one of them... To the outsiders... a bridge." It shapes her tactics (smoothing the way, orchestrating quiet sabotage) and creates internal pressure ("trust was a currency she spent carefully"). The final beat—choosing belief in the raft—resolves the tension between allegiances. The concept drives multiple beats and informs the closure, though the internal conflict is more told than embodied in a pivotal scene where the allegiances collide with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is introduced as a paradox and illustrated with one example: Lan sees patterns in the carnival's chaos and reorganizes disputes. She uses this trait to orchestrate resistance (notes, path-blocking), but the trait itself is label-heavy and doesn't constrain a choice or create a visible tradeoff. The exact phrasing "orderly intuitive" feels like prompt fulfillment; swapping it for "strategic" or "pattern-seeing" would not alter the story's logic. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is named and enacted: Lan rearranges carnival elements (notes, food sabotage, graffiti) to resist the investors. The action shapes the middle beats and her agency, but the exact verb is somewhat swappable with "coordinate" or "orchestrate." The ending turn (belief rather than further reorganization) shifts away from this action, so it drives tactics but not the closure itself. Present across beats, causally relevant, but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Graffiti appears in three beats: initial description, decoding the warning, and Lan's counter-message. The method matters: she "learned to read them like a second language" and the encoded warnings drive her urgency. However, the mechanics are vague (we don't see her encode or decode on the page), and the graffiti doesn't shape the closure—Old Man Vey's appearance does. Present and purposeful across beats, but the exact method (graffiti vs. oral network or coded gestures) is partly swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is vivid and essential: its floating instability mirrors the gentrification threat, its physical layout (bridges, vendor carts, hulls) supplies the surfaces for graffiti, and its performers and cooks become Lan's tactical resources. The setting is signaled in the opening line and returns in the final image ("the edge of the raft"). Removing the carnival afloat would require rewriting the entire conflict and closure. The perpetual revelry vs. corporate kiosks contrast drives the thematic stakes and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The privatization vote is mentioned as "the night before," creating urgency and anchoring the timeline. However, the clock doesn't tighten decisions on the page; Lan's tactics unfold in summary across an unspecified span, and the "night before" moment feels more like a frame than a live deadline that forces hard choices in real time. The timeframe is present and logically consistent, but it doesn't alter tactics or charge the closure with temporal pressure. Functional, but the exact timing is somewhat replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lan's desire to resist gentrification is clear and dramatized through her actions: reading graffiti, orchestrating sabotage, leaving counter-messages. The motivation is tied to her history ("her first twelve years here") and to the investors' threat to Old Man Vey and the deeds. Friction appears in her dual allegiance and the weight she carries, but the internal conflict between wanting to preserve the raft and the costs of resistance is more described than enacted in a pivotal choice. The motivation drives beats and informs closure, but the exact desire could be rephrased as "preserve community" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone blends hope (Lan's agency, the carnival's resilience) and desperation (cracks, hollowness, vultures circling) throughout. The opening sets the bittersweet mood ("dream half-remembered," "hollow laughter"), and the final beat delivers cautious hope ("for the first time, Lan believed it") tinged with the unresolved privatization vote. The tone modulates coherently under pressure and charges the final image, but the exact phrasing "hopeful desperation" is more emergent than structurally load-bearing; swapping it for "fragile defiance" would not break the story's logic. Coherent and purposeful, reaching the lower edge of essential.</comment>
