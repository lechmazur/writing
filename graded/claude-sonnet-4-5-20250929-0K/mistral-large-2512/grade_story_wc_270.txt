<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "evolve tradition" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her defiance reads coherent but monolithic—no visible cost between desire and fear appears on the page. The plant-voice ability is label-only until the unsealing; it constrains no prior choice. Lina's "what have you done?" arrives too late to test Mira's stance with relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Causal-Situational Hybrid; the unsealing decision lands on the page, but the closure unit lacks visible cost—Mira smiles and declares "Now we begin" without forfeiting a live option or facing immediate consequence. The three-night decoding happens off-page, eliding the pressure that would narrow her choices. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, penalty waived. The embryo's dissolution is told, not shown, flattening the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The volcanic springs supply sulfur scent, obsidian cracks, and mineral water that Mira traces and kneels beside, grounding her physically. The springs tremble during the unsealing, constraining the action spatially. The kite snagged on a dead pine and the amber-embedded embryo charge the closure image with recurring specificity. Micro-setting (obsidian, steam, mineral slickness) successfully replaces broad geography at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's choice to unseal the embryo—is signaled by mid-story but escalation is asserted ("the springs trembled") rather than dramatized through tactical narrowing. The Council's off-page threat declares external pressure without on-page test. The night of unsealing compresses the peak action into summary ("her hands pressed to the obsidian"), eliding the moment where refusal was still possible. One tightening (decoding → unsealing) is present but cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of autonomy versus institutional control emerges from Mira's defiance and the embryo's "destiny implanted in the earth," but the final image ("Now we begin") asserts rebirth as concept without specific cost or ambiguity. The kite's symbols and plant-whispers function as motifs that return at closure, reweighting prior material. The story resists easy moralism yet the ending's optimism ("the future unfolded like a kite catching the wind") softens the promised heresy without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature—tracing cracks, hearing plant-whispers, filtering exposition through her defiance—remains distinct and purposeful. Psychic distance stays close; no head-hopping. Lina's brief dialogue ("Grandmother, what have you done?") carries goal and subtext. Diction ("gnarled fingers," "coiled around her thoughts like steam") fits the focalizer's embodied attention. Minor rhythm monotony in the backstory paragraphs (repeated "She had" openings) does not obscure voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in paragraphs four and five: "The elders had called it a relic" / "why had this single life been preserved?" restates the mystery without added pressure. Template cadence in backstory ("She didn't tell Lina... She didn't tell her") flattens momentum. Figurative density ("lazy coils," "prickling at her skin like static," "coiled around her thoughts") clusters without muddle. The unsealing beat tells ("the water churned") rather than showing sequential action, reducing information density at the climax. −0.6 for loops/scaffold, minor artifact in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The insurgent-grandmother premise and plant-telepathy angle offer modest freshness, but the embryo-as-seed-of-rebirth and defiant-elder-versus-Council arc follow familiar post-apocalyptic templates without transformation through lived detail. The kite's cryptic script and the "destiny implanted" concept gesture at mystery without specific world logic or moral calculus that would make the choice non-obvious. The ending's optimism ("the future unfolded") retreats from the heresy stakes declared earlier, diluting boldness. Derivative Premise adjustment −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira decodes the kite, unseals the embryo, and refuses Council rules across three beats; her choices create the key turns. Early signal (first paragraph: "not supposed to be here"), beat involvement (decoding, unsealing, final stance), and closure linkage (she takes Lina's hand, declares "Now we begin") meet all three gates. Cost is asserted ("the Council would come") but not felt on the page, capping high-band entry. Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, three beats +1.4, cost abstract −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The embryo appears in paragraph six (late first third), is referenced during decoding, and dissolves at the unsealing—three touches across setup, development, and payoff gates. Its "destiny implanted in the earth" drives Mira's final choice, but the dissolution is told ("The embryo was gone, dissolved into the springs") rather than shown with visible consequence. Beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, late setup −0.3, summary-only climax −0.5, swappable (any relic would serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" is stated twice (paragraph six: "a destiny implanted in the earth itself"; final paragraph: "the embryo's destiny woven into the earth") but shapes stakes only as assertion—it does not constrain Mira's decoding tactics or alter on-page options. The concept charges the thematic close without visible cost. Setup gate met (paragraph six), closure linkage present (final paragraph), development gate weak (no middle choice turns on it). Causal pressure minimal +0.3, closure linkage +0.7, one beat +0.4, thematic echo without cost −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plant-telepathy is mentioned in paragraph four ("the plants had been speaking to her since she was a child") and returns at the unsealing ("her mind open to the whispers of the plants") and closure ("The plants were singing"). Three touches meet all gates, but the trait enables no on-page action with visible tradeoff—Mira does not struggle to interpret or refuse the whispers; it functions as atmospheric detail. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, ornamental (no cost or constraint) −1.0, label-only until closure −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unseal" drives the climax and redefines the world's options (Mira's act releases the embryo into the earth, forcing the Council's hand). Early signal (paragraph six: "what she had to do"), peak involvement (paragraph seven: "The night she unsealed the embryo"), and closure consequence (paragraph nine: embryo "seeping into the earth," Lina feels the hum). All three gates met. The unsealing itself is summary-told, reducing peak dramatization. Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, two beats +0.9, summary-only climax −0.6, irreplaceable +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The kite is found (paragraph three), its symbols decoded over three nights (paragraph six), and its message delivered at closure (paragraph eight: "its symbols now faded, its message delivered"). All three gates met. The decoding mechanics are told in one line ("tracing the curves and lines until her vision blurred") without shaping on-page attempts or costs. Lyric reprise (kite introduced early, returns faded at closure) reweights the mystery. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, one beat +0.4, summary-only development −0.6, lyric payoff +0.4, swappable method −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs anchor every scene: Mira kneels at the edge (paragraph two), the embryo rests "in the heart of the springs" (paragraph five), the springs tremble during unsealing (paragraph seven), and Lina finds Mira "beside the springs" at closure (paragraph eight). The obsidian, steam, and mineral water ground spatial choreography and constrain Mira's kneeling, tracing, and immersion. All three gates met. Causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, three beats +1.4, irreplaceable (only geothermal site fits embryo logic) +0.7, early signal +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During the reconstruction" is declared in paragraph two ("The Reconstruction Council") and implied in paragraph ten ("a crime against the Reconstruction"), but the timeframe does not tighten Mira's tactics—no ticking clock or visible urgency shapes her three-night decoding or the unsealing choice. Setup gate met, development and closure gates weak (time pressure is asserted, not felt). Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, swappable (any post-collapse era would serve) −0.6, no tactical constraint −0.8, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to evolve tradition with intent" is stated in paragraph eleven ("bending tradition to her will, shaping it like clay") and enacted through defiance of Council rules and the unsealing choice. The motivation drives two beats (initial defiance, unsealing) and charges the closure ("she knew the world would have no choice but to listen"). Friction between desire and cost is asserted ("The Council would come") but not dramatized with on-page consequence. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, two beats +0.9, cost abstract −0.5, stated more than shown −0.6.</comment>
