<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to find lost conversations is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her refusal of the forgery job establishes a moral line, but the trait "wilts near dishonesty" never constrains an on-page choice—she simply descends the stairs without visible cost or internal friction. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("her heart pounding with the certainty") and the final moment offers discovery without a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal chain (fragment → map → archives → staircase) but ends on threshold discovery rather than closure with cost. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly, and the drive lens reads as causal through the middle, but the ending offers setup for further action instead of a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. No cost is legible on the page at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Verdant Spire's glass domes, humidity, and skeletal plants establish atmosphere effectively. The archives' cracked dome and the preserved flower constrain Liora's path, and the hidden staircase charges the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the studio (workbench, floorboard, inkwell) floats without clear layout, and the broader city remains postcard description rather than a crucible that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early, and the map reconstruction creates one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is driven by discovery rather than agency under pressure; Liora solves a puzzle without trade-offs or visible prices that alter later tactics. The staircase revelation functions as a cliffhanger rather than a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of lost language and preserved memory circulates through the postal plate and Echo Vault, but "candor in small moments" never shapes stakes on the page—it remains an abstract claim. The forgery refusal gestures toward ethical calculus but doesn't pressure the dominant plot. The ending withholds insight; the staircase discovery offers setup, not a resonant answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent distance. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the oasis's final gift," "the weight of the moment") that reads slightly generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so character voice distinction cannot be tested. The prose maintains clarity but lacks a strong perceptual signature—Liora's noticing feels authorial rather than selective and biased.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is solid and spatial sequencing tracks, but several beats show template cadence: "She had heard stories... She had never believed them—until now" and "She had no memory... yet something about the fragment tugged at her." Figurative language in the opening ("sky the color of old bruises," "dried blood") establishes tone but borders on stock. Information density is moderate; some lines (the oasis backstory paragraph) slow momentum without advancing immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and Echo Vault premise offer fresh world-building, and the shredded-map mechanic adds specificity. However, the core arc—puzzle-solving discovery leading to a secret chamber—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "wilts near dishonesty" trait and "candor in small moments" concept remain ornamental rather than driving non-obvious choices. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from risk at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her reconstruction of the map drives the middle sequence. However, her choices trend toward puzzle-solving rather than decisions under competing pressure. The forgery refusal occurs off-page in backstory, and the final staircase discovery is reactive observation. Present in all three gates (setup, development, ending) but causal pressure and cost connection are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The postal plate fragment appears in the opening beat, prompts reflection on memory, and sits beside Liora as she works, but it does not constrain a choice or evolve in meaning. It functions as a catalyst for curiosity rather than a tool or charged object that alters tactics. Present in setup and mentioned in the middle third, but absent from the ending and carries no specific cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Candor in small moments" is never dramatized on the page. The forgery refusal is summarized in backstory, and the map reconstruction involves no honesty dilemma. The concept appears as thematic claim without shaping options or creating friction. Ornamental mention only; no beat involvement, no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is mentioned in the forgery backstory (trembling fingers) but does not constrain an on-page choice. The map work and archive exploration involve no dishonesty test, and the ending turn is discovery without ethical friction. Present in setup via backstory; no development or closure participation. Label-only use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reread" occurs twice: Liora rereads the map legend before deciding to visit the archives, which drives the second-half turn. The action is dramatized and necessary to the causal chain. Present in setup (implicit in map reconstruction), development (explicit map legend moment), and shapes the ending choice to descend. However, the final beat is discovery rather than a rereading that reweights meaning, so closure linkage is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded map occupies multiple beats (finding fragments, aligning compass rose and path, reconstructing half by nightfall) and the mechanics matter—her methodical assembly enables the archive discovery. Signaled early (beneath the floorboard), drives middle development (the legend line), and directly enables the ending staircase moment. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability is high (the exact method gates the plot). Slight deduction for late-stage summary ("by the time the sky darkened") that compresses the final assembly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Verdant Spire's greenhouse structure, toxic sky, and humidity establish atmosphere and the archives' oldest dome provides the staircase access. The setting supplies resources (the preserved flower display) and the city's layout (botanical garden ruins on the map) informs Liora's path. Present in all three gates and shapes one key turn (archive access), but does not constrain a difficult choice or charge the final image beyond spatial containment. Mid-band for functional but replaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the oasis dries" frames backstory (Year of the Last Rain postmark, the Last Bloom artifact) but does not create a live clock that tightens decisions. The one temporal marker—"by the time the sky darkened"—marks elapsed time without urgency. The dried-oasis condition enables the mystery but does not pressure Liora's choices on the page. Present in setup and thematic background; minimal development or closure impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to find where lost conversations go is stated in backstory reflection and drives Liora's choice to visit the archives and descend the staircase. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or visible costs. Present in setup (map discovery and tugging curiosity), development (legend interpretation), and ending (descent), but lacks friction between competing desires. Functional causal role without high specificity or felt cost.</comment>
