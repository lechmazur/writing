<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is established (stretching time before the end), and his final choice to whisper through the pane carries symbolic weight. However, the interiority remains abstract—"the weight of what he was about to do" and "bruised awe" are labels rather than embodied contradictions. The puppet-as-mirror realization ("It was like him") arrives cleanly but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would show competing impulses in action. The choice to hum feels more thematic than dramatized through credible internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors early (lighthouse, Elias, doomsday clock), accumulates symbolic objects (clock, puppet, pane), and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image (stillness, the puppet softening, the sea kind) reweights the opening dread with undeniable pressure and felt cost (Elias's decades of effort crystallized into one uncertain act). The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns, which fits the lens. One persistent constraint—the frozen clock hands—shapes the final image. Cost is legible in "didn't know if the lullaby would reach the right ears" and the persistent brokenness ("smile didn't mend").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: "jagged spit of rock," "cellar, buried under layers of salt and time," the beam flickering to life at closure. The pane of hush as micro-setting (glass pressed, fractures studied) constrains Elias's method and charges the final act. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's long familiarity. The body (trembling fingers, closed eyes, steady hands) anchors key beats. The final image—waves stilled, wind held—integrates setting into the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: soothe the world before its end (not save it). Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as deepening through the layering of objects and the cadence shift from adjustment to song. One meaningful tightening: "The doomsday clock ticked once, then stopped" narrows options and charges the final act. Agency is renunciation (letting go of control) with visible cost: uncertainty ("didn't know if the lullaby would reach"). The protagonist's choice—to whisper rather than turn back the clock again—drives closure. Coincidence does not resolve; the outcome remains open yet weighted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: decades of delaying the end reweighted into acceptance and care. The puppet, pane, and lullaby recur with shifting meaning; the final image (puppet softening, clock still, sea kind) offers a non-literal answer to "what if you let it end?" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the nested patterns and the whispered question across timelines. The protagonist's arc—from control to release—is inextricable from the thematic question. "Bruised awe" as stated mood risks label-speak, but the imagery (stillness, hum, held breath) earns resonance at closure without summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is present (decades of study, trembling not from cold). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at closure (eyes closed, breath slow). Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("vouchsafed," "bruised awe") in a way that reads more literary than character-specific, but remains legible. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to judge. The prose as character test is met softly: syntax reflects a contemplative, worn mind. Under peak stress (the hum, the glass shivering), compression works without obscuring interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly strong: varied syntax, clear action order, high information density in key beats. However, mild paraphrase loops appear ("The doomsday clock ticked once, then stopped" / "The doomsday clock's hands dissolved") and filter stacks cluster in reflective passages ("had kept it, though he couldn't say why" / "didn't know if the world would end"). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("bruised awe filling the air, thick as salt"). The opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor scaffold ("Now, as dusk bled") and one conceptual restatement ("quiet, like a held hand, like a promise" after "quiet") nudge the score down without breaking momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of doomsday clock, puppet, and pane of hush into a lullaby-as-soothing premise is specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (acceptance over heroism) avoids template arcs. However, the nested-patterns-across-time frame and the lighthouse-keeper-adjusting-reality setup echo familiar spec-fic motifs without full transformation; the protagonist's solitary vigil and the ambiguous open ending trend toward safety-middle choices. The final image earns its weight, but the path feels more assembled than inevitable. Risk-taking is present (quiet closure, refusal to "save") but does not radically heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias (doomsday clock adjuster) is present throughout and his choice to stop adjusting and instead whisper shapes the closure. Setup by paragraph one, development via the decades-long adjustment habit, payoff when he lets the clock stop. His decision alters tactics (from delay to acceptance) with cost (uncertainty). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, cost +0.4 = base ~7.6. Minor swappability (another solitary keeper could fill the role with edits) −0.4, ornamental summary of "decades turning back" −0.3 = 6.9 → 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Puppet head appears in three beats: washed ashore years ago, the realization ("It was like him"), and placed against the pane at closure. Setup early, development via the mirror insight, payoff when it fits the fractures "like a key" and softens. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6 = base ~6.6. Swappability (any broken relic could serve) −0.4 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pane of hush introduced mid-story (cellar discovery), studied for years (nested patterns), and used at closure to transmit the lullaby. Development via study, payoff strong. Late first appearance (second paragraph cluster) −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost +0.3 = base ~6.0. Summary-only study ("spent years studying") −0.2 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" as attribute appears in the puppet description and implicitly in Elias ("like him"). Setup via puppet label, payoff when the smile softens without mending. Early signal +0.5, one beat (puppet realization) +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, cost +0.3 = base ~5.1. Label-only ("something beautiful and flawed") without action constraint −0.0 net (already low). 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" (to whisper the secret through the pane) is the climactic action. Setup via the "if he vouchsafed" sentence, payoff when he begins to hum. Late first appearance (fourth paragraph) −0.4, one beat (the hum) +0.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = base ~7.9. Swappability (could be "spoke" or "sang" with minor edits) −0.6 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Through nested patterns" introduced with the pane's fractures, studied for years, and active at closure when sound seeps through. Setup paragraph three, development via glimpsed timelines, payoff as transmission method. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = base ~6.0. Summary-only middle ("spent years studying") −0.0 net (already mid). 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse at dusk anchors the entire scene. Setup paragraph one, development via cellar and beam, payoff when the beam flickers to life "not to warn, but to cradle." Early signal +0.8, three beats (opening, cellar, beam flickers) +1.4, causal pressure +0.6 (provides resources: pane, isolation), closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6 = base ~7.4. Minor postcard moments (dusk bled into horizon) −0.3 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" as timeframe is poetic but vague. "Final ripple" appears twice (mid-story and end), bracketing the action. Setup via opening "three minutes to midnight," payoff when "the last ripple...settled." Early signal +0.4, one beat (final ripple lands) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8 = base ~4.6. Untracked elapsed time and metaphoric rather than tactical pressure −0.0 net (already capped low). Lyric reprise lifts slightly: +0.8 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" is stated mid-story and enacted at closure. Setup via the goal sentence, payoff via the hum and its transmission. Late first appearance (paragraph four) −0.3, two beats (goal stated, hum enacted) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5 (uncertainty) = base ~7.5. Told more than dramatized with friction (motivation is declared rather than shown conflicted) −0.6 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" as tone label appears once explicitly ("bruised awe filling the air") but the mood (melancholy wonder, quiet dread softening into care) is coherent across beats and modulates at closure (stillness, the sea kind). Setup via opening dread, development via study and realization, payoff via held breath and kindness. Early signal (implicit) +0.4, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0 = base ~5.8. Label-only phrase without embodied texture −0.3, but strong tonal consistency and modulation under pressure +1.0 = 6.5.</comment>
