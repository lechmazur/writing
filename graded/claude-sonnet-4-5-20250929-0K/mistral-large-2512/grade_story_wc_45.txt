<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior texture is established—forgiving skeptic who stays rather than flees—and her choice to return to the garden drives the action. The yearning and her bone-setting motivation are asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the progression reads more as declaration than embodied struggle. The changeling child's "smile too old for its face" leans on stock phrasing. Her final choice to take the child's hand feels inevitable but the internal cost or renunciation that forecloses another path is not made visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Lena, garden behind hedge maze, after the substitute body. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the teeth, the map, the maze all deepen rather than narrow causally, and the ending crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "together, they walked back" with the implication that Lena can now keep the changeling). Cost is felt—she accepts the strangeness the town cannot—but the phrasing "some constellations were meant to be seen only by those who knew where to look" borders on stating the theme rather than embodying it. The closure lands cleanly under the lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden is sensuously specific ("damp earth and something older," "flowers bloomed in colors no one had names for") and the hedge maze, apple tree, and flat stone recur with purpose. The silver-veined map and the maze's shifting paths constrain Lena's movement and charge the final image. Minor slip: "polished river stones" for the child's eyes is generic. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find the changeling, set the town's wound. Pressure accumulates through the discovery of the second tooth, the map's appearance, and the maze navigation, with one meaningful deepening when the child offers the third tooth and Lena understands her role. The ending reconfigures her stance—she can keep what the town could not—but the coincidental appearance of the map (teeth vanish, map appears) edges toward convenience rather than earned agency. Cost is legible in her acceptance of the child and the town's ignorance, scaled appropriately to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness, wholeness from brokenness, seeing beyond fear—emerges from the teeth, bone-setting ritual, and the contrast between Lena and the town. The ending image "some constellations were meant to be seen only by those who knew where to look" reweights the premise without overt moralizing, though it leans close. Subtext operates in the child's "smile too old for its face" and the garden's sighing release. The story resists tidy binaries and earns its nostalgic charge through the specifics of the changeling myth and Lena's particular stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays consistently with Lena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "shrewdly innocent question: *What if?*" and "bone-setting rituals of the old world" anchor her worldview. Minor register drift: "the kind that lived in the spaces between breaths" and "letting the nostalgia of it wash over her" edge toward elevated diction that doesn't quite fit a woman kneeling in dirt. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and goal-driven. The child's "Because they didn't know how to keep me... But you do" advances the final turn cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty ("the air smelled of damp earth and something older, something that made her skin prickle"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She knelt beside... She placed the teeth... She followed it..." clusters identical stems without pattern-teaching (−0.4). "Bloated" for the substitute body is specific; "polished river stones" for eyes is stock. No paraphrase loops, but the phrase "the kind that" recurs three times across the piece without payoff. Overwriting is minimal and figurative language is controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The changeling-tooth-bone-setting synthesis is purposeful and the forgiving-skeptic protagonist offers a non-obvious angle on the changeling myth. The garden as a "cleft in certainty" and the teeth-to-map transformation are fresh inflections. However, the hedge maze, secret garden, and "child who wasn't quite right" are familiar fantasy tropes executed competently but not transformed through highly specific world logic or moral calculus. The story commits fully to its premise but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena (forgiving skeptic) is named early and her decision to stay after the body is found, return to the garden, and take the child's hand all drive key turns. Her skepticism is asserted ("doubted the sky was blue until she saw it for herself") but the forgiving trait is more operative—she accepts the changeling and the strangeness. The trait shapes two beats (staying, returning) and the closure. Mid-band: present across beats and at closure, but the skepticism half is more label than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in paragraph two (early signal), Lena handles it ("tooth in her pocket"), finds a second tooth that glows, and the two teeth vanish to become a map. The third tooth in the child's palm at closure recharges the motif with reweighted meaning ("glowing like a tiny sun"). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (the teeth enable the map and the final meeting), and closure linkage. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because the teeth could theoretically be other tokens.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The garden is explicitly named "a cleft in certainty" and the phrase "shrewdly innocent question: *What if?*" echoes it. The concept shapes Lena's stance—she stays when others would flee—and the final acceptance of ambiguity ("The town would never know the truth"). It's woven into two beats (garden as uncertainty, final constellation line) and influences her tactics (returning to the garden, whispering unknown words). Lyric reprise with thematic weight; not quite causal pressure but shapes the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears once as a descriptor for the garden's question, not Lena's trait. It's a label without visible constraint or enabling action tied to Lena's choices. Late and ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Yearn" is named explicitly in paragraph three ("She yearned for answers") and implicitly drives her return to the garden and her pursuit of the changeling. It motivates two beats (returning, following the map) and the ending's acceptance. The yearning is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and could be swapped for "search" or "seek" with minor edits. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bone-setting is mentioned twice: "bone-setting rituals of the old world still held power" and "The bone-setting wasn't just about healing; it was about making whole what had been broken." It's asserted as Lena's method but the mechanics are abstract—she places teeth and whispers words. It shapes her understanding at closure but does not constrain her attempts or alter tactics visibly. Thematic participation without mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The secret garden hidden behind the hedge maze is introduced in the opening line (early signal), provides the apple tree and teeth (resources), the maze shifts and guides Lena's path (constrains movement), and houses the changeling at its center (closure participation). The setting is handled across four beats and directly shapes the outcome. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because the maze's mechanics (shifting paths) are asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" anchors the opening and motivates Lena's return to the garden. The body discovery is referenced twice (paragraphs one and four) and sets up the mystery that drives her. It's present at setup and primes the closure (finding the real changeling), but does not tighten decisions in the middle beats. Two-gate presence with thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" is named explicitly in paragraph five and again in the final line. It drives Lena's choice to perform the ritual and accept the changeling, and the ending image ("some constellations were meant to be seen only by those who knew where to look") reprises it with cost. Lyric bracket with closure charge, but the middle beats don't dramatize friction between this want and competing costs. Two gates with strong thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone blends nostalgia (the old stories, bone-setting rituals, "nostalgia of it wash over her") with innovation (flowers in unnamed colors, the silver-veined map). The tone modulates subtly—quiet wonder at the garden, urgency in the maze, acceptance at the end—and charges the final image with both loss and renewal. Coherent through turns, but the innovation element is less developed than the nostalgic; the balance tilts toward one pole. Purposeful and consistent, supports closure.</comment>
