<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's "confidently uncertain" trait is primarily asserted through narrator description rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The contingent relationships with Elias and others are told rather than shown constraining her choices under pressure. The final choice to "decide what to keep" arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page; we see intention but not consequence. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("fragile thing," "performance she maintained") and therapy-speak ("contingent relationships") rather than character-particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals a Hybrid lens (causal backstory + accumulative atmosphere) but never delivers a clear closure unit. The ending offers readiness to edit ("decide what to keep") but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—Liora stands, brushes dust, and declares intent without altering options or forfeiting a path. The three-year mistake and misinterpreted signal are exposition rather than on-page causality; the anomaly functions as atmospheric dressing without constraining a present choice. Orientation is clear, but the closure test fails: no before/after is legible with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and dried fountain are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Liora's attention (the nib's shifting symbols, the ozone-and-bread smell). The plaza and fountain anchor spatial choreography cleanly. However, neither the anomaly nor the environment constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain atmospheric rather than tactical. The pen is handled twice but does not alter an on-page decision, capping the score below 7.5 under the micro-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—correcting the town's corrupted memory—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Liora moves from doubt to resolve without obstacle, cost, or foreclosed path. The anomaly's time-blurring could create pressure but instead functions as excuse ("a misstep today could be erased tomorrow"), deflating stakes. Elias's encouragement is supportive rather than oppositional. The ending intent ("decide what to keep") promises escalation but does not deliver it within the text.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of mutable truth and gardening metaphors (seeds, weeds, soil, thresh) recurs but remains abstract; no specific on-page action embodies "unbending" or "threshing meaning." The closing line "All she had to do was decide what to keep" is a theme statement rather than a resonant non-literal answer. The piece gestures toward complexity (history as draft, contingent relationships) but does not dramatize tension between competing goods or unavoidable harms—doubt is ventilated, not wrestled with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric-fantasy register with controlled diction ("bruise-colored smear," "watercolors," "ozone and fresh bread"). Distance remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Elias's dialogue is brief and functional, lacking distinct idiom from Liora's interiority. Minor filter-verb reliance ("thought of," "knew") is voice-appropriate. Perceptual signature is selective (the pen's nib, the anomaly's pulse) and character-specific, supporting the celestial-interpreter role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breaks. Sentence openings show variety (noun, prepositional, dialogue, action). Minor scaffold appears: "some truths were better left half-formed" and "maybe the truth isn't something we carve in stone" both assert the same idea without added pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2). The pen description recurs cleanly across beats. One figurative cluster in the opening paragraph (moon, shimmer, watercolors, draft, red pen) reads as atmospheric rather than overwriting. Information density is moderate; lines often do one job rather than multiple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The gravitational-anomaly-plus-celestial-signal premise is a recognizable SFF template (reality distortion + specialist interpreter). The "history as draft" and "editing memory" metaphors are familiar. Execution is competent but does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus, lived occupational detail, or a turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. The ending's "decide what to keep" resolve is a median choice—neither bold risk nor fresh synthesis. No proximity issues with famous lines, but the piece reads as fulfilling a prompt rather than pursuing a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her role (celestial signal interpreter) frames the premise. However, her interpretive work is backstory (the misinterpreted signal three years ago); no on-page interpretation or signal-reading constrains a present choice. She observes, reflects, and declares intent but does not make a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is ornamental (standing, brushing dust). Late-penalty and swappability (another specialist could fill the role) apply. Causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fountain pen appears in three beats: pocket carry, edge-sitting examination, and final pocket return. Setup by first third, development via the tactile examination and memory of its bleeding-ink behavior, and present in the ending beat (slipped back into pocket). However, it does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure—Liora pockets it and stands, but the pen's presence does not alter her resolve. Specificity (exotic nib, shifting symbols, living ink) is vivid. The object is handled but not causally active in a decision. Lyric reprise with moderate specificity; causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Editing history is the thematic frame ("history was a draft," "she was the editor") and motivates Liora's three-year guilt. Setup is clear; the concept recurs in metaphor (red pen, unbend, thresh). However, no on-page editing occurs—no memory is corrected, no signal re-interpreted, no history altered within the text. Development and payoff are thematic echo rather than plot action. The concept shapes stakes abstractly but does not change options on the page. Swappable with "repairing the past" or similar; specific diction (draft, editor) adds texture without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is asserted twice: as narrator summary ("Her confidence was a fragile thing, a performance") and in Liora's question "What if I make it worse?" Setup is present; the trait does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The ending resolve ("decide what to keep") implies confidence, but uncertainty does not force a tradeoff—Elias's encouragement dissolves doubt without friction. Label-only without visible cost on the page. Development and closure gates missing. Late-penalty does not apply (present early), but swappability and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears once in dialogue ("Maybe it's time to unbend a little") and metaphorically in the opening ("edges unbent by certainty"). Setup is present; no on-page unbending action occurs. The concept is thematic rather than physical or tactical—no stiff rule is relaxed, no rigid stance altered with visible cost. Easily swappable with "soften," "yield," or "let go." Does not drive a turn or redefine options. Closure participation is metaphorical (pen description echo) rather than causal. Ornamental and summary-only use; causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Contingent relationships are described in exposition ("leaning on the baker's steady hands when hers shook, trusting the librarian's sharp eyes") and demonstrated once when Elias sits beside her and offers encouragement. Setup by first third; the method enables Liora's confidence but does not mechanically shape an on-page attempt or alter tactics under pressure. Elias's dialogue supports but does not constrain or complicate her choice. The librarian is mentioned but absent. Development is thin; closure participation is absent (Liora acts alone in the final beat). Swappable with "through mentorship" or "through allies."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is signaled in the opening line, described vividly across beats (bruise-colored smear, pulsing, time-blurring, ozone smell), and present in the ending beat (pulses again as Liora stands). Setup, development, and closure gates are met. However, it functions as atmospheric pressure rather than tactical constraint—the anomaly does not limit Liora's options, supply a resource, or force a choice. The time-blur is asserted to make "cause and effect blur" but this deflates stakes rather than tightening them. Specificity is high; causal pressure and cost connection are absent. Lyric reprise without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("three years since she'd planted the wrong seeds") is established early and provides backstory pressure. The piece takes place in a single continuous present scene; no clock tightens decisions or alters tactics within that window. The three-year gap is causal setup, not a live timer. Development is thin (past tense reflection); closure does not hinge on elapsed time. The anomaly's time distortion could create urgency but instead offers escape ("a misstep today could be erased tomorrow"). Present but not pressing; swappable with any regret-laden interval.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" is signaled via the phrase "thresh it from the chaff" and supported by the gardening/editing metaphors throughout. Setup is clear; Liora's desire to extract truth from error frames her guilt and intent. However, the threshing is declared rather than dramatized—no on-page process separates wheat from chaff, no choice demonstrates friction between meaning and noise. Development is metaphorical; closure participation is the intent to "decide what to keep," which echoes the motivation without enacting it. Told-only with thematic friction; no visible cost tied to the desire on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strange comfort appears in Elias's "smile, his face creasing with strange comfort" and is threaded through the tone: the anomaly's eerie beauty, the ozone-and-bread scent, the stray-cats-in-fountain domesticity amid reality distortion. Setup by first third; the tone modulates across beats (chill, pulse, fog, warmth) and charges the final image (anomaly pulses as Liora stands, weight "familiar and strange"). Coherent through turns; the odd-cozy register supports the theme of mutable history. Does not escalate with pressure—tone remains stable rather than intensifying. Closure linkage is present but not transformative; the "familiar and strange" echo reinforces rather than reweights. Strong lyric resonance without dramatic turn.</comment>
