<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to chase deleted files is clear and rooted in personal disillusionment, but her internal landscape remains largely cerebral—"brightly attentive" reads as label rather than embodied contradiction. The archive work gives her investigative texture, yet key emotional beats (discovering the video, choosing to copy it) lack the contradictory impulse that would show genuine struggle. The lie about the patch is mentioned but never complicates a present choice with visible cost. Elias exists only in summary; no on-page relationship pressures her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when promptly and follows a causal chain: patch → numbers → hidden folder → video → decision to copy. The escalation narrows from mystery to revelation, and Lena's final act (copying the file, choosing a side) constitutes a Decisive Change with implied professional and personal cost. However, the cost remains conceptual—no on-page consequence materializes, and the video reveal lands as exposition rather than a dramatized confrontation that alters tactics mid-scene. The lens reads Causal with a late tilt toward Situational (stance crystallization), held adequately but not tightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The archive setting is vividly established with "quiet static of forgotten data" and "digital graveyard," and server-room geography grounds the video. Sensory details (frayed patch edges, grainy footage, static) are filtered through Lena's investigative focus. The patch and terminal constrain choice by supplying evidence, but the archive itself remains atmospheric backdrop—it does not force a tactical trade-off or supply a resource at the closure beat. Micro-setting (desk drawer, terminal) does light work without charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what Nexis hides—is signaled early and tightens through the numbers pattern to the video discovery. The video revelation raises personal danger and forces Lena's choice to copy the file, a meaningful escalation that narrows options. Yet the final turn feels passive: she watches footage, then decides; no on-page complication (system alert, observer, conflicting evidence) tests her commitment in real time. The cost is asserted ("digging further would put her in danger") but not dramatized—no trade-off between career, safety, or conflicting loyalty plays out on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—corporate erasure versus individual memory—emerges organically from archive work and Project Echo without overt moralizing until "the archive wasn't just a record of the past—it was a battleground," which borders on theme-statement. The patch and numbers recur with shifting meaning (prank → evidence → key), and "Echoes of the Forgotten" song title resonates with the premise. The final image (choosing a side, numbers in transfer log) offers a charged reprise but leans toward symbolic convenience—the 4-7-11 return feels planted rather than inevitable. No single particular (injury, conversation, physical constraint) anchors the emotional cost in scene texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Lena's perceptual signature (scanning profiles, "chasing something that refused to be found") establishes investigative idiom. Elias's video monologue delivers key exposition cleanly, though "Nexis is erasing people… rewriting history" reads slightly on-the-nose for a whispered confession. Psychic distance holds, but narrative certainty wobbles: Lena "knew better" and "suspected" claims confidence the text hasn't yet dramatized. Diction stays consistent except for one slip: "brightly attentive" feels externally imposed rather than voice-organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm, and opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most lines advance mystery or character—but scaffold phrases recur: "the truth was," "she needed to know," "it all made sense now" function as expository hinges rather than scene texture. Template cadence appears in the numbers-listing paragraph ("In timestamps, in user IDs, even in…"), which stalls momentum. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, and technical detail (server logs, metadata) reads plausible. Figurative language (digital graveyard, static, echoes) remains coherent but leans decorative in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cold-case + corporate-coverup premise is familiar, and the execution follows expected beats: clue → pattern → hidden file → revelation → moral choice. The numbers motif (4-7-11) and patch anchor specificity, but their integration feels manufactured—coordinates, song lyrics, and transfer logs all echo the sequence without causal variation. The video monologue delivers the conspiracy via tell rather than a fresh structural angle. Lena's arc (idealism → disillusionment → defiance) is legible but predictable; no risk-taking structural choice or non-obvious moral calculus transforms the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena's role as corporate memory keeper frames her access to the archive and motivates her investigation. Her choices—lying about the patch, digging into hidden folders, copying the video—drive two key beats (lie, final decision). However, her occupation supplies permission more than constraint; no on-page friction (audit, supervisor check, system lockout) tests her keeper status at the closure. Present early, shapes middle action, and participates in ending (transfer log), meeting two-of-three gates and causal involvement, but swappable with "archivist" or "data analyst" without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The patch is handled twice (desk drawer inspection, final mention after video), but both instances are reflective rather than tactical. It arrives via anonymous mail and supplies the 4-7-11 sequence, framing the mystery, yet Lena never uses it—no comparison with server records, no forensic detail that changes her approach. Present early, returns in thought during the video discovery, but does not constrain a mid-scene choice or charge the final image. Functional setup with weak development and no payoff action; the patch could be a note or email without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The missing-persons cold case (Elias vanished five years ago) shapes the dominant stake and drives every beat: Lena's search, the numbers pattern, the hidden folder, and the video revelation. The case reframes at closure from "walked away" to "erased by Project Echo," with Lena's decision to expose it. Present from paragraph two, drives investigation tactics (archive searches, metadata checks), and the video transforms understanding. However, the case is singular—no second victim or on-page complication diversifies the investigation, and the final act (copying a file) is generic whistleblowing rather than case-specific tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears once as narrative label in paragraph six, describing Lena's mental state. No on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice—she never misses a detail due to hyper-focus, nor does sharp attention create a tradeoff (overlooking emotion, alienating a contact). The trait does not recur or shape the video discovery or file-copying decision. Label-only, no causal pressure, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lena lies to her supervisor about the patch, claiming it is a personal keepsake. This deception is mentioned in paragraph six and establishes her willingness to bend rules, priming her final choice to copy evidence. However, the lie never complicates later action—no follow-up question, no risk of discovery that forces a tactical pivot. Present early, aligns with motivation, and thematically echoes her closing defiance, but the act itself is summary-only and does not drive a distinct on-page beat. Swappable with "withheld information" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The recurring numbers (4-7-11) appear in six contexts: patch, timestamps, user IDs, metadata, satellite coordinates, distress signal frequency, song lyrics, hidden folder label, and transfer log. The sequence is signaled in paragraph five, drives Lena's search method (scanning for the pattern), and unlocks the hidden folder, a causal middle beat. The numbers return in the transfer log at closure, recharging prior mentions. However, their mechanics remain decorative—why 4-7-11 encodes Project Echo is never explained, and the sequence does not impose a constraint (wrong order fails, time pressure) that alters Lena's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting supplies the digital graveyard metaphor, grants Lena access to deleted files and server logs, and houses the hidden folder that contains the video. The archive's layered structure (oldest layer = 4-7-11 folder) enables the discovery beat. Lena's memory-keeper role depends on this exact setting; no other venue (police database, personal files) would provide the same access and stakes. Present from the opening line, shapes search tactics (metadata scans, server logs), and the transfer-log action at closure occurs within the archive. The environment does not impose a live constraint (time limit, observer, system alert) at the final beat, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears as a timeframe label but does not structure the narrative clock. The story spans an unspecified investigation period ("last three years") with the final night marked, yet no on-page ticking deadline pressures Lena's moves. The song "Echoes of the Forgotten" is mentioned once as thematic color but does not pace action or return to charge the closure. Time remains vague and untethered; removing this phrase would not alter any choice or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's desire "to know where the deleted files go" is dramatized early (paragraph eight), drives her archive deep-dive, and escalates when the video reveals Project Echo erases people, not just data. This motivation fuels two key beats: the hidden-folder search and the decision to copy the video despite danger. The friction between curiosity and professional risk is asserted ("she should stop") but not tested on the page—no moment where safety tempts her to quit. Present early, shapes middle and ending choices, with cost implied (choosing a side) but not yet paid. Essential to structure; no generic substitute works.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone of sensed absence is established through "quiet static," "digital graveyard," "echoes," and "silence swallowed him whole," creating a coherent atmosphere of loss and erasure. The tone modulates slightly—investigative focus in the middle, urgency during video discovery, contemplative weight at closure—without breaking coherence. The final image ("weight of the truth settling over her") sustains the absence motif, though it tilts abstract rather than image-specific. Tone charges theme but does not impose a tactical constraint or shift dramatically under peak pressure; it remains a consistent wash rather than a pressure instrument.</comment>
