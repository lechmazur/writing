<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is textured through his relationship with the death certificate error and the poison label, but his moment-to-moment choices lack urgency—he collects and observes but rarely faces contradictory impulses that force visible tradeoffs. The woman who appears briefly offers thematic echo but doesn't apply pressure that alters his stance; she vanishes without cost. The final moment ("he didn't feel the need to run from it") gestures toward Earned Stasis but the renunciation feels declared rather than earned by prior causal friction. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, crouching in muck) yet his transformation lacks the tight causal throughline needed for the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established cleanly (port, containers, post-death-certificate). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered images (graffiti, mudflats, scratched names) and the final Daniel Mercer callback reweights the opening premise. However, the closure unit—"Maybe some histories weren't meant to be found—only layered"—leans toward abstract moralizing rather than an on-page image with felt cost; the protagonist's stance crystallizes through reflection more than dramatized choice. The lack of a visible forfeit or cost-bearing action at the ending beat keeps this mid-band despite the coherent accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered (fluorescent glow, diesel and low tide, graffiti layers, mudflats at low tide) and functions as micro-setting that constrains Elias's search patterns. Tidal rhythm provides recurring environmental pressure and the woman's appearance on a container edge weaves setting into character encounter. The final scratched inscription ties setting directly to the closure image, charging it with prior detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout and sensory selection (rust, salt, muck) reflects urgency without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—searching for "the seams where reality frayed"—is signaled early and sustained. The encounter with the woman offers a micro-turn (revealing shared quest) but Elias's agency remains observational; he doesn't face a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The tide "coming in" at the end supplies atmospheric pressure but does not force a decision with visible tradeoff. One tightening deepening is visible (the scratched name reframes his search) yet the protagonist's passivity and lack of on-page forfeit cap escalation credit under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—erased histories, identity as layered palimpsest—emerges organically through containers, graffiti, the Forget-Me-Not label, and the woman's claim that "names are just labels we outgrow." The final image ("only layered, like the containers themselves") offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights the search premise. However, the closing line edges toward stating the theme ("the truth became something new") rather than letting the scratched name carry full resonant weight. The abstract philosophizing slightly undercuts the earned particulars (label, certificate, woman's tune) that precede it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is stable and textured with lyric specificity ("leaf caught in a storm," "ghosts," "cathedral"). POV modesty holds: Elias infers but does not claim certainty beyond his vantage. The woman's brief dialogue ("Names are just labels we outgrow") carries subtext and her speech rhythm feels distinct from the narrator's internal register. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during high-pressure beats (crouching in muck, touching the scratched letters). No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift and figurative language (labyrinth, cathedral, magpie) enriches without overloading most beats. The "prying at the book's spine, as if the words might still be legible" is vivid and propulsive. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "half-remembered, half-erased" echoes "the rough, frayed edges of things half-remembered" within close proximity, and "just like his" repeats structure in adjacent lines. The closing paragraph edges toward abstract summary ("one story atop another, until the truth became something new") that slightly dulls momentum. No major artifact patterns but enough minor density slips to prevent 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The death certificate error as inciting premise and the Forget-Me-Not label as talisman offer fresh synthesis; the container maze as externalized memory archive feels specific rather than generic. The woman's humming the mother's tune and her vanishing/reappearance as inscription provides an eerie, non-obvious turn. Yet the core emotional arc—searching for lost memories amid layered histories—trends toward familiar territory without a decisive transformation that makes the final stance feel inevitable rather than chosen for thematic neatness. Risk is present (lyric accumulation, quiet ending) but the piece stops short of bold irreversibility.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (death certificate error survivor) is present throughout and his search frames every beat. He collects stories, examines the label, encounters the woman, and touches the scratched name at closure. However, his choices are primarily observational; he does not make a decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The final moment ("he didn't feel the need to run") is a stance shift but feels declared rather than earned by a prior causal fork. Setup clear, middle activity present, ending linkage present but passive—fits two-of-three gate model with lyric reprise, eligible mid-5s to low-6s, but swappability friction (another seeker archetype could fill the role with minor edits) and lack of causal pressure lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The poison bottle label appears in three distinct beats: pocketed early, handled and traced by the woman mid-story, and implicitly reweighted by the final layered-histories realization. Its name ("Forget-Me-Not Elixir") is ironically charged and the woman's recognition ("How poetic") adds meaning. However, the label does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as talisman and thematic anchor but remains largely passive. Setup strong, development present (woman traces it), closure linkage implicit but not causally active. Eligible for ~6.0 under two-gate model; lyric resonance and specificity ("the only thing he had left of his mother") lift slightly within band, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (another keepsake could serve) cap higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Erased histories (core concept) shapes stakes from the opening ("if the world could misplace a life") and drives Elias's search tactics (collecting fragments, examining mudflat objects, layering stories). The woman embodies the same quest, and the Daniel Mercer inscription at closure reweights the premise—identities and histories are layered, not recovered. The concept is dramatized through action (crouching in muck, stitching conversations) and the final image makes it undeniable. Setup early, middle beats constrained by it (he filters reality through this lens), closure explicitly reprices it. Three gates met with strong causal and thematic pressure; specificity and irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The attribute "filters reality differently" is stated early ("Elias had learned to filter reality differently") and shown through his seeing "layers" where others see rust. It enables his notebook collection and magpie behavior. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it remains a perceptual label that justifies his quest without forcing tradeoffs. Setup clear, middle activity present (he collects and stitches), but no on-page moment where filtering differently forecloses an option or exacts a price. Two-of-three gate eligibility with label-only friction; lacks causal pressure for higher band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Layer" as action (required element) manifests throughout: Elias layers fragments in his notebook, the containers layer graffiti ("some fresh, some faded into the metal like ghosts"), and the final realization frames histories as "layered, like the containers themselves, one story atop another." The action is present in at least three beats and charges the closure image decisively. However, the verb itself could be replaced with "accumulate" or "overlay" without structural break—swappability friction. Setup early, middle beats involve it (stitching conversations), closure image reprices it. Three gates met with strong thematic integration but moderate causal necessity; eligible mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories (method) is signaled early ("He collected fragments of overheard conversations like a magpie, stitching them together in his notebook") and demonstrated through three examples (dockworker, sailor, child). The method shapes his search tactics and the woman's parallel quest (stories "written on the walls of the containers") reinforces it. However, the method does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elias collects without friction or failure. Setup clear, middle beats show mechanics, ending implicitly rewards the method (layered histories). Three gates with moderate causal work; lacks visible tradeoff for higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth is present throughout and directly pressures choices: high tide turns containers into islands, low tide reveals mudflat objects Elias examines, and the woman sits on a container edge where the scratched inscription later appears. The setting supplies resources (graffiti as stories) and constraints (tidal rhythm dictates his search). Micro-setting (body in muck, water lapping) alters tactics beat-by-beat. Setup immediate, middle beats constrain action, closure image (scratched metal, tide coming in) is charged by prior spatial detail. Three gates met with strong causal and atmospheric pressure; specificity and irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm (timeframe) is referenced explicitly ("The tides dictated his rhythm") and shown through high tide/low tide beats that shape when and where Elias can search. The tide "coming in" at closure supplies atmospheric pressure. However, time does not tighten a decision with visible cost or impose a deadline that alters tactics; the rhythm remains descriptive mood rather than active clock. Setup present, middle description of tidal effects, ending mentions tide but without urgency. Two-of-three gate eligibility; lacks causal pressure and deadline constraint for higher band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of memories" is stated explicitly and dramatized through Elias's crouching in muck, prying at waterlogged books, and collecting fragments. The label and his inability to recall his mother's face embody the desire. However, the motivation does not face on-page friction or conflict with a competing want; Elias pursues it without visible cost until the final passive acceptance. Setup clear, middle beats show goal-directed action, closure reprices the goal (memories are layered, not found) with conceptual cost but no felt forfeit. Three gates met with moderate dramatization; lack of contradictory pressure caps higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone of "nameless identity" coheres through the death certificate error, the woman's claim that "names are just labels we outgrow," and the final layered-histories image. Mood is elegiac and searching, modulating appropriately (trembling hands early, quiet acceptance at end). The tone charges the final image (Daniel Mercer scratched into metal) and reweights the opening premise. However, the tone remains largely static—melancholic throughout—without sharp modulation under pressure. Setup immediate, middle consistency strong, closure image charged by tone. Three gates met with thematic coherence but limited dynamic range; eligible mid-6s.</comment>
