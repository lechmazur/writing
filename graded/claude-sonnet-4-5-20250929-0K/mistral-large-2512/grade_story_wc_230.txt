<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—cultivating safety versus confronting truth—act simultaneously on the page. Her involuntary truthfulness drives concrete choices (pressing the eye to her socket, burying it) with visible costs. The dream sequence and final stance crystallization feel earned by prior causality, though the orchard fox moment reads slightly ornamental. Embodied emotion is strong ("her stomach tightening," "hands shaking"), and the trajectory from isolation to accepting "the storm" forecloses her safety-in-silence path with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Mira buries the eye and accepts that "safety wasn't in silence...It was in the storm," a stance crystallization that forecloses her prior path with visible cost (her fear remains, psychological walls dismantled). The lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the eye discovery → testing → dream → burial sequence tightens causally, while sensory and thematic density builds to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly (ravine orchard, post-empathy-virus isolation, truffle foraging). One meaningful deepening occurs when the eye amplifies rather than occludes truth, forcing the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard constrains Mira's choices throughout: its isolation gifts safety, its storm-worn earth hides the eye, and the burial site charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her priorities ("damp loam," "gnarled roots," "branches groaned like a living thing"). The ravine's slick paths and the antique glass eye as tactile object recur with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the final image of Mira standing in the orchard after burial crystallizes setting as both constraint and answer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety versus confronting enforced honesty—is signaled early and tightens through one major reversal: the eye amplifies truth instead of occluding it, forcing Mira to choose burial and acceptance. Her agency drives the closure (she digs, buries, relinquishes silence) with visible cost: "Her fear remained." The empathy-virus context and involuntary truthfulness raise the price of confrontation. Pressure coheres under the Causal-Accumulative lens and escalates meaningfully when the eye "demands attention" and the dream sequence forecloses retreat, narrowing her to the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the glass eye, storm-battered roots, and the act of burial. The final image—"safety wasn't in silence. It was in the storm"—reweights the premise without moralizing, arising from the eye's failure and Mira's renunciation. Subtext operates in the orchard's "grief," the fox's unblinking watch, and the whispered wind. The involuntary-truthfulness curse and empathy-virus backstory integrate thematically without abstraction. No thematic echo or label-speak in the closure beat; the resonance feels earned by prior images and choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and embodied throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices loam, roots, and silence through a forager's lens. Diction stays grounded and specific ("gnarled roots," "slick paths," "mildew and old secrets"). The brief italic telepathy from the eye ("You're afraid") is a deliberate device, not head-hopping, and the return to her shaken interiority maintains distance control. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (dream, burial). No dialogue on the page to evaluate, but internal voice remains distinct and purposeful across pressure points.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in early paragraphs ("She had come here," "She had spent years") and one near-paraphrase loop ("It wasn't occluding truth—it was *amplifying* it" closely follows the prior whisper) trigger a small deduction. The metaphor "the orchard's branches groaned like a living thing" edges toward stock phrasing but remains functional. Clarity and propulsion are strong through closure; the final image carries weight without overwriting. No filter-verb stacks or major loops that dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—glass eye that amplifies rather than occludes truth, forcing a forager to confront her involuntary honesty—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar cursed-relic and post-apocalyptic-isolation tropes. The empathy-virus context and "Hollow Eye of Veyth" textbook detail add specificity. The reversal (eye exposes instead of hides) feels earned in hindsight and drives the closure. Emotional truth anchors the arc; the final choice to bury the eye and accept fear avoids tidy resolution. Risk-taking in the telepathic-eye device heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact elements and would collapse under substitution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's identity as rational truffle forager frames her isolation choice and anchors her in the orchard across all beats. Her foraging expertise (touching loam, reading soil) appears in the opening and closing, and her rationality conflicts with the eye's irrational demand. The attribute shapes two key choices: returning to the orchard after the first test and burying the eye in the soil where truffles hide, closing the loop. The forager role constrains her to the ravine and charges the final image of dirt under her nails, making removal structurally damaging.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The antique glass eye appears in five distinct beats: discovery, textbook research, pressing it to her socket, dream-glow on nightstand, and burial. Its shifting function—from smuggled relic to truth-amplifier to rejected object—drives escalation. The eye's "weight a silent accusation" and the whispered voices force Mira's reversal. Its presence in the final burial act charges the closure image and reweights prior material. Removing it would collapse causality and the dominant stake. High irreplaceability and closure linkage; the object is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept frames the eye's danger ("smuggled, cursed, or worse") and motivates Mira's caution in the opening. The discredited textbook and "Hollow Eye of Veyth" passage deepen the concept and guide her testing choice. The relic's rumored power (occlude truth) sets up the reversal when it amplifies instead. The concept constrains her choice to bury rather than destroy ("too old, too *alive*"). Present across setup, middle choice, and closure, shaping stakes and tactics throughout. Swapping "smuggled relic" for a generic cursed object would weaken specificity but not break structure, capping at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's involuntary truthfulness ("words spilled from her before she could stop them, a curse in a world that punished honesty") motivates her isolation and her hope that the eye will "hide her truths." This trait drives the textbook research and the decision to press the eye to her socket, both pivotal choices with cost. The reversal—eye amplifies rather than hides—lands harder because her curse made the attempt desperate. The attribute shapes tactics (seeking occlusion) and charges the closure (accepting truth). Visible tradeoff on the page; essential to causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "occlude" appears explicitly in the textbook passage ("The Hollow Eye of Veyth occludes truth, not light") and drives Mira's central hope and test. The reversal—amplification instead of occlusion—creates the story's major turn. The final burial can be read as her attempt to occlude the eye itself by hiding it in earth, inverting the premise. The concept is signaled early and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Swapping "occlude" for a near-synonym like "conceal" would preserve logic but lose the textbook's archaic specificity and thematic charge, placing it in upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method "through rumored cures in discredited textbooks" is seeded in the hut scene where Mira consults the salvaged textbook with "frantic notes about rumored cures for things no one named." The passage about the Hollow Eye directly enables her next choice (pressing the eye to her socket). The "discredited" quality charges her desperation and the method's failure when the eye does the opposite. The textbook's presence shapes her attempt and its mechanics matter to the reversal. Removing this method would require inventing another knowledge source, breaking the setup. Essential across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in a storm-battered ravine anchors every scene: its isolation gifts Mira safety, its slick paths keep others away, its storm-worn earth hides and later receives the eye, and its swaying branches charge the final image. The setting pressures her choices (no one dares descend) and supplies the burial site that closes the arc. The orchard "sighed" when the eye touched earth, a micro-turn that validates her choice. Spatial particulars (damp loam, gnarled roots, ravine's edge) recur with purpose. Removing this exact setting would collapse isolation logic, discovery causality, and closure resonance. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the empathy virus" is established early and explains Mira's isolation ("touch became a minefield and silence the only safe language"). It contextualizes her psychological-safety stake and raises the cost of her involuntary truthfulness in a world where empathy is dangerous. The virus is present in the opening and implied in the closure when she "didn't feel alone" despite the broken world. The temporal frame does not create urgent pressure or tighten a clock, but it meaningfully shapes motivation and the thematic weight of her final acceptance. Present across setup and payoff with conceptual cost; causal role in one major stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to cultivate psychological safety is dramatized in the opening ("She had spent years cultivating psychological safety, building walls") and tested in every beat: finding the eye that "demanded attention," hoping it will hide truths, recoiling when it amplifies instead, and finally choosing burial over destruction. The friction between her desire for safety and the eye's exposure drives escalation. The closure renounces silence-as-safety with visible cost ("Her fear remained"). The motivation is conflicted (safety versus honesty), embodied in choices, and present from setup through ending with undeniable price. Essential to causality and theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone "fractured grace" coheres through poetic compression ("clung to the ravine's walls like a desperate thought"), fragments of beauty amid threat ("iris a swirl of amber and gold"), and the stuttering rhythm of Mira's testing and retreat. Tone modulates with pressure: calm in the opening loam-touching, urgent when the eye whispers, dreamlike in the nightmare, hushed at burial. The final image—"The eye was gone. Her fear remained. And that, she realized, was the point"—lands with quiet inevitability, fractured acceptance meeting grace. The tone charges the closure and remains coherent across turns without flattening into static mood.</comment>
