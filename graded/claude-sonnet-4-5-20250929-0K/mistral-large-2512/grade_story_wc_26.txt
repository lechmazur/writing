<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is grounded in his observational practice and sustained by his theory about shadows, but his final choice—merging the footage—feels more like a discovery than a decision with competing costs. The "softly deliberate" movements are claimed rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. His motivation to preserve hope is clear, but the ending smile arrives without visible forfeit or renunciation that would earn the shift. The stone's warming and rolling feel symbolic rather than tied to a specific micro-choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through layered imagery (library, shadow, river memory) and builds density toward the footage-merge moment. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope reframed as movement rather than stasis—with felt cost implicit in years of patient observation. Orientation anchors (library, Elias, the stone, the shadow) land within the first 120 words. The tightening is legible: Elias's theory crystallizes when the footage overlaps and the shadow stills, signaling a shift from searching to listening. Cost is implied but not sharply visible on the page, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming library with silver vines and self-turning pages establishes a vivid, fantastical micro-setting that constrains Elias's work to this sanctuary. The river stone returns as a tactile anchor (windowsill, palm, floor) and its warming signals the theory's validation. Spatial choreography is clear: Elias at the terminal, shadow on floor and ankle, stone on sill then floor. The setting does not materially constrain a choice—Elias could merge footage anywhere—so it charges atmosphere more than tactics, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the river's shadow persists to restore the valley—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through juxtaposed footage and the shadow's movements, but no on-page reversal forces Elias to trade off competing goods or alter tactics under cost. The footage merge is a discovery, not a decision with visible forfeit. The shadow stilling and Elias's smile suggest resolution, yet no live option is foreclosed with felt price. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens without a tightening choice that narrows paths, limiting escalation credit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—hope as motion, not preservation—emerges organically from the river's flow, the self-turning pages, and the shadow's echo. The final image ("a river, always moving, always changing") reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadow's physicality (cold, coiling, dissolving) and the library's breath-holding. The stone and footage motifs recur with shifted meaning at closure. The closing paragraph edges toward summary ("nothing worth preserving ever did") but stays grounded in Elias's lived realization, avoiding overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent perceptual signature: Elias notices dusk transitions, firefly flickers, shadow pooling. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("bruised from blue to violet," "coiled around his ankle, cold as the river's memory"). No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he realized") appear but fit the reflective voice. Diction remains coherent under pressure, though elevated phrasing ("metamorphose," "sliver of proof") occasionally drifts from immediate perception into narrative summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarative beats at closure: "Elias closed his eyes, listening"). Information density is high in the footage-comparison beats. Minor scaffold appears: "The shadow unbound" repeats as a label across five paragraphs without varied construction, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loop between "He had spent years studying it" and "He had spent his life chasing this moment" restates duration without added pressure. Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacked ("bruised," "scarred wasteland," "trickle of dust") without pattern-teaching. No filter-verb stacks or major muddle, but the recurrence of stock phrasings lowers craft precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fantastical library and shareable-dream premise offer fresh details, but the core—researcher proves a lost place's memory persists through archival evidence—follows a familiar recovery/restoration template. The shadow-as-echo theory and footage-merge method are specific, yet the emotional arc (patient hope rewarded by discovery) resolves predictably without moral calculus or competing costs. Elias's role as "dusk noticer" and the vine-bloom setting add texture, but the story does not transform the template through an unexpected turn or renunciation. Solid execution within a recognizable frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias as "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" is established in paragraph two and his observational habit frames his work with the footage. His noticing drives the comparison that produces the merged image, but this is discovery rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The trait shapes context but does not constrain a choice with cost, trending functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears early (windowsill, paragraph four), is handled in Elias's palm with sensory detail (warm, weight a comfort), and returns at closure when it pulses and rolls to the floor. Its warming signals validation of Elias's theory. However, the stone does not constrain a choice or change tactics; Elias does not pick it up, and the footage merge proceeds without its involvement. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is introduced early (paragraph six), studied across years, and described as shifting, pooling, coiling. Elias's theory that it is an echo of the river drives his archival work. The shadow stills and sharpens at closure when the footage merges, marking a shift. It participates in setup, middle beats (coiling around ankle), and ending, but does not narrow options or impose visible cost; it signals rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is claimed in paragraph eight and repeated in paragraph twenty-four at the terminal controls. The trait is asserted through narrative summary ("never rushing, never panicking") rather than demonstrated in a micro-choice where slowness enables success or incurs cost. Removing the label would not break story logic; Elias's careful observation could be shown through action alone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears once in paragraph seventeen as Elias's hope that the valley could return to its former state. The word names a desired outcome but does not drive an on-page turn or action; the footage merge is the key move, and "restore" or "return" could replace "metamorphose" without altering structure. The concept is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage from decades apart is signaled early (paragraph nine) and the method structures Elias's work across the middle beats. The frame-by-frame comparison (paragraph twenty-one) identifies the shadow's persistence, and the merge (paragraph twenty-four) produces the closure effect. The mechanics matter: juxtaposition enables the proof. Present in setup, middle attempt, and ending, with causal pressure on the final discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The blooming library above the clouds is established in the opening line and described with vivid details (silver vines, petals at dusk, self-turning pages). It recurs at closure when the library sighs and petals unfold. The setting provides atmosphere and anchors Elias's sanctuary, but does not constrain his choices or alter tactics; the footage merge could occur in any archive. Functional presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after dreams became shareable" is introduced in paragraph thirteen and explains the existence of recorded dream-footage that Elias uses. This premise enables the method but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; no clock pressures his work. The timeframe is a world-rule that supports the plot mechanic without imposing cost or escalating stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to preserve the shape of hope" is stated in paragraph fourteen and drives his years of archival stitching. The desire is clear and sustained through his theory and footage work. At closure, he reframes hope as motion rather than frozen preservation, which reconfigures the motivation with conceptual cost (letting go of stasis). The shift is more realization than dramatized friction between wants and prices, limiting higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone blends luminous imagery (blooming vines, glowing petals, fireflies, flowing river on-screen) with regret (valley now "scarred wasteland," river "swallowed whole," years spent chasing proof). The tone modulates: patient observation in early beats, cold shadow coiling in the middle, and the library's sigh and Elias's smile at closure. The final image—listening in silence—carries both light (hope as river) and loss (the past won't return overnight), charging the ending with coherent emotional weight.</comment>
