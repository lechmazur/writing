<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is specific—polishing marbles "as if by smoothing its flaws, he could mend something deeper"—and his choices (leaving marbles strategically, following the crack-map) show agency under the garden's pressure. The final act of carrying the seedling and scattering the marbles demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract label-speak ("mended deception" as a mantra rather than embodied struggle) and the forty-year backstory remains inert summary rather than a live constraint on present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The marble appearances, strategic placements, and the crack-map guide create a coherent escalation; the final seedling discovery and Elias's choice to scatter the marbles constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with felt cost—he relinquishes control and trusts the garden's judgment. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening (the garden responds, then guides) tightens the dominant stake. Cost is legible: "The garden had never been his to control, only to tend."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The maze is vividly rendered—hedges "sagged with age, their leaves brittle as old parchment," paths growing narrower, roots rising overnight—and it constrains Elias's choices throughout (impassable paths that suddenly open, the fountain as locus). The marbles function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's reverent attention. The garden's living, judging presence pressures every beat and shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("Will the garden accept/trust him?") is signaled early and accumulates pressure through the marble exchanges and the garden's shifting responses. The crack-map marble is a meaningful reversal that narrows Elias's path to the seedling. His final choice—to scatter the marbles and trust the garden to choose the next gardener—forecloses his prior ambition with visible cost ("enough to know that the deception had been mended"). One deepening turn is sufficient at this length; escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (control versus stewardship, deception versus understanding) emerges organically from Elias's rituals and the garden's responses without stated morals. The final image—seedling carried, marbles scattered—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance of limits is the only victory. "Mended deception" shifts from an abstract claim to embodied realization through the polishing ritual and the garden's guide. The ending reweights prior material (forty years of pretending) with quiet, earned cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (reading cracks "as if reading a story," seeing marbles as offerings) is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains within his lexicon—reverent, deliberate, slightly archaic ("gnarled fingers," "withered vine")—and modulates naturally under pressure. Two brief moments edge toward elevated register ("coaxing life from stubborn soil," "time after luck became measurable" introduced without grounding) but do not break voice. No dialogue present; interior rhythm supports the accumulative escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with strong images ("leaves brittle as old parchment," "flowers tiny and perfect"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the garden "judging him" is restated three times in variant forms across early paragraphs; "mended deception" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment mid-story; and template cadence runs in the marble-placement sequence ("Each one was a question, a challenge, a plea"). One mixed metaphor: "the sun bled into the horizon" followed immediately by maze walls "rustling like whispers" conflates visual and auditory vehicles. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the second quarter. Density is generally high, but scaffold phrasing ("He was wisely pragmatic about it") intrudes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The garden-as-judge conceit and the marble ritual are fresh inflections on the gardener-and-garden trope, and the seedling as quiet closure avoids false triumph. The phrase "time after luck becomes measurable" introduces a high-concept frame that remains ornamental—it does not constrain choice or reappear at closure. The emotional arc (control → acceptance) is familiar but executed with specific detail (polishing cracks, following the map). Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its accumulative structure without bold formal experiments. One proximity concern: "blooming in the withering" echoes common poetic phrasing without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias drives every beat: collecting marbles, polishing the first, placing them strategically, following the crack-map, kneeling at the seedling, carrying it home, scattering the marbles. His decisions alter tactics (the garden responds by opening paths, blooming vines) and the final scatter is the closure choice with visible cost (relinquishing control). Early signal, middle development, closure participation all present. Causal pressure and cost connection elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marbles appear in the opening (setup), are handled in at least four beats (polishing, strategic placement, the crack-map marble in hand, final scatter), and their cracked surfaces carry reweighted meaning at closure (questions for the next gardener, not tokens of mastery). The crack-map marble narrows options and enables the seedling discovery. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Specificity (cracks as rivers, as maps) makes them irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is named explicitly in paragraph 4 and recurs as a thematic label, shaping Elias's interpretation of the marble ritual. It provides the moral frame for his final acceptance ("the deception had been mended—not by force, but by understanding"). However, the concept is more thematic echo than tactical constraint; removing the phrase would not break the garden-trust arc. Present in setup and closure, but ornamental in middle beats. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" appears once as a label ("He was wisely pragmatic about it") when Elias decides to play the garden's games, but the trait is not dramatized with a visible tradeoff or cost. The strategic marble placement could illustrate pragmatism, but the phrase itself does no causal work and could be cut without altering the narrative. Functional mention, no cost connection. Missing middle development as a distinct pressure; cap 4.6 for missing setup as an enacted trait, but the brief mention allows modest elevation within the replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Polishing the first marble is ritualistic and early (setup); it frames the "mended deception" insight and establishes the reverent relationship with the marbles. However, polishing does not recur as a distinct action in later beats—placement and following dominate. The act itself does not create a major turn; it sets tone and motive. Strong early signal and thematic linkage, but swappable with another care ritual (cleaning, arranging) without breaking structure. Two gates (setup, closure relevance via the ritual frame) and modest beat involvement yield mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is named explicitly when Elias clips the rose and places it with the marbles (setup and middle beat). The method shapes his survival strategy and recurs implicitly in the marble ritual and the seedling care at closure. However, the method is more thematic description than tactical constraint; the story could function with "tending carefully" instead. Present across beats with modest causal pressure (the rose gesture triggers garden response). Three gates, but replaceable mechanics and no sharp cost tied to elaboration itself limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden maze is present throughout, pressuring every choice: paths narrow, roots rise, hedges part or block, the fountain is the convergence point, and the seedling emerges from cracked stone at the heart. The maze's shifting geometry forces Elias's tactical decisions (strategic marble placement, following the crack-map) and the final image (seedling at the maze's heart, marbles left as breadcrumbs) is inseparable from the setting. Early signal, beat involvement across the entire arc, causal pressure, closure linkage, and high irreplaceability. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" is introduced in the opening paragraph as a temporal anchor, but the phrase remains abstract and ornamental. No on-page mechanics explain what measurable luck entails, and the timeframe does not constrain Elias's choices or tactics. The story functions identically if set in "his final years" or "the present day." Setup present, but missing middle development and closure participation. Swappable and decorative; functional consistency at best.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To prove that gardens know their gardeners" is dramatized through Elias's forty-year tending, the marble rituals, and the garden's responses. The desire drives his strategic placements and his interpretation of the crack-map guidance. At closure, the motivation shifts to acceptance: "The garden had never been his to control, only to tend." The arc from proving to accepting constitutes development with cost. Setup, middle pressure, and closure transformation all present. Modest friction: the motivation is occasionally told ("he knew the garden was judging him") rather than shown purely through action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" (or "withering blooming") is embodied throughout: hedges sag and wither, yet a blood-red rose blooms; vines wither then burst into bloom where marbles rest; the seedling with metallic sheen emerges from cracked stone. Tone modulates between decay and fragile renewal, charging every beat and the final image ("something that bloomed in the withering"). The oxymoron structures the emotional and thematic arc without becoming static. Coherent through turns, elevates the closure image, and maintains tension. High causal and closure integration.</comment>
