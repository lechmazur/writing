<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand the erasure is clear and her finger-tapping tic provides embodied texture. However, internal conflict remains largely absent—she pursues a mystery without meaningful competing impulses or visible hesitation. The final smile and determination feel asserted rather than earned through contradictory wants tested under pressure. The choice to continue lacks visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers clues (torn page, AI query, hidden atlas pages) toward a pattern-break revelation. Orientation anchors promptly (station, Elara, post-ban era). Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the answering knock reweights the station's solitude and the erasure into a hidden presence—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or altered option. The lens holds cleanly through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sea-level monitoring station supplies recurring sensory anchors (humming machinery, salt scent, tide gauge blinks) and the lowest-level floor panel constrains Elara's search spatially. The setting actively pressures her investigation by its archive gaps and isolation. The micro-setting of the loose panel and the atlas pages charges the final discovery, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why survey paths vanished—is signaled early and tightens through the four-day assembly sequence. However, escalation reads as additive discovery rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes a visible tradeoff. The answering knock shifts atmosphere but does not dramatize a decision with felt cost. One meaningful deepening is present but agency at closure remains observational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of erasure versus memory emerges through concrete particulars (torn atlas, hidden pages, the rhythm as call-and-response). The final image—Elara's smile and resolve to follow the paths—offers a non-literal answer to the story's question without overt moralizing. The conceptual cost (someone still watches, the past is guarded) registers clearly. No thematic echo or late symbol insertion; resonance arises organically from the layered clues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual filter (finger-tapping, quickening pulse, breath hitching) is consistent and character-specific. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction remains within her register ("pulse quickening," "coiling unease") and rhythmic modulation supports pressure rises. The AI dialogue is functional but brief; no voice convergence issues. Meets the perceptual-signature and distance-control standards for high 7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is strong in the assembly sequence. Minor paraphrase adjacency appears ("The paths hadn't disappeared; they'd been hidden" immediately follows discovery of hidden pages) but does not obscure causality. No template cadence, filter-verb stacks, or metaphor muddle in peak beats. Clarity and momentum remain intact; propulsion is steady without loops touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coral-bleaching witness + monitoring-station + hidden-records premise synthesizes familiar elements (climate aftermath, mystery archives, solitary researcher) without a sharp inflection. The answering knock and tapping-rhythm motif offer specificity, and the "periodically eternal" frame adds texture, but the emotional arc and mystery structure follow recognizable paths. Transformation test: core beats could transfer to other settings with minor edits. No close echoes of famous work; competent execution without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout; her role as coral bleaching witness frames her mission and the significance of the reefs she seeks to document. The attribute appears in setup (first paragraph) and closure (final paragraph's coral-fading reference). However, her witnessing does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics—she pursues the mystery of the paths without the bleaching observation forcing a tradeoff. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with lyric reprise but no middle development caps eligibility near 6.0; causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The torn atlas page appears in three distinct beats: discovery on shelf, traced edge with quickening pulse, and final reassembly beneath the floor panel. It narrows Elara's search (she traces coordinates, follows the deletion pattern) and charges the closure by completing the hidden map. Early signal (second paragraph), causal pressure (guides investigation), and closure linkage present. Irreplaceability is strong—no generic clue would carry the same tactile and archival weight. Cost is conceptual (the erasure itself) rather than a visible forfeiture tied to the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire plot: data is incomplete, atlas page torn, records erased incrementally. The concept shapes stakes (why the gaps?) and Elara's tactics (assembling fragments, following the deletion pattern). It appears in setup (missing survey paths, paragraph four) and drives the middle assembly sequence, culminating in the closure discovery of hidden pages and the answering knock. All three gates present; causal pressure is steady. Swappability is moderate—other mystery frameworks could serve—but the incremental-erasure angle fits the "periodically eternal" motif and tidal rhythm.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears as atmospheric descriptor ("periodic hum of the tide gauges," "periodic eternity") but does not constrain an on-page action or enable a tactic with visible cost. The trait colors tone and setting but remains ornamental—label-only use without causal pressure. Introduced mid-story (paragraph after AI query) without setup, and absent from closure participation. Missing setup gate caps at 4.6; no development or payoff participation caps further at 3.4 under missing-middle rule; lyric texture nudges upward within band but cannot overcome gate failures.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Assembly drives the central arc: Elara spends three days piecing fragments (logs, coordinates, torn page), discovers the deletion rhythm on day four, and completes the atlas beneath the floor panel. The action appears in setup (incomplete data signals the need), dominates middle beats (assembling fragments), and delivers closure (hidden pages reassembled, paths revealed). All three gates present with strong causal pressure—removing assembly would collapse the plot. Specificity is high (not generic "investigation" but concrete fragment-work). Cost is conceptual (the revelation of intentional erasure) rather than a visible forfeiture Elara pays.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tapping rhythm appears in four beats: opening (fingers on sill), dream (tapping bedframe), middle (tapping out tide rhythm), and closure (tapping metal wall, receiving answering knock). Early signal present; the method shapes the final call-and-response that confirms the hidden presence. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter Elara's search tactics—she would assemble fragments regardless. Two strong gates (setup, closure with charged reprise) and lyric resonance earn mid-6s; missing middle development and ornamental use in early beats prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sea-level monitoring station supplies spatial constraint (archives, lowest level with floor panel), isolates Elara (staff rotated out), and provides the tide gauges and machinery hum that anchor the setting's sensory texture. The station's records and their gaps drive the mystery; the lowest-level location enables the hidden-page discovery. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (archives, AI, level descent), and closure (lowest level, answering knock in corridors). Causal pressure is strong—removing the station would require full plot redesign. Irreplaceability is high; the monitoring function ties to both the bleaching mission and the tidal rhythm motif.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fossil fuel ban timeframe is mentioned in setup (paragraph three: "after the fossil fuel ban had finally taken hold") and implicit in the bleaching aftermath premise, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The story's investigation unfolds over four days without time pressure; the ban serves as backstory context rather than a live constraint. Setup gate present but no middle development or closure participation; ornamental use without causal work. Swappable with other post-crisis frames.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to discover why survey paths disappeared is dramatized through concrete actions: pulling the atlas, querying the AI, assembling fragments over three days, following the deletion pattern. The motivation frames her investigation from paragraph four onward and shapes every middle beat, culminating in the discovery of hidden pages and the answering knock. All three gates present with strong causal pressure. Friction between intellectual pursuit and unease (pulse quickening, breath hitching) is embodied. Cost is conceptual (confirming the erasure and hidden watcher) rather than a visible forfeiture of an alternate goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" tone—suspended between motion and stasis—is coherent through the story's tidal imagery (lap of water, rise and fall, rhythm of waves) and the station's isolated, time-stretched atmosphere. The tone modulates subtly with Elara's quickening pulse and mounting unease, then stabilizes at closure with her smile and resolve. It charges the final image by reinforcing the "periodically eternal" frame and the answering knock's ambiguity. Present throughout with purposeful cadence; one meaningful pressure shift. Specificity is strong but the tone remains atmospheric rather than driving a tactical choice.</comment>
