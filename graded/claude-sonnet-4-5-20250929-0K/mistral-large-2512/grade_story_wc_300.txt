<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The inspector's interiority is present—fear of being forgotten, purpose clarifying across the arc—but lacks contradiction acting *in scene*. Her choices (touching pearl to confessions, placing crown on her own head) arise smoothly without competing impulses or visible hesitation that would charge the moment. The confession "I'm afraid of being forgotten" arrives as a stated insight rather than an embodied cost that forecloses a path. Embodiment is gestural but lacks the micro-choice friction that would lift the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the inspector's whispered confession and the pearl's dulling reconfigure her purpose with conceptual cost—the pearl's "purpose fulfilled" and her leaving the crown for the next heart. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through confessions, pearl contact, and radiance until the crown moment reweights the premise. Causality is clean (pearl dissolves confessions → crown reveals final message → inspector speaks her own fear → pearl dulls). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bunker's grief becomes her own, narrowing the question to self-confrontation. Cost is felt but understated—the pearl's dullness and her departure signal closure without a sharp forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal caves frame and constrain: shattered quartz, prismatic whispers, latent radiance all recur and charge the final image when "the crystal caves shimmered, their edges softer now." The pearl interacts with the cave's radiance to amplify effect, and the bunker's metal walls hold the confessions that drive the arc. Spatial choreography is clear (entry, bunker interior, shelf, exit). The caves' textural shift at the end—quartz "no longer felt like shards, but like seeds"—directly charges the closure image and reflects the inspector's internal reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the inspector's mission to inspect/dissolve bunker grief, tightening when she realizes "this was the wall she'd been trying to dissolve—not between strangers, but within herself." One meaningful deepening occurs at the crown discovery, narrowing the question to her own courage and fear of erasure. Agency is renunciation/confession ("I'm afraid of being forgotten"), which forecloses passive inspection and demands self-exposure. Cost is conceptual (the pearl dulls, her secret spoken) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters tactics. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the final cost reads muted—no live option visibly closed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—abandoned hope, grief as reliquary, courage to remember—emerges through pearl mechanics, confessions, and the crown without overt statement until the final lines, which toe the line of summary ("even abandoned hopes could find their way home"). The pearl's shift from luster to dull white, the crown left for "the next heart," and the quartz-as-seeds image offer non-literal answers. The inspector's arc (external mission becomes internal confession) integrates with the thematic question. Minor slip: "heartbeat of hesitation" recurs as a phrase-motif but does not constrain a choice—it gestures at theme rather than shaping it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled—"prismatic whispers," "reliquary of what could have been"—but the register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that reads slightly above the POV's grounded urgency ("reluctant priestess," "stitching the broken pieces back together"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's "certainty that even abandoned hopes could find their way home" borders on thematic summary rather than dramatized perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during confession, wider at exit) but the prose leans decorative in non-peak beats without tightening rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral," "fireflies," "seeds"—without pattern-teaching or a clear payoff that differentiates peak from setup beats, triggering overwriting concerns. Paraphrase loop: "The bunker sighed around her, its weight lifting" followed by "no longer trapped but free" restates release without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the confession list and final-paragraph summary ("She walked on, carrying nothing but the quiet, and the certainty…") lacks propulsion. Clarity remains intact, but the closure beat is cushioned by metaphor rather than sharpened by it. Minor scaffold: "From her satchel, she withdrew the pearl" could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bunker-inspector premise is functional but not transformed—premise and emotional arc (external mission becomes internal reckoning) are widely templated in speculative microfiction. The pearl-as-tool and confessions-in-metal offer specific detail, and the crown reprise adds a fresh inflection. The ending's shift (quartz as seeds, crown left behind) grows from prior particulars rather than a late rule change. Synthesis feels competent but not inevitable: swapping bunker for lighthouse or pearl for another heirloom would leave the arc largely unchanged, signaling mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Inspector present throughout; her choices (enter bunker, use pearl on confessions, place crown on own head, whisper fear, leave crown behind) create the key turns. Setup clear, two distinct beats (dissolving confessions, crown self-placement), and closure participation (she walks out transformed). Deduction: her role as inspector is framing more than causally necessary—she could be any visitor; the "inspection" mechanic does not constrain her choices or supply a cost tied to her occupation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pearl present early (satchel, grandmother's warning), used in two beats (touching confessions to dissolve them, final glow when crown placed), and returns with reweighted meaning (dulls to milky white, "purpose fulfilled"). Closure linkage strong—the pearl's transformation signals the arc's completion. Cost visible (pearl's luster lost). Minor deduction: the pearl's mechanics (amplifies radiance, dissolves metal words) are asserted rather than earned through prior setup or world logic, and the grandmother's warning about ocean memory does not directly prepare the dissolution function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Latent radiance is named early, recurs (cave glow, pearl amplifies it, flares at crown), and participates in closure (pulsing twice then fading). However, it functions as atmospheric description rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics—the inspector's choices (touch pearl to confessions, place crown) proceed identically whether radiance is present or not. It charges the mood but does not constrain decisions or reveal cost, landing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Acquires abandoned hopes" is the thematic premise rather than a trait that constrains action. The inspector does collect/dissolve the bunker's confessions (hopes), but "acquiring" reads passive—she witnesses and releases rather than taking them on with visible cost. The attribute appears in setup (her mission framing) and closure (hopes "find their way home"), offering a lyric through-line. Deduction: the trait is told in summary rather than dramatized as a friction that alters her tactics or imposes a price mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Crown introduced mid-story, lifted by inspector, worn by her, and left behind at closure—three beats. The crown discovery triggers the key turn (inspector realizes the wall is internal) and wearing it intensifies the pearl's glow, enabling her confession. Closure participation strong (left for "the next heart"). Deduction for late arrival (past midpoint, −0.3) and the crown's role as symbol rather than mechanically irreplaceable—any personal object with "wanted to be brave" could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Confessions in seashell spiral appear early (inspector traces them on bunker walls), shape middle beats (she reads them, uses pearl to dissolve each), and the final confession (under crown band) triggers her self-revelation. Two beats, causal pressure (confessions must be read and dissolved to reach the last one), closure linkage (final confession prompts her own). Deduction: the seashell-spiral detail is poetic but mechanically inert—confessions could be etched in any pattern without altering the inspector's actions or the arc's cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Crystal caves frame the entire piece (entry, interior action, exit), provide the latent radiance that the pearl amplifies, and shift at closure ("edges softer now," quartz as seeds rather than shards). Setting pressures the inspector's mood and charges the final image with textural transformation. Three beats (entry description, radiance interaction, exit reconfiguration), strong closure linkage. The caves are irreplaceable—no other setting offers the radiance mechanic and the shard-to-seed shift that encodes the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Heartbeat of hesitation" is named twice (mid-story "thrummed through the cave," final paragraph "lingered, but it was lighter now") but does not function as a ticking clock or shape decisions. Time remains vague—no urgency, no narrowing window that alters the inspector's tactics. The phrase reads as lyric motif rather than temporal constraint. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise) but without middle development that tightens pressure, capping it below the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation present early ("she had come to dissolve the walls between hearts, though she hadn't known it until this moment"), dramatized in action (dissolving confessions, confronting her own wall), and resolved at closure (speaking her fear, leaving crown for another). Two beats, causal linkage (mission reframes as self-work). Deduction: friction between the stated desire and cost is thin—no competing want resists the mission, and the inspector's realization that the wall is internal arrives as insight rather than a choice that forecloses an easier path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is quiet, lyric, and sustained throughout—"eerie resonance," "ghost of a perfume," "resonant hush" at climax, "quiet" in final line. Modulates subtly (wonder → grief recognition → self-confrontation → release) without breaking coherence. Charges the final image strongly: the hush becomes "lighter now, almost hopeful" and the inspector carries "the quiet." The tone's consistency across pressure points and its reprise at closure ("the cave answered with a resonant hush") elevate it into the essential band, though it remains a single static register rather than a dynamic modulation.</comment>
