<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand echoes is stated but never tested in concrete choices under pressure. The protagonist remains passive throughout; Veyan arrives with the solution's missing half, and Liora simply accepts and joins. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves from curiosity to collective action without friction, cost, or a visible stake she must forfeit. The final choice to sing feels given rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece announces a Causal lens ("The shell was the key") but delivers Accumulative texture without a decisive change. Liora follows vibrations, encounters Veyan, learns the shell's nature, and they sing—no choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The ending reconfigures the cosmology ("no longer a secret, but a story") but lacks visible cost: we see no one called back, no price paid, only assertion. Orientation is clear early, preventing deeper penalties, but closure remains conceptual rather than dramatized with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, starlight, and merchant circle provide atmosphere and spatial anchors early. The seashell's tactile detail (jagged edge, warmth) functions as micro-setting. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Liora's path is guided by vibration alone, and the nexus serves as backdrop rather than pressure. The final image invokes the canyon walls answering but does not show environment shaping the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why echoes persist—is signaled early but never escalates or faces an on-page test. Liora encounters no obstacle, trades no competing value, and suffers no visible loss. Veyan's arrival provides exposition and the missing shell half; coincidence resolves the premise. The singing at closure is collaborative rather than agentic, and no cost (time, stamina, relational friction) appears on the page to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—fragmented voices seeking reunion—emerges through the shell metaphor and the webs-of-intrigue backdrop. The final image ("no longer a secret, but a story") gestures toward meaning without grounding it in a particular choice or sacrifice. Subtext is minimal; key concepts are stated ("They're fragments. Pieces of people..."). The piece avoids overt moralizing but also lacks the dense particulars that would let theme resonate beyond assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited; perceptual signature is present ("richly perceptive senses," "vibration," "impressions"). Veyan's dialogue ("reed-blown melancholy") carries distinct idiom. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she saw," "she understood") cluster during key beats, dulling immediacy slightly. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose maintains its established register through the end without head-hopping or unmotivated shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; spatial choreography tracks. Repetitive phrasing appears: "she knew / she was certain / she understood" cycles across paragraphs, and "The shell was / The shell had / The shell in her hand" loops without added pressure. Figurative language ("coiled like frozen serpents," "thread, weaving through the webs") is vivid but occasionally mixed. Information density is moderate; several lines paraphrase prior beats. Propulsion slows mid-story during exposition but recovers at the ending image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—an echo singer with a whispering seashell fragment—synthesizes familiar portal-fantasy and lost-voice tropes without transforming them through specific lived detail or unexpected moral calculus. The nexus, the collector, and the reunion-of-halves climax follow template structures. "Webs of intrigue" is mentioned but not dramatized. Emotional specificity is present in Veyan's "reed-blown melancholy," but the plot's turns feel predictable and the resolution arrives without earned friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and named early. She follows vibrations, presses the shell to her ear, and sings at closure. However, these are observations and participations rather than decisions that narrow options. Veyan supplies the missing half; Liora accepts. Her choices do not create key turns—she reacts and joins rather than driving causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in paragraph 2, is handled and pressed to Liora's ear mid-story, and returns at closure when joined with Veyan's half. It is present in setup, development, and payoff. The object enables the final singing but does not constrain prior choices or impose visible cost—it guides rather than limits. Specificity (jagged edge, warmth, hum) is present, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is named twice (paragraphs 7 and final) but functions as atmosphere rather than causal pressure. The nexus is described as a place where travelers trade secrets, yet no secret-trading occurs on the page and no intrigue alters Liora's tactics. The concept is ornamental—mentioned but not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive senses" is stated in paragraph 7 ("Liora's richly perceptive senses caught the faintest tremor"). It enables her to follow vibrations but does not constrain or impose tradeoff. The trait is label-only; no scene shows her perception creating friction or cost. It functions as character flavor without altering outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears twice: Liora "had to ensure she understood why" (paragraph 3) and Veyan asks "Will you help me ensure they're heard?" (final third). The first frames her motivation; the second becomes the closure question. It is present in setup and payoff and ties to the dominant stake. However, the action itself is abstract—no on-page choice dramatizes what "ensuring" costs or how it narrows options. Mid-band for setup and closure linkage without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is named once (paragraph 8): "She followed the vibration through progressive disclosure, letting the path reveal itself one step at a time." The method guides Liora's movement through two turns but does not impose mechanics or constraint that alter tactics. It is acknowledged but not weight-bearing—removing it would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus under starlight is anchored in paragraph 1 and returns in the final line ("the stars blinked above the serpentine nexus"). It provides spatial grounding and a charged image at closure. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources—Liora's path is determined by vibration alone. Setup and closure presence earn mid-band; lack of causal pressure limits higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears in paragraph 1 ("Tonight, the universe hummed its secret song") and returns transformed at closure ("the universe hummed louder, no longer a secret"). The timeframe is lyric rather than literal—no ticking clock tightens decisions. It frames atmosphere and shifts meaning at the end but does not impose urgency or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Liora's motivation "to learn why some people echo" is stated in paragraph 3 and shapes her journey. Veyan's explanation provides the answer; she accepts and joins the effort. The motivation drives setup and development but lacks friction—no competing want or visible cost tests her commitment. It is functional but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is named once (Veyan's voice, paragraph 10) and the tone pervades: starlight, seashells, lost voices, longing. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly at closure (the universe "no longer a secret"). It charges the final image but remains static through turns—no tonal shift marks escalation. Setup and closure presence earn mid-band; lack of modulation under pressure limits higher scores.</comment>
