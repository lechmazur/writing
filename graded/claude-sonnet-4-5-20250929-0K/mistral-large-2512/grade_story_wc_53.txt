<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scavenger's interiority is concrete and textured—"regret clung to her like the damp mist"—but the ghost encounter flattens into abstraction ("you took too long") without visceral contradiction or a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final turn toward listening feels asserted rather than earned by prior on-page struggle; we see her collect fragments but never witness a choice between competing wants that would make the shift decisive. Embodied emotion is present early but dissolves into metaphor at closure, and the ghost's dialogue reads more like thematic echo than character pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (scavenger, rusted platform, kinetic lagoon) land clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the scavenger moves from collection to confrontation to listening, with the ghost encounter serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration moment. However, the cost at closure is conceptual and felt rather than visible—"let the wind carry the weight away" gestures toward release but does not foreclose a path on the page with a concrete action or renunciation. The camera wheel's disappearance into the lagoon functions as a micro turn but the final "now you listen" directive remains abstract, making the closure image more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, broken carousel, and rusted platform supply vivid, selective details that anchor the fractured mood. The camera wheel is handled twice (warm in her pocket, then sinks) and the lagoon's "water neither warm nor cold, just there" constrains the ghost encounter spatially. However, the carousel halting sets the timeframe but does not apply pressure to a present choice, and the lagoon's physics (man emerges younger) are introduced but not leveraged at closure. Sensory hierarchy is present but the final image relies on atmospheric assertion ("the lagoon hummed") rather than a concrete object or environmental constraint that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost to resolve regret—is signaled early and the ghost's arrival mid-story tightens the scavenger's options. Yet the escalation is more atmospheric than causal: the scavenger dips her fingers, the ghost speaks, the wheel sinks, and then the ghost dissolves without a visible trade-off or cost that alters tactics. The "now you listen" directive reweights the stake conceptually but does not narrow options on the page; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive the final reconfiguration with a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—time's erosion of ambition and the cost of delay—emerges through the carousel, camera wheel, and ghost encounter without overt statement. The wheel's warmth despite decades of disuse and the man who lost his memories supply concrete particulars that charge the concept. The final image ("she heard the world without flinching") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, and the ghost's "time doesn't care what you think" lands as earned insight rather than platitude. Minor slip: "let the wind carry the weight away" edges toward therapeutic abstraction in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a perceptual signature rooted in collection and fragmentation. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"regret clung to her like the damp mist," "a sound like time slipping through fingers"—and the ghost's dialogue carries subtext ("you took too long"). However, the ghost's lines edge toward thematic ventriloquism at closure ("time doesn't care what you think") and the final paragraph's "she heard the world without flinching" shifts into summary assertion rather than dramatized perception under the POV's established filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is textured ("a mirror that refused to hold a single truth," "voice like wind through broken glass") but several passages loop conceptually: "she had come to bargain, but the terms were unclear" followed immediately by "Did she want forgiveness? Absolution?" is paraphrase churn. Paragraph clarity is strong and sentence openings vary, but the closure beat stacks abstract assertions—"the lagoon hummed with stories," "she exhaled… and let the wind carry the weight away"—that reduce propulsion and information density. Minor filter-verb stack in the ghost encounter ("she swallowed," "she admitted," "she asked") dulls immediacy at a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and ghost-as-younger-self offer a fresh synthesis of regret and time-distortion, and the camera wheel as warm relic is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the negotiation-with-ghost frame and carousel-as-metaphor for stalled time are familiar templates, transformed only partially through the scavenger's collecting habit. The ghost dissolving after delivering a thematic line and the protagonist then "hearing the world" follows a well-worn arc of self-forgiveness without a bold structural or moral risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scavenger appears throughout, dips her fingers into the lagoon (middle beat), and at closure turns to listen—a stance crystallization. However, her choices are reactive: she arrives, listens to fragments, confronts the ghost when it appears, and accepts its directive. The turn toward listening is a shift but not a decision that narrows prior options with visible cost; the ghost's arrival and departure drive the sequence more than her agency. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The camera wheel is present early ("still warm"), handled mid-story ("pressed it to her ear"), and sinks into the lagoon at the ghost encounter, serving as a visible marker of letting go. However, its disappearance is passive (it "rolled from her fingers") and the cost is more symbolic than tactical—it does not constrain a choice or alter later options. Present in setup, middle, and closure participation, but the specificity and irreplaceability are moderate; another trinket could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions are named early ("her ambitions eroded like the edges of the wheel's plastic teeth") and the ghost states "you took too long," but the concept shapes stakes more as theme than as on-page pressure. The scavenger's present goal is to negotiate with the ghost, not to recover ambitions; the erosion is backstory that primes the encounter but does not constrain a middle choice. Present in setup and thematically charged at closure, but not developed as a live tactical stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Chronological confusion is gestured at via the lagoon's "reflections that didn't match the sky" and the man who emerged younger, but the scavenger herself is not shown to be chronologically confused in a way that constrains or enables action. The trait is applied to the setting and other characters, not to the protagonist; label-only mention without on-page cost or tactical trade-off. Missing middle development and closure participation as a character attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Regret is named early, embodied in the scavenger's collection habit, and drives her to the lagoon to negotiate. The ghost's accusation ("you took too long") crystallizes the regret as a relational cost, and the final turn toward listening suggests a reconfiguration of that weight. Present in setup, middle (ghost encounter), and closure (release), and the action shapes the dominant stake. However, regret could be swapped for guilt or loss with minor edits; the specificity of *regret* versus adjacent emotions is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Collecting fragments is signaled early ("she had been drawn by whispers," "she lived now by collecting fragments of overheard stories") and the voice from the lagoon ("I should've told her") is one such fragment. However, the method does not shape the ghost encounter or the final turn toward listening; it establishes her mode of survival but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic at closure. Present in setup and one middle beat but missing causal pressure at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is present from the opening line and supplies the ghost encounter mid-story; its water is "neither warm nor cold" and the shadow rises to meet the scavenger's touch. The lagoon's properties (time distortion, thick reflections) are vivid and specific, but they do not constrain the scavenger's choices—she dips her fingers and the ghost appears without the setting applying tactical pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure (final image of the lagoon humming), but the setting functions more as atmosphere than as a resource or obstacle that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The carousel's halt is named in the opening as a past event that drew the scavenger, establishing a before/after marker. However, the timeframe does not apply pressure to present choices—there is no clock tightening decisions, no urgency tied to the carousel's stopped state. The halt is backstory that sets the scene but does not constrain tactics or shape the ending. Present in setup but missing middle development and closure participation; late arrival of relevance and no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to negotiate with her ghost is stated mid-story ("she had come to bargain") and dramatized when the ghost appears and speaks. The scavenger's question "What now?" and the ghost's directive "Now you listen" show friction between her desire for terms and the ghost's refusal to grant them. Present in setup (implied), middle (ghost encounter), and closure (the turn toward listening), and the motivation drives the dominant stake. However, the negotiation itself is more told than shown—no on-page offer, counter-offer, or visible trade-off; the ghost dissolves and the scavenger shifts stance without a dramatized cost tied to the negotiation attempt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fractured stillness is established early through syntax ("broken horses… just swayed," "time unraveled like frayed thread") and sustained through the ghost encounter ("voice like wind through broken glass," "the moment between heartbeats"). The tone modulates appropriately: stillness at the platform, tension when the shadow rises, quiet resolution at the end. The final image—"she exhaled, long and slow, and let the wind carry the weight away"—charges the stillness with release, and the lagoon "humming with stories" reweights the fractured quality as generative rather than merely static. Coherent through turns and purposefully integrated into the closure beat.</comment>
