<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority shows purposeful contradiction—she writes obituaries for the living yet feels hollowed out by the act—and her micro-choices (kneeling to press the thread into soil, closing her eyes to imagine roots) reveal character under pressure. The king's physicians and the court's polished veneer supply secondary pressure, though these remain told rather than dramatized. Embodied emotion is present in "the garden's shadows clung to her like old grief," but some interiority slides toward label-only abstraction ("the geography of healing"). The final choice to "keep writing, keep weaving, keep projecting" reads as endurance with cost, though the cost remains atmospheric rather than concretely foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Lena's repeated acts of writing obituaries for the vanished accumulate into the garden ritual, which deepens her understanding of grief's movement. The closure—imagining the thread growing roots to bind the fractured kingdom—reconfigures her prior abstractions into a charged image of futile hope with felt cost ("a foolish hope… but it was all she had"). One meaningful tightening occurs when she kneels and presses the thread into soil, narrowing her tactic from observation to symbolic action. Cost is legible in "let them swallow her whole," signaling exhaustion and self-erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden's autumn decay and "shadows clung to her like old grief" filter setting through Lena's melancholy and constrain her symbolic gesture (kneeling in damp earth). Sensory detail—"scent of damp earth and decaying leaves," "pale moonlight," wind sending leaves spiraling—varies across senses and supports the tone without postcard cataloging. The garden functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: shadows "stretch long and thin" and swallow Lena, making loneliness spatial and physical. The palace carpet thread anchors occupation and world (royal loom, weavers' needles "like fireflies") without excess exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding grief's movement to stitch the kingdom's wound—is signaled early and tightens when Lena kneels to embed the thread, a micro-choice that forecloses passive observation. One meaningful deepening occurs: the thread shifts from stolen artifact to symbolic suture, reweighting her obituary practice as an attempt at healing rather than documentation. The king's absence and the court's polished denial supply external pressure, though these remain atmospheric rather than on-page antagonistic force. Cost is felt in "hollowed out, as if she were the one being buried" and visible in the final image of shadows swallowing her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as geography, absence as wound, storytelling as suture—emerges through the thread's journey from theft to burial, not through direct statement. The final image of imagined roots "binding the garden to the palace, the palace to the kingdom" offers a resonant answer to whether language can mend fracture: it cannot, yet the attempt itself is the act of love. Subtext operates in "a foolish hope… but it was all she had," which refuses tidy consolation. One forced note: "projecting presence into the spaces where absence had taken root" edges toward prompt-label articulation of theme rather than remaining implicit in image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Lena notices weavers' needles "like fireflies," the queen's trembling hands). Diction modulates with pressure: the opening's lyric density ("autumn's breath curled through the branches like a sigh too tired to finish") compresses slightly in the climactic beat ("she closed her eyes"). One slip: "projecting presence into the spaces where absence had taken root" shifts into expository register that abstracts Lena's work rather than showing it through her lens. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "autumn's breath curled… like a sigh too tired to finish" and "grief moved through a person like a river carving stone." One mixed metaphor: "the garden's shadows clung to her like old grief" then later "let them swallow her whole"—clinging and swallowing are contradictory actions that blur the vehicle. Minor paraphrase loop: "She had not meant to steal it" and "when the king's absence was explained" retrace motivation without added pressure. Information density is high; momentum consistent. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living, golden thread as symbolic suture—offers a fresh synthesis of grief-work and courtly intrigue. Transformation is partial: the thread's journey from theft to burial reweights it, but the emotional arc (observer → symbolic actor) follows a familiar curve. One specific detail elevates: the king's "retreat to the northern estates" as courtly lie, which Lena sees through, grounds the abstract stakes in lived deception. Risk-taking is modest; the lyric frame and reflective mode cohere but do not push beyond established literary territory. The ending's "foolish hope" earns credit for resisting false consolation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena the traveler-obituarist is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, pressing the thread, imagining roots) create the closure turn. Her occupation shapes her lens ("brief, vivid sketches") and her final decision to "keep writing, keep weaving" crystallizes her stance. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is observation-heavy. The role is essential but not irreplaceable—another grief-worker could fulfill similar narrative function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The thread appears in four beats: theft from the loom, unspooling in moonlight, pressing into soil, imagined as roots. It enables the climactic symbolic action and carries reweighted meaning (from stolen artifact to suture metaphor). Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. Swappability is modest—another royal object could serve with revision. Cost is conceptual (the thread cannot truly heal) rather than directly tied to its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Explained absences" drives the premise: Lena writes obituaries for the vanished (generals, poets, lovers, king), and the court weaves lies instead of facing loss. The concept shapes her occupation and the closure image (projecting presence where absence has rooted). Setup and payoff are strong; middle beats summarize prior cases rather than dramatizing new choices under this concept's pressure. The final act (burying the thread) operationalizes the concept with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is enacted in the prose texture—lyric imagery ("autumn's breath curled," "needles flashing like fireflies")—but does not function as a character trait that constrains action. The attribute describes narrative method rather than altering Lena's choices or tactics. It charges tone and setting but lacks causal pressure. Present throughout, yet easily swappable for another stylistic register without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Intimate" operates in two ways: Lena's obituary-writing is called "an intimate act" (label-only), and her physical gestures (kneeling, pressing thread, closing eyes) are small-scale and personal. The action does not create a major turn; the peak beat is symbolic rather than interpersonal. The trait is present but does not redefine options or escalate stakes. Swappable with "solitary" or "private" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named explicitly in two passages ("giving them a voice when they could no longer speak," "projecting presence into the spaces where absence had taken root") but its mechanics remain abstract. The method is told rather than shown; we do not see Lena write an obituary on the page or witness the projection's effect. It shapes her motivation but does not constrain her tactics. Late signal (explained midway); closure echoes it without demonstrating new cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "shadowed garden in autumn" is present in every beat: withered roses, damp earth, decaying leaves, wind, pale moonlight. It supplies the soil into which Lena presses the thread, making it a functional resource. Sensory details (scent, texture, wind) pressure her symbolic choice. The garden's shadows "swallow her whole" in the final image, charging closure. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the setting is integral to the ritual and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" anchors the opening temporally and establishes Lena's arrival after mobility has ceased, which subtly underscores isolation. The timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency; no countdown or evolving pressure stems from it. It functions as atmospheric setup rather than constraint. Present but replaceable with "at dusk" or "after the city slept" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is named on the page and dramatized through Lena's attempt to map grief's movement and stitch the kingdom's wound. Her kneeling to press the thread into soil enacts this desire with visible cost (futility, self-erasure). The motivation is signaled late (middle third) and remains partly abstract. Friction between want (to heal) and cost (hollowing out, being buried) is present but could be sharpened. Setup and payoff strong; middle development is reflective.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is established in the opening line ("lonesome splendor, where autumn's breath curled") and sustained through lyric diction, melancholy imagery, and isolation. Tone modulates with pressure: the opening's languorous syntax tightens slightly at the climax ("she closed her eyes") then opens again in the final image ("let them swallow her whole"). The tone charges the closure by making solitude both beautiful and consuming. Coherent across all beats; no tonal breaks.</comment>
