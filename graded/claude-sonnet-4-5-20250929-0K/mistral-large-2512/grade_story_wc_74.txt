<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The painter's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical details (trembling fingers, smudged ink), but her motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested under pressure. The three-night insomnia and the dream-faces are told with specificity, yet no internal contradiction emerges—she moves smoothly from fatigue to certainty without struggle. The final choice (leaving paintings for strangers) arrives without visible cost or friction; no live alternative is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (painter, greenhouse, smog, night) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates through painting-as-ritual and moon-charged reflection, but the closure—rolling up paintings and planning to distribute them—remains preparatory rather than decisive. No on-page cost accompanies the final act; the "quiet certainty" is declared, not earned through a visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: fogged panes, wet earth, mint, glass bubble above smog. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the painter's priorities. The moonlight functions as both atmosphere and thematic anchor, and the brush's glow subtly charges the space. The rooftop setting pressures the isolation but does not constrain a pivotal choice at closure, limiting upper-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through the painting ritual and moonlight-charged reflection, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The decision to distribute paintings is presented as resolved certainty with no visible cost, alternative, or friction. Escalation remains textural rather than choice-driven, consistent with the Accumulative lens but limiting closure force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (kindness as recoverable language) emerges organically from the brush's history, the painted faces, and the final distribution plan. The "lost languages" concept and the moon-tipped brush seed thematic weight without overt statement. The closure image—moon spilling silver, eyes closed in warmth—offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the world was still kind") rather than trusting the image alone, and no counter-reading complicates the optimism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric cadence, concrete images (sour yellow haze, liquid black ink), and a perceptual signature tied to moonlight and memory. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—building warmth in the final paragraphs—without register drift. Minor slip: "as if the brush itself was judging her" leans slightly toward filter-heavy introspection, but it does not obscure the focalizer's stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high in the opening (greenhouse, smog, brush history compressed efficiently). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the first half (smog "thick as wool," moonlight "like liquid silver") remains coherent and voice-motivated. Slight momentum drag in the middle section where reflection on kindness-as-language extends without scene pressure; the piece breathes rather than tightens. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—painter leaving portraits of remembered strangers as silent gifts—offers a specific angle on the kindness-and-memory theme. The moon-tipped brush and rooftop greenhouse are particular anchors. However, the emotional arc (insomnia → moonlit certainty → altruistic distribution) follows a familiar redemptive template without a non-obvious complication or moral friction. The transformation test is borderline: swapping the painter for another solitary artist and the brush for a different tool would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Insomniac painter: present throughout; insomnia frames the opening and the closing line inverts it ("She wasn't tired. Not anymore"). The trait enables the nocturnal painting ritual and the moonlight encounter. However, the insomnia itself does not constrain a choice or create visible cost—sleep deprivation is described but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off. The character's decisions (paint, roll, plan distribution) are not insomnia-specific. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weak. Lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Calligrapher's moon-tipped brush: appears in beat one (junk-shop discovery), beat two (dipping into inkwell, first stroke), beat three (painting faces), and implicitly in the closure (rolled paintings). The brush's moon-glow and stiff bristles are specific, and its history ("lost languages," bone handle) seeds thematic weight. It enables the painting action and its "judging" quality adds mild pressure. However, the brush does not constrain a key choice or evolve in use—it remains a static tool. Causal role in two beats; closure linkage indirect. Upper 7s, not 8+, due to limited cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lost languages: mentioned once in the junk-shop backstory ("a tool for words that had no home") and echoed thematically in "kindness was a language." The concept frames the brush's history but does not shape on-page tactics or choices. The painter "didn't care about the words"—the element is acknowledged then set aside. Present but ornamental; no middle development or closure participation. Functional background detail, replaceable with another relic motif.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Methodically hopeful: the adverb "methodically" appears once in "She painted them methodically, hopefully." The trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates method constraining hope or vice versa. The systematic painting of multiple faces could illustrate method, but the text does not show hopeful impulse in tension with methodical discipline—they are simply paired descriptors. No cost, no friction. Present, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Rouse: "The moonlight had roused something in her—not just the brush, but the quiet certainty." Appears once, late (final third), in summary reflection. The element is told rather than shown; we do not witness the moment of rousing, only its aftermath. The rousing does not create a turn—it describes the painter's already-present state. No earlier setup; no causal link to a choice. Summary-only, late arrival, swappable with "awakened" or "stirred."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Via daydreams sparked by moonlight: the method is present (she paints "the ones she dreamed of when the moon was waxing") and moonlight permeates the text. However, the mechanics are vague—daydreams are described as content (vivid strangers) but not as a distinct process that the moonlight triggers. The waxing moon is mentioned twice; its causal role in sparking daydreams is asserted, not dramatized. Setup weak, middle mention present, closure participation indirect (moonlight in final image). Functional but replaceable backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse in smog-choked city: vivid and present throughout. The greenhouse provides isolation, warmth, and contrast to the groaning city below; the glass panes fog with breath, the smog seals the rooftops. The setting constrains the painter's nocturnal ritual and charges the atmosphere. However, it does not alter a key tactic or force a choice—she could paint anywhere quiet. Strong setup, atmospheric development, closure participation (moonlight through roof). Borderline high 6s: setting pressures mood but not decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Under a waxing moon's glow: the waxing moon is named twice (daydreams "when the moon was waxing," final paragraph "the moon climbed higher"). Moonlight is pervasive and charges the ending image. However, "waxing" as a timeframe is not tracked—no sense of urgency, no tightening window. The phase functions as thematic backdrop (growth, hope) rather than a clock that alters tactics. Present, coherent, but does not constrain timing of choices. Mid-band for atmospheric contribution without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To prove that strangers remember kindness: the motivation is stated ("What if it was just waiting for someone to remember") and drives the action (painting faces of kind strangers, planning to distribute portraits). However, "prove" implies a test, and none occurs on the page—no stranger responds, no kindness is dramatized in the present. The motivation is told and enacted through solitary ritual, not conflicted or tested. Setup clear, action aligned, but no friction or visible cost tied to the proving. Functional, one-note.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Saffron quiet: "saffron" appears once ("sour yellow haze"), later the greenhouse hums "with something like possibility," and the final image is "quiet certainty" and warmth. The tone is coherent—muted, meditative, nocturnal—and modulates subtly from fatigue to peace. "Saffron" as a descriptor is brief; "quiet" is more sustained. The tone supports the ending's warmth but does not shift with pressure or charge a reversal. Coherent, present, atmospheric; does not drive a turn.</comment>
