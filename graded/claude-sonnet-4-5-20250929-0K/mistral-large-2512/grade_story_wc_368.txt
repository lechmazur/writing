<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dye master's watchfulness and post-surgery restlessness are established, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation rather than embodied contradiction. The donor heart functions more as a poetic premise than a lived constraint that forces micro-choices. The traveler's arrival introduces pressure, but her role remains primarily catalytic; the dye master's final realization ("his search was over") reads as declared epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory texture and metaphoric recurrence (morpho wing, light trails, map symbols) toward a final image where the map shimmers. Orientation is anchored early (tea house, dye master, valley). However, the closure lacks felt cost—the search ending feels like intellectual recognition rather than a foreclosed path or stake reweighted with pressure. The night conversation and dawn map transformation offer a tonal shift but no decisive action or visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house with bamboo stilts, granite slab, and rice-paper walls creates vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail (valley mist, moonlight through the wing, sun trails) is selective and purposeful. The tea house setting constrains observation but does not shape a concrete choice at closure—the protagonist watches rather than acts. The morpho wing as micro-object charges multiple beats and the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding "why some people magnetize stories"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The traveler's arrival introduces complication, and the map's symbols align with the sun trails, creating one meaningful deepening. However, no reversal forecloses options; the dye master's realization at dawn involves no trade-off or visible cost. The piece accumulates texture but does not tighten choices or demonstrate agency with consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (iridescence, stories that cling, light that catches) emerges organically from imagery rather than statement. The morpho wing's shifting blue and the storyteller's line about glowing "when the light hits them just right" recur without being forced. The donor heart and valley-mist setting create resonance. However, the ending offers an aesthetic realization—"not in the stories themselves, but in the way they clung to the world"—that reads more as platitude than a non-literal answer earned through conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; the dye master's perceptual signature (sharp eyes, tracing patterns, watching sun trails) is consistent. Dialogue between dye master and traveler carries subtext and advances knowledge ("You're trying to illuminate something"). The prose maintains a lyric register with controlled diction ("caution... that was also an invitation," "iridescent and quietly explosive"). Slight register drift into abstract philosophizing ("quiet restlessness," "quietly explosive") feels voice-motivated rather than jarring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (heron stilts, sleeping giant valley, breathing wing) is vivid and coherent. Information density is high in setting description. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Some people are like that too" echoes "Some people magnetize stories because they're like this"; the morpho's "warning that was also an invitation" and "come closer, but not too close" restate the same idea. Template cadence in exposition ("He had spent the winter tracking... watching how...") slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination of floating tea house, morpho wing iridescence, and donor heart creates a fresh synthesis. The sun-trail tracking method and map of story-gathering sites offer specific, non-obvious angles. However, the thematic resolution—stories as iridescent phenomena that "cling to the world"—feels derivative of common craft-essay metaphors. The piece avoids template plot beats but risks middle-ground safety by resolving into aesthetic observation rather than a bold choice with irreversible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dye master is present throughout and his watchfulness frames all beats. He traces the wing (beat 1), recognizes the traveler (beat 2), studies the map (beat 3), and holds the wing to moonlight (beat 4). However, his choices are observational rather than decision-driven; he does not act to alter tactics or pay a cost. The final realization ("his search was over") is internal and does not foreclose a path on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in four distinct beats: opening (dye master tracing it), backstory (storyteller's gift and explanation), map scene (recognized as pigment source), and climax (held to moonlight, iridescence flaring). It returns with reweighted meaning at closure, where its breathing shimmer mirrors the map's symbols. The wing constrains past dye experiments (fleeting, irreplicable colors) and charges the final image, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is signaled through the morpho's behavior ("flashed its blue only when threatened, a warning that was also an invitation") and the storyteller's line about people who "glow when the light hits them just right." The concept shapes the dye master's interpretive frame and thematic stance but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter on-page options. It functions more as theme than as a causal force, capping the score in mid-band despite clear setup and closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears twice: the tea house "seemed to hover between stillness and flight" and the ending ("iridescent and quietly explosive"). The attribute is applied as metaphoric label rather than a trait that enables or constrains action. No on-page moment demonstrates the dye master acting explosively or his restraint costing him an opportunity. The lyric reprise reweights tone but does not show visible cost, placing the score in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is explicit in the traveler's line ("You're trying to illuminate something") and implicit in the sun-trail tracking and map's glowing symbols. The dye master's winter search for light patterns and the dawn shimmer of the map tie multiple beats to this action. However, the action does not redefine options at closure—the map shimmers on its own rather than through the dye master's agency. The element shapes the dominant stake but does not drive a decisive turn, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" is signaled in the winter exposition and directly linked to the map's glowing symbols ("The symbols followed the sun trails he had been tracking"). The method matters to the middle reveal (the alignment of paths and stories) and primes the dawn shimmer. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how he tracked, what tools or observations he used—and the method does not constrain tactics or require a choice under pressure. Functional but not deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house anchors all action and provides vivid micro-setting (granite slab, bamboo stilts, rice-paper walls, sun-painted floors). Its "quiet explosiveness" and suspension "between stillness and flight" mirror the dye master's internal state. The balcony stages the night conversation. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—the protagonist could reach the same realization elsewhere. The space is atmospheric and thematically resonant but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After receiving the donor heart" is mentioned once ("three months since the donor heart settled into his chest") and linked to the dye master's "quiet restlessness" and search for meaning. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—no urgency or clock pressure is dramatized. The donor heart functions as thematic backstory rather than a live constraint on tactics. The element is present and logically integrated but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation ("to learn why some people magnetize stories") is stated in the opening restlessness, explored through winter sun-trail tracking, and addressed in the traveler conversation and final realization. However, the desire remains abstract and intellectual—no on-page moment shows the dye master sacrificing something to pursue this knowledge or facing friction between this want and another cost. The motivation frames the story but is not dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" is sustained through lyric diction ("valley stretched out below them like a sleeping giant," "dreams don't disappear... they just become part of the mist," "first hints of color in a dye bath"). Tone modulates subtly from solitary observation to collaborative discovery during the night conversation, then to quiet awe at dawn. The final image ("iridescent and quietly explosive") charges closure with tonal coherence. One of the strongest integrations; tone supports rather than dictates the accumulative design.</comment>
