<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (finding where unused love is stored) is clear and drives her method, but her interiority leans heavily on declarative exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The psychometry scene offers sensory detail ("weight of a held breath") yet the character's emotional arc remains relatively smooth—she moves from waiting to vision to promise without meaningful internal friction. The vision of the star and composer provides backstory texture, but Mira's own stakes feel more intellectual than viscerally conflicted. The ending choice (reaching for the pen) arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that would elevate the renunciation or decision into Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mira, Orpheum booth, three nights in) land early and clearly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: psychometry reading deepens from touch to vision to projector activation, building pressure through sensory intensification. However, the closure moment—"The ink was still wet"—gestures toward a conceptual repricing (the song and letters exist across time) but the cost remains oblique; we see no tangible sacrifice, forfeited option, or visible consequence that reweights Mira's situation on the page. The projector whirring "on its own" and the pen's wet ink suggest magical payoff without dramatized friction, reducing closure to a moment of discovery rather than a reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors: celluloid/dust scent, dormant gears "like a heart in hibernation," film perforations traced by hand. The setting constrains Mira's method (psychometry requires the booth's "liminal pocket") and provides the projector that activates at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (film strip on lap, booth humming) functions as both tool and environment, meeting the 9+ gate test by shaping the closure beat when light spills through the film.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love and forgotten songs are stored—is signaled early and drives Mira's psychometry work. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: touch → vision → projector activation, which tightens knowledge and narrows Mira's search to "the storage place…behind the screen." Yet the escalation is largely internal revelation without visible cost or tradeoff; Mira encounters no resistance, makes no sacrifice, and the film strip's blackening edge is noted but doesn't alter her tactics. The ending promise ("I'll find you…I'll bring the tune back") followed by the song appearing "all along" deflates the pressure rather than charging it with consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central question—"Where do the songs go when the music stops?"—emerges through concrete particulars (film strip, forgotten lyrics, the star's mouthed melody) and avoids overt moralizing. The final image (lyrics cast on the wall, wet ink in the stolen pen) reweights prior material with a non-literal answer: the song exists in a "vast, echoing cavity" accessed through psychometry, not lost but waiting. The thematic resonance (unused love pooling like "liquid silver," letters never drying) is textured and specific, though the ease of discovery—"It just needed someone to listen"—borders on sentimental summarization. The piece embraces ambiguity (the vision's ontological status) without confusion, and the "storage place" concept integrates with Mira's method rather than arriving as thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature: she notices "hollows between breaths" and "gaps where emotions pooled," filtering the world through her crystal-gazer lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("Not with heat, but with *pressure*"), with purposeful compression in lines like "a hushed thunder in the cramped space." The italicized emphasis (*remembered*, *pressure*, *see*, *shape*) reads as character-particular urgency rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from sensory observation to visionary immersion. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She could *see* it now") are sparse and justified by the psychometry premise. One minor slip: "her voice low, a hushed thunder" externalizes voice in a solo scene where no listener exists, creating a slight POV leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong imagery: "emotions pooled like water in cracked pavement," "the weight of the unsaid." Sentence structure modulates purposefully between longer descriptive passages and shorter action beats. However, template cadence appears in multiple paragraph openings: "She had spent…," "She was here…," "She just had to…," "She closed her eyes…," "She could *see*…," "She reached for…," creating a repetitive subject-verb stem pattern across beats (−0.5 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack). Additionally, "The film strip [verb]" recurs three times in close proximity without reweighting. Information density is high, no loops or paraphrase redundancy appear, and figurative language remains controlled. The scaffold stems cluster but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image materially.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry reading to locate "where unused love is stored"—offers a fresh synthesis of silent-film nostalgia, paranormal method, and metaphysical question. The projection booth as a "liminal pocket" and the lyrics-searching-for-tune conceit are specific and non-generic. However, the emotional arc (lone seeker finds hidden answer through vision) follows a template quest structure, and the resolution lacks a non-obvious turn: the song was "here all along," discovered without complication or tradeoff. The wet-ink pen at closure gestures toward temporal paradox but doesn't fully commit to its implications. Transformation test: swapping psychometry for another mystical method and changing the medium from film to music box would leave the arc intact, suggesting mid-range originality. The piece synthesizes existing paranormal-romance and forgotten-art tropes through vivid sensory detail rather than structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (crystal gazer) is present from the opening and drives all major beats: she chooses to wait in the booth, performs psychometry on the film, interprets the vision, and reaches for the pen at closure. Her decisions (touching the film, leaning into the vision, promising to find the tune) shape the progression. However, her choices face no resistance or tradeoff; she observes and accepts rather than navigating conflicting options. The character's method enables discovery but doesn't force a high-cost turn. Present in setup, development, and payoff, with causal involvement in two beats (psychometry attempt, closure reach), but lacks the visible cost required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The film strip is handled across multiple beats: described in setup ("brittle and yellowed"), traced during psychometry ("ran her fingers along the film's perforations"), warms under touch, curls and blackens at climax, then serves as medium when the projector casts lyrics through it. Its physical transformation (edges blackening) mirrors the vision's intensity. Present in setup, development, and payoff; appears in three distinct beats; causally enables the projector's final display. Narrowly misses ≥7.0 because the blackening is noted but doesn't alter Mira's tactics or impose a felt cost—she continues unhindered. Strong integration overall, but lacks the irreplaceability signal (a similar relic could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "goodbye letters" (reframed as "love letters…never sent") appear in setup as Mira's stated goal and resurface in the vision as "unused love pooled like liquid silver" with "letters…suspended in the dark." However, the concept remains abstract—no specific letter content is dramatized, and Mira doesn't interact with or retrieve any actual letters on the page. The climax focuses on the *song* and *lyrics* instead, which are distinct from the letters premise. The letters shape Mira's motivation but don't constrain a choice or alter tactics; they're a thematic echo rather than a causal force. Present in setup and development (vision), but absent from closure participation, capping the score per the missing-closure-participation gate at 2.8. The piece delivers on "forgotten lyrics" more than "goodbye letters," suggesting prompt drift. Functional but replaceable and not integral to the ending's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is signaled through Mira's ability to see "spaces: the hollows between breaths, the gaps where emotions pooled" and later to perceive "a *shape*—a vast, echoing cavity behind the screen" during the vision. The trait enables her psychometry reading and structures her climactic discovery. However, it functions as perceptual flavor rather than a constraint with cost; Mira's spatial sight succeeds without friction, and no on-page action demonstrates a tradeoff (e.g., disorientation, exhaustion, or missed detail). Present in setup (definition of "crystal gazer"), development (vision of the cavity), and implicit at closure (the projector's light spills "through" space). Eligible above the two-gate floor, but lacks the visible cost or tactical constraint required for ≥7.0. Enabling rather than limiting.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Incubate" is signaled in setup: "spent the last three nights here…waiting for the film strip to speak" and "chosen it to incubate her plan." The booth functions as an incubation space where the vision gestates and the projector eventually "whirrs to life." The action shapes the premise (waiting/incubating versus active search) and explains Mira's passive positioning. However, the incubation itself doesn't drive a turn—Mira's psychometry touch, not the passage of three nights, triggers the vision. The nights of waiting could be compressed to minutes without breaking the closure. Present in setup and development (implicit in the booth's "liminal" properties), with thematic payoff at closure ("The song had been here all along"). Functional but somewhat replaceable; a shorter waiting period or immediate reading would work with minor edits. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-5s, and the booth-as-incubator image charges the final moment, pushing toward 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is introduced in setup ("touching an object and letting it touch her back"), demonstrated in the central beat (Mira traces the film's perforations, feels "pressure," and the vision unfolds), and its mechanics matter: the touch-based method requires the physical film and the booth's "liminal pocket" to access the past. The method enables the core turn (vision of the star and composer) and is causally active at closure when the projector responds to Mira's touch-work, casting the lyrics. Present in setup, development (drives the vision beat), and payoff (projector activation completes the reading). The method is irreplaceable—switching to tarot or clairvoyance would require rewriting the film-touch dynamic. Causal pressure across two beats and closure linkage push it solidly into the ≥7.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth is established in the opening line, described with concrete sensory detail (celluloid/dust scent, dormant projector gears, wool blanket, cramped space), and identified as "a liminal pocket where time stretched thin"—a necessary condition for Mira's psychometry. The booth supplies the film strip and projector, both essential to the closure beat. The setting constrains Mira's method (she must be *here* to access the vision) and provides the tool (projector) that activates at the ending, casting the lyrics and charging the final image. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (the booth's properties enable the vision), and payoff (projector whirs, light spills). The booth is irreplaceable; no other setting would supply the film, projector, and liminal conditions. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage elevate it into the ≥7.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" is conceptually present: Mira is searching for the tune to match the lyrics she found in the script. However, time itself is not dramatized as a constraint—no ticking clock, no urgency beyond Mira's internal drive, and the "three nights" of waiting function as setup rather than pressure. The phrase "search for tune" anthropomorphizes the lyrics poetically but doesn't translate into a live deadline or temporal tightening on the page. The piece's rhythm is meditative rather than time-pressured. Present thematically in setup and development (the search is ongoing), but time doesn't narrow Mira's options or force a faster choice. The temporal frame is vague and untracked within the scene. Functional as premise but replaceable; the story would work identically if Mira arrived tonight for the first time. Caps at ~4.8 due to missing middle development (time doesn't constrain a mid-scene choice) and lack of closure participation (the ending doesn't hinge on time running out).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is stated explicitly in setup ("She was here for the love letters…the ones never sent") and drives Mira's psychometry work. The vision reveals the storage place: "a vast, echoing cavity behind the screen, where the theater's unused love pooled like liquid silver." The motivation is dramatized through Mira's action (touching the film, leaning into the vision) and reaches the page at closure when she promises, "I'll find you…I'll bring the tune back." However, the motivation remains largely intellectual—there's no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. Mira doesn't sacrifice, lose, or forfeit anything to access the storage place; the vision arrives freely. Present in setup, development (the vision answers the question), and closure (the promise and projector activation). Causal involvement across beats and closure linkage push it into the mid-6s, but the lack of visible cost or conflicted choice (want versus fear, want versus need) caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tone "hushed thunder" is signaled in the climax: "her voice low, a hushed thunder in the cramped space." The oxymoron captures quiet intensity, and the piece sustains a low, reverent register ("the projection booth…smelled of celluloid and dust," "the booth hummed," "the booth trembled") punctuated by moments of visceral surge ("short, sharp bursts," "the projector whirred to life"). Tone modulates purposefully: meditative in setup, building in the vision sequence, then releasing in the projector activation. The final image (light spilling, lyrics dancing, wet ink) carries the hushed-thunder quality—quiet discovery charged with mythic weight. Coherent across turns and present in the closure image, meeting the gate for ≥6.0. The tone is somewhat ornamental (could be described differently without breaking story logic), preventing higher scores. Strong tonal control and closure presence elevate it into low-6s.</comment>
