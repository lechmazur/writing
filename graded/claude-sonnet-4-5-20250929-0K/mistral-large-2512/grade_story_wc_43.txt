<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows consistent interiority tied to his role as music therapist and friend, with the vinyl shard providing embodied memory. His "decisively kind" actions (setting guitar down, taking Lena's hand) track coherently through the scene. However, Lena's request to "hymn the mundane" feels slightly authorial rather than emerging from her established voice, and the final exchange lacks internal contradiction—Elias accepts each instruction smoothly without friction. The choice to reunify the vinyl pieces is presented cleanly but doesn't foreclose a competing path with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors (hospice room, post-blood-work call, twilight progression). Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vinyl shard recurs with reweighted meaning, and the song performance deepens the "scent of hope" motif into a charged goodbye. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lena's peaceful death and the reunified shards offer a before/after with felt cost (loss of the friend, acceptance of brokenness holding song). The cost is legible in Elias's "throat tight" and his vigil until twilight. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena hands over her shard, crystallizing the friendship and mortality stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" hospice room is anchored early with frosted glass, golden light, and "pulsing stillness," creating a distinct sensory envelope. The scent description (lavender, rain, vanilla) filters through the POV effectively. The vinyl shard and guitar are handled concretely (strap adjustment, setting case down, strumming). The room's atmosphere charges the final image of Elias staying "until the light outside faded into twilight." However, the setting remains largely static backdrop; it doesn't constrain a choice or supply resources that alter tactics, keeping it just below the higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—executing Lena's "flawless goodbye"—is signaled by the doctor's call and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through Lena's specific requests (the song about mundane things, the vinyl reunification), each narrowing Elias's performance into a more intimate farewell. The tightening is meaningful: the shift from generic "what do you want to hear?" to "hymn the mundane" forces a choice that tests his understanding of their friendship. The reunification of vinyl shards at the end forecloses the path of solitary grief, offering shared brokenness with felt cost (his tight throat, the vigil). Agency is present in Elias's acceptance and performance, though the lack of internal resistance keeps escalation from reaching the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely through the vinyl shard motif: "even broken things can hold a song" is earned by the objects' handling, the childhood memory, and the final reunification image. The request to "hymn the mundane" reweights the premise from grand farewell to quotidian reverence, and the "pulsing stillness" deepens into acceptance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the two shards "fitting" with "rough edges"—without stating a moral. However, Lena's instruction "Not to fix them—just to remember" edges toward thematic echo, nearly articulating the story's thesis. The lavender-and-rain "scent of hope" remains more decorative than structurally thematic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Elias remains stable and anchored in his perceptual signature (the vinyl shard, guitar strap, embodied memory). Lena's dialogue ("Hymn the mundane") carries distinct idiom and goal-driven subtext, contrasting with Elias's measured responses. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external action (entering the room) to interior memory (mother's song) to embodied emotion (tight throat). The prose rhythm shifts appropriately with pressure: short exchanges during the song request, slower cadence during the vigil. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the final image holds narrative stance without explaining.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (each paragraph advances situation, interiority, or motif). The vinyl shard recurs with purposeful compression, and the "pulsing stillness" phrase bookends effectively. However, minor loops appear: "the way" is used five times in Lena's speech about mundane images, creating template cadence in a key beat. The "scent of hope" description front-loads figurative language (lavender, rain, vanilla, "steeped in something gentle") without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond atmosphere. "Decisively kind" is told rather than shown in micro-actions. The final paragraph's "pulsing stillness" reprise works but borders on over-reliance on the opening phrase. These non-closure artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—music therapist performing a final song—is familiar hospice material, but the "hymn the mundane" instruction and the broken-vinyl motif offer specific, non-obvious angles. The request to reunify shards without fixing them transforms the cliché of "broken but beautiful" into a concrete, tactile choice. Emotional honesty in the throat-tightness and vigil avoids sentimentality. However, the "radiant haven above the clouds" framing, the "scent of hope," and the halo-like silver hair tilt toward stock imagery without sufficient POV-specific grounding. The song's content (tea, laugh, clouds) is told rather than sung on the page, missing a chance for fresh synthesis. The transformation test is borderline: swap names and the arc holds largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (serene hospice music therapist) is present throughout and his choices (bringing the guitar, playing the requested song, accepting the shard, staying until twilight) create the story's key beats. He is introduced early with embodied detail (adjusting guitar strap, vinyl shard in pocket). However, "serene" is asserted rather than tested under pressure; he moves smoothly through Lena's requests without internal friction or a moment where serenity must be earned or abandoned. His role as therapist constrains the song choice and the "decisively kind" actions, but the trait doesn't force a visible trade-off. Two gates (setup, closure participation) are met; middle development is present but not causally sharp. Band guidance and causal pressure suggest mid-5s; closure linkage (the vigil, the shard acceptance) lifts toward ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken vinyl record piece appears in three beats: opening (Elias's pocket, mother's memory), middle (implicit during the song as he thinks of it), and ending (Lena's matching piece, reunification instruction). It is handled concretely (fingers brushing, slipping into pocket, edges fitting) and its meaning reweights from solitary memory to shared brokenness. The reunification instruction shapes the closure image and forecloses solitary grief. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (jagged edges, mother's song) +0.6. Swappability friction −0.5 (another keepsake could work with edits). Total ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The scent of hope" is introduced early with vivid sensory detail (lavender, rain, vanilla) but remains atmospheric decoration. It does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or constrain choice. The phrase "pulsing stillness" bookends the story, but "scent of hope" itself does not return or reweight at closure. Setup gate met (+0.5), but no middle beat involvement, no closure participation, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Total ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is told in narration ("his movements decisively kind—no hesitation, no pity") but not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Elias's actions (settling into the chair, taking her hand, staying) are kind but not tested by competing pulls or friction. The trait is present and consistent but does not narrow options or enable a tactic under pressure. Setup gate met weakly (told in paragraph 6, past the first third), no middle constraint, no closure cost. Late introduction −0.4, label-only −0.5, ornamental −0.6. Total ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reunify" appears as Lena's final request and shapes the closure image: Elias slips the two shards into his pocket, their edges "rough but fitting." The action is signaled late (final third) but drives the ending's meaning (shared brokenness, not solitary grief). It forecloses the path of keeping the fragments separate. Setup gate missed (not introduced until near the end), closure linkage strong +1.5, specificity (the edges, the pocket placement) +0.6, cost connection (throat tight, vigil) +0.4. Late introduction −0.8, summary-only middle development −0.5. Total ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is signaled in dialogue midway ("Sing about the ordinary things") and shapes one key beat: the song Elias performs. The method is explained through Lena's list (coffee, rain, light on the kitchen floor) and Elias's execution (tea, laugh, clouds). However, the song itself is summarized ("weaving a melody around the simplest of images") rather than dramatized with lyrics or specific lines. Setup after first third −0.3, one-beat involvement +0.4, closure absent (the vigil and shards matter more), swappability −0.5 (another song type would work). Total ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Radiant haven above the clouds" is anchored early (paragraph 1) with frosted glass, golden light, and "pulsing stillness." The setting provides atmosphere and a spatial anchor but does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics. The room is static; Elias and Lena could execute the same farewell in any hospice room. Setup +0.6, no middle development, closure participation weak (twilight fading is temporal, not spatial), ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.7. Total ~4.6, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" anchors the temporal frame (hour before the scene, twilight at the end) but does not create a ticking clock or urgency. The doctor's call establishes that Lena is dying, but no countdown pressures Elias's choices. Time passes (song, conversation, vigil until twilight) without tightening decisions. Setup +0.5, no middle pressure, closure participation minimal (twilight is mood, not tactic), swappability −0.7. Total ~3.8, capped at 3.8 for generic temporal framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is Lena's explicit desire (paragraph 5) and frames Elias's actions (bringing the guitar, playing the requested song, accepting the shard). The motivation is stated early and sustained through the scene. However, "flawless" is not tested by friction or competing wants; Lena's requests are met smoothly without cost or complication. Setup +0.7, two-beat involvement (song, shard) +0.9, closure linkage (the peaceful death and reunification) +1.0, dramatized choice weak (no internal conflict) −0.6, told-only "flawless" label −0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("casting everything in a warm, pulsing stillness") and reprised in the final line ("until the radiant haven above the clouds became a place of quiet, pulsing stillness"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly: the opening stillness is atmospheric, the middle deepens with Lena's breathing and music, the ending stillness is charged with death and acceptance. However, the phrase itself is told rather than embodied through rhythm or syntax shifts. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, coherence across turns +0.8, static mid-section (no tone modulation during the song) −0.5, lyric reprise effect +0.4. Total ~6.1.</comment>
