<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is consistent and his embodied fear of dissolution reads concretely ("lungs burning"). The pattern-matching choice at the end grows from his established compulsion to stitch meaning, but the final decision arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost—he simply proceeds. The mentor's vanishing and Elias's near-suicide are told rather than dramatized, weakening the weight of his scars. "Kintsugi intentions" and the quilting metaphor are labeled more than enacted in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern break via pockmark-to-scar matching reweights the stake). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—statue splitting and memories flooding back—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the option to dissolve is foreclosed, the workshop steadies). Cost is felt in the gasped breath and the image of gold-filled cracks, though the emotional price could be sharper. The final beat earns its turn through the established pattern of scars and pockmarks, and the key charm's glow signals the shift. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The acid sea, rusted struts, and grinding gears create a vivid, coherent setting that constrains Elias (platform edge, fumes, tilting workshop). The workshop's mechanical instability pressures his choices and the final steadying charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (metallic air, hissing fumes). The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting, shaping the central action. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from fragments—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias discovers the pockmark-scar map, narrowing his approach from abstract alchemy to concrete pattern-matching. The final beat (pressing charm to statue) forecloses passivity and dissolves the threat of oblivion, but the agency feels slightly passive: the statue splits "with purpose" and memories "flood back" rather than Elias extracting them through struggle. Cost is present in the breath held and the workshop's shudder, meeting the threshold for this band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—repair and memory as resistance to oblivion—emerges from particulars (scars, pockmarks, gold) without overt statement. The kintsugi concept is woven into action (stitching fragments, gold filling cracks) and the final image of liquid gold answers the opening's fear of evaporation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the alignment of scars and pockmarks, the mentor's erasure, and the workshop's breath-holding rhythm. The final image reweights the opening fragments as a coherent whole, resonant and non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and clean. The prose has distinct texture ("iron bones creaking," "spectral fingers," "quilts of half-remembered dreams") that reflects Elias's alchemical lens. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, several filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("wasn't sure," "had come here to conjure," "had to make sense") and the perceptual signature—while consistent—leans toward elevated diction ("pockmarked with centuries of neglect") that occasionally drifts from immediate crisis perception. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("acid sea licked," "gears turned with a slow, grinding rhythm"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "make sense of the fragments" / "piece together" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure, and "half-remembered dreams" / "memories he couldn't quite narrate" / "things he'd lost, the things he'd tried to forget" cycles synonym churn. The final beat is clear, but filter-verb stacks ("wasn't sure," "had never mastered," "couldn't quite narrate") in mid-story beats dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("shadow that stretched longer," "spectral fingers") reduce freshness. No severe artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 for loops and filters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of kintsugi philosophy, memory quilting, and acid-sea alchemy is specific and thematically coherent. The pockmark-as-map turn is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars (scars, statue, key charm). However, the premise—alchemist on a failing structure confronting memory fragments—echoes familiar SFF templates (isolated craftsperson, relic unlocks past, literal golden repair). The ending's liquid-gold imagery is apt but leans on the prompt's kintsugi label rather than transforming it through lived tension. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure but does not fully escape genre safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choice to press the charm to the statue at the end is a key turn. He appears in the opening, middle pattern-matching beat, and final closure action (all three gates). However, his uncertainty is more observed than enacted in choices under pressure: he kneels, traces, grips, scrambles for notes—reactive gestures. The final act (pressing charm, beginning to narrate) alters the outcome, but the decision feels abrupt rather than a trade-off. Two beats (matching pockmarks, pressing charm) involve him causally. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability (any uncertain craftsperson could fill the role with minor edits) −0.6, and ornamental interiority in mid-story −0.4. Base ~6.2, net 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The key ring charm with cracked vial appears in the opening (setup), is turned over and examined mid-story (development beat), and is pressed to the statue's chest at closure (payoff—all three gates). It glows faintly as a signal and its liquid contents ("mercury or evaporated") frame uncertainty. The charm enables the final turn when pressed to the pockmark circle, but its exact properties (why it glows, what the liquid does) remain vague, reducing irreplaceability—a similar talisman could substitute. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but late clarification (glow appears only in final third) −0.3 and moderate swappability −0.5. Base ~6.9, net 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi is named once by the mentor and the final image (liquid gold filling cracks) visually echoes it. The concept appears in setup (mentor's line) and at closure (gold splitting the statue), meeting two gates but missing middle development—cap 6.0. However, the concept is never dramatized as a method or constraint that shapes Elias's choices; it remains thematic backdrop. The final gold-filling is consequence, not tactic. Early mention +0.4, closure image +0.8, but ornamental use (no on-page repair attempt or tactical application) −1.0 and summary-only −0.5. Base ~4.7, cap 6.0, net 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together" is applied metaphorically (scars as quilt, fragments stitched) but never constrains an action or imposes a visible cost. It appears in setup ("quilt of half-remembered dreams") and in the final image (memories "stitched together with threads of light"), meeting two gates—eligible to ~6.0. The attribute is label-only; Elias does not choose one memory over another or pay a price for assembly. Early signal +0.4, closure reprise +0.7, but label-only trait −0.6, swappability (any metaphor of assembly works) −0.6, and no cost connection −0.3. Base ~5.4, net 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Narrate" appears late (final third) when Elias "began to narrate—not in words, but in the language of scars and pockmarks," triggering the statue's transformation. It is the climactic action that completes the closure, meeting payoff but missing setup and middle—missing-setup cap 4.6. However, the action drives the major turn (memories flood back, workshop steadies), showing high causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, and irreplaceability (only narration unlocks the vessel) +0.6. Late introduction −0.8. Base ~7.1, cap 4.6 enforced, but lyric allowance (the seed "make sense of it" / "thread that connected" primes narration as solution) nudges the effective cap to ~6.9 given transformation strength. Net 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pockmark-matching method is discovered in the middle (Elias sees one pockmark matches a wrist scar, then the pattern emerges) and executed at closure (pressing charm to the pockmark circle). Setup is implicit (statue and scars present early), development is the discovery beat, payoff is the charm-press—all three gates. The method shapes two beats (discovery, application) and is irreplaceable (only this pattern opens the vessel). Early implicit signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (narrows approach from vague alchemy to concrete map-reading) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. No major frictions. Base ~7.2, net 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The workshop is anchored in the opening and pressures Elias throughout: it groans, tilts, threatens to fall into the acid sea. The gears' rhythm mirrors his breath-holding, the platform edge tempts dissolution, and the final steadying signals resolution. Present in setup, development (tilting pressures his urgency), and payoff (workshop steadies)—all three gates. The acid sea and gears constrain movement and heighten stakes. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (environment's instability forces choices) +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability (the specific floating/tilting mechanic matters) +0.7. Base ~8.0, net 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between breaths held underwater" appears metaphorically ("breath held like a diver," "lungs burning," "hadn't moved in hours") but does not function as a live clock. Elias holds his breath figuratively, not literally, and no countdown or tightening window alters his tactics. Present in setup and closure image (breath released as workshop steadies), meeting two gates—eligible to ~6.0. However, the element is ornamental; time does not constrain. Early signal +0.4, closure reprise +0.5, but ornamental use −1.0, swappability (any slow-pressure metaphor works) −0.6. Base ~4.3, net 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated explicitly in the opening and drives Elias's pattern-seeking and final act. Present in setup, implicit in the middle discovery (matching pockmarks answers the question), and resolved at closure (meaning conjured via gold-filled statue). All three gates. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction: no scene where Elias must choose between conjuring meaning and another want. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only (no visible trade-off) −0.7, moderate swappability −0.4. Base ~6.8, net 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dire enchantment" is coherent from the opening (groaning workshop, acid sea, hollow statue eyes) through the climax (shuddering, churning sea, gold-split statue). Tone modulates with pressure: slow grinding dread in the opening, urgency in the discovery, wonder in the closure. Present in setup, development, and payoff—all three gates. Tone charges the final image (gold, light, harmony after acid and rust). Early establishment +0.7, coherence across beats +1.0, closure charge +1.2, specificity (dire + enchantment balance maintained) +0.5. Minor stock metaphor overlap (spectral fingers) −0.3. Base ~7.4, net 7.1.</comment>
