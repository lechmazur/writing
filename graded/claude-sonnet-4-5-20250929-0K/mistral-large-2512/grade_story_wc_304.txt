<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's profession is established but her interiority remains abstract—"quiet defiance of holding on" and "heart aching with the beauty" are label-only emotions rather than embodied contradictions. The ritual with the emerald chip proceeds without internal friction or cost to her; she succeeds cleanly, which flattens agency. The figure's revival feels like a plot event rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No visible renunciation or trade-off emerges on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: aurora imagery, frost motifs, and the emerald chip recur, and the ending reprises "threshold of stillness" and "lucidly watchful" with modest deepening. However, no decisive change or visible cost lands—the figure revives, Liora smiles, and the story closes on affirmation without foreclosing a path. The Resonant Reconfiguration is asserted ("the threshold held") but not dramatized with a felt price. Cost-proof test fails: no line shows what Liora loses or what option vanishes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto, aurora, and ice provide vivid sensory anchors that recur and modulate through the piece. The emerald chip's glow is filtered through Liora's professional attention. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; no spatial constraint or environmental feature forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome. The final aurora flare charges the closure image but does not constrain agency, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion—is signaled early. The ritual proceeds smoothly: Liora presses the chip to the figure's lips, the figure revives, and the emerald dims. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the one complication (the figure's fading spark) is resolved without visible cost or trade-off. The ending affirms Liora's mission rather than testing it, so escalation under the Accumulative lens remains modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of beauty and death as companions emerges through image and action. The phrase "not to cheat death, but to remind the living of its radiant hush" approaches direct statement but stays within character reflection. The final image—emerald chip placed on the figure's chest—reprises the threshold motif with modest resonance. However, the ending offers affirmation rather than a non-literal answer with cost, so thematic depth plateaus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("silver thread," "fractured dreams," "radiant hush") that fits the meditative voice and grotto setting. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective, filtering the scene through Liora's professional lens ("patterns in the static of existence"). Minor slips: "quiet defiance of holding on" and "heart aching with the beauty" lean toward therapy-speak in peak beats, applying a small deduction. No dialogue present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. Paraphrase loops appear: "beauty and death were not opposites but companions" restates the earlier "beautician mortician" tension without added pressure; "the threshold held" is reprised three times in the final third with minimal variation. Template cadence: "She had come... She had spent... She had learned... She had found" clusters in early paragraphs. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 but do not obscure the closure image. Information density is modest; many sentences restate atmosphere rather than advance stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician hybrid and skyborne grotto offer a fresh synthesis. However, the core arc—magical healer performs ritual, succeeds, finds renewed purpose—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific cost or moral calculus. The emerald chip functions as a generic magic token; its properties do not constrain or complicate the ritual. The ending affirms rather than complicates, and no turn arrives from Liora's established pattern or flaw. Specificity in setting and voice partially offset the derivative stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and performs the ritual, but her choices do not create key turns. She decides to use the emerald chip, but the ritual proceeds without friction or tactical adjustment. The figure's revival happens to her rather than through a contested decision. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development (a choice that alters tactics) is weak, capping the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears in four beats: Liora holds it in the opening, presses it to the figure's lips during the ritual, it pulses and dims as the figure revives, and she places it on the figure's chest at the end. It enables the ritual and its dimming marks the reprieve, so causal pressure is present. However, its properties are generic (captures light, infuses essence) and could be replaced by a similar magical object without breaking story logic. Early signal +0.5, multiple beats +0.9, causal role +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability −0.6 and mild specificity debt −0.3 yields ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The threshold of stillness is announced in the title phrase and reprised in the final paragraph ("the threshold of stillness had held"). It frames the grotto as a liminal space and the ritual as holding back oblivion. However, it does not constrain Liora's tactics or force a choice; it functions primarily as thematic atmosphere. Setup present, lyric reprise present, but no middle beat where it narrows options. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, landing near 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears twice: "she was lucidly watchful" in the second paragraph and "lucidly watchful, infusing the dark with light" in the final line. Both are label-only; no on-page action or tactical adjustment demonstrates the trait's cost or constraint. It describes her stance but does not enable or foreclose a move. Swappability with "vigilant" or "attentive" is high. Setup weak, closure reprise present but ornamental, no causal work, capped at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Infuse is the core action: Liora whispers words to "infuse the fading essence with the emerald's captured light." The ritual depends on this verb, and the final line reprises "infusing the dark with light." However, the mechanics are vague, the act proceeds without complication, and a near-synonym ("channel," "transfer") could replace it with minor edits. Setup +0.5, causal role +0.6, closure reprise +0.8, minus swappability −0.5 and summary-only mechanics −0.4 yields ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" appears once in the third paragraph as backstory exposition ("Liora had spent years finding patterns in the static of existence"). It does not shape her on-page choices or the ritual's tactics; the emerald chip and whispered words drive the action. Late first appearance (second paragraph) −0.3, ornamental use −0.7, summary-only −0.4, no causal work, capped near 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is established in the opening and recurs throughout, anchoring the setting with vivid sensory detail. The aurora modulates (violet to indigo, flares emerald and gold, dims to twilight) in step with the ritual. However, the setting does not constrain Liora's tactics or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it remains atmospheric. Early signal +0.6, presence across beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus ornamental function −0.8 and no causal constraint −0.5 yields ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is signaled in the title and stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph. Liora's ritual pursues this desire and succeeds. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction or competing wants; no cost or internal conflict tests her commitment. Setup strong, one beat (the ritual) enacts it, closure affirms it. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, minus told-only execution −0.7 and no friction −0.4 yields ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" appears in the fourth paragraph ("their last breaths dissolving into the aurora's radiant hush") and the final third ("to remind the living of its radiant hush"). The tone is consistently meditative and lyric, with elevated diction and slow pacing that match the grotto's stillness. The aurora's brightening and dimming modulate intensity without breaking coherence. The final image (Liora standing, shadow stretching) sustains the tone. Early signal +0.5, coherence across beats +0.8, closure charge +0.8, minus static mood in middle −0.4 yields ~6.7.</comment>
