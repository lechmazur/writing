<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's obsession is clearly stated but her interior choices rarely reflect genuine contradiction or cost. The grandmother's memory offers mild color, but the "understanding" at the cathedral arrives as a passive epiphany ("She understood then, not with her mind but with something deeper") without embodied friction or a foreclosed path. The final flower addition feels like symbolic completion rather than a choice that alters her stance with visible price. Interiority leans abstract ("tugged at her like the pull of the moon") without character-specific embodiment under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: images (postcards, flowers, stained glass) layer toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the pavilion opening; no penalty. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—darkness as illumination, thaw as beginning—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the protagonist adds a flower to her mural without a felt sacrifice or foreclosed option on the page. One tightening (postcards → cathedral → pavilion return) reweights the dominant question, meeting minimal escalation, but the final image does not impose a legible emotional or tactical price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, cathedral, and autumn/winter transition are vivid and coherent. The stained-glass detail ("hidden layers… tiny, almost invisible night-blooming flowers") is selective and purposeful. The pavilion returns at closure and provides the stage for the final brushstroke, constraining the protagonist's physical act. Sensory detail (scent of damp earth, candlelight casting shapes) reflects POV attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations with clean transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the postcards spread across the altar and the stained-glass flowers "seemed to glow brighter," narrowing interpretive options toward the epiphany. However, the protagonist's agency is passive observation and summary insight rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No visible trade-off or tactical cost; the ending grants resolution without renunciation or endurance that constrains later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—darkness as its own illumination, endings as beginnings—emerges from image patterns (night-blooming flowers, melting snow, twilight mural) rather than statement. The grandmother's line primes the conceptual answer without heavy-handed moralizing. The final brushstroke offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Yet the resolution feels tidy and declarative ("And for the first time, that was enough"), edging toward satisfaction without lasting ambiguity or earned friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Liora's focus on patterns, unseen layers) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "as if alive") appear in peak beats but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue to assess. Prose rhythm modulates appropriately across transit and reflective beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally solid; sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loops: "quietly driven" appears twice in similar phrasing; "spread across" recurs (lap, altar); "seemed to" clusters in the cathedral beat without clear pattern payoff. Figurative density is high ("honey in the dim autumn light," "whisper against the silence," "umbral tenderness") with some mixed metaphors (flowers "pulse" and "tremble" simultaneously). No major scaffold or pronoun confusion. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty but reflective passages occasionally restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The night-blooming flower question and hidden stained-glass layers offer a modest fresh angle, but the epistemic journey (searching clues → epiphany → symbolic completion) follows a familiar template. The grandmother's wisdom and postcard map are stock discovery mechanisms. Emotional arc (confusion → quiet revelation → satisfaction) resolves neatly without lasting friction or a bold structural risk. Specificity (cereus, moonflowers, Gethsemane scene) elevates texture but does not transform the underlying frame. The piece executes competently within genre conventions without a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her occupation (mural artist) frames the opening and closing actions. She paints the pavilion walls, studies the cathedral glass, spreads postcards, and adds a final flower. However, these are largely observational and symbolic acts; no key turn depends on a difficult choice she makes under pressure. The epiphany arrives passively ("She understood then") rather than through a decision that narrows options. Functional but her role as artist does not drive causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The postcards appear in three beats: lap at pavilion, tucked in pocket, spread on altar. Their content (messages about moonflowers, village in mountains) provides clues that inform the epiphany. The altar spread is the strongest beat, where their pattern ("all of them spoke of the same quiet miracle") helps trigger understanding. They return with reweighted meaning but do not constrain a choice or impose cost. Early signal and multi-beat use earn mid-band; lack of causal pressure or closure cost limits ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears once as a transition phrase ("A dawning hush settled over the town") bridging autumn and winter. It contributes atmospheric texture but does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or create on-page pressure. The concept remains ornamental and could be removed without structural loss. Present but not integrated into character goal or closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is mentioned twice: once as a character label ("She was quietly driven, her obsession… etched into every piece") and again near the end ("she, quietly driven, had been searching"). It describes Liora's temperament but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains asserted rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option. Label-only integration caps score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears once ("Liora had come here to reckon with something she couldn't name") as a framing verb for her investigative impulse. The action encompasses her study of postcards and cathedral glass, but the verb itself is abstract and does not define a specific, irreplaceable tactic. The epistemic journey could be described with "understand," "discover," or "confront" with minimal edit. One-beat thematic signal without causal specificity or closure participation places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "hidden layers of etched glass in the cathedral window" are signaled early (Liora has "spent hours studying them"), used in the cathedral beat where she presses close and the flowers "seemed to pulse," and referenced again at closure ("the flowers in the stained glass seemed to glow brighter"). The method shapes her investigative tactic and contributes to the epiphany mechanism. However, the mechanics remain vague (what exactly are "hidden layers"?) and the glass does not impose a constraint or cost. Three-gate presence with causal contribution but limited specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion frames the story: Liora sits beneath it at opening, departs to the cathedral, and returns for the final brushstroke. Its "wooden beams glowing like honey" and "sloped roof" provide vivid setting detail, and autumn light reinforces tone. The pavilion supplies the physical stage for the mural work, but it does not pressure choices or alter tactics. The cathedral does more causal work (the glass triggers epiphany). Early signal, closure return, and sensory specificity earn mid-band; lack of constraint or tactical friction limits ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the melting of winter's last snow" appears as a transition phrase and at the cathedral ("Across the melting of winter's last snow, the flowers in the stained glass seemed to glow brighter"). The timeframe establishes thaw as a thematic parallel (endings/beginnings) but does not create urgency or tighten decisions. The narrative unfolds in continuous present without a tracked clock or deadline that alters tactics. Two-gate presence (setup, closure echo) with thematic contribution but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The question "Why did some flowers bloom at night?" is introduced early, stated as haunting Liora since childhood, and drives her study of postcards and cathedral glass. The motivation sustains across beats and culminates in the epiphany. However, it remains intellectual curiosity without conflicting wants or visible cost; she never faces a choice between this pursuit and another path, and resolution grants understanding without sacrifice. Desire is clear and sustained but lacks friction or dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears once in the final image ("its petals unfurling in the umbral tenderness of the hour") and coheres with the story's tone: quiet, contemplative, twilight/shadow-focused. Diction throughout ("whisper," "ghostly petals," "cool and still") maintains a soft, shadowed register. Tone modulates subtly from searching (cathedral candle, pressing close) to resolution (steps lighter, quiet revelation). The phrase charges the closure image by naming the tonal synthesis. Coherence and closure linkage earn mid-to-upper band; single explicit use and lack of pressure modulation under stress limit ceiling.</comment>
