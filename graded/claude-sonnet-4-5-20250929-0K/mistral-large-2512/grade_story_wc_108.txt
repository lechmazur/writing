<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's phobia and stunt-double history are told rather than dramatized under pressure; the final "vulnerability isn't weakness" insight arrives as an assertion rather than emerging from on-page cost. The caretaker's recognition and his choked "I tried to protect you" gesture toward interiority but remain stock. The piece shows micro-choices (lunging forward, pressing the shell) but the emotional progression—from betrayal to "let's start over"—feels smoothed rather than contradictory or genuinely risky.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the photograph reveals the caretaker's role; Mira's "let's start over" crystallizes a stance), but the cost remains abstract—what path is foreclosed? The causality is functional: seashell whispers → desk → cast → floorboard → box → photo. However, the caretaker's sudden passivity (he "didn't move to stop her") and the convenient discovery sequence weaken escalation. Drive lens is Causal with sufficient linkage, though the final beat's emotional pivot lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted library anchors early with vivid specifics ("iron shelves groaning like a shipwrecked hull," "air smelled of damp paper and rust"). The cast and floorboard are handled as tools that enable the discovery, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, doorway, kneeling at floorboards). Yet the stars "burning brighter" at the end reads as metaphoric convenience rather than embodied environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the truth of Mira's origin—is signaled early and drives the discovery sequence. The confrontation with the caretaker introduces a reversal (he recognizes the shell, flinches), but his immediate capitulation deflates pressure. The final "let's start over" lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option; the photograph reveals information but does not force a high-cost choice. One meaningful tightening (the caretaker's arrival) exists, but escalation plateaus rather than crescendos.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power—is asserted in the penultimate paragraph ("vulnerability wasn't weakness. It was the only thing that had ever made her strong") rather than earned through on-page cost or embodied choice. The seashell, cast, and photograph accumulate as motifs but their symbolic weight is told. The ending's "stars burned brighter" and "they, too, had been waiting" reads as overt thematic signaling. The transformative betrayal premise is echoed but not explored with moral complexity or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; psychic distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("slithering through her fingers," "honed on the whetstone of necessity") but remains mostly grounded. The caretaker's dialogue ("You shouldn't be here") and Mira's reply feel natural. Internal voice is character-specific (the stunt-double past, the phobia metaphor "gnawed at her ribs like a trapped rat"). No head-hopping. Minor: "firmly adaptive" arrives as exposition rather than shown syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening sentences are textured. Some stock metaphors appear: "her pulse hammering in her throat," "her fear a living thing," "the betrayal was transformative." The phrase "firmly adaptive, bending without snapping" reads as scaffold exposition. "The truth had unraveled her" followed by "it had sharpened her" loops the transformation concept without adding pressure. Clarity is high; no major loops in peak beats. Propulsion is steady but the final paragraph front-loads theme rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Combining stunt double, phobia, stolen-child backstory, magical seashell, and rusted library reads as prompt-checklist assembly rather than organic synthesis. The "whispering seashell half" and smudged notes on a child's cast feel ornamental—replaceable with any mystery object. The emotional arc (betrayal → acceptance) follows a familiar template. The photograph-reveal turn is functional but not surprising. No close echoes of famous lines, but the "stars burned brighter" ending and "vulnerability is power" thesis lack fresh specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira's phobia is mentioned twice (early exposition, final paragraph reflection) but does not constrain an on-page choice. Her stunt-double background is told as backstory and does not alter tactics in the library confrontation. She makes decisions (lunge forward, press the shell, pry the floorboard) but these could belong to any determined seeker. No visible cost tied to the phobia or profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seashell appears in three beats: opening (held to ear, whispers pull her toward desk), confrontation (pressed into caretaker's palm, he flinches), and implicit at closure (the discovery it enabled). It enables the key turn (caretaker's recognition) and is causally active. However, its "whispering" mechanism remains vague and its properties are not reweighted at the end. Present across setup, development, and payoff; enables one major turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is the premise (mother stole Mira from a fire; the letter and diary reveal this). The betrayal is recounted in backstory and the transformation is asserted ("it had sharpened her," "vulnerability wasn't weakness") rather than dramatized with on-page cost. The caretaker's complicity adds a second betrayal layer, but Mira's response ("let's start over") resolves it without visible friction. Present in setup and reflected at closure, but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is told once as exposition ("She was firmly adaptive, bending without snapping"). Her adaptability is mentioned as the reason she's in the library but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait could be removed without altering the plot. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Outwit" is implicit in Mira's confrontation tactics: she lunges forward instead of fleeing, presses the shell into the caretaker's palm to destabilize him, and uses the cast to pry the floorboard while he's off-balance. These moves avoid direct conflict and exploit psychological leverage. The action shapes the middle turn (caretaker's passivity) and enables the discovery. However, "outwit" could be replaced with "confront" or "surprise" without major structural change. Present in development and linked to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cast appears early (on the desk, surface scrawled with mother's smudged notes) and Mira decrypts the shorthand to find the map. Later she uses the cast's edge as a tool to pry the floorboard. The method is signaled in setup, used in development, and enables the closure discovery. However, the decryption itself is summarized ("decrypting the shorthand") rather than shown, and the cast could be swapped for any inscribed object. Present across all three gates but mechanics are thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rusted library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (iron shelves, damp paper, rust smell, starlight). The crumbling desk supplies the cast; the rotting floorboards hide the box. The doorway frames the caretaker's entrance. The setting provides resources (desk, floorboards) that alter tactics and enables the discovery sequence. The stars at closure add atmospheric charge but do not apply new pressure. Present in setup, supplies tactical resources in development, and charges the final image. Essential to the plot's spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is premise: Mira arrives "after the letter arrived" and "after discovering you're not who you thought." The inciting betrayal is backstory; the library scene unfolds in continuous present. No ticking clock or time constraint tightens decisions. The "after" framing sets the emotional context but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure on the page. Present in setup as context; absent from development and payoff as a tactical force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph: "vulnerability wasn't weakness. It was the only thing that had ever made her strong." Mira's choice to press the shell into the caretaker's palm and her final "let's start over" gesture toward vulnerability as a tactic, but the desire is told rather than dramatized with friction or cost. No on-page moment where proving vulnerability conflicts with another want. Asserted at closure but not embodied in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone reads as determined urgency with flickers of fear: "her pulse hammering," "her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands," "the stars burned brighter." The trembling-certainty pairing is present (fear coexists with resolve) and modulates across beats (initial trembling at the cast, steadiness when confronting the caretaker, final declarative "let's start over"). Coherent through turns and charges the ending image ("as if they, too, had been waiting"). However, the final paragraph's tonal shift to affirmation ("she didn't flinch," stars burning brighter) smooths rather than sustains the tremor.</comment>
