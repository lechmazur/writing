<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior establishes a perceptual signature ("cataloging the unremarkable until it became unsettling") and the final choice—walking away—is earned by his realization that houses listen to themselves. However, the micro-choices are observation-heavy rather than crucible moments; he places the shard and steps back, but no visible cost or internal contradiction drives that act. Embodied emotion remains sparse, and the ending renunciation feels more like thoughtful departure than a foreclosed path with visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece reads under an Accumulative lens: the bay's silence, houses breathing, orris root, and streetlights daydreaming build a coherent pattern of uncanny domesticity that pays off when the house pauses and exhales. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the house's resumption reweights Elias's quest, and the cost (walking away without answers, knowing some questions aren't meant to be answered) is legible. Orientation anchors appear promptly (Elias, bay, dock). One weakness: the core causal turn (shard inserted → house pauses → exhales) happens largely off-stage; Elias hears the shape of a breath but the dramatized consequence is atmospheric rather than a choice-altering pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through Elias's professional lens: tide retreating without sound, seaweed sway, clapboard house leaning, orris root scent. The bay and house constrain his choices (he came to escape breathing houses; the house appears and leans toward him). The orris root shard—a recurring object—charges the final image when the house exhales. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor issue: the streetlights "daydreaming" and "forgetting to turn off" is poetic but does not materially constrain a choice or supply a resource at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding why houses feel alive. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric intensification (tide, silence, house leaning), and one tightening occurs when the shard pauses the house, narrowing Elias's understanding. The final realization—houses listen to themselves—reweights his quest. However, escalation is largely observational; Elias does not face a forced choice or trade-off, and the cost (walking away, unanswered) is more acceptance than a foreclosed path with visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient but not urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—the uncanny creeping into the everyday, the cost of noticing what others ignore—emerges from concrete images (bay's deliberate silence, houses that breathe, orris root holding silence). The final image (house exhaling, Elias walking away) offers a non-literal answer: some mysteries resist sanctification. No on-the-nose moralizing. The orris root shard shifts meaning from fixing scents to holding silence to permission to stop, charging the ending. Subtext operates in gesture (not knocking, slipping the shard beneath the door) and the ambiguous exhale. One small slip: "some questions weren't meant to be answered" hovers near a thematic statement, though it's more character stance than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, distance intimate, perceptual signature distinct (Elias notices "the weight of unspoken things," "the shape of a sound"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "crouched," "the bay had decided, quietly, to stop pretending," "the ghost of a breath held too long." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close when the house stops, pulling back as he walks away). Syntax and rhythm support pressure: short clauses when the house pauses ("Not all at once, but in increments"), longer sentences in reflection. No dialogue to judge. Minor register wobble: "inadvertently profound" in the narrator's voice feels slightly elevated for the otherwise grounded texture, though it ties to a prompt element.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, vivid images ("seaweed sway," "exhaled warmth through their floorboards"), high information density. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Some scaffold remains: "the thing he had been chasing all along" is a placeholder that delays the reveal; "the houses that felt alive weren't listening to the world. They were listening to *themselves*" is clean but borders on expository summation rather than discovery through image. "Inadvertently profound" is slightly abstract. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Rhythm varies naturally. Figurative language ("held breath," "shadows rearranged") is apt but dense in places without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—orris root as a tool to "hold" silence and sanctify animate houses—is a fresh synthesis of perfumery, domestic uncanny, and restraint. The twist (houses listen to themselves, not the world) feels earned in hindsight. Specific, verifiable detail (orris root used to fix scents) anchors freshness. The frame avoids stock haunted-house tropes by centering stillness rather than dread. However, the emotional arc (observer notices, intervenes, walks away) follows a familiar pattern of withdrawal; transformation is limited. The house's exhalation and Elias's departure feel inevitable but not urgent. Risk-taking is moderate; unconventional focus on silence elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias, the creeping normality noticer, appears throughout and frames the narrative. His noticing drives the choice to place the shard (setup, development). However, his observation is passive until that single act; no contested choice or visible cost emerges from the noticing itself. The final decision to walk away ties to his realization (closure participation), but the trait feels more like a lens than a constraint that shapes key turns. Present across beats but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears early (setup: in his coat pocket, "could *hold* silence"), is used in the key beat (development: slipped beneath the door, pauses the house), and its effect resonates in the ending (closure: house exhales after tasting stillness). Three distinct beats. However, the shard's role is enabling rather than contested; Elias does not face a cost tied to using it, and removing it would require a different mechanism but not collapse the thematic arc. Solid integration, one step below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" appears as a descriptor for the orris root's effect (the shard becomes "a wedge driven into the house's rhythm," "permission to stop"). The concept is echoed in theme (silence, stillness, permission) but does not create a distinct on-page stake or tactic. It overlaps heavily with element B (orris root) and functions as thematic gloss rather than a separate causal force. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once in narration ("he had done something inadvertently profound instead"), labeling the result rather than constraining the choice. The trait does not recur or shape a prior action with visible cost. It describes the outcome rather than enabling or complicating a beat. Mentioned, not integrated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is Elias's stated goal ("he had meant to sanctify the house"), drives the middle beat (placing the shard), and redefines options at closure (he realizes sanctification is impossible; the house tastes stillness and resumes). Setup, development, closure all present. Causal pressure: the attempt to sanctify creates the pause and the revelation. However, the action itself is brief and unopposed; a close synonym (cleanse, quiet, still) could replace it with minor edits. Essential but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is weakly signaled: the orris root is placed beneath the door, and earlier reference is made to houses rearranging shadows and exhaling warmth (implied object-displacement). However, the method is not taught or dramatized as a recurring tactic; the shard is used once, and the mechanics (why beneath the door? how does displacement matter?) are not explored. The method feels like a thematic label retrofitted rather than a constraint shaping attempts. Present but not developed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is established early (tide, seaweed, salt, damp earth) and frames the narrative. The bay's "patience" and deliberate silence set tone and mirror the house's pause. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Elias could conduct the same action elsewhere. The bay functions as atmosphere and backdrop rather than active pressure. Setup and tone present; causal role minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in one passage ("that evening, while the streetlights daydreamed—glowing just a little too late into the morning, as if they'd forgotten to turn off"). The timeframe is evocative but not tracked or tightened; no clock pressures decisions, and the streetlights' later flicker is atmospheric rather than causal. Setup present, but the time element does not shape tactics or escalate pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to understand why some houses feel alive"—is stated early, drives his action (placing the shard to sanctify/cleanse), and is resolved at closure (houses listen to themselves; some questions aren't meant to be answered). Setup, development, closure all present. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices; Elias acts once, and the cost (walking away unanswered) is acceptance rather than friction between want and obstacle. Functional and essential, but not contested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is coherent throughout: quiet intensity in the bay's deliberate silence, the house's pause, and the exhale's resumption. Diction choices ("held breath," "shape of a sound," "exhaled") maintain the hushed register, while pressure ("the thing he had been chasing," "tasted stillness and found it wanting") supplies the blaze. Tone modulates with the house's pause and resumption, charging the final image. However, the blaze element is muted; the ending is more wistful than incandescent. Strong coherence, moderate charge.</comment>
