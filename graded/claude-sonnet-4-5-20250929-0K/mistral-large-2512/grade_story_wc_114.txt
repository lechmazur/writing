<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is concrete and particular—the "fault-tolerant oracle" framework shapes his perception of uncertainty as freeing rather than frustrating, and his embodied guilt over the false landslide prediction drives present action. The fever residue, the smudged illustration, and the descent to the clearing all register as choices under pressure. Minor slip: the final epiphany ("The oracle's burden wasn't to be right—it was to be present") edges toward diagnostic label-speak but is grounded enough in prior particulars to avoid a larger penalty. The cost of years spent fearing mistakes lands on the page through his physical descent and the photograph's note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. The illustration arrival, Elias's identification of the flower, the descent and excavation, and the photograph discovery form a clear because/therefore chain that narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he accepts that prophecy's burden is presence, not accuracy—with visible cost: years of guilt finally grounded. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note reweights his guilt: "You were wrong, but so were we." The closure image (breathing without prophecy's weight, illustration as reminder) reconfigures prior material with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station, observation deck, valley, and clearing provide concrete spatial anchors that constrain Elias's movement and choices. The rusted tin box and photograph function as micro-setting elements that charge the closure by reweighting his guilt. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "auroral sorrow of dawn," "trees swaying in the grip of a certainty," "the cold biting through his layers." The illustration's shifting meaning (mystery → clue → reminder) and the clearing's disturbed ground both constrain the final turn. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and excavation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Elias seeks "the weight of a swallowed truth" tied to his failed prediction. Pressure tightens when the illustration appears (complication), intensifies when he identifies the flower and its burial association (escalation), and culminates in the excavation and photograph discovery (tightening that forecloses his prior stance). The note "You were wrong, but so were we" narrows options by redistributing guilt with visible cost. Agency is clear: he chooses to descend, dig, and carry the truth back. No coincidence resolves; the protagonist's decisions drive the turn. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: prophecy as presence rather than accuracy, uncertainty as freedom, and the shared nature of error. The illustration, flower identification, and photograph converge without stated moral. The final image ("some truths were meant to be unearthed, not foretold") reweights prior material—the unopened illustration, the abandoned village, years of self-imposed exile—without sermonizing. Subtext operates in the note's terse absolution and in Elias's choice to return to the station rather than descend further. The piece resists tidy binaries: both oracle and villagers were wrong, and the cost is distributed. Minor slip: "breathing without the weight of prophecy" inches toward explicit articulation but remains image-anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clear psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices fragments, edges, and margins ("peripherally aware," "like a reflection in rippling water"). Diction remains consistent with his introspective, pattern-seeking mindset. Free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: terse action during the descent, reflective texture in the station. Slight register drift in "auroral sorrow" and "the grip of a certainty that wasn't theirs to hold"—elevated phrasing that strains against the established voice but remains legible and purposeful. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or situation. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection and quickening during the descent. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "He had come here to find…" followed immediately by "The guilt had festered…" restates emotional ground. "Petals like shattered glass, roots coiled in impossible spirals" and "shadow's whisper" carry slight purple-prose weight but remain functional. The final paragraph stacks three resolution gestures in quick succession (weight settled, breathing without prophecy, illustration no longer a mystery), which borders on over-closure but lands cleanly. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Propulsion is strong through the excavation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "fault-tolerant oracle" premise offers a fresh angle on prophecy tropes by embracing uncertainty rather than tragic inevitability. The botanical illustration as clue, the disturbed-earth flower, and the shared-guilt note synthesize into a non-obvious turn. Elias's final insight (presence over accuracy) feels earned rather than imposed. Minor derivative pressure: the guilt-ridden seer seeking redemption is familiar territory, and the mountain-station isolation echoes genre conventions without full transformation. The synthesis of margins, fragments, and peripheral awareness creates a coherent thematic texture. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure and voice remain conventional despite the conceptual freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: Elias introduced immediately as fault-tolerant oracle; his fragmented future-sight shapes his worldview. Development: his tolerance of uncertainty enables him to interpret the illustration as clue rather than prophecy (middle choice). Payoff: the final realization ("oracle's burden…to be present") directly invokes the trait and reconfigures his approach. Causal pressure: the trait enables his acceptance of shared error and his return to the station. Three gates met; two distinct beats (interpretation, closure stance); closure linkage strong. Specificity: "fault-tolerant" is unique, but the trait's mechanics (seeing fragments "slightly wrong") function more as worldview than constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: illustration appears early, driving Elias's investigation. Development: he traces it, smudges it, identifies it in encyclopedias, carries it in his pocket. Payoff: final line repositions it as "reminder" rather than mystery, reweighting its function. Three beats: initial study, identification/decision to descend, pocket flutter at closure. Causal pressure: the illustration's appearance and content launch the excavation quest. Cost connection: his choice to dig stems from decoding the flower. Minor swappability: another clue object (note, map) could serve with edits. The smudge action is brief but tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "swaying certainties" referenced obliquely in opening (futures "slightly wrong," "never certain"). Development: the valley trees "swaying in the grip of a certainty that wasn't theirs to hold" mid-story. Payoff: the note "You were wrong, but so were we" and Elias's shift from fearing mistakes to accepting presence. Two gates (setup, payoff); one beat (valley observation). Causal pressure weak: the concept colors theme but does not narrow tactics. Lyric resonance: the swaying image returns with reweighted meaning at closure, but it remains more metaphor than constraint. The concept shapes stakes philosophically but not tactically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "peripherally aware" introduced as descriptor for the illustration's unknown sender. Development: no on-page action tied to this trait for Elias himself; it describes an absent character. Payoff: not revisited at closure. One gate (setup); zero beats involving protagonist choice. Ornamental: the phrase enriches atmosphere but does not constrain Elias's options or enable a tactic. No visible cost or causal pressure. The trait is label-only, applying to an off-page presence rather than shaping protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: smudge action occurs early ("He smudged the ink with his thumb"). Development: the smudge registers as a micro-choice reflecting his wish to erase the question. Payoff: not directly revisited, but the final repositioning of the illustration as reminder echoes his initial impulse to dismiss it. One beat. Causal pressure minimal: the smudge does not alter his later investigation. Swappability high: tracing, folding, or setting it aside would serve similarly. The action is embodied and character-specific but not irreplaceable. Lyric resonance faint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: "occupying margins" introduced as Elias's practiced stance ("between sleep and waking, between truth and prophecy"). Development: the method is claimed but not dramatized; we do not see him use marginal positioning to solve a problem on the page. Payoff: the final image (breathing, illustration as reminder) implies acceptance of liminality but does not show the method shaping the resolution. One gate (setup); zero beats where the means alters tactics. Summary-only: the narrator tells us Elias occupies margins rather than showing the mechanics at work under pressure. The concept enriches characterization but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: mountain weather station anchored in opening line. Development: observation deck provides vantage for valley view; station encyclopedias enable flower identification; isolation context supports the mystery of the illustration's delivery. Payoff: Elias climbs back to the station at closure, repositioning it as his chosen ground rather than exile. Two beats (deck observation, encyclopedia search). Causal pressure moderate: the encyclopedias enable the flower ID, which launches the descent. Constraint visible: isolation and resources both matter. Minor swappability: another remote setting (lighthouse, fire tower) could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "after fever breaks" anchored early; illustration appeared "the night his fever broke." Development: fever residue colors his physicality ("trembled—not from cold, but from the residue of fever") but does not tighten decisions. Payoff: not revisited at closure. One gate (setup); one beat (physicality). No ticking clock; the timeframe marks a threshold but does not constrain tactics. The fever's lifting is a signal, not a shaping force. Functional but replaceable: another recovery or arrival timeframe would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: motivation stated explicitly mid-story ("He had come here to find the weight of a swallowed truth—his own"). Development: the search for truth drives his encyclopedia work and descent; guilt over the false prediction provides friction. Payoff: the photograph and note deliver the truth, and his final stance (accepting shared error) resolves the want. Three gates met; two beats (decision to descend, excavation). Causal pressure strong: the want launches and sustains the investigation. Cost visible: years of guilt and the descent's effort. Slight over-articulation: the motivation is told rather than fully dramatized in early conflicting choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "auroral sorrow" introduced in valley observation scene. Development: tone is coherent through introspection and descent—melancholy, liminal, elegiac. Payoff: "the first true light of dawn touched the peaks" at closure modulates the sorrow into tentative relief without erasing it. One lyric beat (dawn passage). Tone charges the final image by shifting from sorrow to grounded acceptance. Coherence strong; modulation present. The tone is maintained through figurative language ("bruise," "grip of certainty") and does not flatten under pressure. The auroral image returns with reweighted emotional valence.</comment>
