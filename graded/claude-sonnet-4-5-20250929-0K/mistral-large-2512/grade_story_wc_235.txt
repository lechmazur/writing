<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is richly textured—jealousy of past selves, feral nostalgia, the compulsion to collect scrolls—but his moment-to-moment choices rarely pivot under pressure. The ending door-rattle creates suspense without forcing a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied contradiction is present (resentment vs. hunger for clarity), yet the closure lacks agency: something arrives at him rather than his action reshaping options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (cabin, Elias, birch bark scroll). The piece establishes a Situational lens—chronological confusion and mounting dread—but the final door-swing offers atmosphere without decisive change or conceptual repricing; we see threat arriving, not Elias altering stance or knowledge with felt cost. The grave-seeing and scroll discovery supply solid setup, but the ending stops at charged suspense rather than closure that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cabin logs, scarred pine table, birch bark scroll, and mountain shadow are vivid and purposeful. The scroll is handled twice (tracing, clutching over fire), and the cabin's walls lined with other scrolls ground the collecting compulsion. The fire-versus-burn moment charges the object with tactical weight. Sensory specificity (iron and pine taste, wind howling) filters through Elias's urgency without postcard lists.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias distilling chaos, competing with past selves—is signaled early and sustained. The scroll's message tightens dread, and the fire-clutch moment offers a potential tactic (burn it), but Elias doesn't choose; the door interrupts. Pressure accumulates atmospherically yet the protagonist never forecloses an option or pays a visible price on the page. One meaningful intensification (door-rattle) arrives via external coincidence rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia and chronological confusion emerge from concrete images—grave dated before birth, jealousy of the earlier self who "soared," collecting scrolls as proof of mattering. The theme resists easy morals and invites reflection on identity across time. However, the ending amplifies atmosphere without offering a resonant answer or reweighting the central question; it stops at suspense rather than thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "*Chronologically confused, eh?*" in Harkin's mouth versus Elias's internal "*I was here. I mattered.*" The perceptual signature (iron-and-pine taste, the hollow in his chest) stays character-particular. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reflection to present fear. The prose rhythm tightens toward the ending without filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally ("*The cabin creaked…logs groaning*"; "*He could burn it. Let the past stay buried.*"). Information density is high—each line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor lift: the final "*Or his future, come to drag him into the earth?*" echoes earlier imagery without redundancy, and the body-pressing-door detail is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—lucid dream chronicler jealous of past selves, finding his own pre-dated grave—offers a fresh synthesis of time-loop and identity crisis. Execution avoids stock twist mechanics; jealousy of one's earlier clarity is a specific, non-obvious angle. However, the atmospheric ending (door swinging open) leans toward familiar horror beats rather than a final turn that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is the focalizer throughout and his profession is named, but "lucid dream chronicler" functions as atmospheric label rather than shaping on-page choices. The scrolls he collects link to his role, yet no dream or chronicling act constrains a tactic or alters the ending. Present by setup, absent in development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in beat one (tracing edges, reading), beat two (clutched over fire, potential burn choice), and the ending (still in hand). It carries the past-self message that seeds jealousy and distills the temporal confusion. Removing it would weaken the jealousy motive and the fire-choice moment. Strong middle development and closure linkage, but Elias never acts on the burn option, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named explicitly and embodied in the hunger for clarity of the past, the jealousy of earlier selves, and the compulsion to carve names into trees. It shapes Elias's emotional stance and the scroll-collecting behavior. However, it does not narrow a tactical choice under pressure at the ending; the door arrival supersedes it. Setup and development present; payoff indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Chronological confusion is demonstrated on-page: grave dated a decade before his birth, competing with past selves, the scroll's handwriting unmistakably his own. It constrains Elias's certainty and fuels the feral nostalgia. The trait is present in setup and middle reflection but does not force a visible tradeoff at closure; the door interrupts before confusion alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Soar" appears once in the scroll's message and once in Elias's interior reflection ("*That earlier Elias had soared—hadn't he?*"). It seeds the jealousy theme but does not drive an on-page action or turn. It could be swapped for another metaphor of transcendence with minor edits. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves is signaled early ("*getting jealous of past selves*") and embodied throughout: resentment of the man who wrote the scroll, envy of the cartographer in dreams, the coiling gut feeling. It shapes Elias's emotional arc and his fire-clutch hesitation. However, the method does not mechanically alter the ending choice; the door arrival supersedes it. Setup and development present; payoff indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin is anchored early (scarred pine table, logs groaning, loft with loose floorboard, walls lined with scrolls). The fire and door provide spatial resources. The cabin's isolation and the mountain's shadow contribute atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain the final choice—Elias could hold the scroll anywhere. Micro-setting (fire, door latch) is present but does not decisively alter tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The grave-seeing is dated "three days prior," and the scroll discovery "yesterday." These anchors frame the window but do not tighten tactics in the ending beat. The time pressure is atmospheric (seasons, winters on the cabin) rather than a live clock altering moves. Setup present; development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is stated explicitly and dramatized in the scroll-collecting compulsion, the yearning for clarity, and the fire-clutch moment where burning the scroll would "let the past stay buried." The motivation shapes his interior arc and the potential burn choice. However, Elias does not complete the distillation on the page; the door interrupts. Setup and development present; payoff incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Jaded wonder suffuses the prose: "*the mountain didn't care. It had seen a thousand Elias Veynes*"; "*the taste of iron and pine*"; "*the same feral ache for a life that slipped through his fingers like mist.*" The tone modulates from weary reflection to tight dread at the door-rattle, charging the final image. Coherent through turns and integrated with the temporal confusion theme.</comment>
