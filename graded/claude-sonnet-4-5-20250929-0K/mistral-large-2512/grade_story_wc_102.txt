<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lien's motivation—finding where unused love is stored—drives her actions, but the answering moment feels abstract rather than embodied. The memory of her past life as a woman with ink-stained fingers is introduced with vivid specificity, yet her present-self agency is largely observational until the final beat. The father's emotional arc is compressed and told through summary ("the look of a father who had tried everything"), undercutting the earned quality of the resolution. The final insight—love stored in the act of giving it away—arrives as a stated epiphany rather than a choice Lien makes under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (viaduct, camera obscura, Lien's purpose). The dominant stake—understanding where unused love goes—is signaled early and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the realization that love is stored in others' hands). However, the father and child appear abruptly from the mist without prior setup or causal motivation, reading as coincidental arrival to enable closure rather than a turn earned by Lien's prior choices. The tear's glow and the boy's recovery feel unearned; no prior on-page rules establish the mechanics, reducing closure cost legibility. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (memory fragments, fog, breath) but the final beat leans on convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is vivid and atmospheric—wisteria blooming violet, iron ribs, damp stones—and the camera obscura functions as both tool and constraint, reflecting an inverted world within. Fog responds to Lien's breath, anchoring the method in environment. However, the spatial choreography when the father emerges is vague (direction, distance, how he found her), and the viaduct itself does not constrain Lien's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The setting charges the mood but remains largely postcard, not pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is clear and repeats across beats. The middle deepening occurs when Lien remembers offering the tear in a past life, reweighting her present possession of it. Yet the father's arrival is coincidental, not a tightening driven by Lien's agency; she does not pursue, discover, or risk to encounter him. The cost of giving away the tear is undercut by its immediate validation (the boy stirs, the fog reveals a path), offering reward without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central question—where unused love is stored—emerges organically from Lien's memory and her present encounter, and the final image answers it through a non-literal metaphor: love lives in the hands of others. The pilgrim-of-sparks motif recurs with purpose, and the jade tear shifts from relic to conduit. However, the closing lines veer toward direct thematic statement ("she understood… it was in the hands of others, waiting to be passed on") rather than letting the image resonate without explanation. The theme avoids platitude but edges close to moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and Lien's perceptual signature—light, souls, breathing, memory—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is elevated and lyric ("drowned thing rising," "communion," "sparkles were in her") without register clash, fitting the meditative tone. The father's dialogue is minimal and raw ("Please"), contrasting with Lien's interior richness. However, the phrase "revealing through breathing changes" reads as meta-commentary inserted for prompt alignment rather than organic discovery, and the final paragraph's explanatory clarity ("she had shown the father where his love had been stored all along") slightly flattens the distance that held through the earlier beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is specific ("jade tear," "camera obscura's wooden body warm," "fog around her thickened"). However, the prose carries light scaffold: "The memory was not hers, yet it fit like a key in a lock" restates the prior paragraph's established fact. "A pilgrim of sparks, that's what the old texts called those who walked the edge of memory and fire" interrupts the present scene for exposition. The closure beat—"She had healed them, but not in the way she expected"—summarizes rather than trusting the prior image. Figurative density is high but remains legible; no mixed metaphors or major loops, though minor paraphrase appears.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of past-life memory, Kwan Yin's tear, and breath-as-revelation offers a specific angle. The reincarnation frame and the jade artifact avoid cliché through the camera obscura detail and the fog-response mechanics. However, the core emotional arc—learning that love must be given away to find its place—is familiar, and the father-and-sick-child encounter follows a recognizable template (stranger appears, receives aid, problem resolves). The story commits to its premise but does not transform the arc through non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lien is present throughout; she adjusts the camera obscura, kneels, remembers, and gives the tear. The final act of pressing the tear into the father's palm is a decision that closes the story. However, most beats are observational or reflective; the camera obscura is adjusted once but does not constrain later choices. The character drives closure but does not create multiple key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears early (found years ago, carried in her coat pocket), returns with reweighted meaning in the memory beat (offered in a past life), and is given to the father in the closure action. The tear glows and its light seeps into the child, linking it causally to the resolution. However, the mechanics of the tear's power are not established prior to its use, reducing irreplaceability slightly. Three distinct beats; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A pilgrim of sparks" is named and defined mid-story ("those who walked the edge of memory and fire") and Lien identifies herself as one. The concept informs her understanding but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The sparks-as-breath metaphor enriches theme but remains abstract; no visible cost tied to pilgrimage. Present and thematically resonant, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lien's spiritual curiosity is shown through her study of "the unseen, the way light bent and souls flickered" and her years with the camera obscura. It motivates her presence on the viaduct and her interpretation of the breath-fog response. However, the trait does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it enables understanding but does not create friction or tradeoff. Functional but replaceable with "seeker" or "scholar."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Healing occurs on the page: Lien presses the tear into the father's palm, tells him to breathe, the tear glows, and the boy stirs. This action is the climax and closure unit. However, the healing is passive (the tear does the work) and immediate, with no resistance, uncertainty, or cost to Lien beyond parting with the object. The action drives the ending but could be swapped for other forms of aid (blessing, talisman, spell) with minor edits. Two beats (memory of offering the tear, present offering); closure active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Revealing through breathing changes" is introduced explicitly mid-story ("how a sigh could part the mist, how a gasp could make the wisteria tremble") and used once in the closure beat when Lien tells the father to breathe and the fog swirls to reveal the path. The method is signaled but does not shape multiple attempts or tactics; it appears as explanation and is used once. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. Cap at 4.6 per missing-middle rule.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom is vividly described and provides the location for all action. The damp stones, wisteria, and fog contribute to atmosphere. The fog responds to breath, linking setting to method, and the viaduct is the site of the memory and the encounter. However, the viaduct does not constrain Lien's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics; it is backdrop. Setup and payoff present; causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored: "last night" the memory surfaced, "now, in this life" Lien carries the weight. The viaduct scene occurs "as twilight bled into the water," establishing present urgency. However, time does not tighten decisions or create a clock; Lien's visit feels contemplative rather than time-bound. The memory provides context but does not compress tactics. Setup present; no middle or closure pressure tied to time. Cap at 3.8 per swappability (could be "days later" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lien's desire to find where unused love is stored is stated early, drives her presence on the viaduct, and is answered in the closure realization. The motivation surfaces in the memory beat and is tested when she gives the tear to the father. However, no on-page friction between wants and costs appears; Lien does not hesitate, doubt, or sacrifice a competing desire. The motivation is dramatized through action but lacks internal conflict. Setup, development, and payoff present; cost tied to motivation is weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is coherent throughout: the prose is elevated and meditative, the fog is literal and symbolic, and Lien's interiority balances clarity of insight with dreamlike memory. The tone modulates slightly when the father appears (urgency in "Please," Lien's immediate action) but returns to reflective closure. The fog's response to breath and the final image's soft resolution maintain the tone without rupture. The tone charges the final image through its layered fog-and-light motif, avoiding static mood.</comment>
