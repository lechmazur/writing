<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("three years off the grid") but her internal conflict never materializes on the page—she shifts from tracker to liberator without visible contradiction or cost. The Ember Scribe's fever-bright intensity is vivid, but his sudden trust ("You were always part of the message") feels unearned; no prior choice dramatizes why he accepts her help. Interiority relies on labels ("analytically intuitive mind," "volcanic tenderness") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to help lacks friction; no competing impulse complicates her commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the first paragraph, though "off the grid" remains vague. The dominant lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: clues build toward the seal revelation, but the final turn (tapestry completes mural, lock begins to turn) lands as a Charged Poise—options crystallize without full cost paid on the page. The ellipsis from "three years" to this archive is unmotivated; no scene choice narrows her path or raises the price. The "You were always part of the message" line asserts causality not earned by prior beats. Cost at closure is implied (the seal turning) but not felt in forfeited safety or relational breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The archive's "scorched parchment and old secrets" and the defaced portraits create atmospheric specificity, and the tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting by constraining Elara's choice to help. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (bookshelf, pillar, far wall), though the mural's sudden visibility ("she hadn't noticed until now") strains credibility. The setting pressures the revelation but does not force a trade-off; the environment enables rather than complicates. The final image (archway lock turning) charges setting detail with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the arsonist's purpose—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara realizes the seal's function. However, the escalation is cognitive (learning the truth) rather than a choice under competing pressures; no live option is foreclosed. The Ember Scribe's acceptance of her help arrives without resistance, deflating potential conflict. The lock turning implies future cost but does not dramatize a present price paid. One meaningful deepening (promise-as-lock twist) shifts knowledge, but agency remains observational until the final collaborative act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of broken promises and silenced truth emerges through the defaced portraits and the key-as-lock twist, avoiding overt statement. The tapestry's meaning shifts from mystery to warning, a purposeful reprise. However, "volcanic tenderness" in the penultimate paragraph veers into on-the-nose descriptor, and the final line ("the promise wasn't forgotten. It was waiting to be kept") edges toward thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance. The core question—what happens when liberators unseal buried truths—is posed but not tested with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the confrontation. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("You're late" / "Or you were slower" carries subtext). However, "analytically intuitive mind" and "volcanic tenderness" are register intrusions—the former clinical, the latter operatic—that break the established middle register. Diction is mostly consistent, though "embers settling" as a laugh description strains. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific; Elara's noticing (jagged lines, thread unraveling) could belong to any careful observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere, but several phrases loop: "the arsonist's signature" / "the Ember Scribe," "trail of artistic creations" appears twice with minimal evolution, and "promise" recurs without charged escalation. "Volcanic tenderness" is a mixed metaphor (volcanic intensity vs. tenderness) that muddles tone. The opening line anchors voice, and the final line attempts resonance but leans toward assertion. Information density is moderate; the middle section (defaced portraits, tapestry logic) compresses effectively, but the ending rushes through collaboration without scene work. No catastrophic artifacts, but paraphrase drag lowers momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The arsonist-as-liberator twist and key-as-lock reversal offer non-obvious angles on the lost-civilization template. However, the core frame—lone investigator tracks arsonist through ruins, discovers noble motive—closely follows familiar genre beats without transforming them through lived detail or moral friction. The "You were always part of the message" convenience and the instant trust deflate earned surprise. Specificity is present (defaced self-portraits, tapestry threads) but serves plot mechanics more than character complexity. The final lock-turning image gestures toward fresh stakes but does not dramatize the cost of unsealing a dangerous truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Ember Scribe is present by the second half, confesses his motive, and hands over the canvas scrap—functional involvement in two beats. However, his key decision (to accept Elara's help) occurs without visible resistance or cost, and his prior three-year campaign is summarized, not dramatized. He enables the closure but does not drive a turn through conflicted choice. Swappable with "mysterious guide" archetype with minor edits. Late introduction (past 40%) and lack of causal pressure cap score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the opening paragraph (early signal), Elara handles it twice (satchel, final wall fitting), and its meaning shifts from clue to warning at closure—three-gate involvement with purposeful reprise. It constrains her choice to help (she carries the missing piece) and charges the final image when fitted into the mural. However, the fragment's specific properties (scene of key, child, archway) could be replaced with any symbolic puzzle piece; irreplaceability is moderate. Cost tied to the element is implied (unsealing danger) but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vandalized self-portraits appear early (defaced archivist portrait) and recur in the Ember Scribe's explanation, shaping the core revelation: the scratched-out eyes/mouth signal silenced truth. The concept drives the twist (artists knew the key locked rather than opened) and Elara's realization, altering her stance from pursuer to ally. It participates in closure by framing the seal's meaning. Specificity is high (eyes gouged first, then mouth) and the element is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the story's central logic. Visible cost: the truth was violently suppressed, and unsealing it carries implied danger.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once in paragraph five as a label without constraining or enabling a choice. Elara's pattern-piecing (noticing defacement, connecting fragments) reads as generic investigator competence; no on-page moment shows analytic rigor conflicting with intuitive leap or vice versa. The trait does not alter tactics, impose a visible tradeoff, or shape closure. Ornamental descriptor with no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Portray" is absent as an on-page action. The vandalized self-portraits are described and discussed but never created, altered, or used by a character in scene. If the element refers to the act of defacement (past-tense portrayal destroyed), that backstory is summarized, not dramatized. No beat shows a character portraying or engaging with portrayal as a present act. Missing all three gates; purely ornamental to the prompt requirement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations (burned libraries, defaced portraits, tapestry fragments) is signaled early and recurs across beats, shaping Elara's pursuit and the Ember Scribe's method. It enables the middle revelation (every portrait defaced the same way) and participates in closure when the mural completes. However, the mechanics remain vague—how the trail was laid, why these specific sites, what cost the civilization paid to hide it—and the method is more setting than active constraint. Functional across three beats but could be replaced with "cryptic symbols" without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is established in the opening line, provides the dominant spatial frame, supplies key props (bookshelf, portraits, mural), and houses the closure image (archway lock). The setting constrains movement (collapsed pillar, hollow chambers) and enables discovery (the far wall mural). Specificity is high (scorched parchment, half-melted painting) and the archive's dual function (ruin and reliquary) is irreplaceable. However, the setting does not impose a visible tactical cost—Elara and the Ember Scribe navigate it without obstacle. Strong integration across all three gates; micro-setting (tapestry, mural) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" and "three years" are mentioned in the opening but never tighten decisions on the page. The archive scene unfolds in continuous present with no time pressure; Elara's arrival timing is arbitrary ("You're late" is banter, not a missed window with cost). The timeframe does not constrain tactics, raise stakes, or shape closure. Summary-only, no causal work, easily omitted without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The forgotten promise is seeded early (crimson-inked "promise" in burned books), drives the Ember Scribe's motive (to expose the lie), and Elara's final commitment ("let me help" to keep the promise). It shapes two beats and participates in the ending line ("the promise wasn't forgotten. It was waiting to be kept"). However, the promise is told, not dramatized in conflict—no on-page friction between Elara's desire to rescue it and a competing want or cost. The motivation enables but does not constrain; swappable with "hidden truth" or "buried secret" with minor edits. Functional but lacks specificity and visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears once in the penultimate paragraph as a descriptor of the Ember Scribe's voice, not as a sustained tonal register. The tone elsewhere is measured mystery-thriller (analytical, atmospheric) with no modulation toward volcanic intensity or tender intimacy. The phrase reads as an imposed label rather than an earned synthesis of pressure and warmth. If the intent was to charge the final collaboration with contradictory emotional heat, the scene's flat acceptance deflates that potential. Late, ornamental, contradicts the established register, no payoff at closure.</comment>
