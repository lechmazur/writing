<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is concrete and professionally filtered—her atlas-editor precision shapes perception—but internal contradiction is thin. The shift to "subtly confident" at the end reads as a label rather than dramatized tension between doubt and certainty acting simultaneously. The keeper's hands trembling and Mira's breath-fogging establish embodied stakes, yet no meaningful renunciation or cost forecloses a path on the page; she simply decides to go. Motivation is signaled early but the closure choice feels more like continuation than transformation earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ice-memory motifs, condensation patterns, and phrasebook fragments layer toward a final convergence image. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. However, the closure unit—Mira's request to go to the lake's center—lands as Charged Poise at best, with the cost implied rather than felt on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift occurs in the final beat. The "or where the ice remembers" echo and the falcon's return suggest reweighting, but the before/after remains conceptual rather than dramatized with a legible price. The two-shard structure (indoor atlas work, dawn conversation) coheres, yet the final turn hinges on a phrasebook callback without a fresh pressure point that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation-traced windowpane are vivid and purposeful; the glass pattern becomes a map, charging the ending image. Micro-setting (the phrasebook in her pocket, the atlas page left blank) recurs with meaning. Spatial choreography is clean across the two shards. However, the environment does not constrain a middle choice—Mira moves through the space without friction from cold, tool limits, or access barriers—so the 9+ gate (constraint or choice-forcing) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the rivers' origin, the singular convergence—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the keeper's muttered phrase ("or where the ice remembers") prompts Mira's realization, but this deepening hinges on thematic echo rather than a trade-off or foreclosed option. No on-page reversal tests Mira's commitment; the falcon's arrival and the phrasebook are complications inherited, not overcome. The request to go to the lake is an extension of intent, not a choice under duress with visible cost. Escalation is coherent but diffuse; under the Accumulative lens one meaningful pressure point suffices, yet the cost at closure remains implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, erasure, the unseen made visible through convergence—emerges organically from condensation imagery, the blank atlas page, and the phrasebook's margin note. The final image (Mira asking to go to the center, the falcon circling, "worrying tranquility") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "where things begin" without a stated moral. Subtext operates in silence and implication: the keeper's hesitation, the note's smudged ink. However, the phrase "Nothing was just another word for unseen" borders on overt thematic statement, and the convergence concept is asserted more than dramatized in a choice with cost. Strong particulars (ice forgetting its name, condensation as map) elevate the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Mira's perceptual signature—atlas-editor precision, dry wit, the way she "corrected borders with the same precision others used to stir tea"—is distinctive and consistent. Distance modulates purposefully from close interior ("The words had settled into her chest like a stone") to wider atmospheric framing. The keeper's dialogue is spare and naturalistic, contrasting with Mira's more considered syntax. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she knew better," "Mira knew") is acceptable for voice, not intrusive. No head-hopping or tense drift. The prose rhythm supports pressure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images are sharp. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold: "She had come here for the maps, not the ruins" is immediately paraphrased by "She had come to this outpost for the same reason she always did: to find where things began," creating a conceptual loop (−0.2). The phrase "watching the condensation bloom on the windowpane" recurs productively, not as churn. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the final third avoids summary. One paraphrase loop touches a non-closure beat, capping penalty at the lower end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—atlas editor seeking a singular convergence at a frozen outpost, using condensation as map—synthesizes familiar quest and memory themes with specific professional lens and micro-setting ingenuity. The phrasebook margin note and the falcon as herald are stock motifs executed with restraint. The condensation-as-map image and the "ice forgets/remembers" duality offer fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (curiosity → realization → resolve) follows a predictable trajectory without bold risk or a non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation is present but moderate; the story commits fully to its premise without retreating, yet the closure image does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira Voss, the dry-witted atlas editor, is present throughout and her professional precision filters perception. She makes the final decision to go to the lake's center, but that choice extends prior intent rather than creating a key turn with visible cost. Her dry wit appears in "corrected borders with the same precision others used to stir tea" and the interior observation that "precision had limits," shaping voice and motivation. Setup is immediate; middle beats involve her tracing the atlas and phrasebook; closure participation is present but the decision does not dramatically narrow options. Two beats (atlas work, dawn realization) involve her agency, but the cost is implied, not felt. Score reflects solid involvement without indispensability: removing "dry-witted" would not break logic; her being an atlas editor is more essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: found in an archive (backstory), carried in her pocket (mid-scene anchor), and its margin note ("The ice remembers") triggers the keeper's echo that crystallizes Mira's realization at closure. The dog-eared entries ("source," "origin," "threshold") prime the convergence theme. However, the phrasebook is not physically handled on the page after the opening mention; its closure participation is verbal (the keeper's muttered phrase) rather than Mira consulting it again. Setup is early, development is thematic, payoff is indirect. Swappable with another mnemonic artifact (a journal, a letter) with modest edits. Causal pressure is moderate; the margin note shapes the ending realization but does not constrain a middle choice. Score reflects strong thematic integration and closure linkage but lacks a second distinct handling beat or irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Singular convergence is stated as Mira's goal ("the point where all the maps she'd ever drawn collapsed into one") and echoed in the falcon message and the condensation-as-map image. It frames expectation and recurs in the final request to go to the lake's center. However, it remains a thematic claim rather than a dramatized constraint that narrows options; Mira does not face a trade-off between competing convergences or a choice shaped by convergence mechanics. The concept is present across beats (setup, middle reflection, closure intent) but does not alter tactics on the page. Setup is immediate, development is conceptual, closure participation is thematic. Swappable with "hidden source" or "origin point" without breaking logic. Score reflects functional thematic presence without causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears as a label in the penultimate paragraph ("subtly confident, the way she always was when the pieces finally clicked") but does not constrain or enable an earlier on-page action with visible cost. Mira's behavior throughout—tracing the atlas, pressing her palm to the glass, deciding to go to the lake—reads as determined curiosity rather than a balance between confidence and hesitation with friction. The trait is told, not shown through a micro-choice where confidence forecloses caution or vice versa. Setup is absent until the final third; no middle development; closure mention is label-only. Ornamental use. Score reflects late, decorative mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The falcon's return is the inciting event: it arrives the day before with the message "The rivers begin where the ice forgets its name," setting Mira's investigation in motion. The keeper's trembling hands when handing over the message and Mira's chest-stone reaction establish stakes. The falcon circles again at the end, bookending the action and charging the final image with its "cry sharp against the worrying tranquility." However, the herald action itself (arrival, message delivery) is complete before the on-page present; the middle beats trace Mira's response, not the falcon's ongoing influence. Major turns trace to the message content, not the herald mechanics. Setup is immediate (second paragraph), development is indirect (Mira processes the message), payoff is atmospheric (final circle). Swappable with another messenger (radio, letter, runner) without breaking logic, though the falcon's symbolic weight elevates it. Score reflects strong setup and closure linkage but limited middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Condensation on glass is signaled early ("the condensation bloom on the windowpane," "tiny droplets forming first at the edges, then creeping inward") and becomes Mira's method for understanding: "The pattern wasn't random. It was a map. Not of land, but of time." The mechanics—cold condensing the past into visibility—are explained and used. Mira traces the condensation with her fingertip at dawn, and the pattern directly shapes her realization that the convergence is readable. The keeper finds her "tracing the window's condensation," and this act precedes the final request to go to the lake. Setup is immediate, development includes Mira's palm-press and finger-tracing, payoff drives the closure realization. Irreplaceability is high: the condensation's temporal-map logic is unique and non-swappable. However, the method does not constrain a failed attempt or force a tactical shift; Mira reads the pattern successfully without friction. Score reflects strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity, but lacks a middle complication where the method's limits matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted outpost by the frozen lake is established immediately ("clung to the shore," "its rusted beams groaning under the weight of silence") and recurs: collapsed barrel, windowpane, the keeper's presence, and the lake's blank atlas page. The setting provides the condensation-window and houses the phrasebook/atlas, supplying resources. The frozen lake is the destination that frames the closure request. However, the setting does not pressure a middle choice—Mira moves freely through the space without access barriers, cold-induced limits, or competing spatial options. Setup is immediate, development is atmospheric, closure participation is the lake as goal. The outpost functions as stage more than constraint. Micro-setting (window, atlas) charges the final image but does not alter tactics. Score reflects strong presence and thematic integration but lacks the choice-forcing friction for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" anchors the story's present: the bird arrived "the day before," and the on-page action spans from Mira's indoor work to dawn when the keeper finds her. The temporal window is legible and the dawn anchor tightens the closure. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or a live clock that alters moves; Mira's pacing is contemplative, not race-against-dawn. Setup is immediate (second paragraph), development is passive (time elapses without pressure), payoff is the dawn discovery. The "day before" backstory is brief and functional. Swappable with "after the message arrives" without breaking logic. Score reflects clear temporal structure and closure participation but lacks the pressure of a ticking clock or a deadline that forces earlier choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to find where the rivers begin, and more broadly "where things began," the singular convergence—is stated early and sustained across beats. She came "for the maps," is "chasing the singular convergence," and repeats the falcon's message as a guiding phrase. The final request to go to the lake's center dramatizes this desire. However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted on the page; Mira does not face a trade-off between finding the origin and another want (safety, return, doubt). Her curiosity is consistent but frictionless. Setup is immediate, development is thematic repetition, closure participation is the request. The dominant stake is clear, but the lack of dramatized cost—no moment where pursuing the rivers' source forecloses another path—limits the score. Swappable with "find the source" without breaking logic. Score reflects strong presence and closure linkage but modest friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is established through "the weight of silence," "the gray sky," and the falcon's metronome-like wings; the oxymoron is made literal in the final phrase "the worrying tranquility of the ice." Tone is coherent and modulates: eerie calm in the opening, contemplative focus during Mira's window work, charged poise at dawn when the falcon circles. The tone supports the convergence theme and charges the final image without breaking into overt dread or false serenity. Setup is immediate (opening paragraph), development is sustained through atmospheric detail, payoff is the closing phrase that names and crystallizes the tone. However, the tone is more static mood than dynamic modulation; it does not shift decisively under a pressure beat. Score reflects strong coherence and closure charge but lacks a mid-scene tonal turn that reweights stakes.</comment>
