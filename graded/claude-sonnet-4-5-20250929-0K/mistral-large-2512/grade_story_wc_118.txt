<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and embodied ("fingers...stained with ink or ash, traced the spines...as if they were pulse points"), and her perceptive attribute drives concrete micro-choices—pressing her palm to the silo, reaching toward the threads. Internal contradiction between her stated motivation (collecting stories) and her dawning suspicion ("wondered if she had been following them in the wrong direction") creates productive tension. The final choice to reach out feels earned by prior observation and the cumulative pattern of sensory noticing, though the moment when she crosses from observation to decisive action could carry more visible resistance or cost to charge the threshold fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered images (tapestry, diaries, silo hum) that converge at closure when the dragons "lift their heads" and the axis reveals itself as directional rather than broken. Orientation anchors (silo, Elara, "two winters ago") arrive early. The closure—"It was a door"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise (displaced axis) with the cost legible in Elara's realization that the past she chased was always pointing elsewhere, foreclosing her prior method. One meaningful deepening (from collector to participant) tightens the final image, meeting the length's requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The silo's concrete ribs, spiral shelves, and vibration create a micro-setting that constrains and charges Elara's final choice: she presses her palm to feel the thrum, the shelves tilt toward her, spatial pressure builds to the moment she reaches through the threads. Sensory detail is filtered through her professional lens (she chose it "for its silence, the way the air inside settled like dust on a bronze plate"). The tapestry fragment and diaries function as tactile objects whose physicality—curling edges, singed pages—pressures her perception and the ending image when the dragons' eyes gleam and their bodies unravel to reveal space beyond.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding what the walls have heard and why the dragons matter. Pressure coheres through accumulative textural deepening—diaries hint ("The axis is slipping"), the silo groans, the tapestry shivers—culminating in the tightening moment when Elara realizes the stories aren't behind her but "ahead, in the spaces between the threads." Agency is attention that forecloses her prior collection method; the cost is the abandonment of her historian role for an unknown threshold. The escalation is one meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens, meeting length requirements, though a second micro-constraint (a visible hesitation or price paid in the reaching) would sharpen the stakes further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—perception as discovery versus direction—emerges from concrete particulars: Elara following cracks "in the wrong direction," the tapestry's non-repeating pattern, the axis "always...pointing somewhere else." The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: the door was present in the threads all along, and listening was the key, not the archive. Subtext operates in the diaries' fragmented warnings and the way the silo's hum responds to Elara's touch. The piece avoids thematic echo or summary, letting the door revelation reweight prior material (her motivation, the "last human dream") with conceptual cost—she must abandon collection for participation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "the way shadows pooled too long in corners" and traces spines "as if they were pulse points," idiom consistent with her role and sensitivity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during tactile moments (pressing palm, brushing threads), slightly wider in reflective beats without head-hopping. Prose rhythm reflects her contemplative stance: "The silo groaned, its bones shifting in the wind." No dialogue present; interior voice is character-specific and controlled under rising pressure, with compression at the threshold ("It wasn't a pattern. It was a door.") that sharpens rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: "The fragment...had been tucked between the pages of a ledger, its threads stiff with age. Dragons coiled across it in faded crimson and gold, their scales catching the dim light like scattered coins." Sentence rhythm varies naturally, opening stems shift, and figurative language (nautilus shell, pulse points, dying leaves) serves mood without stacking. Minor template cadence in two adjacent lines mid-story ("She had felt it first...," "She had spent her life...") slightly flattens momentum but does not touch closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; the final sequence ("It wasn't a pattern. It was a door. And the axis...") propels cleanly with zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-apocalyptic library keeper discovers metaphysical threshold through medieval tapestry and half-burned diaries—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template apocalypse or stock revelation. The "displaced axis" as directional rather than broken is a fresh inflection that reframes prior material in hindsight. The "bronze quiet" tone and accumulative structure cohere as a singular vision. Risk-taking in the lyric, slow-build approach and the absence of overt conflict heightens stakes through atmosphere and perception without gimmickry, though the "last human dream" frame is a familiar post-human motif that the piece does not fully transform beyond invocation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices—pressing her palm to the silo, brushing the threads—create key turns at closure. Present throughout, her perceptive stance enables the discovery and the final reach. Two beats (pressing, reaching) show decision that alters her trajectory from collector to participant, meeting the two-beat threshold for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tapestry appears in the opening third, is handled and examined across multiple beats (spreading it, feeling it shiver, watching dragons lift their heads), and its unraveling at closure creates the door. The object's properties (non-repeating pattern, moving dragons) are causally indispensable to the ending image. Three gates met; strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The displaced axis is seeded early ("something that had unspooled the moment the last dreamer closed their eyes"), recurs in the diaries ("The axis is slipping"), and is reframed at closure ("the axis...had always been pointing somewhere else"), reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. It shapes Elara's perception and the ending's meaning, though it does not constrain a mid-scene tactical choice, keeping it below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" enables on-page actions: noticing cracks in the world, feeling the silo's vibration, sensing the tapestry's response. The attribute is embodied in her touch and attention, driving two beats (silo press, thread brush). It does not impose a visible tradeoff or cost—her perception succeeds without friction—limiting the score to mid-range despite presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Probe" appears explicitly in the diaries beat ("Elara probed them carefully") and implicitly in her repeated tactile investigation (tracing spines, spreading tapestry, pressing silo). The action drives the discovery sequence and the final reach, shaping two major turns. If swapped for "examine" or "search," the mechanics remain similar, but the careful, invasive connotation fits the threshold moment, earning solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered and probed mid-story, providing the clues ("The walls remember," "The axis is slipping") that reframe Elara's understanding. Present in one extended beat, they enable the conceptual shift but do not appear at closure or shape the final image directly. Setup and development gates met; closure participation absent, capping the score despite solid causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is established immediately, its spiral shelves and concrete ribs creating spatial choreography. The silo's vibration and groaning pressure Elara's perception at closure, and its structure (shelves tilting) participates in the final image. The setting constrains and charges the ending, meeting all three gates with strong specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last human dream is dreamt") is seeded early and contextualizes the silence and the "axis...unspooled" logic. It establishes stakes (isolation, finality) but does not tighten a mid-scene decision or create a live clock. Setup and thematic presence are solid; development and payoff remain atmospheric rather than tactical, landing in mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is stated early and dramatized through her touch and attention. The diaries complicate it ("the walls had been listening to something else"), and the closure reframes it (listening as key, not collection). Friction between her archival want and the threshold's demand is legible, though the cost of abandoning collection could be more viscerally felt to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" as tone is coherent throughout: the air "settled like dust on a bronze plate," "the way the air inside settled," "slow, deep thrum." The tone modulates subtly under pressure (the silo groans, dragons gleam) without breaking, and the final image—Elara reaching into the space beyond—carries the same hushed, charged quality. The tone charges the closure image, meeting the high-band test for this element.</comment>
