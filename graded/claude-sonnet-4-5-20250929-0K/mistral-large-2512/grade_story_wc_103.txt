<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to fix the time-loop is clearly rooted in her grief over lost family, and her final choice to press the fragment to her mother's chest carries visible cost—she loses the fragment and the woman. Interiority is vivid in the opening beats ("she had never thought it would unravel so visibly, so *personally*"), but the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final act; no contradictory impulses complicate her decision to use the fragment. The child/daughter thread introduces confusion: the photograph shows "her daughter," but the street scene reveals "her mother" holding a bundle stolen by time "before she could be born"—this genealogical knot is never clarified on the page, weakening causality and flattening what should be the story's most charged relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (garden), and the inciting object (halo fragment) within the first third. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara wakes in the garden, photographs restored, fragment gone, aged "not in the way of years"—a Charged Poise moment where touching time has exacted a felt if oblique cost. However, causality stumbles at the closure beat: the mechanism by which pressing the fragment to her mother disintegrates the woman, restores all photographs (not just that one), and ages Elara remains unexplained, reading as coincidental resolution rather than earned consequence. The daughter/mother genealogy confusion noted in Q1 also clouds the stakes at the peak turn. Drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture (garden hums, photographs fade, willows whisper), but the final turn lacks because/therefore linkage—applying the artifact fixes everything off-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is introduced early, sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ivy into arches," "willow roots into staircases that spiraled into the earth"), and the oldest willow's roots shape the doorway that delivers Elara into the trapped moment. The garden's leaves brush her arms "like fingers," guiding her through the maze, and the final image returns her to the willow's roots "cradling her like a child"—the setting actively constrains movement and charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean (cottage → central bridge → heart of labyrinth → street beyond the willow door), though the street-scene lacks layered sensory anchoring beyond gas lamps and damp air, reducing the reader's foothold in that pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring fading photographs and, implicitly, recovering lost family—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph "reversed" into a horrifying street scene, forcing Elara into the garden. The protagonist's agency at closure (pressing the fragment to her mother) is a decisive physical act, but the cost is stated rather than dramatized: "The woman's form began to disintegrate... into light, into *time*." The garden lets her see, then she acts, then silence—no on-page resistance, no visible tradeoff between restoring the photos and losing the mother's presence, no lasting wound that alters her stance in the final paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs (photograph reversal → garden call → willow doorway), but escalation is compressed and the peak choice feels like the only path rather than a narrowing of live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: memory, loss, and the cost of touching the past. The photographs fade "as if burned by an unseen flame," the retrocognitively trapped are "alive in the past, yet lingering in the present like a stain," and the final image—"She had touched the texture of time, and it had touched her back"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The halo fragment and willow roots recur with reweighted meaning at closure, and the garden's "quaking with reverie" reinforces tone. However, the phrase "texture of time" is both title-card and prompt-label, repeated three times with increasing abstraction; the final line "But for now, she let the past rest" edges toward tidy sentiment rather than sustained ambiguity, slightly flattening what had been complex grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara throughout; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the street-scene encounter with her mother. Diction is elevated and consistent ("hyperbolic geometry," "retrocognitively trapped"), though occasionally tips into academic register ("a paradox: alive in the past, yet lingering in the present like a stain") that edges beyond what a grieving maze designer would frame mid-crisis. The dialogue exchange with the mother is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You shouldn't be here" / "I know"), but the mother's voice lacks distinct idiom—she could be any ghost. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure (short, clipped beats during the street scene; longer, lyric cadences in the garden restoration), and no head-hopping mars the focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong imagery ("a shard of golden light that pulsed faintly when she touched it, warm as a heartbeat"), and the opening paragraph establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, the piece accumulates minor loops and scaffold: "not from wind but from recognition" / "not as she had known her, but as she had been *before*" / "not into nothingness, but into light, into *time*"—three template not-but pairs within 400 words, creating a rhythmic drumbeat. The phrase "the texture of time" recurs three times without functional variation, and the genealogy knot (daughter/mother/bundle) is narrated with vague pronouns that obscure rather than clarify ("the child she had lost" in para 5, "her daughter" in para 8, "her daughter stolen by time before she could be born" in para 13—who is the subject of "her" in that final clause?). These artifacts dull momentum at peak beats but do not collapse causality outright.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—fading photographs as literal memory-loss linked to time-trapped souls—offers a fresh synthesis of grief, temporal paradox, and garden-as-archive. The halo fragment is a specific, non-obvious object, and the willow-root doorway into a stretched moment is vivid. However, the retrocognitively trapped are introduced via summary exposition ("She had read about them in forbidden texts"), and the resolution (fragment disintegrates mother, restores all photos, ages Elara) leans on unexplained magic rather than established rules. The emotional particulars (her parents, first lover, lost child) remain generic placeholder losses without lived detail or hierarchy, weakening transformation-test integrity—swap names and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, shapes the opening (designer of the garden for thirty years), discovers the fragment, experiments with the photograph, follows the garden's call, and makes the closure choice (pressing fragment to mother's chest). Her profession seeds the garden's responsiveness but does not constrain her maze-navigation or inform her tactics beyond thematic flavor. Two distinct beats involve active choice (lifting the fragment, using it on the photograph; pressing it to the mother), and the final act drives disintegration and restoration, meeting the mid-to-upper band. However, the design skill itself does not create visible cost or tactical friction on the page—she is designer by label, actor by necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment is introduced early (para 7, ~20% mark), handled physically ("warm as a heartbeat," "pressed... to one of the fading photographs"), drives the photograph-reversal beat (para 9), and is used again at closure (pressed to mother's chest, para 15), disintegrating the woman and vanishing by para 17. Three distinct beats involve the fragment, it shapes the peak turn, and its absence at the end signals irreversible cost. The fragment's properties (golden light, pulsing, warm) and its role as "a sliver of the cage that held them" are specific and causally necessary—without it, Elara cannot enter or alter the trapped moment. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fading photographs frame the story (para 4–5 opening, para 17 closure: "whole again, their colors vivid"), drive Elara's initial stake (recover lost faces), and the reversal beat (para 9: photograph shudders, reverses into street scene) forces her into the garden. However, the concept is more result than active constraint—the photographs fade passively, and Elara does not wrestle with their translucency or manipulate them beyond the single fragment-press experiment. The restoration at the end is told in one summary sentence without dramatized discovery or cost-check, weakening closure participation. Two gates (setup, payoff) met, middle development marginal, so mid-band fits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The retrocognitively trapped are introduced via exposition (para 11: "She had read about them in forbidden texts"), and the attribute shapes the mother's state (para 14: "moments that refused to end"). However, the trait is explained rather than demonstrated—no on-page constraint shows how being trapped alters the mother's choices or limits Elara's tactics. The concept charges the thematic atmosphere but does not visibly constrain action or create a dramatized cost tied to this specific attribute. Late signal (~40% mark), summary-only use, and swappable with "time ghost" or similar generic paradox, so mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Disintegration is the climactic action (para 15: "The woman's form began to disintegrate, not into nothingness, but into light, into *time*"), directly caused by Elara pressing the fragment to her mother's chest, and it triggers the street's dissolution and Elara's return. The act is irreversible and specific to this element (disintegrate fits the time/light metaphor), and the ending hinges on its consequence (mother gone, photos restored). However, the verb is stated rather than staged—no sensory progression, no resistance, no visible intermediate cost before the blackout. One major turn traces to this action, closure participation is solid, so upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry appears once (para 12: "the air shimmered, warped as if viewed through a lens of hyperbolic geometry") as atmospheric description at the willow threshold. The method is not signaled earlier, its mechanics do not shape Elara's entry or navigation, and it could be replaced with "distorted," "bent," or any synonym for spatial warping without structural loss. Label-only mention, no causal pressure, no cost, so low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is introduced in the opening paragraph, its labyrinthine paths and willow-root staircases seed Elara's profession, and the garden's aliveness is demonstrated early (para 2: "where the past and present grew into each other like vines"). The garden calls Elara (para 10), the hedges shift to guide her (para 11), the oldest willow's roots form the doorway (para 12), and she wakes cradled in those roots at closure (para 17). Three distinct beats involve the setting, it actively pressures choice (the call cannot be ignored), and the final image charges the willow's recurring presence. High integration, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of time" is stated in exposition (para 6: "Elara had spent a lifetime studying the texture of time") and thematically reinforced at closure (para 18: "She had touched the texture of time, and it had touched her back"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices—Elara does not weigh the cost of learning against safety or other wants on the page; she acts because the garden calls and the photographs fade. The motivation frames theme but does not create on-page friction or narrow options. Setup and payoff gates met, development weak, so mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone is established early through diction ("quaking," "hummed with the weight of memories not yet faded," "whispered when she lifted it") and sustained across the garden and street scenes. The prose modulates under pressure (lyric in the opening and restoration paragraphs, tighter and more concrete during the street encounter), and the final line ("its leaves quaking with reverie") reprises the opening's atmospheric register. However, "quaking reverie" as a phrase does not appear verbatim on the page, and the tone at the peak beat (para 15: disintegration) briefly flattens into summary abstraction ("into light, into *time*") rather than sustaining embodied tremor. Coherent and present, modulates with pressure, but the final image could more vividly embody the quaking rather than tell the garden's state.</comment>
