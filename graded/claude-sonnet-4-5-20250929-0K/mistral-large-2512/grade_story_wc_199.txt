<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is stated (decode falling leaves, sort chaos into order) but her interiority reads label-only: "her edges softened, her movements slower" is summary rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation sequence—moss on hands, vines in hair—lands as ornamental rather than felt cost tied to prior choices. Her final smile and continued leaf-sorting lack visible foreclosure; she appears unchanged in stance despite the arbor's contact, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase via moonstone dust proliferation and leaf-pattern recognition). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora becomes "part of the folklore" and continues sorting, but the cost is decorative—no path is foreclosed on the page, no live option visibly sacrificed. The final image recycles the opening (sorting) without reweighting stakes, and the villagers' whispered claim of transformation is told rather than dramatized with consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is vivid and present across beats (roots, branches, leaf-fall rhythms). The moonstone dust speck functions as a recurring object that multiplies and charges the monument-building sequence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Liora's actions (sorting, building monuments, arranging leaves) proceed unimpeded. Sensory detail is selective (moss, silver dust, pale blue glow) but largely decorative; spatial choreography remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early. Pressure does not escalate under the Accumulative lens: the moonstone dust multiplies, Liora arranges leaves into names, but no tightening choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The overnight dream-transformation (moss-stained hands, vine-tangled hair) is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The final act (building a larger monument, arranging leaves) repeats prior moves without visible cost or consequence that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—order found in chaos, forgotten names preserved—emerges from repeated images (seed sorting, monuments, leaf patterns) rather than direct statement. The moonstone speck and leaf-spelling beat attempt resonance but the arbor's "message" (names of the forgotten and yet-to-be) remains abstract. The ending offers a quiet reconfiguration (Liora becomes folklore herself) but the conceptual cost is not legible on the page—she continues sorting with a smile, unchanged in method or stance, so the "answer" to the central question lacks felt weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (seed-sorter precision, "edges," "movements") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fleeting note in nature's grand composition," "world where the leaves were not dead but dormant") that reads authorial rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's "whispered that she had become part of the folklore now" is distant summary rather than close internal experience. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "understood") are frequent but voice-motivated enough to remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained but momentum stalls in mid-story reflection ("If order could be found in chaos, she reasoned…"). Sentence stems repeat: "She had spent months building…," "She had never seen anything like it…," "She began to arrange them…" Template cadence across multiple paragraphs triggers −0.5. Purple tendencies appear ("ashen skyborne arbor stretched like a skeletal hand," "light bled into twilight") and mixed metaphor at "pulling her deeper into a world where the leaves were not dead but dormant, holding memories" blurs sense. The loop "prodded…gently" recurs without adding pressure. No line-level artifacts obscure the closure image but cumulative patterns lower band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The seed-sorter seeking patterns in leaves offers a modest angle on order-versus-chaos. The moonstone cabochon dust speck and arbor-as-folklore are specific but the emotional arc (woman listens to trees, is transformed, continues sorting) echoes familiar "touched by nature" templates without a non-obvious turn. The overnight transformation (moss, vines) and villagers' awe are told conveniences rather than earned causality. The final synthesis—Liora as folklore herself—is signaled by outside voices rather than a protagonist choice that reweights prior stakes, limiting freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout but her choices (kneel, build monuments, pluck leaf, arrange leaves) do not create key turns—she observes patterns and reacts to them. The major shift (overnight transformation) happens to her off-page. At closure she continues sorting, a repetition of opening behavior rather than a decision that alters tactics. Present in setup, middle, and ending but agency is low; swappable with another observer-protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moonstone cabochon dust speck appears late (evening scene, past midpoint). It multiplies in a second beat (next morning) and is placed at the center of the final monument. Early signal is missing (−0.5 late penalty). Two beats of involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (center stone) (+0.8) elevate, but the dust does not constrain choice or enable tactics under stress—it decorates the sequence. Swappability moderate; another glowing element could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Regional folklore is present in setup (villagers speak of arbor, echoes of the dead) and at closure (Liora "became part of the folklore now"). It frames expectation (+0.4) and participates in the ending image (+0.7). However, it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—Liora's actions (sorting, monument-building) do not change because of folklore rules. The concept is thematic rather than causal; present but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is signaled obliquely ("she emerged transformed, always") and shown once (overnight transformation: moss-stained hands, vine-tangled hair, softened edges, slower movements). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—the transformation is result rather than active trait. Label-only rendering (−0.3) and no middle development beat (missing development gate → cap 3.4). Present at closure when villagers note her change, lifting slightly above floor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Prod" appears twice: Liora prods monuments "gently to ensure they hadn't shifted" and later prods a spiral of pebbles, which crumbles and releases silver dust, leading to her epiphany about leaf sequences. Early signal (first third) (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), enables the understanding turn (+0.8), and is present at closure conceptually (she continues tending/sorting). Specific cost is absent—no visible trade-off tied to the prodding action itself—and the epiphany follows rather than being forced by the prod. Moderately essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments to forgotten things is introduced in paragraph three, present across beats (she tends them daily, builds a larger circle at closure), and shapes her method throughout. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (final circle monument) (+0.8). However, the monuments do not constrain a choice or enable tactics under stress—they are ritualized acts that decorate rather than complicate her goal. Swappable with another meditative practice; no on-page cost tied to building.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor is present in setup (opening image), middle (roots, branches, leaf-fall), and closure (branches tremble, leaves rain down). Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure participation (arbor's response to final monument) (+0.9). The arbor supplies the leaves and creates atmosphere but does not constrain Liora's actions or alter tactics—she moves freely beneath it. Micro-setting (roots, branches) is vivid but not tactically decisive. Highly specific and irreplaceable as image (+0.5), moderately essential to structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is invoked once in paragraph two and mentioned again at closure ("ashen sky"). The timeframe is poetic but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Liora's actions unfold across months and then one evening/morning without time pressure altering moves. Missing middle development (no tactical urgency driven by this time), vague tracking (−0.6 late penalty when it reappears only as mood). Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To decode the message in falling leaves" is introduced in paragraph one, motivates her monument-building and leaf observation across beats, and is fulfilled at closure when she arranges leaves into names. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (she "understood the leaves' message") (+0.8). However, desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between want and cost. The decoding succeeds without visible sacrifice or trade-off; the moonstone dust conveniently multiplies to assist. Functional but low conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" is attempted through moss imagery (moss-stained hands, moss clinging to sleeves) and Liora's final smile, but the tone reads contemplative/mystical rather than delightful. The moss appears twice (dream aftermath, closure) and charges the transformation image (+0.5 closure linkage). Tone is not coherent—early passages lean eerie ("skeletal hand," "dead lingered"), middle is neutral observation, ending shifts to gentle satisfaction. No modulation under pressure; static mood descriptor. Present but mismatched to overall register.</comment>
