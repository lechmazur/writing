<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "feel something again" is established early and drives his choices through the training sequence. The embodied response during combat—"heat, pressure, pulse of his own blood"—shows concrete progress. However, the epiphany that "numbness wasn't his enemy—it was the canvas" arrives via Master Veyra's wisdom rather than emerging from Kael's own struggle, and the final step off the dojo edge feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation efficiently (floating dojo, Kael + Veyra, training goal) and follows a causal progression: training failures → Veyra's teaching → breakthrough → departure. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael steps forward "not knowing if he'd fly or fall," crystallizing his acceptance that movement itself is victory. The cost is legible—he leaves numbness intact but reconfigured—and the lens holds as situational pressure forcing stance crystallization. One tightening occurs when Veyra's blade "sliced through the illusion" of his self-narrative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating dojo, weathered platform grooves, ozone-and-incense air, and churning clouds anchor setting vividly. The brain jar recurs with thematic weight, and the sword exchanges show clear spatial choreography. The dojo's trembling ("the earth itself had noticed") adds atmosphere but doesn't materially constrain Kael's final choice. Micro-setting (practice sword weight, slick palms) supports embodiment throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled immediately and drives all action. The training sequence escalates through failed parry → retrieval → "crack that echoed through the sky" → raw attack that cracks the numbness. Veyra's opposition remains consistent, and the sword-loss/recovery cycle narrows Kael's options until he abandons technique for "raw, clumsy need." The final step carries felt risk (fly or fall), though the precipitating cost is more atmospheric than material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of ego dissolution vs. authenticity emerges through the duplicate brain's "silent scream" and Veyra's teaching that "pain is just pain." The realization that "numbness wasn't everything, either" offers complexity without moralizing. However, "Light needs dark. Joy needs sorrow" trends toward stated wisdom rather than dramatized discovery, and the final image—stepping into clouds—leans metaphorical without a fully earned non-literal charge from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Veyra's economy ("Then fight") and Kael's interior questions carry distinct rhythms. The free indirect thought ("*Why am I here?*") integrates cleanly. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during combat, narrowing to immediate sensation. One minor slip: "History is rewriting itself" in Veyra's speech reads slightly elevated for the moment's urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, alternating short action beats with longer reflective passages. The opening anchors voice and stakes; information density is high throughout. Minor template cadence appears in the combat sequence: "He moved... He lunged... He attacked." The metaphor "numbness cracked... into heat, into pressure, into pulse" is clear and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold detected. Propulsion remains steady through the departure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo and brain-in-jar setup offer a fresh frame for the numbness-through-combat premise. The "duplicate custody battle" backstory adds conceptual texture, and the complementary-opposites teaching avoids cliché by embedding it in sword work. However, the emotional arc—broken warrior seeks feeling through training, discovers acceptance—follows a recognizable structure. The final step into clouds is evocative but not fully transformative of the template. Specificity in setting and the jar image elevate originality modestly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's choices (retrieving sword, shifting focus, attacking with need) drive the training beats and his final departure. He is framed as a numbness survivor seeking vitality. However, the backstory positions him as someone *seeking* ego death rather than a survivor emerging from it; the label fits loosely. Two gates: setup (paragraph 1), payoff (departure). Missing clear middle development where this identity constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The jar appears in three beats: Veyra's glance, Veyra's teaching monologue, and Kael's final look. It seeds the clone-custody theme and charges Veyra's lesson about pretense. The reprise—"It had fought for a self that no longer existed. He didn't have to"—reweights Kael's stance. However, the jar remains static; Kael never handles it, and its function is primarily thematic illustration. All three gates present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The custody battle is recounted as backstory (founder cloned himself, original vanished, duplicate remained) and thematically echoed in Veyra's teaching. It flavors the setting but does not shape on-page tactics or decisions; Kael's struggle is about numbness, not identity litigation. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but no middle beat where the concept alters Kael's options. Swappable with other identity-crisis backstories.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Veyra's blade "sliced through the illusion" in the climactic sequence, literalizing her attribute. The teaching about the duplicate's "sacred" pain and Kael's self-narrative ("I'm broken. I'm empty") are pretenses cut away. This trait drives the tutorial method and charges the breakthrough. Early signal (Veyra's sharp gaze), middle use (teaching), and payoff (illusion slice). Visible cost: Kael gasps "not from pain, but from the absence of it."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veyra uses "vivify" in her advice: "Then vivify what's left." The term seeds the realization that numbness can be a starting point. The action reappears implicitly when Kael feels alive ("not whole, not healed, but *alive*"). However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized; no spell, ritual, or physical act of vivification occurs. Setup and closure reprise present; middle development weak. Moderate thematic weight but low causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Veyra teaches "Opposites define each other. Light needs dark. Joy needs sorrow" explicitly, and Kael's breakthrough comes when he stops trying to erase numbness and instead accepts it as "one color in the spectrum." The method is stated in dialogue and then enacted in the final shift. Present in middle teaching and closure. However, the sword combat itself does not operationalize the method; it's more insight than tactic. Lyric reprise with moderate causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo anchors every beat: grooves worn by centuries, trembling during the breakthrough, the edge where Kael departs. The platform's weathered surface and the drop into clouds create spatial pressure that charges the final step. The setting is irreplaceable; a ground-level dojo would lose the fly-or-fall stakes. Early signal, used across multiple beats (training, tremor, departure), and shapes the closure image decisively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Veyra mentions "history is rewriting itself" once: "Below us, wars are won and lost, borders redrawn, names forgotten." This frames the dojo as timeless against flux but does not create urgency or alter Kael's tactics. The timeframe is ornamental atmosphere rather than a ticking clock. Present in one beat (middle), absent from setup and closure. No causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's desire to "feel something again" is stated in the opening, tested through failed combat, and partially fulfilled in the breakthrough ("heat, pressure, pulse"). The friction between wanting feeling and fearing its absence drives every choice. The motivation reappears in his final step: movement as proof of life. Early signal, middle friction (holding back), and closure payoff (acceptance of uncertainty). Visible cost: he leaves numbness intact, reconfigured but not erased.</comment>
