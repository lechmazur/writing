<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior world is established through concrete detail (booth, disc, tunnel routine), and her "cultivated estrangement" is embodied in the listening pattern. The woman's "I think I'm ready" and the boy's disappearance provide micro-choices with cost. However, the reflection on grief and foster-home stories risks summary; the final question "if she had done enough" feels abstract rather than tied to a specific on-page price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recurring caller details and the disc's charged returns. The woman's "I think I'm ready" and the boy's cessation constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara's passive listening crystallizes as consequence. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. Cost is implied rather than visibly dramatized—Mara wonders but does not act or lose anything concrete on the page—which keeps this from high-band entry despite clean structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The utility tunnel, booth, and glass disc are vivid and specific; the disc's spirals "seemed to move when she wasn't looking" and the "hum of streetlamps" frame time effectively. The disc constrains Mara's attempts to play it and charges the closure image when she presses it to her ear. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's familiarity. Minor: the flooded maintenance shaft origin feels ornamental rather than constraint-bearing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's refusal to fix the callers, which escalates when the woman signals readiness and the boy stops calling. The "teach endings how to begin" motif reframes earlier passivity. However, the escalation is largely summary (the woman "didn't speak," the boy "stopped calling") rather than a dramatized turn where Mara's choice narrows her options. The cost—her wondering—is conceptual and undramatized, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mara's listening practice and the disc's "melody without music." The glass harmonica as vessel for unsung grief is non-literal and resonant. The woman's "I think I'm ready" reweights the prior material without moralizing. The final question invites reflection. Minor slip: "teach endings how to begin" in paragraph six edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication, though it remains embodied in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "scent so familiar...she no longer noticed it," "melodically haunted." Diction ("metronome for grief," "loop of dead air") is character-particular. The woman's and boy's dialogue fragments carry subtext. Distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider summary of the twelve-year tenure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice holds under pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening anchors setting and voice cleanly. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high in the caller vignettes. Minor issues: "cultivated estrangement—that was what she called the way she lived" is expository scaffold; "melodically haunted, that disc" repeats without added pressure. The phrase "teach endings how to begin" recurs without evolving. No major loops touch closure, but cumulative minor redundancy prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground operator listening to wrong-number grief is a fresh synthesis; the glass harmonica disc as silent resonator is specific and non-obvious. The choice not to correct callers transforms the "helpful operator" trope. The "teach endings how to begin" frame risks abstraction but is grounded in the disc's vibration and the callers' needs. Transformation test passes: plot would not work unchanged with a generic listener role. Risk-taking in the passive protagonist design elevates slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her listening practice drives the emotional arc. Her choice not to correct callers shapes all three caller beats. The closure moment—pressing the disc to her ear and wondering—ties to her stance. However, her agency is largely passive observation until the final beat; the woman's readiness happens to her rather than through a decision Mara makes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in paragraph four, returns in paragraph eight ("pressed her palm"), paragraph nine ("pressed...to her ear"), and the final paragraph ("pressed...to her ear, listening"). Its vibration without sound mirrors Mara's listening without fixing. The final beat charges it with the question of sufficiency. However, the disc does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its role is lyric reprise rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cultivated estrangement" is named in paragraph five and operationalized through Mara's twelve-year tenure and refusal to correct callers. It shapes her tactics (listening without fixing) and the closure question of whether distance was enough. The concept appears early, drives the caller interactions, and is tested at the end. However, it is somewhat told rather than purely dramatized—the label itself does interpretive work the scenes could carry alone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Melodically haunted" appears in paragraph seven as a descriptor of the disc: "haunted by all the voices she had carried." It is evocative but does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible tradeoff. The disc's inability to produce sound might imply this quality, but the trait itself remains label-only. No choice hinges on the disc being "melodically haunted" versus simply "silent" or "resonant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The loop is visible in the woman calling "every Tuesday at 3:17 AM" and the boy who "loop[s] back to the beginning, over and over." Mara lets both callers loop rather than breaking the cycle. The woman's "I think I'm ready" may signal loop-breaking, and the boy's cessation implies the same. The action shapes two beats and the closure question. However, the loop is more thematic recurrence than a decisive physical or tactical act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Wrong-number friendships are signaled in paragraph four and operationalized in the woman (Daniel) and boy (mother) vignettes. Mara's method—letting them talk, murmuring—shapes her tactics and the emotional stakes. The woman's readiness and the boy's cessation are consequences of this method. Present early, drives two beats, and contributes to closure. The method could be more causally irreplaceable (a direct intervention might yield the same result), preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel is named in the opening line and detailed (booth, ladder, junction box, tunnels Mara walks). It provides atmosphere and grounds the isolation. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The booth could be any isolated workspace. The tunnel's "hum" and "shadows" are vivid but ornamental. Micro-setting (the disc on the shelf) does more causal work than the macro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" appears once in paragraph eight, describing when Mara walks the tunnels "when the city above was quiet but not asleep." It sets mood but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The woman calls "every Tuesday at 3:17 AM," which is more specific, but this element itself remains vague and non-constraining. No choice hinges on this timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To teach endings how to begin" is articulated in paragraph eight and tested in the final two paragraphs when the woman signals readiness and the boy stops calling. Mara's wondering "if she had done enough" ties to this motivation. However, the desire is more told than dramatized in conflicted choice; Mara does not face a friction between this want and a competing cost on the page. Present early and at closure, but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>
