<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode her father's cryptic system is established, but her interior voice leans on stock phrasing ("the weight of the revelation pressing against her ribs"). The father's compulsive gambling and probability teaching create useful contradictions, yet his final theory feels asserted rather than earned through her on-page choices. Micro-choices exist (lighting the matchbook, deciding to "burn the numbers herself") but the final stance—paying debts by rejecting his games—arrives as epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (rain, library, Elara) appear early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery (mica lanterns, scrawls, equations) accumulates toward a realization. However, the closure—"burn the numbers herself"—is metaphorical assertion without a visible, felt cost or a decisive change in tactics. The revelation that "the house doesn't always win" reconfigures the premise conceptually, but the on-page consequence (she will pay debts "not by playing the games he'd lost") remains abstract, not dramatized with a specific forfeiture or action that alters her situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, mica-pane lanterns, and basement archives are vivid and purposeful. The lantern is handled twice (lit, then flame applied to mica pane) and its light transformation drives the climactic revelation. Sensory detail is selective ("mildew and old ambition," "fractured light through translucent windows") and filtered through Elara's investigative focus. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (entrance → reference desk → basement).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding her father's cryptic system to understand his final theory—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the matchbook flame transforms the lantern's light and rearranges the equations. However, the escalation is textural (accumulation of clues) rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options. The resolution ("she would pay his debts... not by playing the games he'd lost") asserts agency but does not show a visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the father's contradictions ("probability professor who knew the odds... and still bet against them") and the central question of whether rebellion means breaking or bending rules. The final image—"burn the numbers herself"—offers a non-literal answer tied to rejecting systemic inevitability. However, "widen perspectives responsibly" and "lucid contradictions" are stated too directly as thematic labels rather than dramatized through concrete choices. The closing insight that "the house doesn't always win. It just makes you think it does" verges on thematic summary rather than emergent resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative voice carries a distinct texture ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions," "mica-pane lanterns") that matches Elara's academic-investigative focus. Perceptual signature is character-specific (filtering details through probability and her father's notebooks). The librarian's dialogue ("Your father used to ask for those too") carries subtext and advances plot. Some filter verbs and expository interiority ("the weight of the revelation pressing against her ribs") are functional but dull immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and rhythmically varied. Information density is high in places ("He'd called them 'lucid contradictions,' the kind of equations that made sense only if you squinted at them sideways"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the library's mica-pane lanterns flickered" returns as "lit one of the mica-pane lanterns" without adding new pressure; "the weight of the revelation pressing against her ribs" and "the moment settling into her bones" recycle embodied-emotion templates. Figurative language occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("probability was just a language for the universe's cruelest jokes").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of compulsive gambler, probability professor, and cryptic scrawls on subway seats offers a specific, non-generic frame. The mica-pane lantern as decryption tool is a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc—daughter uncovering father's final lesson via hidden clues—follows a familiar template without transforming it through unexpected moral calculus or lived complexity. The ending's metaphorical assertion ("burn the numbers herself") gestures toward originality but does not follow through with a concrete, irreversible choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (seeking archives, lighting the lantern, deciding to burn the numbers) drive key beats. However, her status as "compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter" functions more as backstory frame than on-page constraint. The final decision to pay debts "not by playing the games he'd lost" arises from revelation rather than a trade-off shaped by her own gambling or teaching. Present by setup, shapes one turn (lighting the lantern), and contributes to closure assertion, but the specific compulsive-gambler lineage does not constrain her tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mica-pane lantern appears early (fractured light in opening paragraph), is handled twice (lit in basement, flame applied to pane), and its transformation—turning "white-hot, searing the numbers into her vision"—enables the climactic revelation. The lantern's changing state (dim glow → white-hot → fading) tracks across beats and charges the final image. Removing the mica pane would break the decryption mechanism and the closure's sensory anchor. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is named explicitly ("He'd called them 'lucid contradictions'") and frames the father's equations as paradoxes that "made sense only if you squinted at them sideways." The concept echoes thematically (father as gambler-professor, "the ultimate contradiction") but does not constrain Elara's on-page tactics or alter her options. Present by setup and linked to closure thematically, but the concept remains a label rather than a mechanism that shapes her choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is paraphrased ("rebellion wasn't about breaking rules—it was about understanding them so well you could bend them") but functions as backstory exposition rather than a trait that constrains or enables Elara's actions. Her investigative moves (seeking archives, lighting the lantern) do not dramatize rebellion or involve visible trade-offs between obedience and defiance. Label-only mention without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara traverses the city by following cryptic scrawls ("spent the last week traversing the city's underbelly") and physically traverses the library (entrance → desk → basement). The action is signaled early and shapes one key beat (descending to archives), but the traversal itself is summarized rather than dramatized with obstacles or changing conditions. Functional but somewhat swappable with "search" or "investigate." Present across beats but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats is signaled early ("numbers and symbols she recognized from her father's old notebooks") and drives the week-long investigation that leads Elara to the library. The method shapes her approach (following a trail of equations) and is paid off when the final scrawl instructs her to "Burn the numbers to see the light." However, the mechanics of interpretation are summarized rather than shown; we do not see her decode a scrawl on the page. Present by setup, shapes middle pursuit, and contributes to closure instruction, but interpretation as a visible process is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer is established early ("rain had been falling for three days straight," "mica-pane lanterns flickered in the dim") and provides sensory anchors (wet parchment, mildew, humming servers). The basement setting supplies the crucial resource (the restricted archives and the book with her father's notes) that enables the climax. Midsummer is implied by "summer reading list" but does not constrain tactics. The library's layered spaces (entrance, desk, basement) guide Elara's descent and the rain charges the opening and closing tone. Strong spatial pressure and resource linkage; midsummer element is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" is signaled in the second sentence and frames Elara's urgency ("not when every spare moment should have been spent grading papers"). The timeframe provides backstory pressure (father's recent death, unpaid debts) but does not function as a live clock that alters her moves on the page. The three-day rain suggests elapsed time since the inciting event, but the timeframe does not tighten her decisions in the basement. Present by setup and colors motivation, but does not shape tactics with time-based cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Widen perspectives responsibly" is quoted directly as the father's phrase and linked to the book title *The Responsible Expansion of Perspective*. The motivation echoes thematically in Elara's final decision to pay debts by rejecting systemic rules. However, the desire to widen perspectives is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction between broadening understanding and immediate cost. Present by setup and asserted at closure, but the motivation does not constrain her on-page actions with felt trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" appears once as a phrase ("the clover melancholy of the moment settling into her bones") and the tone—wistful, measured grief mixed with investigative resolve—is sustained through the opening rain, the librarian's quiet recognition, and the fading lantern glow at the end. The tone modulates slightly (anticipation when the lantern turns white-hot, resolve in the final paragraph) but remains coherent. However, "clover melancholy" as a specific descriptor is ornamental; removing the exact phrase would not alter the tonal arc. Tone charges the final image but the unique label is not indispensable.</comment>
