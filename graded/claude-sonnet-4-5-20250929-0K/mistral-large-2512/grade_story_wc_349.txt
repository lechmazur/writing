<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias has a clear internal want (to find where stories begin) and faces a transaction that tests it, but his interior remains abstract and label-driven ("mindfully scattered," "question without an answer"). The woman dissolves into metaphor without earned cost—her unraveling carries no visible sacrifice or trade-off that alters Elias's options. Interiority relies on poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric intent. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~150 words of abstraction, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("the moment before the first word is spoken"), but cost remains atmospheric—no on-page forfeiture or reweighted prior material with undeniable pressure. The woman's transaction and dissolution function as ornament rather than a causal turn that narrows Elias's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and skylight are vivid, and the bottled moonlight casts shifting shadows that charge two beats (counter display, spillage into key). The ~150-word orientation delay caps this category at 7.0 per Q2. The library's drifting-cloud setting remains postcard description; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Selective sensory detail (ozone, old paper) anchors mood but does not participate in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find where stories begin") is signaled early but remains abstract. The woman's arrival and transaction offer a reversal opportunity, yet her request and the moonlight's transformation into a key lack visible cost or tactical consequence—Elias gains a coin (a "compressed sigh") but no path is foreclosed. The ending smile and open door function as thematic echo rather than a tightening that narrows options under pressure. One tightening is present (the exchange) but agency and cost are ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (stories begin in silence before words) is stated directly in Elias's closing reflection: "the moment before the first word is spoken, the silence before the ink touches the page." The bottled moonlight → key → mist sequence gestures at transformation but dissolves without reweighting prior particulars. "Parole" appears once as ornament ("faintest glimmer of parole") without dramatized cost. Final-paragraph moralizing ("Maybe the trick wasn't to find the beginning…") replaces earned resonance, triggering −0.5 to −0.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds clean focalization on Elias. Diction is lyric and consistent ("prismatic dust," "dandelion fluff"), but elevated register crowds the prose in every beat without pattern-teaching, trending toward overwriting (−0.3). Dialogue carries subtext ("You don't know either, do you?") but the woman's lines are interchangeable with Elias's interior idiom. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is poetic but uniform across pressure states.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is mostly clean, but figurative density is high without payoff: "like seeds tossed into the wind," "like a secret too heavy to keep," "like smoke." Paraphrase loop in the middle: "things appeared and disappeared, not because they were lost, but because they were still being decided" restates the library's flux without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in opener: "The air smelled…" "Elias exhaled…" "He had incised…" three consecutive subject-verb stems (−0.4). Artifacts total −0.6, and elevated diction at closure ("parole," "prismatic," "androgynous figure with ink-stained fingers") drifts from scene urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Premise (vendor seeks story origins in a floating library) offers a fresh frame, and the bottled moonlight → key transformation is specific. However, the ending retreats into abstraction ("the moment before the first word") rather than following the premise's implications. The woman's dissolving coat and parole glimmer are ornamental rather than inevitable consequences. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) is present but undercut by explicit theme statement and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias (clean slate vendor) frames the story and makes one choice (accepting the coin, releasing the moonlight), but the transaction is initiated by the woman and its consequence (her dissolution) does not alter his later tactics. He observes more than he decides. Present in setup, middle exchange, and ending reflection; functional but mid-replaceable. Two beats, early signal, closure linkage. Deductions: −0.3 observation-heavy in middle, −0.4 swappability (could be "memory merchant" or "silence seller" with minor edits). Baseline 3.0 + early 0.5 + two beats 0.9 + closure link 0.9 − swappable −0.4 − passive middle −0.3 = 4.6, round down 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in setup (counter display with shifting shadows), transaction (uncorked, spills into key), and ending absence ("the empty space where the bottle had been"). Three beats with visible transformation and closure linkage. Deductions: the key dissolves without constraining later choice; the element's removal would weaken the transaction but not break story logic. Baseline 3.0 + early 0.6 + three beats 1.4 + causal pressure (enables transaction) 0.8 + closure link 0.9 − ornamental dissolution −0.6 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Core concept "glimmering parole" appears once as ornament in final third: "faintest glimmer of parole in the air, a promise that something had been exchanged." It does not shape stakes, constrain choices, or reweight prior material—purely decorative. Introduced late (final third), summary-only, zero causal work. Baseline 3.0 + late arrival (final third) −0.8 + ornamental −0.8 + label-only −0.3 = 2.1, but closure absence caps at 2.8; apply 2.4 for minimal thematic nod.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Attribute "mindfully scattered" appears once in exposition: "the kind of scent that made thoughts feel mindfully scattered, like seeds tossed into the wind." Label-only, no action enabled or constrained, no visible cost. Introduced mid-story, summary-only. Baseline 3.0 + mid intro −0.3 + ornamental −0.8 + label-only −0.3 + no causal work = 1.6, but round up slightly for thematic echo; 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Action "incise" appears once: "He had incised his own name into the wood earlier… though the letters had already begun to fade." Setup present, but the fading letters do not drive a turn or redefine options—purely atmospheric. One beat, early mention, no causal pressure or closure link. Baseline 3.0 + early 0.4 + one beat 0.4 − ornamental −0.5 − no closure link −0.5 + thematic nod (erasure/impermanence) 0.4 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>Method "by quantifying absence" appears in dialogue mid-story: the curator says, *By quantifying absence.* It is not demonstrated, does not shape Elias's tactics, and remains cryptic decoration. One mention, no mechanics shown, no causal role. Baseline 3.0 + mid intro −0.3 + ornamental −0.8 + summary-only −0.5 + no closure link = 0.4, but thematic echo lifts slightly; 1.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting "glass orchard library floating upon a swirling sea of clouds" is present in opening and closing (door opens to "endless swirl of clouds"). Two beats, early signal, closure reprise. However, it remains postcard description—does not constrain choice, supply resources, or alter tactics. Baseline 3.0 + early 0.6 + two beats 0.9 + closure link 0.7 − postcard/ornamental −0.8 − no pressure −0.4 + lyric reprise 0.2 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "during the lull on a store's very first opening day" is signaled early: "The store had opened an hour ago, but the lull had settled" and reprised at closure: "The lull returned, deeper this time." Two beats, early signal, closure link. The lull functions thematically (story-before-story), but does not tighten decisions—time is ambient rather than a live clock. Baseline 3.0 + early 0.6 + two beats 0.9 + closure link 0.9 + thematic pressure 0.5 − no tactical constraint −0.5 − ambient time −0.4 = 5.0; lyric reprise adds 0.3 for reweighting; 5.3 round to 5.8 for charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the place where stories begin" is stated early and reprised at closure: "He had come here to find the place where stories begin… Maybe the trick wasn't to find the beginning." Three beats (opening, curator dialogue, closing reflection), early signal, closure link. However, the want remains abstract; no on-page friction between cost and desire—Elias never faces a choice that sacrifices this goal. Baseline 3.0 + early 0.7 + three beats 1.4 + closure link 0.9 − abstract/told-only −0.8 − no visible tradeoff −0.5 = 4.7; thematic charge at end adds 0.4; 5.1 round to 5.4 for resonance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone "integrated fragmentation" is taught early (library where "things appeared and disappeared," woman's coat unravels, moonlight dissolves) and sustained through dissolution imagery to closure (woman as smoke, chime without entry, open door). Coherent across beats, modulates with each transaction. Three beats, early pattern, closure linkage. Baseline 3.0 + early 0.7 + three beats 1.4 + closure link 1.0 + charges final image 0.8 − static mood in middle −0.3 − ornamental in transaction beat −0.3 = 6.3.</comment>
