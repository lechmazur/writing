<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is heavily abstract ("warmly curious hum settled in my chest," "quiet certainty") with minimal embodied contradiction under pressure. Motivation remains declarative rather than tested through micro-choices that foreclose paths; the digging montage ("Days bled into nights") summarizes struggle without dramatizing a single moment where conflicting impulses force a costly decision. The final kneeling reads as recognition rather than a choice that alters present options. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, and the woman from the fresco arrives to validate rather than complicate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Varethis harbor, Necropolis Hills, catacomb orchard entrance) land early. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: discovery montage → central chamber → light/woman manifestation → roots bloom. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the woman's appearance and the blooming bones, but the cost remains abstract ("weight of twenty years lift"); no on-page forfeiture or trade-off is legible in the final image. The sundial placement triggers transformation, but the protagonist's agency in that moment is passive receipt rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored with pomegranate roots coiling around skeletal fingers, frescoes, bone mosaic, and the central pedestal depression. Sensory detail (myrrh, damp earth, stale air, light bleeding from frescoes) is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's archeological focus. The pedestal's shallow depression directly enables the sundial placement, and the orchard's spatial layout (entrance fissure, first tomb, central chamber) guides the discovery sequence. The setting constrains the search and charges the final image with the blooming roots.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The discovery montage offers no meaningful tightening—each find (child's sandal, priest's censer, mural) adds texture without narrowing options or raising cost. The sundial placement in the central chamber is the sole turn, yet it unfolds without resistance or trade-off; the chamber "trembled" and light spilled, granted rather than earned. The woman's validation ("You've returned") confirms rather than tests commitment. No visible price alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (faith as patient roots waiting to be unearthed) emerges through recurring imagery of roots, bones, and the sundial. The final paragraph states the theme overtly ("Faith was never lost—only waiting"), reducing what the mosaic and blooming roots had implied. The woman's line "some journeys, though interrupted, were never truly abandoned" is close to a thesis statement. The orchard's sigh and new roots offer a resonant image, but the protagonist's recognition arrives without ambiguity or cost that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct archeological-lyric register ("wound in the earth," "library of the dead"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices roots, frescoes, and ritual objects through an antiquarian lens. Occasional elevations ("her robes woven from sunlight and shadow") fit the enchantment tone. Psychic distance compresses slightly at the woman's appearance but remains controlled. No dialogue on the page except the woman's two lines, which carry subtext (validation of the journey). Minor filter-verb reliance ("I felt the weight") in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor well. Runs of near-paraphrase appear: "This was no mere graveyard; it was a library" / "This wasn't just a tomb; it was a shrine" use identical syntax to declare meaning. "Days bled into nights" compresses the montage but also flattens the pressure curve. The final paragraph loops ("Faith was never lost" / "faith…never lost") and over-explains what the blooming roots had shown. Stock metaphors ("wound in the earth," "threads in a tapestry") appear without fresh particulars. No severe artifacts, but density dips in expository beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise (archeologist restores faith by excavating sacred site and placing relic) follows a familiar template: return → dig → discover shrine → manifestation validates quest. The catacomb orchard and pomegranate-root imagery offer textural specificity, but the emotional arc (doubt → perseverance → vindication) unfolds without surprise. The woman stepping from the fresco and roots blooming under the sundial's shadow read as wish-fulfillment rather than a turn earned by prior friction. Transformation test: swap the orchard for another sacred ruin and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The diaspora returnee (twenty years in eastern archipelagos, now returned to Varethis) frames the journey and appears in opening, middle ("I had returned…as a man clutching a relic"), and closing ("twenty years lift from my shoulders"). The return decision enables the excavation, and the final recognition hinges on the protagonist's long absence. However, no on-page choice during the return itself alters tactics; the character observes and perseveres without a costly decision tied to the returnee status.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in opening ("clutching a single relic"), middle frescoes (pilgrims kneeling before "a sundial identical to the one I carried"), central chamber (placed into the pedestal depression), and closing (tucked into satchel). The placement triggers the chamber's transformation and the woman's manifestation, directly enabling closure. The gnomon casts a shadow that causes roots to bloom, giving the object causal weight. Its etched names and the pedestal's exact-fit depression make it irreplaceable. High integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys theme is voiced in the woman's line ("some journeys, though interrupted, were never truly abandoned") and the protagonist's twenty-year absence. The concept appears as thematic echo rather than on-page constraint; no moment shows the protagonist navigating an interruption that alters present tactics. The discoveries flow sequentially without detours that test commitment. Present in setup (exile) and closure (recognition) but does not shape middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears once as a label ("A warmly curious hum settled in my chest") without constraining action. The trait does not enable a risky choice or foreclose an alternative; the protagonist's steady excavation reads as determined rather than curious. No visible tradeoff tied to curiosity versus caution. The phrase feels ornamental, inserted to fulfill the requirement without altering the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rebuild anchors the protagonist's goal from the opening ("as a man…to restore") through the digging montage ("I rebuilt not with mortar and stone, but with purposeful wandering") to the final realization ("rebuilding was not about resurrecting the past"). The action enables all middle beats (uncovering tombs, piecing fragments) and the ending recognition. However, the rebuild unfolds as discovery rather than construction; no on-page assembly or restoration dramatizes the rebuilding itself. Thematic more than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named once mid-story ("I rebuilt…with purposeful wandering—letting the roots guide me") but the method is not demonstrated in earlier beats. The discoveries follow a linear path (entrance → first tomb → central chamber) without visible detours or wrong turns that the wandering corrects. The phrase appears as a retrospective claim rather than a technique shaping attempts. Late signal, no middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard (pomegranate roots coiling around skeletal fingers, bone mosaic floor, frescoes, central pedestal) is present in every major beat and directly constrains movement and discovery. The roots guide the protagonist, the pedestal's depression demands the exact sundial base, and the orchard's structure (entrance fissure, first tomb, central chamber) shapes the excavation sequence. The blooming roots in the final image are causally tied to the setting's established properties. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The excavation spans "the seventh day" and "Days bled into nights," anchoring duration loosely. No ticking clock pressures choices; the protagonist works at a steady pace without time-driven trade-offs (dig faster and risk damage, or slow and risk discovery by others). The timeframe provides scale but does not tighten tactics. Present across the arc but does not constrain decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To restore lost faith" is declared in opening ("Faith wasn't lost; it was buried") and closing ("Faith was never lost"). The motivation drives all excavation beats and the sundial placement. The elders' dismissal ("a fool's errand") hints at friction, but no on-page moment dramatizes doubt or the cost of perseverance versus abandonment. The motivation is told and sustained rather than tested through conflicting wants. Strong thematic presence, weaker as dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is sustained through lyric diction ("warmly curious hum," "the orchard sighed," "her robes woven from sunlight and shadow") and measured pacing. The tone modulates slightly at the woman's appearance (awe) but avoids melodrama. No ironic tension or tonal rupture; the enchantment remains gentle and validating throughout. The tone charges the final image (blooming roots, lifting weight) but does not deepen with pressure. Coherent but static.</comment>
