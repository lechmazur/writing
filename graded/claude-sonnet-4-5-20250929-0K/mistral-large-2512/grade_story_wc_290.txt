<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia is embodied early ("squeezing his ribs until his vision blurred"), and his movement through the Nexus shows goal-driven behavior. The final choice—grasping the compass despite the warning—forecasts a decisive shift, but the piece withholds on-page consequence: we see realization ("The Nexus wasn't a ruin. It was a ship") but no follow-through action or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward discovery-mode rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elias, Nexus bowels, fallow period). The piece follows a Causal lens: Elias enters seeking the spatial-mutiny key → hears organ → finds the figure → touches compass → world-shift revelation. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—spatial mutiny reweighted from "rebellion" to "freedom," and the Nexus reframed as dimension-sailing vessel—but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than dramatized (claustrophobia "forgotten" is告知 not shown as renunciation with visible price). One meaningful deepening occurs when the figure extends the compass, narrowing Elias's options to accept or retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fractured dome, damp stone, old parchment, and scaffolding ground the opening. The compass (brass-tipped, needle sharp) and the drafting table anchor tactile detail. The central chamber's "air shimmering, warping like heat" and the figure's glowing ink-trails provide sensory specificity that reflects POV urgency. The starlight-veins motif recurs and charges the final image ("The stars above weren't just light. They were a map"), satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility, though spatial choreography during the organ-music approach could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the spatial-mutiny key—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained. The organ hum and the figure's appearance tighten pressure; the figure's warning ("once you see the truth, you can't unsee it") forces a trade-off. Elias's choice to grasp the compass is protagonist-driven and narrows options (he cannot unknow the Nexus's true nature). However, the world-shift and the figure's dissolution happen *to* Elias rather than being caused *by* a second on-page decision, limiting escalation to one meaningful turn. The cost is largely perceptual (claustrophobia forgotten, stars reframed) rather than a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—"spatial mutiny isn't rebellion, it's freedom"—emerges through the compass-gesture, the Nexus-as-ship reveal, and the final star-map image, not as a stated moral. The piece invites reflection on confinement vs. autonomy, and the particulars (Elias's claustrophobia, the architect's vanishing, the dimension-sailing premise) ground the abstraction. The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing. Minor deduction: the figure's line "Spatial mutiny isn't rebellion. It's *freedom*" skirts thematic echo, risking −0.3 to −0.4, but it is delivered by a non-POV character and functions as the conceptual key rather than a moral summary, so the penalty is held light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("lattice of iron and glass," "prudently adventurous," "transfix"). Free indirect style is clean ("The key to the spatial mutiny was here, somewhere"). The figure's dialogue carries distinct otherness ("their voice layered with echoes"). Perceptual signature—claustrophobia, the compass's weight "like a promise," recognition of impossible geometries—is character-specific. Minor filter-verb density in the middle ("he almost mistook," "he saw") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during panic, wider during revelation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer atmospheric paragraphs). Sentence openings shift. Figurative language is controlled: "silver veins," "living thing," "heat off desert sand." Information density is high; most lines serve character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor issues: "The sound was coming from the central chamber, where the old blueprints had been found" is slightly scaffolding-like (the blueprints are not dramatized). "Prudently adventurous" in paragraph six reads as a label rather than embodied action (he moves "light but deliberate," which *shows* the trait, softening the deduction). No loops or template cadence. The closing triad ("The stars above weren't just light. They were a map.") propels and recharges the motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Nexus-as-dimension-sailing-ship premise is a fresh synthesis of Gothic ruin and speculative architecture. "Spatial mutiny" as freedom-through-dimensional-travel rather than political rebellion transforms the trope. The blueprint compass point as a tool that draws on air (not paper) and reveals impossible geometries is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. The claustrophobic explorer discovering the ultimate anti-cage is thematically coherent. The organ-music-as-threshold and the half-present architect figure feel earned in hindsight rather than late conveniences. Risk-taking (blending cosmic horror atmosphere with optimistic liberation theme) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias (claustrophobic explorer) drives all major beats: enters Nexus, follows organ sound, approaches figure, grasps compass. Claustrophobia is signaled early (setup ✓), shapes his bodily experience mid-scene (development ✓), and is declared "forgotten" at closure (payoff ✓). His decision to take the compass despite the warning is a key turn. However, the "forgotten" claustrophobia is told rather than shown through a physical or perceptual shift, and the final paragraph offers revelation without a second on-page choice that tests the trait. The explorer role is active; the claustrophobic attribute constrains perception but does not force a visible tactical tradeoff. Two gates strong, third partial: ~5.0 base + early signal +0.5 + two-beat involvement +0.9 + closure mention +0.4 − told-only resolution −0.4 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blueprint drafting compass point: introduced in paragraph three (setup ✓), reappears when the figure uses it to draw on air (development ✓), and Elias grasps it at the climax, triggering the world-shift (payoff ✓). All three gates. The compass is irreplaceable: its specific function (drawing impossible geometries) enables the spatial-mutiny revelation. Beat involvement: at least two distinct uses (carried as clue, drawn with, grasped). Causal pressure: the compass unlocks the truth and alters Elias's options. Closure linkage: the grasp is the pivot action. Specificity high ("brass-tipped," "needle still sharp," leaves "glowing ink"). Base ~6.5 + early +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + causal pressure +1.0 + closure linkage +1.2 + specificity +0.6 − slight swappability (could be another tool) −0.5 − summary mention of earlier carry (not handled) −0.3 ≈ 9.0 neighborhood, capped at 7.8 due to the lack of a visible cost tied specifically to *this object* at closure (the cost is conceptual and tied to the act of touching, not to unique properties of the compass beyond unlocking).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny: signaled in paragraph four as the puzzle Elias seeks (setup ✓), implicit when the figure draws warping geometries (development partial), and explicitly reweighted at closure ("Spatial mutiny isn't rebellion. It's *freedom*") with the Nexus-as-ship reveal (payoff ✓). The concept shapes the dominant stake and drives Elias's entry. At closure, the reframing from political rebellion to dimensional travel reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (Elias's prior understanding is obsolete). However, the concept does not constrain an on-page tactical choice mid-scene—Elias seeks *the key to* spatial mutiny rather than enacting or resisting the mutiny itself. Base ~5.5 + early signal +0.6 + closure linkage +1.0 + conceptual repricing +0.5 − middle development weak (concept is goal, not obstacle) −0.5 − swappability (could be "dimensional breach" or similar) −0.5 − ornamental midpoint mention −0.5 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Prudently adventurous: label appears once in paragraph six ("He moved prudently adventurous"). The surrounding action ("steps light but deliberate") *shows* a version of the trait, but the phrase itself is a filter/label rather than a dramatized constraint. No on-page moment where prudence and adventure directly conflict to force a tradeoff with cost. The trait does not recur or shape the climactic grasp of the compass (which is reactive, not prudent). Setup weak (late label, ~40% mark), development absent (no middle choice constrained by this duality), payoff absent (final act is impulsive acceptance). Base ~3.0 + partial embodiment via action +0.8 − label-only mention −0.6 − late first signal −0.4 − no cost or tradeoff −0.6 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transfix: Elias is "transfixed" (paragraph nine) when he sees the figure drawing on air. This moment of arrested attention shifts his goal from cautious observation to direct engagement. The word itself appears once; the state (frozen, unable to speak) drives one beat. At closure, Elias's grasp of the compass and the world-shift could be read as breaking the transfixion or completing it, but "transfix" does not reappear or shape the mechanics of the final turn—he "hesitated, then reached out," which is deliberation, not paralysis. Setup absent (action occurs mid-scene, ~55% mark), development ✓ (one beat), payoff weak (not named or causally active at closure). Base ~3.5 + one-beat involvement +0.4 + enables next move +0.5 − late signal −0.4 − swappable (could be "mesmerized," "stunned") −0.5 − no closure reprise −0.6 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Reverberation of a lonely church organ: the organ hum appears in paragraph five, swells, and pulls Elias toward the central chamber. The sound functions as the inciting sensory cue that reveals the figure's presence. At closure, the music "crescendoed" as Elias grasps the compass, but the organ itself does not return as a charged image or constrain the final choice—it is atmospheric accompaniment rather than mechanical cause. Setup ✓ (signaled early), development weak (sound guides movement but does not shape a choice under pressure), payoff weak (crescendo mentioned but not causally tied to the world-shift). Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + one-beat guidance +0.4 − swappable (any uncanny sound) −0.6 − ornamental at closure −0.5 − does not shape attempts −0.5 = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus under starlight: the fractured dome, starlight veins, stone floor, scaffolding, and central chamber are present throughout. Starlight recurs as a charged motif ("The stars above weren't just light. They were a map") at closure, reweighting the setting's meaning from cage to gateway. The Nexus's spatial features (bowels, scaffolding, central chamber) structure movement and pressure. The "shadowed" quality and the fallow-period emptiness enable secrecy. Setup ✓, development ✓ (environment supplies access and atmosphere), payoff ✓ (starlight motif charges final image). Base ~6.5 + early +0.7 + closure linkage +1.2 + recurring motif reweighted +0.8 + micro-setting (body, starlight) constrains mood and frames discovery +0.5 − spatial choreography could be sharper (exact distances, figure's position) −0.6 − setting does not force a mid-scene tactical tradeoff −0.5 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Fallow period: established in paragraph four ("He had come during the fallow period, when the city above slept"). The timing grants Elias solitude and access (no interference). At closure, the time constraint is not tested—no clock pressure or consequence for lingering. The period is context rather than a live constraint that narrows options. Setup ✓ (early mention), development weak (enables entry but does not shape a mid-scene decision), payoff absent (no temporal urgency at closure). Base ~3.5 + early signal +0.5 + enables goal (access) +0.4 − no ticking clock −0.7 − no cost for time spent −0.5 − swappable (any off-hours window) −0.5 = 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>To uncover a vital key lost to time: Elias's motivation is declared in paragraphs four and five ("The key to the spatial mutiny was here") and sustained through his approach to the figure ("I need to know how to fix it"). The figure's extension of the compass and Elias's choice to grasp it directly answer this want. At closure, the discovery reframes his understanding (Nexus as ship, stars as map), but the piece does not dramatize friction between this want and a competing cost (e.g., safety, sanity, time). Setup ✓, development ✓ (want drives every move), payoff ✓ (key obtained, though its form surprises). Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.7 + sustained across beats +0.9 + closure payoff +0.9 − told-only want (no embodied craving or conflicted hesitation beyond one line) −0.5 − no visible sacrifice to obtain key −0.8 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion: the opening paragraphs establish melancholy (fractured dome, forgotten marvel, "silent tormentor") and the quest to reclaim lost knowledge. The figure's final line ("Spatial mutiny isn't rebellion. It's *freedom*") and the closing image (stars as map, claustrophobia forgotten) blend longing with liberation. Tone modulates from confinement-anxiety to wonder under pressure. However, "rebellion" as a charged stance is conceptual rather than enacted—Elias does not defy an authority or break a rule on the page; he pursues hidden knowledge. The "wistful" quality is present (loss, nostalgia for the old world); the "rebellion" is thematic rather than actional. Setup ✓ (melancholy established early), development partial (tone shifts with discovery), payoff ✓ (freedom-image at closure). Base ~5.5 + coherent modulation +0.8 + charges final image +0.9 + early signal +0.5 − rebellion as theme, not enacted stance −0.8 = 6.9.</comment>
