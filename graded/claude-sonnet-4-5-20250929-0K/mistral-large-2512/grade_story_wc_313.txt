<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve memory is clear, but his interior life trends abstract—"the weight of the past settling into his bones" exemplifies label-only interiority. The photographs-to-closure trajectory is coherent, yet the final choice (carry them back vs. burn them) is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost. The woman Mira and the father exist primarily as backstory fuel; no on-page relationship tests Elias under pressure. Embodied contradiction is absent; he processes the discovery with steady insight rather than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Charged Poise: Elias pockets the photographs and commits to telling the stories, crystallizing his stance with the felt cost of carrying suppressed history into a healing town. However, the pivot happens in summary ("He could burn... Or he could carry") rather than through a dramatized beat that narrows options on the page. The causal lens holds—photographs lead to discovery, discovery to choice—but the escalation is cognitive rather than pressured by an external turn. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fourth photograph reframes his father's narrative, sufficient for this length under a causal-accumulative hybrid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway, reservoir, and distillery interior are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective: "damp wood and something sweeter—the ghost of fermented berries" filters through Elias's warden expertise. The distillery's stone walls and the lantern's flicker constrain the discovery scene, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across three micro-locations. The 9+ test is narrowly missed: the setting supplies atmosphere and frames discovery but does not force a tactical choice with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve truth vs. let the town heal—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when the fourth photograph reframes his father's story, but the turn is informational rather than a forced trade-off under external pressure. The final choice to carry the photographs back is declared with thematic weight ("the stories had to be told") yet lacks an on-page antagonist or material cost that would narrow options at the closure beat. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length, but the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than felt in the present scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as communal responsibility versus erasure—emerges through the photographs, the reservoir's resurfacing, and Elias's warden role. The recurring sapphire liqueur label and the distillery motif reweight at closure without overt statement. However, "To spin stories into shared meaning wasn't to rewrite history, but to give it voice" trends toward thesis articulation in the final third, though still rooted in scene. The ending offers a resonant answer (carry the past forward) without moralizing, but the thematic reconfiguration is more affirmed than tested by contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elegiac texture: "the bones of a forgotten song," "the ghost of fermented berries." Psychic distance is controlled; Elias's warden expertise colors perception (levee vigilance, reservoir drawdown mechanics). Register remains coherent, though "precisely humane" appears once as a prompt echo without fully inhabiting Elias's idiom. No dialogue is present. Elision of Mira's fate and the father's relationship is purposeful, anchored in discovery rather than withheld for suspense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and syntax supports the elegiac tone. However, paraphrase loops weaken key moments: "the stories had to be told" echoes "give it voice" within two paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("the bones of a forgotten song," "gasping for air") cluster early without fresh inflection. Figurative density in the opening (wind chime, twilight bleeding, dark mirror) slows momentum before stakes anchor. "The weight of the past settling into his bones" exemplifies unearned abstraction at a pivotal beat. Information density is uneven: the photograph trail is clear, but Mira's backstory summarizes rather than dramatizes. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The resurfacing-town premise offers a spatial metaphor for memory, but the emotional arc (son discovers father's hidden love, chooses transparency over erasure) follows a familiar template. Mira and the father's relationship is sketched rather than particularized; no detail makes their story irreplaceable. The photograph trail is a recognizable discovery mechanism. Elias's warden role provides fresh idiom (levee, drawdown, resurfacing), yet the central choice—preserve painful truth vs. bury it—resolves predictably without moral friction or competing goods that would complicate the stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elias observes the trail, processes the photographs, and makes a final choice to carry them back. His warden role anchors stakes and frames the premise. However, the key turn (discovering the fourth photograph) happens to him rather than through his agency; he does not make a mid-story choice that alters tactics or narrows options under pressure. The closure decision is declared in summary rather than dramatized with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes the final stance but does not drive a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The label appears in the opening (pocket mention), reappears at the distillery (on the table), and is pocketed again at closure. Its crest ties to the distillery and Mira's story, providing continuity. However, it is never handled with causal pressure—Elias does not use it to unlock a door, recognize a face, or make a trade-off. It functions as a thematic token (memory relic) rather than a tool or constraint. Present across beats but not irreplaceable; a photograph or bottle could serve the same symbolic role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The resurfacing town is the story's spine: it creates the warden role, exposes the photographs, and frames the thematic question (what rises with the water?). The drawdown's mechanics shape Elias's discovery and the town's healing tension. The premise is not merely backdrop; it generates the dominant stake and charges the final image (stories resurfacing with the streets). Present in setup and closure; drives the middle turn when the distillery and photographs emerge. Strong causal integration, though the ending's conceptual work (stories must be told) could apply to any buried-history premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" appears once in the opening: "to do it precisely humane meant facing the stories head-on, not burying them." The phrase is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice with visible trade-off. It does not constrain a tactic (e.g., Elias choosing a harder, more transparent path over an efficient cover-up) or enable a capability under pressure. The final decision to carry the photographs aligns with the label but is not shaped by its specific cost. Label-only mention without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears as a gerund in the opening: "To expunge the past was to let the town heal, but to do it precisely humane meant facing the stories head-on." The action frames the thematic fork (erase vs. preserve) but is never enacted on the page. Elias considers burning the photographs but does not attempt it; the verb remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The opposite action (carry them back) defines the closure, so "expunge" functions as a declined option rather than a driver. Present in setup and closure framing but not executed with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The photograph trail structures the entire middle: four discoveries across the church, distillery office, cabin door, and final distillery table. Each photo deepens knowledge and reframes the father's narrative, culminating in the fourth image that charges the closure choice. The method is signaled early, shapes Elias's investigation tactics, and delivers the reweighted stake. However, the trail is linear (find, read, proceed) without friction—no photograph is misleading, missing, or demands a choice under pressure. Strong setup, development, and closure presence; causal spine but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway anchors the opening and frames Elias's descent to the distillery. The reservoir's "dark mirror" and the distillery's stone interior provide atmosphere. The setting does not constrain a choice (Elias moves freely) or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is clear across three micro-locations, and the distillery's preservation (stone walls "still standing despite decades underwater") lends credibility. Present in setup and middle; mentioned at closure ("Outside, the wind picked up") but not active in the final image. Functional, purposeful, but replaceable with another ruin or archive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The wind chime's silence opens the story and is never revisited. "Midnight" and "twilight" are mentioned but not tracked; no ticking clock tightens Elias's choices. The story unfolds in a single night, but duration is vague—how long does the walk take? How much time in the distillery? The final moment notes "the wind picked up," implying elapsed time, but the frame does not pressure tactics. Present as mood in setup; absent from escalation and closure. Ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To spin stories into shared meaning" appears twice: once in the opening as Elias's framing motive, once in the closure as affirmed principle. The desire is told rather than tested by friction—no on-page cost (e.g., a townsperson who resists, a personal price for transparency) dramatizes the conflict between Elias's communal ideal and competing pressures. His final choice aligns with the motivation without complication. Present in setup and closure; shapes the thematic stance but not constrained by a visible trade-off. Functional but under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is named once in the opening ("the mirrored hush of the night") and enacted through diction: "swallowed," "groaning," "ghost," "sigh." The tone is elegiac and consistent across the discovery sequence. Sentence rhythm slows for reflection, quickens slightly at the distillery entry. The final image ("the wind picked up, rustling the branches like a sigh") sustains the hush while hinting at change. Coherent and purposeful, charging the ending without modulating sharply under pressure. Strong setup and closure presence; mid-band development.</comment>
