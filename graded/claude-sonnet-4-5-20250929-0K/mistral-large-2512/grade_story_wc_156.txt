<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows methodically playful curiosity through his "what if" habit and concrete micro-choices (picking up the nickel, pressing it to glass), but his interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("breath fogging the glass," "ribs and squeezed"). The final moment—understanding the mural as door and being asked to step through—reads as realization rather than embodied struggle with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (came to restore certainty, finds ambiguity) but the progression feels more conceptual than viscerally enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored (Elias on scaffold, cathedral, sound garden outside) and the piece follows an accumulative lens: awakenings one through four deepen the supernatural threat. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias understands the mural is a door and has been asked to step through—but the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift accompanies the final beat. The "four awakenings" structure provides a taught pattern, but the final image ("he had just been asked to step through") does not crystallize a visible price or tactical foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sound wave garden (parabolic dishes, resonant tubes) and scaffold are vividly rendered and recur across beats; the garden's autonomous movement (dishes tilting, tracking breath) creates atmospheric pressure. The hobo nickel's carved eyes and the glass barrier are tactile anchors. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or alter Elias's tactics—it amplifies and reflects but does not force a decision. The final image charges via the trumpet lifting from the wall, but spatial dynamics (scaffold groaning, glass cracking) remain reactive rather than shaping the protagonist's options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elias came to restore certainty but the mural resists, revealing nested layers and supernatural agency. Pressure accumulates through the four awakenings, each tightening the supernatural grip (sound answering him, dishes moving, nickel reflecting Gabriel's face, trumpet becoming metal). The final beat—understanding the mural as door—operates as recognition rather than agency-driven choice; Elias does not decide to step through or refuse with visible cost on the page. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation is driven by external revelation rather than protagonist trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—certainty versus ambiguity, surfaces hiding depths, invitations to the unknown—emerges organically through nested murals, the hobo nickel's hollow eyes, and the archangel's trumpet as funnel rather than herald. The final image (mural as door, question coiling around ribs) offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Elias's methodically playful flaw directly ties to the thematic question. Minor slip: "came to this city to restore certainty—to clean away the ambiguity" verges on explicit theme statement rather than pure dramatization, though it remains character-voiced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual filters ("his colleagues called it a flaw, this habit of turning every restoration into a game of 'what if'"). Diction is elevated and ornate ("bewitched the stone, turning it pliable as wet clay") but remains consistent and voice-motivated for an art restorer's perspective. The piece teaches a lyric compression pattern early. Minor issue: "Elias would have sworn to that" is a filter insertion that momentarily distances the reader from the moment's immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("parabolic dishes," "note that wasn't there," "tongue a flicker of gold leaf," "question that coiled around Elias's ribs") and mostly coheres, but several metaphors are strained: "bewitched the stone, turning it pliable as wet clay" mixes enchantment with physical transformation in a way that blurs rather than sharpens. Template cadence appears in the awakening sequence ("The first awakening… The second awakening… The third awakening… The fourth awakening"), which feels mechanically scaffolded rather than pressure-driven. Some clauses loop: "the fresco resisted, its layers peeling back not to reveal the original, but something beneath it: a second mural, then a third, each nested inside the last like a series of Russian dolls" restates nesting three times. The overwriting and scaffold patterns dull momentum in peak beats; apply −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The nested-mural premise and sound-garden setting offer fresh specificity; the hobo nickel with hollow buffalo eyes is a vivid, non-obvious object choice. The "four awakenings" frame and methodically playful restorer provide character-driven synthesis. However, the "artist/restorer discovers supernatural truth in artwork" template is recognizable, and the piece does not fully transform it—Elias remains reactive rather than driving turns through specific occupational insight or moral calculus. The ending (mural as door, protagonist invited through) is a familiar portal-threshold image executed with lyric control but without a sharp, non-obvious inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias the mural restorer is present throughout and makes micro-choices (kneeling, hovering fingers, picking up nickel, pressing it to glass), but most are observational or reactive. His "methodically playful" habit is mentioned and shown in the "what if" questions, but those questions do not alter tactics or create visible trade-offs. The final beat—understanding the mural as door—is recognition rather than decision with cost. Setup and middle development are functional; closure participation is present but passive (he is "asked to step through" rather than choosing). Two-gate functional use; limited causal pressure. Score: mid 4s for functional but replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in beat one (street performer toss), beat two (lodged in scaffold crack, eyes reflecting Gabriel), and beat three (Elias picks it up, presses to glass, grows hot, buffalo snorts steam). Three-beat involvement with evolving properties (carved eyes shift reflection, grows warm/hot, buffalo animates). It enables the key turn when pressed to glass, causing the mural to shiver and the archangel's lips to part. Setup early, middle causal role, closure linkage (mentioned in penultimate paragraph as it grows hot). Strong development and payoff; moderate causal pressure. Score: mid-to-high 6s for essential role across beats but not fully indispensable (the awakening sequence could proceed via other triggers).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Nested awakenings structure the entire piece: four enumerated awakenings deepen supernatural contact, and the nested murals (second, third, "each nested inside the last like Russian dolls") literalize the concept. The concept shapes the escalation pattern and provides the frame for pressure. However, it does not constrain tactics—Elias does not choose between awakening layers or pay a price to proceed through them; they happen to him sequentially. Setup present, development present as frame, closure directly invokes the concept ("the mural wasn't a record of the past, but a door"). Two gates solid, third gate present but passive. Score: low-to-mid 5s for concept as frame without on-page choice friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is labeled once ("his colleagues called it a flaw, this habit of turning every restoration into a game of 'what if'") and demonstrated via the three "what if" questions in one paragraph. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—the questions are internal musing, not tactical shifts. The trait contributes to characterization but remains ornamental to plot mechanics. Setup present, no middle development or closure linkage beyond the general posture. Score: low 3s for label-plus-brief-demonstration without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears once in a key turn: "the echo bewitched the stone, turning it pliable as wet clay." This moment follows Elias pressing the nickel to glass and precedes the scaffold groaning and glass cracking, directly enabling the supernatural escalation. The action is specific and irreplaceable in diction (the word "bewitch" carries thematic resonance with transformation and enchantment). However, it is a single-beat use; no setup or reprise. Late middle appearance, strong causal role in one beat, no closure participation beyond being part of the chain. Score: high 4s for one essential turn but limited spread.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sound as method is signaled early (sound wave garden, parabolic dishes catching city murmurs) and recurs: Elias hears vibration from Gabriel's lips, the note answers from the garden, dishes tilt tracking his breath, garden amplifies movement and hurls echo back. The mechanics matter—sound is the transmission medium for the supernatural contact. However, Elias does not manipulate or choose how to use sound; it operates on him. Setup robust, middle development present (sound shapes the awakening sequence), closure participation indirect (trumpet emits question as sound, but Elias does not wield the method). Score: mid 5s for method as mechanic without protagonist agency over it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly described (parabolic dishes, resonant tubes in spirals, "his refuge since he took the restoration job") and recurs across beats: dishes catch hobo nickel clatter, hum with distant sound, tilt autonomously tracking Elias's breath, spin faster when he touches nickel, amplify movement. It provides atmospheric pressure and a supernatural conduit but does not constrain Elias's choices—he does not navigate it, hide in it, or use its resources tactically. Setup strong, middle development as amplifier, closure participation indirect (dishes amplify trumpet's question). Score: high 5s for essential atmospheric role without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the pause between question and reply" appears only in the opening sentence as lyric framing ("Elias Voss heard its whispers in the pause between question and reply"). It does not constrain decisions, track elapsed time, or tighten tactics. The story unfolds across an unspecified duration (Elias has worked the restoration job for some time; "today" the garden hums). No clock, no urgency tied to temporal limit. Setup as metaphor only, no development or closure participation. Score: low 2s for ornamental opening phrase without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to exchange certainty for curiosity" is dramatized: he "came to this city to restore certainty—to clean away the ambiguity, to reveal the truth beneath the grime. But the mural had other plans." His methodically playful "what if" questions enact curiosity, and the final beat—understanding the mural as door and being asked to step through—crystallizes the exchange. However, the choice is not yet made on the page; he understands but does not decide with visible cost. Setup present (restoration job to restore certainty), middle development present (curiosity via "what if"), closure participation present but not resolved. Score: solid 6.0 for clear motivation with friction but incomplete final trade.</comment>
