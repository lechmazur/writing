<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is embodied through whittling and tea ritual with clear internal contradiction—cultivating lightness while drowning in grief. The mask metaphor risks label-speak but is rooted in habitual performativity. The wife's dream voice reopens the wound with specificity ("sheets are smoothed, the corners tucked just so"), and his crying upon waking shows embodied cost. Motivation remains consistent but the final stance feels likeループ rather than earned alteration or renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rituals accrete pressure through density and pattern (tea narration, whittling, dried flowers). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis ("the ritual was all he had left"), but the cost is told rather than shown in a decisive image; the final lines loop description without reweighting prior material. The ending fails the Cost proof test—no exact sentence makes the foreclosure legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The farmhouse, turbines, dried flowers, and whittled stick anchor setting with purposeful constraint. The turbines' groaning becomes a recurring sonic motif that pressures silence. The bouquet and carved bird function as micro-setting objects; he places the bird "beside the bouquet, another offering to the silence," which charges that pairing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("tea burned his tongue, but he drank it anyway").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is "to cultivate lightness in grief" through ritual, signaled early. Pressure accumulates via density (nightly tea narration, whittling progression, flower decay) but does not meaningfully tighten or deepen. The dream functions as a micro turn but does not foreclose an option. The ending recapitulates ritual without visible trade-off or escalated cost, missing the band guardrail for 8.0+ (tightening that forecloses a live option).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of private grief as rebellion against the "happiness mandate" emerges through concrete ritual without direct statement. The turbines' purposeless spinning mirrors Elias's repetitive performance. Subtext operates in gesture and image ("sweetness is a choice"). The ending attempts resonance through continuation of ritual but feels more like thematic echo than a non-literal answer—it restates rather than reweights the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—POV filters all detail through grief-saturated lens ("dark as the earth he had shoveled over his wife's coffin"). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure ("wound reopening" in the dream beat). The dramatic narration of tea-making is purposeful and voice-consistent. Minor register drift: "cultivation" and "private rebellion" read slightly elevated for a man whittling in silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sensory detail is selective. The piece loops conceptually across multiple paragraphs: tea ritual described twice with near-identical narration structure ("First, the kettle is filled" / "Today, the tea is poured"), and the whittling object cycles without progression ("almost a bird… then a tree, then nothing at all"). Template cadence in the tea beats: "The [noun] is [verb]" stems stack across three+ lines. Apply paraphrase-loop and template penalties (−0.6 cumulative in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The happiness mandate premise is recognizable from dystopian templates (emotion-policing state). Transformation occurs through the specificity of whittling, dramatic mundane narration, and the turbines as pressure-symbol, but the emotional arc (grieving man performs rituals) does not surprise. The tea-narration method offers a fresh inflection. Risk is minimal; the piece stays safely in lyric melancholy without bold structural or moral choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias the "blank-faced performer" is present throughout. His whittling and tea ritual are on-page actions, and his choice to "cling to" the ritual at the end is framed as agency. However, the final choice does not alter tactics or foreclose a path—he continues as before. Setup clear, development present (ritual under dream pressure), payoff weak (no decisive shift). Mid-band for functional participation without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet appears in five beats: opening table description, pressing memory, rustling when he sits, the bird placed beside it, and "crumbled a little more" at the end. Development is present (decay tracked), and it anchors the closure image as recipient of offerings. Payoff is static description rather than charged reprise; the bouquet does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning decisively. Two gates plus lyric presence → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Remade hush" as concept is absent from the text. The "happiness mandate" and private grief-as-rebellion frame the world, but no "remade hush" phrase or thematic equivalent appears. If inferring that silence and ritual narration constitute a "remade" approach to quiet, that remains ornamental—does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Swappable; no causal pressure. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; score 2.1 for decorative theme claim.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity is claimed ("grief had become a private rebellion") but not dramatized through trade-offs. Elias performs rituals; no on-page choice reveals competing ethical pulls or visible cost tied to ambiguous morality. The trait is label-only. Missing development and payoff gates; present in setup as backdrop only. Cap 4.6 for missing setup action, score 3.2 for label without constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Whittling appears in opening, mid-story turn ("placed it beside the bouquet"), and closing line ("became a bird, then a tree, then nothing at all"). The act anchors his hands-on grief work and the progression (idea of bird → nothing) tracks dissolution. Development present (object placed as offering), payoff present (final transformation cycle). Causal role in two beats; contributes to ending charge. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("First, the kettle is filled") and recurs ("Today, the tea is poured"), shaping his grief performance. The method defines his ritual rebellion and is present in the dream (wife narrating laundry). Payoff: "he kept speaking, because silence was the one thing he couldn't bear." The method drives two distinct beats and articulates motive at closure. Essential; removal would collapse the ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Farmhouse and turbines anchor setting from the opening line. The turbines "groaned outside, a sound like a dying breath," providing sonic pressure in three beats. The setting overshadows but does not constrain a choice—Elias could perform his rituals anywhere. Setup strong, development weak (postcard backdrop), payoff present (turbines in final paragraph as "mechanical mourners"). Lyric reprise without tactical constraint → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the happiness mandate" is mentioned twice (opening context, "after the mandate" recall) but does not function as live clock or tighten decisions. Timeframe is vague past-tense; no urgency or tactical pressure from the temporal frame. Setup present, development absent, payoff absent. Cap 4.6 for missing setup of time as pressure; score 4.8 for weak thematic backdrop that does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To cultivate lightness in grief" is his stated motivation and drives the tea ritual and whittling. Desire is dramatized through repeated attempts. Friction exists (the void vs. the ritual), but the ending loops rather than resolving the conflict with cost. Setup clear, development present (ritual under dream pressure), payoff weak (continuation without transformation). Two gates plus modest causal work → 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Emotional void tone is coherent and modulates: flat narration in ritual beats, wound-reopening in the dream, weighted speech at the end. The "blank-faced" persona and "flat line" voice establish tone early. Tone charges the final image: "silence was the one thing he couldn't bear" reweights the void with undeniable pressure. Setup strong, development consistent, payoff integrated. Essential to closure effect.</comment>
