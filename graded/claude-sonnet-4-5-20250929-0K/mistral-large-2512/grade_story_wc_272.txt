<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and specific—the portrait erasure sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (clinging to the woman's memory while erasing her face). The redesign choices (cards, portrait) demonstrate agency under pressure. However, the motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" feels abstract and arrives pre-formed rather than emerging through dramatized friction. The final act of drawing "the shape of the ache" lands as earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when by ~120 words (lighthouse library, Elias post-breakup, present). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias redesigns the cards and portrait, lies down as the walls close, then wakes to begin again—a refusal to escape that forecloses the old path with felt cost. The "walls closing/expanding" cycle functions as a metaphorical deepening rather than a causal turn, appropriate for the chosen lens. One meaningful cost: he stops trying to capture her and instead draws the ache itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse library constrains choice: the physical claustrophobia (walls pressing closer) mirrors and intensifies Elias's psychological unraveling, forcing the redesign sequence. Sensory specificity is strong—"scent of salt and old parchment," "shelves sagging under the weight of books...their spines cracked like old bones." The broken tarot box and scattered cards function as micro-setting elements that anchor the redesign action. The spatial evolution (library shrinking to coffin-size, then expanding) directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Elias can move beyond fixating on the woman's departure and face his own role. One meaningful tightening: the walls literally close in, forcing him to redesign the artifacts and lie down rather than flee. The erasure of the portrait and rewriting of the tarot cards are protagonist-driven choices with visible cost (he forecloses clinging to her image). The resolution through "drawing the shape of the ache" is earned by the prior sequence. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure accumulates through claustrophobic imagery and culminates in a deepening that reweights his stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: unraveling/redesign, the space loss leaves, facing necessary darkness. The redesigned tarot cards (*The Tower* → *The Rebuild*, *The Hanged Man* → *The Pause*) function as concrete thematic anchors without overt moralizing. The final image—"drawing the shape of the ache"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. The "walls closing/expanding" cycle and the portrait erasure create meaningful ambiguity. Minor deduction: "What if the only way out is through?" verges on platitude, though it's immediately dramatized rather than asserted as wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature—Elias notices charcoal strokes, card edges "chewed by time," the weight of silence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the redesign sequence, pulling back slightly at the wall-closing moment). Rhetorical questions are voice-consistent and filter through his artistic lens. One slip: "He wasn't afraid of disappearing—not yet" reads as convenient authorial foreshadowing rather than organic character thought. The prose rhythm tightens appropriately under pressure (short fragments during the coffin moment, longer syntax when he wakes).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully—short beats during peak pressure ("Elias didn't resist"), longer arcs for reflection. Minor scaffold present: "The walls of the library seemed to breathe" followed two paragraphs later by "The library's walls pressed closer" creates mild paraphrase loop (−0.3). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "darkness...a living thing, a current pulling him under" works. One mixed vehicle: walls "breathe" then "groan"—acceptable but verging on muddle. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-psychological-unraveling premise is familiar but executed with specificity—the library shrinking/expanding cycle and the tarot redesign offer fresh angles. The choice to erase the portrait and "draw the shape of the ache" feels earned rather than imported. Risk-taking in structure (the metaphorical walls, the lie-down/wake sequence) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Deduction: the "descend into necessary darkness" motivation and several rhetorical questions echo workshop-speak, reducing distinctiveness. The emotional arc (breakup → redesign → acceptance) follows a recognizable template, though the particulars (cards, charcoal, lighthouse) anchor it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias present throughout; his choices drive all three beats: (1) tracing the portrait, (2) redesigning cards/portrait, (3) lying down and waking to draw again. Each choice narrows options with visible cost—erasing her face forecloses clinging to her image. Early signal (paragraph 1), middle development (redesign sequence), and closure participation (drawing "the shape of the ache"). Causal pressure is moderate; the decisions feel interior-driven rather than externally tested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Box introduced early (paragraph 5), handled in two beats: discovery/description and the redesign sequence where he glues cards and rewrites meanings. Returns in the lie-down moment ("cards fanned out around him like a second chance") with reweighted meaning. The rewriting (*The Tower* → *The Rebuild*) is causally active and charges the ending. Specificity strong (warped by damp, frayed edges). Slight deduction: the box itself disappears after the initial mention; the cards do the work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" shapes the library's wall-closing/expanding cycle and the redesign action—Elias literally fragments the portrait and cards to rebuild them. The concept alters tactics (he stops trying to capture her whole and instead erases/rewrites). Present by paragraph 3 ("unravel"), developed through the redesign sequence, and charges the final image (drawing the ache rather than the person). Moderate causal pressure; the fragmentation is more thematic resonance than a rule that constrains choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear throughout (*Why did you stay so long? What if the answers aren't out there? Is this what it feels like to unravel? How do you redesign a life? What if the only way out is through?*). They color Elias's voice and reflect his self-interrogation, but most function as interiority texture rather than constraining choices. The questions do not demonstrably enable or prevent an action with visible cost. Present and voice-consistent, but ornamental to the plot's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Redesign" is the story's structural spine: signaled early ("How do you redesign a life when the blueprint is gone?"), executed in two major beats (erasing the portrait, rewriting the cards), and directly shapes the ending (he begins again, drawing differently). The action redefines Elias's options—he moves from trying to capture her to drawing "the shape of the ache." Causal pressure is strong; removing "redesign" would collapse the middle sequence and the closure. Visible cost: he forecloses clinging to her image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" appears mid-story (paragraph 9): "literally at first, pulling loose strands from the hem of his coat, then metaphorically, sorting through memories." The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—he physically pulls threads, then applies the logic to the portrait and cards. It enables the redesign action. Introduced after ~50%, so late penalty applies (−0.3). The method is present in one beat and shapes the ending indirectly, but is swappable with another metaphor (e.g., "sorting," "dismantling") with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse library introduced in paragraph 3, pressures every choice: the "walls pressing closer" force the redesign, the desk supplies the workspace, the claustrophobia triggers the lie-down moment. The setting shrinks to "coffin" size, then expands—this evolution is causally active and charges the final image. Sensory detail (salt, parchment, groaning wood) is dense and filtered through Elias's state. The location is irreplaceable; a generic room would not supply the lighthouse beam/prism imagery or the "swallowed themselves whole" motif. Early signal, strong development, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is both metaphorical timeframe and literal event: the library physically contracts across paragraphs 3, 8, 10, forcing Elias to act. The tightening alters tactics—he stops resisting and lies down. The moment arrives on-page ("the walls finally closed in...he lay down") and is causally linked to the redesign sequence. After waking, the walls have expanded, signaling a shift. The timeframe is tracked through progressive claustrophobia and directly shapes the closure. Cost is visible: he submits to the darkness rather than fleeing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is stated explicitly (paragraph 8: "His motivation had always been simple...") and dramatized through the lie-down sequence where he lets "the darkness swallow him whole." The desire drives the redesign and submission choices. Present early, shapes middle and ending. Deduction: the motivation is told rather than shown in friction—there's no visible cost or competing want that tests his commitment to descent. It reads more as thematic through-line than a conflicted stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" coheres through diction: "lighthouse beam cut through fog," "her smile still trapped in charcoal," "shape of the ache," "swirl of grays and blacks, a storm with no center." The tone is elegiac and sensory, modulating with pressure—cooler and metaphorical during reflection, tighter and physical during the wall-closing beat. The final image ("drawing the shape of the ache") directly charges the tone. Slight deduction: a few moments verge on stock melancholy ("silence only amplified the questions"), but the overall texture is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
