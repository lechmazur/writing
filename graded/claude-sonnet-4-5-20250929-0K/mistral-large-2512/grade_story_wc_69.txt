<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miss Voss demonstrates clear interiority through her concrete observations of choir divisions and her strategic use of the zither, with embodied perception ("her throat tight"). The secondary cast—Maren, Liora, Mr. Harkin—are sketched with functional traits (sharp-tongued, warm voice, rumbling anchor) but remain somewhat stock, and the protagonist's shift from "not to teach, but to learn" to "teach them to listen" reads more as thematic claim than dramatized contradiction. Maren's hand-brushing moment at the end gestures toward earned change, but the transformation from scoffing to nudging feels compressed rather than causally built beat-by-beat. The resolution lacks visible cost on the page—hope is not a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present (velvet library, autumn, choir) though the transition from "she had come to this town" to "the choir she inherited" creates mild temporal wobble. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the zither's presence and recurring rehearsals build toward the final hand-touch and "vanishing arts being remembered." However, the closure lacks visible or felt cost—the transformation is asserted ("by the seventh...") rather than shown in a decisive beat, and the final paragraph's "allowed herself to hope" reads as summary rather than a reweighted image. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence demonstrates what Miss Voss sacrificed or lost to achieve this harmony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet library is vivid (aged paper, cinnamon, heavy drapes, oak branches) and the autumn setting anchors tone consistently. The zither is handled in multiple beats (placed on the bench, plucked, played through rehearsals) and its physical properties (soundhole rosette, mother-of-pearl, fragile notes) are woven into action. Spatial choreography is coherent (windows, piano bench, floorboards vibrating). The micro-setting—the library absorbing sound, walls "drinking in the harmony"—charges the final image and satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—braiding diverse voices into harmony—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through rehearsal sequences. However, escalation is additive (rehearsal 3, 5, 7) rather than causal; no single on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off. The choir's transformation from divided to unified is told in summary ("By the third rehearsal...") rather than dramatized, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation plus zither-playing without meaningful resistance or cost. No visible price is paid; the resolution arrives without a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of unlearning hatred and listening emerges organically from the zither's fragile notes, the soprano/alto tensions, and the final image of leaves settling. The piece avoids explicit moralizing until "she had come to teach them to listen," which borders on thematic summary but stays tied to the on-page action. The recurring "vanishing arts" motif is handled with restraint, and the final paragraph's "quiet between the notes" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The cost remains conceptual rather than felt, but the ending reweights prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent (Miss Voss notices "dissonant undertones," "the noise...in the silences"). The prose modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to the fragile zither beats to the quieter ending. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Sing with me"); the alto's "warm and slightly off-key" voice and Maren's scoff carry subtext. Filter verbs appear occasionally ("she saw the way Maren's hand found Liora's") but do not flatten immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift, and the psychic distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "It wasn't the music. It was the noise. Not the kind that filled the air, but the kind that lived in the silences" repeats the same idea across three beats. The phrase "vanishing arts" appears three times without functional evolution, and "expectantly resigned" in paragraph 2 is a paradoxical modifier that reads more decorative than enacted. Stock metaphors ("vines around a trellis," "ice over a pond") and the phrase "her throat tight" at closure slightly muddy the final image. Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but figurative density in the final third ("leaves settling after a storm," "walls drinking in") approaches overwriting without pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The choir-learning-to-harmonize premise is familiar, and the "subtract noise first" insight, while apt, is not deeply transformed through specifics. The zither's use is a fresh detail, and the immigrant altos versus local sopranos adds texture, but the emotional arc—divided group → united through patient teaching → hand-touch reconciliation—follows a template trajectory. The "vanishing arts" frame gestures toward originality but remains abstract. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but does not offer a non-obvious angle that would survive the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Miss Voss is present throughout and her choices (introducing the zither, playing notes, ignoring Maren's scoff) shape the rehearsal sequence. However, these are facilitative rather than turn-creating; no single decision by her narrows options or alters the choir's trajectory in a causal beat. The "harmonious" descriptor is asserted but not tested—she faces no meaningful resistance or competing pressure that would force a trade-off. Present in closure (she sets the zither down, allows herself to hope) but the ending is observation, not decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette is described early (mother-of-pearl inlay, worn smooth) and the instrument is handled across multiple beats (placed on the bench, plucked for single notes, played through rehearsals). Its physical properties—fragile sound "like ice over a pond"—constrain the choir's initial response and the rosette detail recurs as a visual anchor. However, the rosette itself (as distinct from the zither) is static description; it does not evolve in meaning or constrain a choice. Present in closure indirectly (she sets the zither down) but the rosette specifically is not reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" appears three times: opening (leaves as whispers), mid-story (what she spent her life preserving), and closing (being remembered). It frames the stakes thematically but does not shape on-page tactics—Miss Voss's zither strategy is not causally dependent on this concept. The concept functions as atmospheric label rather than constraint; swapping it for "endangered traditions" or "fading heritage" would not alter plot mechanics. Present at closure but as echo, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears once in paragraph 2 as a paradoxical descriptor of posture. It is not enacted through choice or constraint—Miss Voss does not demonstrate resignation (she actively introduces the zither and persists through resistance) nor expectancy in a way that costs her something. The attribute is label-only and could be removed without affecting any beat. Absent from middle development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Denote" appears once when Miss Voss places the zither on the bench, "letting its presence denote something unspoken: a shared history, a thread connecting them all." This moment initiates the rehearsal turn and is causally linked to the choir's eventual participation. However, the action is passive (the zither's presence, not Miss Voss's doing) and the mechanics are vague—what specifically does "denote" accomplish that "signal" or "represent" would not? Present in setup and informs the middle beats (the choir responds to the zither), but the action itself is not repurposed or reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" is named explicitly mid-story ("To braid diverse voices into harmony, she would have to subtract that noise first") and is enacted through her ignoring Maren's scoff and focusing on individual notes rather than addressing grudges directly. The method shapes her approach across rehearsals. However, it is more principle than mechanic—the story does not show the specific means by which noise is subtracted (does silence create space? does the zither mask friction?). Signaled early, present in middle beats as strategy, but the mechanics remain abstract and the method is not tested or charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library is established early with sensory detail (aged paper, cinnamon, heavy drapes, oak branches, cobblestones) and recurs throughout (floorboards vibrating, walls absorbing sound). The autumn setting (wind, gold and crimson leaves, stillness by the end) mirrors the emotional arc. The library's acoustics implicitly support the choir's transformation (walls "drinking in the harmony") and the space constrains the action to an intimate, contained rehearsal. Present in closure ("The velvet library absorbed the sound") where it charges the final image. The setting shapes mood and provides resources (acoustics, intimacy) but does not alter tactics in a specific beat—the choir's transformation would proceed similarly in any enclosed rehearsal space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Time is tracked through rehearsal numbers (third, fifth, seventh) and the autumn season progresses (leaves scattering → drifting to ground, wind rattling → stilled). This accumulation structures the narrative and signals duration. However, the timeframe "across unlearning hatred" is more thematic than tactical—no on-page beat shows time pressure forcing a choice or tightening a decision. The rehearsal count compresses causality (what changes between rehearsals is told, not shown) rather than escalating it. Present in closure (autumn ends, "for the first time in years") but the time element itself does not constrain or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To braid diverse voices into harmony" is named early and drives Miss Voss's strategy (introducing the zither, coaxing participation). The desire is dramatized through her actions and the choir's gradual convergence. However, the motivation is not conflicted—no on-page friction shows her wanting to quit, doubting the method, or trading one value for another. The story tells us she "knew this wasn't about music. It was about unlearning" but does not show her grappling with that insight in a choice. Present in closure (the choir sings without a sour note, she sees the hand-touch) where the desire is fulfilled, but the fulfillment arrives without visible cost to her.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is not named but is enacted through Miss Voss's "quiet certainty of someone who had traveled far and still carried the stillness of distant places." The tone is consistent—measured, observant, patient—and the prose rhythm supports it (long sentences with embedded clauses, fragile imagery, controlled pacing). The stillness contrasts with the choir's initial discord and modulates subtly as the zither's fragile notes become steady harmony. Present in closure ("the wind had stilled," "silent and expectant," "the quiet between the notes") where the tone charges the final image. However, the tone does not shift under pressure—Miss Voss's calm persists unchanged, and the story does not test or fracture this stillness in a way that would deepen it.</comment>
