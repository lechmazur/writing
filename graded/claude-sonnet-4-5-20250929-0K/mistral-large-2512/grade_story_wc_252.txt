<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirien's interiority is concrete and her progression from self-effacement to self-acceptance is clear, but the transformation arrives too easily. The mother-figure's pronouncement "You've always been free, daughter. You only had to stop fighting what you are" slides into therapeutic language that no one speaks mid-crisis. The final choice—walking back to the docks with new confidence—lacks visible cost; nothing is foreclosed, no trade-off made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes orientation cleanly (Port Veyra docks, morning cargo work) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Lirien's stance toward self-concealment shifts decisively. However, the island sequence operates under dream logic without teaching its rules—spatial coherence dissolves ("the temple walls began to dissolve like salt in water"), then she wakes on shore with no causal bridge. The scrimshaw crumbles conveniently after delivering its message, and the final "she knew she would return" declares intent without demonstrating changed options or visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Port Veyra's docks are vivid and embodied: "slick with the last rain," ropes "no thicker than her wrists," bare feet on damp wood. The sublittoral fringe and the island's black sand, twisted trees, and coral temple supply atmospheric specificity. The scrimshaw's tactile warmth and the whale's resonant call function as micro-setting elements that guide Lirien's journey, though the island itself remains more symbolic than spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lirien's need to resolve her mother's disappearance and her own self-concealment—is signaled early and drives the journey to the island. The scrimshaw discovery and the whale's call provide intermediate pressure points. However, the island sequence lacks escalation: the temple doors open without obstacle, the mother-figure offers wisdom without conflict, and Lirien's return to the docks costs nothing visible. The final image declares transformation but does not narrow options or exact a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—freedom found through acceptance rather than force—emerges organically from the island's rule ("only appears to those who no longer seek it through force") and Lirien's arc from self-erasure to embodied presence. The whale's song as a persistent motif charges the closure image with earned resonance. The mother's line "Violence became impossible here" reframes detachment as choice rather than loss, adding thematic depth. The final paragraph avoids moralizing and lets the image of Lirien moving "with the grace of a woman who had finally embraced her true nature" carry weight, though the phrasing edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lirien throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric: "the low groan of moored ships," "the scrimshaw grew warm against her skin," "a sigh" when doors open. The mother-figure's dialogue ("Violence became impossible here") carries subtext but the final exchange—"You've always been free, daughter. You only had to stop fighting what you are"—slips into therapeutic register that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lirien notices texture, weight, vibration, and song.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the opening beats: "bare feet silent on the damp wood, her hands steady as she coiled ropes" economically establishes character through action. The scrimshaw description—"its surface carved with a map of islands that did not exist on any chart"—balances mystery and clarity. Minor scaffold appears in the final section: "The other workers stared as she moved among them, no longer trying to disappear. She coiled ropes with the same precision, but now her hands were sure, her heart unlocked" restates the transformation without advancing it. The line "her heart unlocked" is a dead metaphor that dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—disappearing island accessed through whalebone map and maternal echo—is atmospheric and leans into lyric fantasy conventions without fully transforming them. The progression from dock worker to mystical island to return mirrors a familiar vision-quest structure. The scrimshaw as key, the whale as herald, and the mother as guide are archetypal but rendered with specific sensory detail (oilcloth wrapping, whalebone vibration, seaweed-and-bone figures). The phrase "embracing one's true nature" in the final beats skews generic, reducing originality at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien makes two key choices: pocketing the scrimshaw and following the map to the sublittoral fringe. Her profession as dock worker establishes her physicality and self-effacement ("the Ghost") but does not constrain her island journey. The final return to the docks with new confidence completes the arc, though no trade-off is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three beats: discovery in the chest, warming against her skin as she wades, and insertion into the temple lock. Its crumbling to dust after the vision signals cost, though the loss is symbolic rather than tactical. The object drives the island sequence and its destruction marks the closure, but it does not constrain later action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The island appears twice: shimmering on the horizon, then solidifying around Lirien. Its rule—"only appears to those who no longer seek it through force"—shapes the story's thematic stakes and explains why Lirien can access it. However, the island functions more as symbolic space than tactical constraint; no choice within the island tests this rule.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "unlocks guarded hearts" is implied thematically (the temple doors sealed with whalebone, "her heart unlocked" in the final paragraph) but never enacted as a trade-off or constraint. The mother-figure's heart is already open; Lirien's self-acceptance is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that costs her something on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Detach" is enacted when the mother explains her choice to step beyond the world's cruelty and when Lirien wakes on shore, the island vanished. The action shapes the mother's arc and frames Lirien's transformation, but does not drive a climactic turn. Lirien does not herself detach; she integrates and returns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whale's call appears in three beats: the distant breach as Lirien wades, the closer call as the temple dissolves, and the lingering "roar of the sea in her ears" and "song in her bones" at closure. The call signals the island's presence and charges the ending image with sensory continuity. It does not, however, shape Lirien's tactics or constrain her choices within the island sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe—"where the sea floor dropped away into darkness and the water hummed with the songs of whales"—is the threshold Lirien must cross to reach the island. The cold water biting her ankles and the scrimshaw's warmth create embodied pressure. The setting frames the journey but does not supply resources or obstacles that alter Lirien's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible" is explained by the mother-figure as the island's temporal state, not a constraint on Lirien's present. The phrase appears once, thematically, without shaping the on-page action or narrowing Lirien's window of decision. No ticking clock or deadline pressures her choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lirien's desire to stop disappearing and to embrace her true nature is signaled early ("learned to make herself small") and resolved in the final image where she moves "no longer trying to disappear." The friction between her habit of self-effacement and the island's invitation to acceptance is clear, though the cost of transformation is more declared than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" appears in the mother-figure's "cold but gentle" touch and the line "Violence became impossible here," which reframes detachment as care rather than abandonment. The tone modulates between the hard-edged docks and the dreamlike island, but does not sharpen under pressure. The final paragraph's tenderness is uncontested, lacking the combative edge the element promises.</comment>
