<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora shows embodied tension (trembling clipboard, operatively gentle voice) and her exhaustion is credibly rendered. However, her internal contradiction never truly acts *in scene*—she questions redemption reflectively but never makes a micro-choice that tests competing impulses under pressure. Kessar's penitent arrival and coin gesture feel more symbolic than causally motivated by prior character work. The final decision to "carry it together" lacks visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization toward shared burden), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically legible—what specific option does Liora foreclose by agreeing? The piece teaches a hybrid lens (reflective accumulation toward a causal turn) but the final image relies on atmospheric cues (monks chanting, alignment complete) rather than a concrete action or renunciation that reweights prior pressure. Kessar's coin and the treaty's singed edges function as motifs without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terrace anchors who/where/when early and sensory detail (jasmine, cicadas, singed treaty edges) is selective and purposeful. The clipboard's heartwood origin and the terrace's historical truce site add texture, though the celestial alignment remains decorative. Spatial choreography is clear (Liora at edge, Kessar emerging, both turning toward altar). The clipboard's weight and the coin's warmth are micro-setting elements that charge moments, though neither constrains a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether this treaty will hold—is signaled early. Kessar's question "What's left for you when the wars end?" introduces a secondary existential pressure but does not tighten options. The piece offers one micro-turn (Kessar's coin gesture shifts tone) but no escalation that narrows Liora's choices or raises cost. The final agreement feels preordained rather than wrested from competing goods; the "price of redemption" is invoked but not tested through a trade-off or visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of redemption's price emerges through concrete particulars (singed treaty, war-zone scars, tired negotiator) rather than assertion. Kessar's reframing—"Maybe it's what we choose to carry"—risks thematic echo but is integrated into character exchange. The final image of shared burden offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though the conceptual cost (what walking away would mean) remains more implied than felt. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture and silence (clasped hands, warm coin).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; Liora's perceptual signature (negotiator's lens, weary specificity) is consistent. "Operatively gentle" and the clipboard's tactile presence anchor voice in purposeful detail. Dialogue is sparse but natural, pursuing goals obliquely (Kessar tests her commitment, Liora deflects with pragmatism). Psychic distance modulates intentionally at peak beats (her grip tightens, breath taken before final line). No head-hopping or filter clutter; the monks' chant provides atmospheric closure without POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor density slips: "requisite chiseled into stone like the names of the dead" and "aligned in their slow dance, Jupiter and Venus drawing near like reluctant lovers" stack decorative metaphors in the opening without pattern payoff. "The price of redemption was never just the signing of a treaty. It was the quiet moments after" is a brief paraphrase loop. No template cadence or major artifacts at closure; clarity and propulsion hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The war-zone negotiator meeting her adversary on a ritual terrace is a solid synthesis, but the celestial alignment, monk setting, and clipboard-as-talisman feel derived from familiar templates (sacred-peace-summit genre markers). The coin gesture and "operatively gentle" add textural freshness. Emotional specificity (Liora's exhaustion, Kessar's penitent stance) lifts the piece above generic, but the ending's "let's carry it together" resolution follows a predictable arc. No bold structural risk or transformation that redefines premise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and makes the final decision to sign and share the burden, but her choices function more as thematic stance than causal turns that narrow options. Her exhaustion and resolve are established early; the meeting confirms rather than tests them.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clipboard appears in the opening (traced, trembles in grip) and again when Liora opens it to reveal the treaty. Its heartwood origin and ink-stain map add charged specificity, but it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—the final image shifts to the coin and shared stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Redemption's price is invoked explicitly mid-scene and shapes the dialogue (Kessar's question about what's left, the coin as reminder). However, it remains more thematic overlay than on-page cost that alters tactics. The final agreement gestures toward price without a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is dramatized once in Liora's vocal calibration ("soft enough to disarm, firm enough to command") but does not constrain or enable later action with visible cost. It functions as a trait label with one supporting beat, not a recurring tactical lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Muster" appears in "She had mustered every ounce of her resolve to meet him here," anchoring her arrival as effortful. It establishes stakes but does not drive a major turn; the meeting itself could proceed with minor rewording. Mid-band for setup work without closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early (terrace where first truce was signed, monks' chant, celestial alignment) and frames the meeting's weight. The monks begin their chant at closure, tying method to the ending image. However, the ritual's mechanics do not shape Liora's or Kessar's attempts—it provides atmosphere rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is established in the opening and supplies historical pressure (site of first truce, blood and wine mingled). Midsummer's jasmine and cicadas anchor sensory texture. The setting returns at closure (turning toward the altar) and the celestial alignment times the decision. The terrace itself does not alter tactics, but its ritual weight charges the final moment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The celestial alignment (Jupiter and Venus drawing near) is mentioned early and again at closure ("The celestial bodies had nearly aligned"), bracketing the scene. However, the timeframe remains decorative—no ticking clock pressures Liora's or Kessar's choices, and the alignment completes without consequence if they delayed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is invoked when the monks say such nights are for that purpose, and Liora's life is described as "chasing that alchemy." The motivation frames her attendance and her final agreement, but the friction between ideal and practice is told more than tested through competing wants on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is sustained through lyric particulars (jasmine and scars, singed treaty, warm coin) and modulates naturally with pressure (trembling clipboard, exhaled pragmatism, final breath before agreement). The tone coheres across reflective and dramatic beats, charging the ending image (monks' voices rising like smoke, weight settling between them) without sentimentality.</comment>
