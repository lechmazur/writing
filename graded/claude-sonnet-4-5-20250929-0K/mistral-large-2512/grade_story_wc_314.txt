<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal arc is signaled—alchemist learning to release control—but her contradictory impulses are narrated rather than enacted in scene. The memory of the flame offers backstory motivation, yet the kneeling with the crystal reads more as symbolic gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("the touch of wonder," "secretly sentimental") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final smile and resolve arrive without a dramatized struggle that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the orchard, crystals, flame memory, and starlings layer toward a final image of letting go. Orientation anchors (Liora, orchard, waterfall) arrive promptly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization: she will "harmonize logic and intuition... by letting them dance"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no prior tactic visibly abandoned. The crystal's shattering and starlings' flight offer lyric charge, yet the "for the first time in years, Liora smiled" summary undercuts on-page pressure. One meaningful deepening (flame memory reweighted) is present, meeting minimum escalation, but the cost remains conceptual and told.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (prismatic veil, damp earth, scent of apples, hum of bees). The frozen dew crystal at the tree's center constrains Liora's final gesture (kneeling, pressing it into earth), charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Micro-setting (the crystal, the tree) functions purposefully, lifting the score, though the broader orchard remains more atmospheric than tactically binding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora seeks to reconcile control and wonder before "the final transformation." The flame memory offers a meaningful deepening (past failure reweighted as understanding rather than control), and the crystal-planting gesture tightens her stance. However, no live option is dramatized as foreclosed—she never attempts control on the page, so the renunciation lacks friction. The starlings' unpredictable patterns illustrate her theme but do not force a trade-off with visible cost. Escalation reads as thematic accumulation rather than a pressure spike that narrows tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (wonder versus control, intuition versus logic) emerges organically from the flame memory, starlings, and crystal without thesis statements. The final image—crystal shattering, starlings weaving a new story—offers a resonant, non-literal answer tied to prior particulars. The "harmonize logic and intuition... by letting them dance" line edges toward articulation but stops short of moralizing. Subtext operates in the flame's persistence and Liora's hidden sentimentality. The ending reweights the orchard's invitation without a stated lesson, meeting the quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (alchemist's lens on equations, vials, formations) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the pulse of something greater than reason," "melody that needed no translation") that reads slightly ornamental rather than voice-specific under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the crystal moment. No dialogue to assess. The prose reflects Liora's mind adequately but lacks a rhythmic or syntactic signature that heightens pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paragraph rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the touch of wonder" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure; "Magic, like emotion, was not a formula to be solved" summarizes what the orchard and starlings already showed. Filter verbs ("she felt it most keenly," "she had learned") dull immediacy in high-stakes moments. Stock metaphors ("liquid gemstones," "captured star," "embers in a dying fire") cluster without fresh specificity. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but information density is diluted by restatement. No causality break, so penalties route here: paraphrase loop (−0.2), filter stack in peak beat (−0.5), stock metaphor cluster (−0.3) total ~−1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "alchemist learns to embrace mystery" arc is a recognizable template; the orchard-behind-waterfall and frozen-dew-crystal motifs offer surface freshness but do not transform the emotional arithmetic. The flame memory and starling patterns provide specific anchors, yet the progression from control to release follows a predictable path without a non-obvious turn. The "touch of wonder" and "secretly sentimental" cues read as prompt echoes rather than lived-in particulars. No bold risk or unconventional structure; the piece executes its premise competently but does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout. She steps through the waterfall (setup), recalls the flame failure and studies starlings (middle beats), and kneels to plant the crystal (closure gesture). However, her choices are contemplative rather than decisive—no live option is narrowed on the page. The final smile and resolve are asserted, not enacted through a trade-off with cost. Two gates (setup, closure presence) are met, but causal pressure and specificity are weak. Adjustment: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability (any introspective protagonist) −0.6, ornamental interiority −0.5. Base ~3.0 + net ~+1.0 → floor ~4.0; lyric reprise lifts slightly to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The frozen dew crystal appears at setup (center tree), is handled in the middle (Liora plucks, examines the flame inside), and returns at closure (planted, shatters). Three gates met. It constrains the final gesture (kneeling, pressing into earth) and its shattering charges the ending image. Specificity is high (frozen dew, swirling flame inside). Adjustment: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, but late-middle first touch −0.3, no mid-scene cost −0.4. Base ~3.0 + net ~+3.1 → 6.1, round to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"The touch of wonder" is named in the text and frames Liora's internal conflict (quantify versus feel), shaping the thematic stake. It appears early, recurs in reflection, and the final stance ("let go... of the need to control") addresses it. However, it does not alter on-page tactics—Liora never attempts to measure or control an object in scene, so no live choice hinges on wonder versus logic. The concept operates as theme rather than plot pressure. Adjustment: early signal +0.6, thematic presence across beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but label-only/told −0.7, no causal pressure −0.8. Base ~3.0 + net ~+0.8 → 3.8, round to 4.1 (lyric reprise nudge).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is stated on the page ("She had been secretly sentimental all along, hiding behind calculations"). Setup is mid-story, not early. The trait explains her behavior (hiding emotion behind work) but does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost—no beat shows her choosing sentiment over logic with a price. Development and closure gates are weak. Adjustment: mid-appearance −0.3, label-only trait −0.7, thematic echo +0.4. Base ~3.0 + net ~−0.6 → 2.4; thematic coherence lifts slightly to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Flame appears in backstory (past failure, consumed notes), inside the crystal (middle examination), and at closure (flickering, then shattering releases ember-like pieces). Three moments across the arc. The flame memory motivates Liora's shift from control to understanding, shaping the thematic turn. However, the flame itself does not drive a tactical choice on the page—it is symbolic rather than plot-active. Adjustment: early signal (memory) +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, thematic causal work +0.8, but swappability (any past-failure motif) −0.6, summary-only in key beat −0.5. Base ~3.0 + net ~+2.7 → 5.7, round to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The starling flock appears at setup (takes flight, draws attention), middle (Liora has studied their formations for years, watches mesmerized), and closure (returns, weaves "a new story in the sky"). Three gates met. The patterns illustrate the logic-versus-intuition theme and the unpredictability Liora must accept, but they do not supply a method she uses—she observes, does not act through them. The mechanics (shifting, never-same-twice formations) are shown but not instrumental. Adjustment: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but ornamental/observational −0.8, swappable motif −0.5. Base ~3.0 + net ~+1.5 → 4.5, round to 4.3 (dominant limiter: ornamental).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is anchored early (Liora steps through) and frames the entire scene. The orchard supplies the tree, crystal, and starlings—key props. The waterfall's "prismatic veil" and the orchard's "scent of ripe apples and hum of bees" enrich atmosphere. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Liora could have this realization anywhere lush and isolated. Spatial layout is clear. Adjustment: early anchor +0.7, closure presence (she steps back through) +0.8, specificity +0.5, but postcard-description trend −0.6, no tactical constraint −0.7. Base ~3.0 + net ~+0.7 → 3.7; lyric coherence lifts to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before the final transformation" is named once at setup and echoed at closure ("Before the final transformation, she would let go"). The timeframe establishes urgency conceptually but does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock counts down, no choice is accelerated by the deadline. The transformation itself is undefined (world's magic solidifying or dissolving), so the stakes remain abstract. Adjustment: early signal +0.5, closure echo +0.6, but vague/untracked time −0.8, no tactical pressure −0.6. Base ~3.0 + net ~−0.3 → 2.7; thematic coherence nudges to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to harmonize logic and intuition is stated explicitly ("She would harmonize logic and intuition not by forcing them together, but by letting them dance") and implied throughout (alchemist who tried to control, now learning to feel). It frames the dominant stake and the closure stance. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in friction—no on-page beat shows Liora torn between a logical tactic and an intuitive impulse with visible cost. Adjustment: early setup (implicit) +0.5, thematic spine +1.0, closure articulation +1.0, but told-only friction −0.8, no on-page trade-off −0.7. Base ~3.0 + net ~+1.0 → 4.0; lyric reprise lifts to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Ancient freshness" is not named but evoked: the orchard feels timeless yet alive, the frozen dew crystals catch light "like captured stars," the kaleidoscope shifts hues. Tone is coherent—lyric, contemplative, tinged with wonder—and modulates subtly (memory of failure adds weight, final smile lightens). The final image (crystal shattering, starlings weaving) charges the ending with quiet vitality, consistent with the established register. Adjustment: coherent across beats +1.2, modulation under pressure +0.8, closure charge +1.0, specificity (prismatic, frozen-dew, liquid-gemstone imagery) +0.6, but static mood in middle −0.4. Base ~3.0 + net ~+3.2 → 6.2, round to 6.3.</comment>
