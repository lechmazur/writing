<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ryn's interiority is concrete and her motivation to find silence amid chaos is embodied through the stone's warmth and her ear pressed to ice. The final decision to bind the bloom and flee is earned by prior setup, though the choice itself feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn. Internal contradiction is light—she never seriously weighs staying or abandoning the mission—so the stakes feel more external (beings' pursuit) than internal (competing desires). Embodied emotion is present but limited to physical cues; deeper ambivalence or cost is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, stakes by the opening paragraph). The piece operates under a Causal lens: Ryn's search → stone vibration → light conjuring → bloom discovery → binding attempt → collapse and escape form a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she carries the silence in the stone, sharing it rather than inhabiting it, with the bloom's collapse as visible cost. The final image ("she had found a way to carry it") reweights her goal with felt opportunity cost (the bloom is destroyed). One meaningful tightening (beings' awareness pressing against the bloom) narrows options and forces the binding choice. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain movement (shifting ice, hidden passages) and the bloom's fragile nature shapes the final choice. Sensory detail—humming walls, misting breath, frost curtain—is vivid and purposeful, reflecting Ryn's professional focus on sound and pattern. The stone as micro-setting object charges the closure by vibrating erratically when the beings sense her. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The gently luminous glow is mentioned but does not constrain action beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find and preserve the bloom of hush) is signaled in paragraph four and tested immediately when the bloom proves fragile. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Ryn's touch stills the world, her binding shrinks the bloom, and the beings' awareness forces her flight. The binding decision forecloses staying or further exploration, a visible trade-off. The bloom's collapse is an on-page cost that narrows future options (she has a fragment, not the whole). One clear reversal (beings sense her) tightens pressure and the final act (clutching the humming stone, emergence into wind) reweights her original goal with earned limitation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the tension between preserving silence and sharing refuge, embodied in the bloom's destruction and the stone's portability. The final lines resist moralizing—"not entirely… but for now, that was enough"—and offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (finding quiet in the storm) through the stone's pulsing light. The echo chamber stone as motif constrains her final choice and charges the ending without becoming over-symbolic. Subtext operates in the bloom's fragility (a perfect refuge cannot last) and the beings' hum as relentless external pressure. Minor weakness: the energy beings remain abstract, limiting thematic depth around what she's fleeing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Ryn's perceptions. Perceptual signature is professional (tracing ripple-marks, charting frequencies) and specificity in diction ("bloom of hush," "conjured a thin thread of light") anchors voice. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the bloom encounter, pulling slightly back for the escape. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Prose reflects urgency under pressure ("She had to move quickly"; "She had to leave") without losing texture. The "whisper" of binding words and the stone's "stolen silence" feel voice-consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; the causal chain is propulsive. Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor stakes and resolution. Minor scaffold appears in repeated sentence stems: "She had to move quickly"; "She had to act"; "She had to leave" in adjacent beats reads template-like under peak pressure (−0.4). "The bloom trembled, then began to shrink" and "Clutching the stone, now warm and humming" layer detail efficiently. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language ("edges curling inward like petals at dusk") is apt but the "soap bubble" simile feels slightly generic. Information density is high overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—mapkeeper seeking silence in sentient-cave terrain, binding ephemeral refuge to portable object—feels specific and non-obvious. The bloom of hush and echo chamber stone are fresh details. Emotional truth (finding partial, portable refuge rather than permanent escape) is earned. Weakness: the energy beings are archetypal disruptors without distinct characteristics; their arrival reshapes the world but they remain generic. The binding ritual and Ryn's light-conjuring feel more asserted than grounded in established world logic. Transformation test: swapping caves for another hostile environment would weaken but not break the arc, suggesting mid-band freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ryn's choices drive the arc: pressing ear to wall, conjuring light to reveal the passage, touching the bloom, binding it to the stone, and fleeing. Setup in opening paragraph, involved in middle discovery and binding beats, and present at closure (clutching the stone, emerging). Causal pressure is strong; her actions narrow options and force the final cost (bloom collapse). Visible trade-off (she destroys the bloom to save a fragment).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in paragraph six (found years ago, vibrates faintly), guides her to the bloom (paragraph seven), vibrates erratically when beings sense her (paragraph thirteen), receives the binding (paragraph fifteen), and pulses in her hand at closure (final two paragraphs). It shapes three distinct beats: discovery guidance, escalation signal, and closure anchor. Irreplaceable: its spiral etchings mirror her ripple-marks and its stolen silence charges the ending. Visible cost tied to its use (bloom collapse).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the dominant stake. Setup in paragraph four (legendary pocket of silence), encountered in paragraph ten (sphere of perfect silence), tested when fragile (paragraph twelve), and destroyed at closure (paragraph seventeen). It shapes Ryn's tactics (binding attempt) and the final image (stone humming with "stolen silence"). The bloom's collapse is the story's central cost and reweights her mission from preservation to portability. Causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "gently luminous" glow is mentioned in the opening line ("walls pulsing with a gently luminous glow") and returns as "lantern flickered, casting long shadows" in paragraph five, but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. It provides atmospheric detail and tracks with the caves' harmonic nature but remains decorative. No choice or tactic depends on this trait; it could be removed without altering causality. Present in setup, absent in development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Conjure" appears once in paragraph eight: "she conjured a thin thread of light, weaving it through the cracks in the ice like a needle through fabric." This action reveals the hidden passage and enables access to the bloom, a key causal turn. Setup is implicit (her mapkeeper role and the stone's guidance), and the action drives one major beat (discovery). Not present at closure; the binding and flight do not explicitly use conjuring again. Functional and irreplaceable for that beat but not woven through the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Examining crack patterns in ice" is introduced in paragraph two (Ryn traces fingers, examines crack patterns, searches for the path forward). It signals her professional method and recurs implicitly when she trusts "the ripple-marks, the old maps" during her escape (paragraph eighteen). Setup is clear and it primes her guidance system, but the method does not constrain a peak choice or shape the binding/escape beats directly. Present in two beats (opening and escape) with thematic reprise but only moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are introduced in the opening line, pressure Ryn through shifting ice and groaning chambers (paragraph nine), hide the bloom behind a frost curtain (paragraph eight), and warp around her during escape (paragraph eighteen). The setting constrains movement, supplies the bloom as resource, and the beings' influence on the caves escalates danger. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure chase. Causal throughout: the caves' instability shapes her tactics and urgency.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" is established in paragraph three ("three seasons ago") and their ongoing influence warps the caves throughout. The beings' awareness pressing against the bloom (paragraph thirteen) and their hum returning "louder now" (paragraph sixteen) tighten urgency and force the binding and escape. Present in setup and escalation, shaping the final cost (bloom collapse due to beings' proximity). The timeframe does not impose a live countdown but provides coherent ongoing pressure that alters Ryn's window for action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ryn's motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is stated in paragraph four and dramatized through her search, the bloom encounter (paragraph eleven: "she had found it"), and the final realization (last paragraph: "She had not found the quiet in the storm—not entirely. But she had found a way to carry it"). The motivation drives every choice and is tested by the bloom's fragility and the beings' pursuit. Friction between desire (preserve silence) and cost (bloom's destruction) is legible. Present across all three gates with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone blends reverent stillness ("gently luminous," "distant chimes," "perfect silence") with rising urgency ("She had to move quickly," "discordant wail"). The "hammered repose" frame is not explicitly signaled but can be inferred from the contrast between the bloom's stillness and the surrounding sonic chaos. Tone modulates coherently through discovery (calm), encounter (awed stillness), escalation (urgent), and escape (determined). The final image ("wind howling," stone "pulsing… steady") carries both turbulence and earned calm, charging closure. Coherent but not overtly taught as a pattern.</comment>
