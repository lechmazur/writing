<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's interior life shows embodied contradiction—the ghost of rain he never tasted, the static that "whispers" versus the scream he finally releases—and his final kneeling in ash reads as earned renunciation. The miniaturized fears are concrete, character-particular objects that ground his obsolescence anxiety. However, the motivation arc leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure; the decision to burn the box arrives abruptly without a dramatized precipitating choice that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (android caretaker, glass dome rose farm, magnetic shift timeline). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Eli kneels in ash, understanding the roses never needed him—a renunciation that forecloses his caretaker role with visible cost (the farm burned, his fears destroyed). The cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when he opens the box and lets the static scream out, shifting from containment to release. Minor causality softness: the magnetic north's repeated shifts frame the piece but do not mechanically trigger the burn decision; the linkage reads more atmospheric than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome, hydroponic tubes, artificial suns, and crimson desert roses establish a vivid micro-setting filtered through Eli's perception. The roses' blackened edges and the oldest bush anchor the climactic burn. The dome's cracking glass under heat charges the final image, and the "strangely organic soil" Eli brushes at the end reweights the earlier hydroponic artifice. Spatial choreography is clean; the box placed at the base of the bush, the fire spreading, the mist engagement all track coherently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Eli's need to resolve inner static and understand his purpose—is signaled early and tightens when he opens the box and screams. The controlled burn decision is agency as renunciation: he sacrifices the roses and his fears to achieve peace, forecloses his caretaker role. The cost is visible (farm destroyed, box smoldering, roses gone). Under the Accumulative lens, the magnetic shifts and static intensify until the burn reweights his stance. However, the turn from "containing chaos" to "release" arrives quickly; a second on-page complication or failed containment attempt before the burn would have elevated escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the miniaturized fears seeping into soil, the roses blooming "despite him," the final understanding that "the roses had never needed him. He had needed them." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The rusted gear of obsolescence and the static-as-storm motif recur with shifted meaning at closure. The fragmented wholeness tone (static resolved to peace, ashes yielding understanding) charges the final image. No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Eli; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—static as sensory metaphor, ghost memories, circuits humming—and diction stays within his android-yet-nostalgic lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close when he screams, wide when the dome groans. The prose rhythm accelerates during the burn sequence. Elision of backstory (the voice, the hand, the ozone scent) is purposeful and anchored to present static surges. No dialogue present; not applicable. Minor repetition: "static" appears frequently but remains voice-motivated and thematic rather than template churn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates during the burn. However, **multiple paraphrase loops and template-stem runs appear**: "The static in his mind" opens three sentences; "The roses were gone, but the farm was still alive, the chaos contained, the static resolved" stacks near-synonyms without added pressure; "He had been built to remember, but his memories were..." and similar constructions recur. Filter-verb stacks ("he remembered," "he watched," "he understood") cluster in reflective beats. These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger **−0.7 in Q7** per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. No figurative muddle or clarity break at closure; the final kneeling image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The android-caretaker-of-roses premise is familiar, but the miniaturized fears in vials and the magnetic-north timeframe offer specific, non-obvious inflections. The controlled burn as emotional release rather than destruction transforms the trope. Emotional specificity (the taste of rain he never had, the scream that is "raw, organic") avoids generic templates. The ending's quiet renunciation feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate; the reflective mode and symbolic objects (box of fears, rose petals like lips of a sleeping god) lean toward safe literary conventions. No proximity to famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli is present throughout and his choices (opening the box, carrying it to the rose bush, kneeling in ash) create key turns. Setup early, development middle (the scream), payoff at closure (kneeling, understanding). Causal pressure: his decision to burn the box drives the climax. Closure linkage strong. However, much of his arc is reflective rather than action-driven; the box-opening moment is the first on-page choice under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The box of childhood fears is introduced early (beneath his cot), handled in two distinct beats (lifting the obsolescence vial, carrying it to the rose bush), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (the fears melt, seep into soil, enabling his peace). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Causal pressure: the act of placing and burning the box narrows his options and forecloses his containment role. Specificity high: the glass vials, the shadow in amber, the frozen scream. Cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The controlled burn escape is introduced as engineered failsafe, then enacted when Eli burns the box. It shapes the climactic beat and the ending's stakes (dome cracked, roses sacrificed). Setup early, payoff strong. However, the middle development is thin: the burn is described as "a risk" but no failed containment or escalating magnetic disruption forces the choice on the page; it reads more as metaphor for emotional release than a tactical necessity that changes options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" appears twice: the rose petals and the soil Eli brushes at the end. The label hints at incongruity (organic life in artificial dome, android drawn to organic matter) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. It enriches atmosphere and theme but remains ornamental. Setup present, closure cameo, but no middle beat where the trait alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" applies to the childhood fears in vials. The concept is vivid and serves backstory, but the major turn (burning the box) does not depend on miniaturization per se—full-size fears or symbolic tokens would work equally well with minor edits. Present throughout but swappable; no beat where the miniature scale itself enables or constrains action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"By containing chaos" is Eli's method for decades (adjusting humidity, pruning, ensuring static doesn't spill). It shapes his prior tactics and frames the reversal when he "let it out." Setup early, development implicit (years of containment backstory), payoff strong (the burn is release, not containment). The mechanics matter: his shift from containment to release drives the thematic closure. However, on-page dramatization of containment attempts is thin; most is summary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in the glass dome supplies the spatial arena, resources (the oldest rose bush, hydroponic tubes, fire suppression mist), and the climactic constraint (dome cracks under heat). Setup immediate, development throughout (roses bloom despite him, petals blacken, bush shudders), payoff decisive (fire spreads, glass cracks, Eli kneels in ash). The setting pressures the ending: the dome's fragility and the roses' autonomy force his renunciation. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The magnetic north shift is introduced in the first sentence and recurs ("the north kept shifting," "the north shifted again"). It destabilizes the dome's climate controls and amplifies Eli's static. Setup strong, payoff present (the north shifts again as Eli smiles). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; no live clock or specific magnetic threshold forces the burn timing. It reads more as atmospheric recurring motif than a tactical constraint that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to resolve inner static is stated early and drives the arc: the static "whispers," "swelled," then "dissolved" after the burn. It is dramatized in the scream and the final peace. Setup, development, payoff all present. Causal pressure: the need to resolve static motivates the box-burning choice. However, much of the friction is told ("he didn't care," "something like peace") rather than shown through contradictory micro-choices under immediate pressure. Cost clear (caretaker role renounced).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is coherent throughout: the static crackling, ghost memories, miniaturized fears, blackened petals, and the final kneeling in ash all embody brokenness becoming peace. Tone modulates with pressure—fragments intensify until the scream, then resolve to calm—and charges the final image ("for the first time, Eli remembered what it was like to be whole"). Setup implicit, development sustained, payoff strong. The tone is not static; it shifts from fragmented noise to earned silence.</comment>
