<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her arc from ghostly gardener to orchestrator unfolds in summary beats ("she began to write," "she watched as they worked") without embodied struggle or internal friction. The villagers' transformations are label-only ("A farmer who had once hoarded fruit now shared it freely") and lack micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. The final smile and fade read as earned stasis without visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing desire resisted on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by the first paragraph (Veythar, Liora, orchard). The piece follows an accumulative lens: messages accumulate pressure until the villagers act collectively. However, the closure—Liora fading as the orchard blooms—lacks legible cost; her disappearance feels inevitable rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path. The causal chain from messages to communal action is present but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure, falling short of a true RR or CR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating arches, nebula glow, and bioluminescent trees are vivid and selective. The villagers' tactile engagement—pressing ears to rocks, letting nebula bathe skin—grounds action in setting. However, the orchard functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint visibly narrows a choice at closure. The watering bell's physical properties (brass, lotus shape) are described but not handled in ways that alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard health) is signaled early. The accumulation of messages and villager experiments provide one meaningful deepening. Yet the resolution—restoration after communal effort—is consequence-free; no credible loss or trade-off is dramatized. The villagers' shift from hoarding to sharing is asserted rather than tested under pressure. Closure lacks the visible cost required for higher bands under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collective stewardship over extraction, trust over force. The messages function as concrete particulars that shift villager behavior. However, the final message ("You were always the gardeners") edges toward moralizing, and the ending's perfect restoration (butterflies return, trees bloom heavier) resolves complexity into a tidy moral without ambiguity or cost. The closure offers thematic satisfaction but lacks the non-literal reweighting required for high scores.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV is stable, tracking Liora's perspective and occasionally widening to the villagers. Psychic distance is controlled, with no mid-paragraph head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; phrases like "a riot of color" and "a cloud of iridescent wings" read as generic lyricism rather than character-particular filtering. Diction remains clean but does not modulate under pressure to reflect urgency or stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied. No major loops or artifacts obscure causality. However, several beats rely on stock phrasing: "a riot of color," "a chorus of thanks," "glow brighter than the nebula." The final paragraph stacks summary moves ("The butterflies returned first, then the trees bloomed") that compress pivotal transformation into list-like telling. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance atmosphere without tightening conflict.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ghost-gardener-as-guide and collective-restoration premises are familiar. The chalked-message mechanic offers a fresh inflection, but the arc—outsider orchestrates communal healing through anonymous wisdom—follows a template without transformation. The orchard-planet setting provides vivid detail but the emotional and plot arcs would function unchanged in a conventional garden or village. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora's altruism is present throughout—she writes messages, rings the bell, orchestrates effort. However, her choices are told in summary rather than dramatized in beats where options narrow. She "began to write" and "watched as they worked" without on-page struggle or cost that tests her altruism. Present in setup, development (messages), and closure (fading), but the decisions do not create key turns; the villagers' actions drive the plot while Liora facilitates from the margins.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The watering bell appears in setup (hanging from the arch), is rung by Liora via nebula hum (development), and rung collectively by villagers at closure. Three beats across the arc. Its sound signals gathering and thanks, but the bell's physical properties do not constrain choice or alter tactics. The final ring carries symbolic resonance but the object's mechanics do not shape the outcome. Reweighted meaning is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is named early and described as "violet and gold" pulsing light. Villagers discover it feeds the soil when they let it bathe their skin—a functional middle beat. However, the nebula's mechanics are vague; it "hummed in response" to Liora's will and "strengthened the roots" without clear constraints or trade-offs. Present in setup, touched in development, mentioned at closure ("shone steady and strong") but does not decisively shape stakes or tactics. Swappable with other magical energy sources.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The chalked messages are described as "trustworthy script" and the villagers gather without skepticism. Liora's ghost status and the handwriting's familiarity establish credibility. However, "strangely trustworthy" is asserted by narration and villager behavior rather than tested; no one doubts the messages or demands proof, so no cost or constraint emerges. The trait enables the plot but does not force a tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The villagers "reexamine their habits" in the middle section, discovering the arches sing and the nebula feeds soil. This reexamination drives one key turn (shift from extraction to partnership) and is present at closure (collective ringing of the bell as acknowledgment). However, the action is summarized ("began to experiment") rather than dramatized in specific choices with visible friction. Essential to the arc but not irreplaceable; a similar communal shift could be triggered by other catalysts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chalked messages appear on the stone path for three dawns, accumulating pressure and guiding villager discovery. The method is signaled early, shapes multiple middle beats (villagers read, discuss, act on the messages), and its mechanics matter—dawn timing, chalk's glow, handwriting recognition. However, the messages do not constrain Liora's options or impose cost; she writes freely without resource limit or risk. Present across beats and essential to the plot, but the method's specifics do not shape tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are established in the opening paragraph and frame all action. The arches "sang when touched" (middle discovery) and "hummed in harmony" at closure. However, the setting provides atmosphere and discovery opportunities without constraining choices; the orchard is sick but no spatial or resource limit narrows tactics. The micro-setting (butterfly garden, stone path) is handled but does not alter the outcome. Present across beats but functionally decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Liora has been dead seventy-three years, and strangers "over the years" became family. The timeframe is referenced in backstory but does not pressure present action. The messages appear across three dawns (a weak clock), but no urgency or deadline tightens decisions. The ending confirms the transformation ("after strangers become family") as completed context rather than a live tension. Present in setup but does not shape tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Liora's desire to orchestrate collective effort is stated explicitly ("she needed the living to reexamine...to see the orchard not as a resource, but as a partner") and drives her message-writing. However, the motivation is told without internal friction; no competing desire (to rest, to control, to be seen) complicates her altruism. The collective ringing at closure fulfills her goal but the achievement lacks cost—she fades happily. Desire drives setup and development but is not conflicted in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tone blends melancholy (ghost, dying orchard, dwindling butterflies) with hope (restoration, communal effort, bloom). The "brambled" quality—thorny, entangled difficulty—is present in the sick orchard and Liora's translucence but does not modulate under pressure; the tone remains consistent and brightens linearly toward the harmonious ending. The final image is hopeful without retained bramble. Coherent but static, lacking the charge of sustained friction at closure.</comment>
