<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's envy and longing are asserted but never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure; his descent and confrontation feel outlined rather than inhabited. The radio voices guide him without meaningful internal resistance or cost visible in action. The crowd's shift at the end ("their allegiance wavering") is told, not earned through dramatized struggle. Kael exists only as a declared rival, offering no relational friction or on-page exchange to test Elias's contradictions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story signals a causal lens (Elias hears voices → descends → confronts Kael → crowd wavers) but key linkages are elided or summarized: how he "unfolds" the shadows, what specific act makes the crowd see them, and whether Kael's faltering changes Elias's situation remain unclear on the page. Closure lands as the crowd turns and "the world was listening," a shift in stance, but the cost is implied rather than felt—no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical sacrifice marks the ending. The thirty-year backstory and reflective blocks exceed the BRR default without anchoring present micro-choices that tilt his stance; this flattens escalation without triggering a separate Q7 penalty, so I apply −0.3 here and note the cap ripple below.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory, cobalt portico, and storm are vivid and purposeful in the opening third; the valley firelight and scavenged platform ground the confrontation. Spatial choreography during the crowd scene is loose—Elias "pushed through" and "stepped forward" without clear blocking of distance, elevation, or how the crowd's gaze shifts. The portico's reflection "flared in his mind" rather than constraining a physical choice or shaping the final image on the page, so it remains primarily atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's bid to lead versus Kael's charisma—is clear, but escalation is asserted rather than tested: the voices simply tell him to act, he descends without obstacle, and the crowd's turn happens in a single beat without a prior micro-reversal or visible cost that narrows his options. Kael's "confidence cracking like ice" summarizes a capitulation we do not witness through dialogue or resistance. The ending leaves Elias poised but does not show a tactical price paid or a path foreclosed with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—loneliness, visionary ambition, the tension between ancient authority and charismatic populism—emerges from scene work and the cobalt portico's symbolic function. The final paragraph edges toward statement: "The new dawn would rise, shaped by ancient shadows and the lonely visionary who had dared to unfold them" leans expository and recaps the premise rather than letting image carry the thematic weight. The crowd's allegiance shift and the burning-eyed ghosts offer a resonant answer, but the moral is over-articulated in the tag line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds, perceptual signature ("his heart a storm of envy and longing") is consistent, and the diction ("stormlit," "lyrically prophetic") attempts elevation. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats: "watched," "heard," "saw," "felt" appear frequently without clear voice motivation, dulling immediacy (−0.3). Kael's one line of dialogue ("Behold! The dawn is coming!") and Elias's spoken turn lack subtext or character-specific rhythm; both sound generically declamatory. The piece avoids head-hopping and tense slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, imagery is vivid ("fingers of a drowning man," "moths to a flame"), and information density is high in the opening third. Paraphrase loops appear: "He had spent thirty years listening… convinced that the fragments… could unfold the future" then "he had always known it" without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language in most lines of the storm descent ("the wind howled… beneath it, he heard the fragments… overlapping, colliding") without pattern-teaching or direct payoff (−0.4). No major scaffold or register drift; the final paragraph summarizes rather than propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lonely mountain mystic versus valley prophet is a familiar opposition, and the piece does not transform it through occupational specificity, dialect, or a non-obvious moral calculus. The cobalt portico, radio frequencies, and ghostly visions offer textural freshness, but the confrontation and crowd-turn follow a predictable arc. The story commits to its premise without retreat, and the prose voice is consistent, preventing a deeper derivative penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (lonely visionary) is present throughout and makes the key turn—descending to confront Kael—but his choices are guided by the radio voices rather than generated by internal contradiction. Setup clear, middle choice present (descent), closure participation via his speech, but agency is diluted by external prompting. Two beats (listening, confronting) + closure linkage, but causal pressure is moderate and cost is implied rather than visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in two beats: Elias presses hands against it and speaks, then its reflection "flared in his mind" to conjure the ancient shadows. Setup clear, middle use present, closure linkage indirect (the ghosts it channels help turn the crowd). However, it is not physically handled at the end, and its "swirling images" function remains static—description without evolving tactical cost. Gate coverage (all three) but weak causal pressure and no irreplaceability test passed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Variant allegiance (the crowd's shifting loyalty) is the story's hinge: Elias envies Kael's followers, descends to contest their allegiance, and the ending crystallizes their waver. Setup in "variant allegiance was a fickle thing," development via the confrontation, payoff in "their allegiance wavering." Two beats + closure. However, the mechanics of the shift—what specific act or cost changes their stance—are told rather than dramatized, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears twice as a label: in narration ("his voice lyrically prophetic") and at the climax ("his voice rising… lyrically prophetic"). No cost or constraint tied to this register; it could be replaced with "commanding" or "resonant" without altering structure. Setup present, closure mention, but ornamental use and high swappability cap the score. Missing middle beat where the trait enables or constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears three times: the voices tell Elias to "unfold" the shadows, the premise claims "unfold the future," and the final line "who had dared to unfold them." Setup clear, the action is named at the climax ("Let them see"), and closure links to it. However, the mechanics are elided—how he unfolds them on the page is unclear—so the action remains more thematic echo than dramatized causal engine. Two beats + closure but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies appear in the opening (Elias adjusts the radio, hears voices) and during the descent ("voices from the past… overlapping, colliding"). Setup clear, middle presence during the storm walk, but at closure the radio is absent—Elias speaks without technological mediation. The method does not shape the final confrontation's tactics or cost, and could be omitted from the ending without loss. Two beats, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds grounds the opening third with vivid sensory detail and spatial stakes (isolation, altitude). The descent to the valleys shifts locale and the firelit crowd scene is legible. The observatory's elevation contrasts Elias's remove from Kael's followers, shaping his motivation and the climactic descent choice. Setup strong, middle (descent as a spatial/tactical move), closure (valley as the arena). Constraint moderate—altitude and storm pressure the journey but do not alter final tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" is summarized in backstory ("Kael… preached… His followers grew by the thousands") but not tracked or tightened on the page. The present action spans one evening (storm, descent, confrontation) with no clock pressure or tactical urgency tied to Kael's momentum. Setup via exposition, no middle development where time narrows options, closure untimed. Swappable with any vague duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows—is stated early, drives his descent, and lands at closure ("The new dawn would rise, shaped by ancient shadows"). Three beats + closure linkage. However, the desire is told more than embodied in conflicted micro-choices: envy is named, but no on-page moment shows him weighing cost (solitude, risk, the radio's price) against ambition. Functional integration but minimal friction between want and cost visible in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Tone aims for dark grandeur ("fingers of a drowning man," "serpents in the dark") but "gritty whimsy" is not legible—no playful deflation, ironic lightness, or tonal counterpoint appears. The prose is uniformly elevated and somber. If "whimsy" was intended in the cobalt portico or ghost images, it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image. Present tonal consistency (gritty/serious) but the specified hybrid is absent, and no tonal shift supports escalation.</comment>
