<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular (the nib's weight "like holding her father's hand again"), and her micro-choices (writing three letters, pressing the nib into wax) reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is present—grief versus investigative drive—but operates sequentially rather than simultaneously in most beats. The final choice to step into light feels motivated but the cost is more asserted than dramatized on the page. Embodied emotion is strong in the nib-handling beats but some passages slip into label-only feelings ("the weight of orbits she could no longer ignore").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are delayed: who Elara is and her precise present action don't cohere until the inkwell/letter sequence around 40%. The journalist's call functions as inciting pressure but remains off-page summary; the obituary-scrubbing and father's death are backstory that dominate the present frame. A causal lens is implied but undercut by heavy reflection; the ending "stepped into the light" offers Charged Poise (options crystallized, stakes visible) but the cost—what she risks by going—is gestured at rather than made concrete. The orientation delay triggers a −0.4 penalty here and caps Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid (dome "swallowing" sunset, brass eyepiece, gaslight) and returns at closure (balcony, wind, lights below), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across beats. However, the setting doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Elara could write the letters anywhere. The nib functions as micro-setting (tool-as-anchor) and does charge closure, lifting the score above mid-band. Capped at 7.0 due to orientation debt applied in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving her father's murder—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archives are scrubbed, prompting Elara to write the three letters. Agency is present (writing, sealing, choosing to go) but the escalation is largely internal recap rather than on-page pressure that narrows options. The final "stepped into the light" offers stance crystallization but the immediate cost (danger at the printworks) is told via radio warning, not felt in her body or choice-making. Cost legibility is implied rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus erasure, inheritance of regret—emerges from the nib, letters, and observatory without overt statement. "Orbits of regret" recurs with shifting weight (father's closed loop, hers "different"). The nib's intact tip versus the coroner's "snapped" claim is a concrete particular that grounds the investigation. The ending offers a non-literal answer (light as witness/exposure) without moralizing. However, "solemn playfulness" in the father's teaching is asserted rather than shown, and "proof by contradiction" remains more label than dramatized tactic, preventing full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV control is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Elara reads "orbits of regret in the way streetlamps flickered"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("iron gall sharp in the cold air"). The dialogue is minimal (radio exchanges) but carries subtext and goal pursuit. Free indirect style is clean. Some filter verbs ("She had learned," "she knew") are acceptable for the contemplative tone, but "solemn playfulness" in the father's pedagogy is asserted without rhythmic demonstration. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Strong opening line and vivid images ("forgotten god," "gaslight," "molten pool"). Information density is high in the nib-handling beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The journalist's call had come" / "The journalist's voice had been urgent" / "The journalist's reply came" recycle the same anchor. "Orbits of regret" is repeated without added pressure. Template cadence in the letter sequence ("The first letter…The second…The third") is functional but mechanical. Mixed metaphor: "swallowing the last of the sunset" is followed by "perched like a forgotten god"—the dome is both mouth and deity. Figurative density in non-peak beats ("restless spirit," "dying man's breath") borders on overwriting. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of newsprint heiress, astronomer-investigator, and the rosewood nib as evidence is specific and non-generic. "Proof by contradiction" as method offers a fresh angle but remains more assertion than dramatized logic on the page. The nib's intact state versus the coroner's claim is a solid inflection. Emotional honesty in grief and determination avoids sentimentality. However, the journalist-as-helper and printworks-meeting setup echo noir conventions without transformation, and "obituaries are for the living" is a near-stock aphorism. The observatory-as-witness is vivid but the final "stepped into the light" leans toward familiar metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (writing letters, sealing with the nib, deciding to go) drive key beats and the ending. Introduced immediately. Appears in opening, letter-writing sequence, and final action. Her decision to intervene after the archives are scrubbed narrows options and the final step into light is the closure beat. However, much of her investigation is recounted (father's death, archive-scrubbing) rather than enacted, limiting causal pressure. Two integration gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is retrospective rather than choice-driven. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but summary-only mid-section −0.5, swappability (any investigator could perform these actions) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rosewood nib is present in five beats: opening trace, coroner's report contradiction, dipping in inkwell, sealing wax imprint, and tucked in pocket at closure. Its intact tip contradicts the official story, driving the investigative stakes. Specificity is high (rosewood grain, sharp enough to draw blood). However, it functions primarily as evidence-object rather than constraining a choice or altering tactics; Elara could write with any pen. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, but limited causal pressure (does not narrow options) −0.8, no cost tied to the object itself −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" appears as image (father's closed loop, streetlamps, her different trajectory) but remains metaphor rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. It echoes thematically without altering what Elara can or must do. Present by first third. Recurs in streetlamp observation and final balcony beat. Does not constrain choice or enable action. Early signal +0.4, two mentions across beats +0.6, closure echo +0.3, but ornamental use (description without pressure) −0.9, swappability (any regret metaphor would serve) −0.7, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is stated twice (cataloging sky, father "devotedly observant too") and shown in Elara's reading of streetlamps and the nib's contradiction. It informs her investigative method but does not constrain or cost her a choice on the page; the trait could be rewritten as "meticulous" or "analytical" with minor edits. Present by midpoint. One beat (noticing the nib's intact state). No direct closure linkage beyond character consistency. Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, but late first appearance −0.3, label-only (asserted more than dramatized) −0.3, swappability −0.6, no cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intervene" is signaled ("decided to intervene") after the archive-scrubbing and enacted through writing the three letters and choosing to go to the printworks. It drives the second-half escalation and the closure action. However, the intervention itself (letter-writing) is preparatory rather than climactic; the true intervention (meeting at printworks) lies off-page beyond the ending. Present by 50%. Two beats (decision, letter-writing/sealing, final step). Closure linkage (the step into light is the intervention's start). Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, two beats +0.9, but late signal −0.4, summary-only peak (printworks meeting not shown) −0.6, cost deferred off-page −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is explained early ("assume the opposite…watch the world unravel") and applied once (assume accident, discover murder via the intact nib). The method is named and its logic shown in one beat, but it does not recur or shape multiple attempts. Present by 30%. One beat (nib contradiction). Mentioned at closure ("with the same solemn playfulness") but not active there. Setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, specificity +0.4, but no middle development (not used to test the journalist's claim or the coroner's motive) −0.6, ornamental closure mention −0.4, swappability (any deductive method) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The observatory is introduced in the opening line, provides the setting for all on-page action, and returns with charge at closure (balcony, wind, city lights below as "witness"). Its height and isolation are vivid but do not pressure Elara's choices—she could investigate from any location. The telescope trained on the city (not the heavens) is a nice inversion but remains image rather than constraint. Present immediately. Continuous setting. Closure image +1.2, early signal +0.7, but postcard description (no tactical constraint) −0.9, swappability (any isolated workspace) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist's call" is stated ("just after dusk") and the story proceeds through midnight (observatory clock chimes) to dawn (journalist's reply). However, the call itself is past-tense summary; the present action is Elara alone with the letters. Time does not tighten decisions—she writes at her own pace with no deadline pressure visible on the page. Present by opening. Tracked across beats (dusk, midnight, dawn). No clock that alters moves or forces choice. Setup +0.5, tracked +0.4, but vague pressure (no urgency tied to time) −0.6, summary-only inciting beat −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is Elara's clear motivation: proving her father's murder against the scrubbed record. It drives the letter-writing and final decision to go. The desire is dramatized through her handling of the nib, her laugh at the journalist, and her resolve. However, it remains largely uncontested—no on-page friction between safety and truth, or between grief and exposure. Present immediately (father's death, journalist's call). Two beats (letter-writing, final step). Closure linkage +1.0. Causal pressure +0.8, early signal +0.6, but told desire without internal friction −0.7, no competing want −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is asserted ("solemn playfulness he'd used to teach her the stars") but not demonstrated in rhythm, diction, or scene texture. The prose is consistently somber and lyrical without playful modulation. Elara's smile and the line "Then I won't" at closure offer a flicker of wry confidence but arrive too late to establish coherent tone. Mentioned once at 70%. Present in final exchange (smile, reply). Closure moment +0.8, but single static mood (somber throughout) −0.8, label-only (not enacted in voice or rhythm) −0.6, late signal −0.4, does not charge final image beyond one gesture −0.3.</comment>
