<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The queen's interior is present but abstract: "spent a lifetime issuing decrees," "the climb had not been the end," without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation clarity suffers—starlight etching happens off-page; her decision to climb feels declarative rather than dramatized via conflicting impulses. The mirror encounter offers a choice (touching the surface) but lacks visible cost on the page; the transformation ("no longer marked by constellations") reads as convenient reset. Embodied emotion is thin; "pulse quickened" and wind tugging robes are generic bodily cues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words (queen, palace balcony, city below), waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—dreams bleed into waking, constellations etch skin, the grotto glows, the mirror parts, transformation occurs—but the causal linkage between touching the mirror and losing the constellations is elided. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (queen reborn), yet the cost is asserted ("something deeper") rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The final image ("not as a queen disenchanted, but as one reborn") tells transformation without demonstrating what was renounced or paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and layered: serpentine trail, ember grotto, cobalt moss "like the underside of a wave," ceiling as "swirling void of stars." The grotto's luminescence and the firefly on her wrist constrain the queen's perception and pace the ascent. Spatial choreography is clear (balcony → path → grotto mouth → interior → mirror). However, the environment does not materially alter a choice; the queen walks through unopposed, and the mirror encounter proceeds without environmental friction. The setting charges atmosphere but does not gate or complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel recurring dreams) is signaled early via the scroll and starlight symptoms. Pressure coheres through the ascent—air thins, world shrinks—but no reversal narrows options; the queen proceeds unopposed to the mirror, touches it, and transforms. The mirror woman's exposition ("memories," "summons") replaces dramatized discovery. Agency at closure is thin: the touch is executed without visible trade-off or cost. One tightening (the scroll's warning) sets the journey, but escalation flattens once she enters the grotto; coincidence (the mirror awaits, the transformation completes) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (sky and earth connection, memory recovery) emerges from recurring images: starlight, constellations, fireflies, cobalt grotto, the mirror. The firefly on her wrist offers a momentary lyric beat ("shared exhale") that seeds the final transformation. However, the ending states theme explicitly: "The dreams had not been warnings. They had been memories." The final line ("not as a queen disenchanted, but as one reborn") asserts rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration. Subtext operates in the mirror woman's dialogue and the grotto's cathedral imagery, but the thematic answer is delivered rather than earned through a non-literal final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("cage of silk and shadow," "tapestry of twinkling lights," "cathedral of light"), creating a lyric texture. Psychic distance remains close enough to track her pulse and breath. Dialogue is minimal; the mirror woman's lines carry mythic register that fits the scene's tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—many phrases ("wind tugging at her robes like a restless child," "lanterns flickering like dying embers") could belong to any fantasy narrator. Voice modulates little under pressure; the queen's interior rhythm stays uniform from balcony to mirror encounter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("luminous lines that pulsed faintly," "ozone and something older," "liquid silver"). Clarity is maintained, and grammar is clean. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: the mirror encounter stacks metaphor ("mist," "weightless," "suspended between two worlds," "stars bled brighter") without advancing causality. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "The dreams had not been warnings. … The final warning had not been a threat." Paraphrase loop: "She stepped inside" followed immediately by "The deeper she went" restates entry. Apply −0.6 for density without payoff and loop. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but the accumulation dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise (queen plagued by starlight dreams climbs to mystical grotto, meets mirror self, transforms) follows a familiar quest-to-mythic-source template common in fantasy. Specificity (cobalt moss, firefly timing, constellations etched in skin) adds texture but does not transform the arc; swap the grotto for any sacred threshold and the emotional beats remain unchanged. The mirror woman's exposition ("last queen of the sky") and the transformation (constellations vanish, "something deeper" replaces them) feel declarative rather than inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate—elevated diction and lyric pacing—but does not heighten stakes or obscure clarity enough to warrant bonus. Apply derivative-premise adjustment −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from opening ("queen had not slept"). Development: the queen decides to climb and proceeds; no middle choice constrained by her role. Payoff: she touches the mirror and transforms. Her "disenchanted" state is asserted in the final line but not dramatized; her choices (issuing the climb, touching the silver) are executed without visible internal friction or cost tied to her queenly authority. Swappable with "troubled noble" or "cursed woman" with minor edits. Two gates (setup, payoff); no causal pressure that narrows options. Start 3.0 + setup signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 − ornamental role label −0.5 − swappability −0.7 = 3.2, round 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: named "ember grotto" before the climb begins. Development: the queen pauses at the mouth, watches a firefly, steps inside; the walls' luminescence intensifies as she descends. Payoff: the grotto houses the mirror and frames the transformation; the queen "stepped back" and exits as dawn creeps over "the ridge." Three beats, three gates, closure linkage strong. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability (specific glow, cathedral ceiling) +0.5 = base 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7. Specificity of "cobalt moss" and "swirling void ceiling" adds +0.6. No cost tied directly to the grotto itself; it enables but does not constrain. Round 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "dreams began bleeding starlight" in opening line. Development: constellations on her skin pulse, matching firefly light; the grotto ceiling is "swirling void of stars." Payoff: "the stars bled brighter" at the mirror touch; her skin afterward is marked "by something deeper." Concept shapes the journey's framing and the transformation's visual signature. Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (bleeding, pulsing, etched) +0.5 = base 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6. However, the concept is ornamental in middle beats (firefly matching pulse is description, not a choice altered by the bleeding). Deduct ornamental use −0.7. Round 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setup: "her voice softly commanding" appears in paragraph 7. Development: no on-page speech or action demonstrates the attribute constraining or enabling a choice. Payoff: absent; the queen does not speak or command at the mirror. Label-only mention; introduced late (second half). Late appearance −0.8, label-only −0.6, missing development gate cap 3.4, missing closure gate cap 2.8 (lowest cap wins). Start 3.0 − 0.8 − 0.6 = 1.6, but apply missing closure cap 2.8. Slight credit for setup presence +0.3. Round 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: scroll warning and queen's resolve to climb appear early. Development: "path to the ridge was treacherous," "air thinned as she ascended," "reached the ember grotto." Payoff: the climb delivers her to the mirror; the transformation occurs there; she "turned toward the mouth of the grotto, where the first hints of dawn were creeping over the ridge," preparing descent. Three gates, three beats, causal pressure (ascent effort, thinning air). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables transformation locale) +1.0, closure linkage (implicit descent) +0.9 = base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0. Irreplaceability moderate (could be "journey"); deduct swappability −0.5. Strong setup/development lifts to 7.4. Round 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: fireflies mentioned in opening ("first fireflies of summer"). Development: single beat—firefly alights on wrist, light pulses with constellations, "shared exhale," darts away. Payoff: "Outside, the fireflies rose higher, their light weaving through the cobalt dark like stitches in the fabric of the night." Lyric seed → final reprise reweights the transformation (stitches = integration). Two gates (setup, payoff); middle beat is observational, not a shared-exhale action that alters tactics. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (reweights night) +1.0, lyric-resonance allowance +0.5 = base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0. Specificity (timing, matching pulse) +0.3. Round 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "cobalt grotto above clouds" named in title context; "grotto yawned before her" mid-story. Development: walls "slick with cobalt moss," air "smelled of ozone," ceiling "swirling void of stars." Payoff: grotto frames mirror encounter and transformation; queen exits at dawn. Three gates, vivid sensory detail. Early signal +0.5 (named before entry), three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, micro-setting (walls, air) +0.4 = base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1. Irreplaceability (cobalt moss unique) +0.4. Setting does not constrain a choice (no blocked path, no resource scarcity); deduct −0.3 for passive frame. Round 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: "not slept in three nights," "final warning had come at dawn." Development: "by the time she reached the ember grotto, the first fireflies of summer were rising" (dusk implied); "first hints of dawn were creeping over the ridge" at end. Payoff: dawn arrival signals passage of night, framing transformation duration. Two gates (setup, payoff). Time tracked loosely (three nights prior, one night climb). Start 3.0 + setup signal +0.4 + two beats +0.9 + payoff linkage +0.6 = 4.9. Time does not tighten a choice; no countdown or narrowed window forces tactics. Deduct ornamental use −0.3. Missing middle-development gate cap 3.4 does not apply (payoff present). Round 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: "dreams began bleeding starlight," "to unravel the mystery" implicit in her resolve. Development: scroll reads "The grotto hungers," prompting climb; mirror woman explains "memories" and "summons." Payoff: touching mirror completes discovery; "dreams had not been warnings. They had been memories." Three gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (mystery answered) +0.8 = base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8. However, motivation is told ("knew better," "invitation") rather than conflicted in on-page choices; no friction between desire and cost. Deduct told-only friction −0.5. Swappability (generic "solve mystery") −0.3. Round 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "cage of silk and shadow," "restless child," "lanterns flickering like dying embers," "scroll sealed in wax the color of old blood" establish eerie elegance. Development: "ozone and something older," "cathedral of light," "liquid silver" sustain ornate menace. Payoff: "grotto trembled," "stars bled brighter," "stitches in the fabric of the night" charge the final image with both beauty and unease. Tone coherent across turns, modulates with pressure (ascent → encounter → transformation). Three gates, strong closure linkage. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.2, specificity (lacy = delicate menace layered) +0.5 = base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8. Minor register drift ("committee voice" in exposition) −0.4. Round 6.1.</comment>
