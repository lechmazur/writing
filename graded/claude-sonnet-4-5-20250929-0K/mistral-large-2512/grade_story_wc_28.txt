<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Liora's interiority is established through her retrocognitive trait and her renaming habit, but the core choice at the ending—placing the lapis tessera where *Amira* had been—arrives without sufficient internal contradiction dramatized in scene. The passage "between the girl who'd burned the world and the woman who was rebuilding it. Between vengeance and mercy" reads as expository summary rather than embodied struggle. The final act of placing the stone feels more symbolic gesture than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost, capping the score in the mid-6 range.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who, where, and when promptly and accumulates pressure through layered backstory and the stepping stone's emergence. The closure—placing the lapis piece where *Amira* had been and choosing to keep the name while reweighting its meaning—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains more asserted ("for the first time in years, she wasn't alone") than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. One meaningful deepening is present; the accumulative design holds, but the felt cost at closure is oblique, limiting entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The plaza, shattered sky, mosaic tesserae, and stepping stone are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Liora's retrocognitive lens. The stepping stone constrains her choice by revealing *Amira*'s name and the negative space, making it causally active. The lantern, lapis edge ("sharp enough to draw blood"), and the chipped patterns all charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and layered, meeting the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether to honor or erase *Amira*'s name, embodying aberrant mercy—is signaled early and tightens when Liora finds the stepping stone. However, the escalation is primarily textural (accumulation of memory and detail) rather than a dramatized choice under pressure that narrows live options. The final placement of the tessera feels more like a symbolic affirmation than a decision that forecloses a path with on-page cost, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through the mosaic metaphor, the practice of renaming, and the tension between past and present. "Aberrant mercy" is dramatized through the stepping stone and the decision to preserve *Amira*'s name with reweighted meaning, avoiding direct thematic statement. The final image—pressing lapis into the empty space—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of forgiveness and rebuilding. However, "she had learned to wield it" and "arms of steel" edge toward thematic echo without full embodiment, and the phrase "warm coldness" appears twice without clear intensification, limiting entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Liora's perceptual signature ("retrocognitively trapped," renaming as spell-casting). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with vivid images ("sky split like broken glass," "tesserae…like fallen stars"). However, several lines drift into elevated register that tensions the embodied present: "aberrant mercy—that was what the old texts called it" and "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" read as thematic summary rather than lived thought under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the register drift in peak beats prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance character or atmosphere, but several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "The past was a weight, but it was also a weapon" immediately followed by "She had learned to wield it"; "She would rename this place again. Not the Plaza of Ashes, not the Ruin of the Fireborn. She would call it the Courtyard of the Unbroken Name" cycles through renaming without adding pressure. "Warm coldness" appears twice without clear cadence shift. Mixed metaphor: "quiet furnace of defiance" (furnaces are loud). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third, triggering the −0.6 to −1.4 range and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The combination of retrocognitive trapping, mosaic repair as political act, and renaming as resistance offers a specific synthesis. However, the core emotional arc—guilt over inaction during the fire, choosing forgiveness—follows a familiar template of witnessing trauma and later seeking redemption through symbolic rebuilding. The piece does not transform this premise through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that would make the choice feel inevitable in hindsight. The final act of placing the tessera reads as expected rather than surprising, and "aberrant mercy" is declared more than discovered, applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail for a −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Liora as "gentle radical" is present throughout, and her choice to place the lapis tessera and preserve *Amira*'s name drives the ending. Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.0), and two beats (finding the stone, placing the tessera, +0.9) elevate the score. However, the choice feels more symbolic affirmation than a decision under pressure that narrows options, and "gentle radical" as a label is not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, limiting causal pressure (+0.5 lower band). Swappability is low; the trait is specific. Final score reflects solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tesserae appear in multiple beats: scattered "like fallen stars," Liora tracing patterns, turning over the stepping stone to reveal *Amira*, picking up the lapis piece, and pressing it into the empty space at the ending. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (lapis color, sharp edge, +0.6), and cost connection (the edge "sharp enough to draw blood," +0.4) all apply. The object is irreplaceable and drives the final image. No major frictions; the element is essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly and the concept shapes Liora's stake (forgiveness that defies vengeance). Early signal (+0.6), present in the ending decision to keep *Amira*'s name (+0.9), and two beats (finding the name, placing the tessera, +0.9) elevate the score. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than a constraint that changes tactics on the page; Liora does not face a live choice between vengeance and mercy in scene, only reflects on it. Label-only use (−0.3) and lack of causal pressure (mid-band) limit the score to the 5–6 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early and filters perception throughout ("She saw the plaza as it had been—alive with merchants…while the present crumbled around her"). Early signal (+0.7), pervasive presence across beats (+1.2), and specificity (+0.5) apply. However, the trait does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it enriches interiority but does not force a tradeoff or alter tactics in the final choice. The ending—placing the tessera—would proceed identically without the retrocognitive lens. No closure linkage beyond thematic coloring (−0.8 for swappability), capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Renaming is present throughout: the Nest of Second Dawn, the Garden of Whispers, and the final "Courtyard of the Unbroken Name." Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), and specificity (names as spells, +0.6) all apply. However, the act of renaming does not drive a major turn; Liora's decision to keep *Amira*'s name while reweighting it is more thematic echo than a choice that narrows options. The action is thematically central but causally secondary to the placement of the tessera. Swappability is moderate (−0.4); the element could be "reinterpreting" with minor edits. Final score reflects strong presence without full causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The stepping stone and its chipped patterns are introduced early ("Tonight, she worked by the glow of a single lantern, her fingers tracing the chipped patterns"), shape the middle beat (revealing *Amira* on the underside), and charge the ending (pressing lapis into the empty space). Early signal (+0.7), two distinct beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (the negative space where tesserae were pried loose, +0.6), and cost connection (the patterns "dug into her skin," +0.4) all apply. The method is irreplaceable; the mechanics of finding the name via the stepping stone and placing the tessera drive the final image. No major frictions; the element is essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" anchors the piece immediately, and the setting supplies resources (the scattered tesserae, the lantern, the stepping stone) and atmosphere ("charred cedar and damp stone," "jagged edges holding back the storm"). Early signal (+0.8), present across all beats (+1.4), closure linkage (the plaza's renaming and the sky imagery in the final paragraph, +1.0), and specificity (the minaret, the ash, +0.6) all apply. The setting constrains Liora's work (kneeling in the ruins, working by lantern) and charges the final image ("the sky still broken"). No major frictions; the element is indispensable to atmosphere and choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"After the great fire" is signaled early and establishes the temporal frame. The timeframe is present in backstory (watching the fire, doing nothing) and the present work of rebuilding. Early signal (+0.7), two beats (backstory, present reconstruction, +0.9), and thematic linkage (+0.5) apply. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Liora works at her own pace with no urgency. The element frames the setting but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Swappability is moderate (−0.4); "after the disaster" would function similarly. Final score reflects functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" appears explicitly in the text and shapes Liora's stance (rebuilding with defiance, choosing mercy over vengeance). Early signal (mid-story, −0.3), closure linkage (the decision to keep *Amira*'s name, +0.9), and thematic presence across beats (+0.7) apply. However, the motivation is more declared than dramatized; Liora does not face a live friction between empathy and hardness in scene. The phrase "arms of steel" reads as metaphor without embodied cost. Label-only use (−0.3) and lack of on-page conflict between wants and costs (mid-band causal pressure) limit the score to the upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Warm coldness" appears twice ("The warm coldness of the night settled over her" near the ending, and the final image of breath curling "like smoke"). The tone is signaled late (−0.4) but charges the closure image with oxymoronic texture that mirrors the piece's theme of holding contradictions. Closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (the paradox of warmth and cold, +0.5), and coherence through the final turn (+0.6) apply. However, the tone is more asserted than modulated across beats; earlier passages do not build the warm/cold contrast, making it feel introduced rather than developed. Late signal and static deployment limit the score to the mid-6 range.</comment>
