<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of repair") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His interior life remains abstract—"metallic whispers promising answers," "understanding why the library had called to him"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final realization ("he was not just a locksmith; he was a bridge") reads as a convenient epiphany rather than one earned through specific struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending gestures at understanding without showing what he sacrifices or what option he now cannot choose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery and pattern). Orientation anchors arrive late: "who" is clear early, but "where" (frozen library's geography) and "when" (the timeframe's pressure) remain vague past 120 words; the hall of mirrors is named but its spatial relation to the workbench and the library's heart is unclear. The closure unit aims for Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding as bridge), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, no visible price paid. The gears "began to turn" and mirrors "flickered," but what Elias loses or what path he forecloses remains off-page. Orientation debt and absent cost on the page lower the score significantly; applying −0.4 for orientation slip and −0.6 for cost absence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frozen library's "ice and glass" and "driftwood nostalgia" scent anchor setting early, and the hall of mirrors supplies a concrete space for the climax. However, spatial choreography is loose: the workbench's location relative to the hall is unclear, and the gears shift from "across his workbench" to "in his pocket" to "on the floor" without clear transitions. The mirrors function more as thematic device than constraint—they show possibilities but do not block or enable a specific choice with cost. The ending image (gears turning, mirrors flickering) charges atmosphere but does not hinge on a setting detail that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair" to mend the gears and understand the broken machine—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the hall of mirrors scene, but escalation is gentle: Elias kneels, arranges gears, listens, and they turn. No on-page reversal narrows his options; the gears' success feels granted rather than fought for. The prophecies and mirrors supply information but do not force a trade-off or visible price. Agency is limited to observation and arrangement; the cost (if any) is conceptual and off-page, not dramatized as a forfeited choice or failed attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—repair as remembering, brokenness as scattered identity—emerges from the gears, mirrors, and clockmaker's fate. The final image ("the rhythm of repair was not just about fixing things—it was about remembering") edges toward thesis statement rather than letting image speak. The hall of mirrors and the gears recur with shifting meaning, which lifts thematic resonance, but the ending explains rather than enacts. The piece invites reflection on time and fragmentation, yet the conceptual cost (what remembering demands of Elias) remains abstract. Strong atmosphere and motif work; thematic clarity hurt by late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright," "metallic whispers"). Diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("the rhythm of repair," "bridge between what had been and what could be") that flattens immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular—Elias notices in generalized poetic terms rather than locksmith-specific idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue to judge. The prose serves atmosphere well but lacks the specificity that would anchor voice in Elias's unique lens under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose maintains momentum through the hall of mirrors sequence. However, recurrent phrases and template cadence appear: "Elias had…" openers repeat across paragraphs, and "The gears…" "The mirrors…" "The prophecies…" create a formulaic pattern. Stock metaphors ("metallic whispers," "captured sunlight," "hauntingly bright") cluster without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences do atmospheric work without advancing causality. No major loops or clarity breaks, but pervasive decorative language and minor scaffold (e.g., "He understood now," "Elias realized now") dull line-level propulsion. Applying −0.6 for template cadence and stock metaphor spread; −0.2 for scaffold stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds and the hall of mirrors as meta-device are familiar genre furniture; the lunar-eclipse locksmith title adds flavor without altering function. The twist—clockmaker's consciousness scattered across gears—echoes well-worn "object contains soul" tropes without transformation through specific world logic or character calculus. Emotional territory (learning to repair, facing fear of self-knowledge) is archetypal. Atmospheric execution is competent, but no fresh synthesis or bold structural risk distinguishes the piece from similar fantastical introspection tales. The ending's insight (repair = remembering) is earned by prior imagery but not surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias ("lunar-eclipse locksmith") is named early and present throughout. His choice to enter the hall of mirrors after years of avoidance is the story's hinge, and his final realization that he is "a bridge" concludes the arc. However, his decisions feel reactive—he finds gears, enters the hall, arranges them—without on-page tactical shifts or visible cost tied to his role as locksmith. The "lunar-eclipse" modifier remains ornamental; it never constrains or enables an action. Present in setup, middle, and ending (all three gates), but causal pressure is weak. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 ending presence, −0.5 swappability (could be "twilight locksmith" or "shadow-bound smith" with no plot change), −0.4 ornamental title.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gear assortment is introduced early ("scattered across his workbench"), reappears in his pocket in the hall, and is arranged on the floor in the climax. It drives two distinct beats: discovery/motivation and the ending arrangement. The gears' "hauntingly bright" surfaces and worn teeth are described, and their turning concludes the story. However, the gears do not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—they cooperate once Elias listens. Setup present, middle carried in pocket, ending active (all gates). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 ending active, +0.5 causal link (they are the puzzle), −0.6 no cost tied to their use, −0.8 their success feels granted rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors is named early, avoided for years, and becomes the setting for the entire climax. It supplies the "thousand versions" that guide Elias and reveal the clockmaker's fate. The mirrors shape stakes (fear of self-knowledge) and the final image (reflections shifting to show world's past/future). Setup clear, middle avoidance dramatized, ending central (all gates). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats (avoidance choice, then entry and use), +1.4 ending shapes closure, +0.8 causal pressure (entering is the story's hinge), +0.5 specificity (mirrors show possibilities, not mere reflection), −0.5 no visible cost tied to mirror use (they aid rather than test), −0.8 the mechanism (why they help) is asserted not earned.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" is applied to the gears twice ("hauntingly bright in the dim light," "hauntingly bright surfaces catching the light"). It functions as atmospheric description without constraining or enabling action—the brightness does not guide a choice, impose a cost, or prevent an error. Setup present (attached to gears early), no middle development, ending mentioned (gates: setup + payoff only, cap 6.0 per guidance). Applying +0.3 setup, +0.3 ending cameo, −0.8 ornamental (could be "eerily bright" or "strangely luminous" with no change), −0.5 label-only trait. Fits 3.0–4.9 band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Uncap" (a vial of oil) appears once in the middle section. The oil is described ("golden liquid shimmering like captured sunlight") but Elias immediately notes "The gears needed more than just oil"—the action is dismissed within two lines and does not return. No major turn traces to uncapping; the gears' repair depends on rhythm and mirrors, not oil. Setup absent (action occurs mid-story), no development, no ending presence (gates: none met clearly; closest is fleeting middle, cap 3.4 for missing development). Applying +0.4 one beat (the uncapping moment), −0.8 swappable (could be "polish" or "examine" with identical plot), −1.0 resolves nothing, dismissed immediately. Introduced past 40% mark: cap 4.6 per late-arrival rule.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" is the method by which Elias learns the gears' purpose and the machine's history. The prophecies are mentioned early ("buried beneath scraps of prophecy"), reappear in reflection ("Through scraps of prophecy… he had learned"), and their content (rhythm, pattern) guides his final listening. Setup present, middle referenced, ending knowledge used (all gates). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (learning moment), +0.5 ending knowledge applied, +0.6 causal link (prophecies supply the "rhythm" key), −0.6 mechanics remain vague (what did they say? how did he decode them?), −0.5 summary-only (never see him reading or interpreting on the page).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "frozen library above the clouds" is named in the opening line and supplies atmosphere throughout. The library's labyrinth structure and the hall of mirrors at its heart provide the quest geography. However, the setting does not pressure choices—Elias wanders freely, and the library's "ice and glass" and "mist" are decorative rather than obstacles. No resource constraint (cold, access, time) alters tactics. Setup strong, middle present as backdrop, ending location for climax (all gates). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (ongoing locale), +0.5 ending setting, +0.4 specificity (above clouds, frozen), −0.7 postcard description (does not constrain), −0.6 could be "ancient tower" or "sunken vault" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears once in the opening paragraph to mark when Elias arrived. The timeframe does not return, does not tighten decisions, and does not track—"years" of wandering are mentioned, but the story's present action unfolds in an untracked span. No clock pressure, no dawn/dusk shift to alter stakes. Setup present (opening mention), no middle development, no ending presence (gates: setup only, cap 4.6). Applying +0.3 setup mention, −0.8 vague and untracked (could be "twilight" or "evening" with no change), −1.0 does not shape tactics or create urgency, −0.5 ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to learn the rhythm of repair, to understand how things broken could be made whole again" is stated early and recurs at the ending ("The rhythm of repair was not just about fixing things—it was about remembering"). The desire drives his choice to enter the hall and arrange the gears. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants—no friction between repair and risk, no visible cost tied to his learning. Setup clear, middle implicit in his actions, ending restated (all gates). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (entering hall), +0.5 ending restatement, +0.5 causal link (drives plot), −0.7 told-only without on-page conflict between wants and costs, −0.4 summary phrasing ("to learn," "to understand") rather than embodied choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" is named in the opening line ("a place of driftwood nostalgia, where the air smelled of old parchment and the faintest hint of frost") and coheres with the frozen library, the old clockmaker's vanished past, and Elias's backward-looking quest. The tone is consistent—lyric, elegiac, reflective—but does not modulate with pressure; the climax maintains the same wistful register rather than tightening or breaking. Setup strong (opening anchor), middle sustained, ending matches initial mood (all gates). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 coherent across beats, +0.3 ending coherence, −0.6 static (no cadence shift under pressure), −0.5 does not charge the final image with tonal irony or transformation.</comment>
