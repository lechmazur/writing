<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness and methodical approach are established, but her character work relies heavily on assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The interiority uses some stock phrasing ("her pulse quickened," "her stomach twisted") without distinct perceptual texture. The final choice to draw the lance into Liora's portrait feels more thematic than earned by prior on-page struggle; we see method, not genuine internal conflict that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately. The closure—Elara completing Liora's portrait and making her "whole"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a dramatized trade-off. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final image), yet the figure's revelations arrive conveniently without prior setup, weakening causal linkage. The ending reweights Liora's story, but the sibling's late entrance and the lance's sudden importance feel planted rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry's mist and jagged walls establish atmosphere effectively, and the ribbon fragment is handled twice (discovery, then traced while the figure speaks). Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains a backdrop. The lance buried "under the rocks where the police never looked" gestures toward environmental pressure but is told, not shown as a spatial or tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening empathy for Liora—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: the figure arrives, reveals information, and Elara accepts the lance without a meaningful decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The mist thickens and the sibling departs, but these are atmospheric shifts, not pressure points driven by Elara's agency. The resolution ("finally whole") asserts completion without dramatizing a trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of seeing versus being seen, empathy versus forgetting, emerges from the setup and is reinforced by Elara's face-blindness and the figure's plea. The final image—adding the lance to the sketch—attempts a resonant answer, unifying beauty and violence. However, "Not just as a victim. As a person" edges toward explicit moralizing, and the thematic turn is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars that force Elara to confront a cost or contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (fogging spectacles, fingers as memory) offers some specificity. Dialogue is functional and carries subtext in the figure's compressed revelations. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("the mist curling around their boots like smoke," "the weapon's curve became part of Liora's story") that feels writerly rather than character-particular. Under peak stress, the voice remains uniform rather than compressing or fragmenting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, and most lines advance atmosphere or plot. However, several stock constructions appear: "her pulse quickened," "her stomach twisted," "the figure stepped closer," recycled stems ("She had been," "She had drawn," "She was already"). Figurative density is high without always earning its keep ("the mist swallowing their silhouette," "shadows stretched long"). The final paragraph leans into abstraction ("dark line against the light of her remembered smile") rather than concrete propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence and filter-verb reliance dull immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The combination of face-blindness, portrait art, and cold-case investigation offers a fresh synthesis, and the masquerade/lance pairing attempts to unify opposites. However, the empathy-awakening theme and the artist-as-witness frame are familiar territory, and the execution does not transform them through surprising particulars or a non-obvious moral calculus. The figure's late arrival and the lance's convenient burial feel like prompt-service rather than organic risk-taking. The transformation test is middling: swap names and the arc reads generically.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness is mentioned early and her portrait work frames the closure, but her choices do not pivot on this trait. She picks up the ribbon, listens, and accepts the lance without a decision constrained by her prosopagnosia. The attribute colors her method but does not force a trade-off or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in two beats (discovery, tracing) and connects to the masquerade and Liora's disappearance. It seeds the mystery and returns in Elara's hand during the figure's revelation, reweighting the gala's frivolity. However, it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the lance eclipses it at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The cold-case frame is established early ("a crime scene, one the police had abandoned years ago") and shapes the dominant stake. The misplaced evidence box and six-year gap create narrative space. The concept informs tactics (Elara's methodical file review, the figure's buried lance) and the closure goal (making Liora whole). It does not, however, force a live tightening or impose a felt cost on Elara's final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elara's methodical nature is asserted ("her methodical mind dissecting every detail," "drawn her a hundred times") but not dramatized as a constraint or enabler with on-page cost. It colors her approach but does not create friction, force a mistake, or shape the closure choice. The trait is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lance appears late (past midpoint), introduced by the figure as buried evidence. Elara adds it to her sketch in the final paragraph, attempting to unify opposites. However, the lance does not drive a prior turn or constrain a middle choice; it arrives to be accepted and integrated without resistance. The element participates in closure but does not redefine options or impose dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is signaled thematically ("A party of frivolity, a weapon of brutality") and enacted in the final image (lance curve against Liora's smile). The method is named and illustrated, but it does not shape prior attempts or force Elara to navigate a tactical trade-off. The unification is an endpoint assertion rather than a process under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The quarry in mist is established early and sustained throughout. The jagged walls, fog, and rocks supply atmosphere and anchor the ribbon and lance discoveries. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or alter Elara's tactics; it functions as mood rather than obstacle or resource. The mist thickens at closure, charging the final image modestly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the evidence box was misplaced," "six years ago") is mentioned but not tracked as a live clock. The "after" condition creates narrative space but does not tighten decisions or impose urgency. Time is backdrop, not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to awaken empathy is stated ("The cold case wasn't just about justice. It was about empathy") and the figure's plea ("For her to be seen… As a person") reinforces it. The motivation shapes the closure goal, but it is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. Elara's acceptance of the task feels frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone—quiet, subdued, shadowed—is consistent and modulates subtly (mist thickening, figure's dark gaze). "Furrowed hush" is evoked through diction ("whisper," "swallowing," "stretched long") and the quarry's stillness. The tone charges the final image as Elara draws in silence, though it does not sharpen under peak pressure or create friction with the content.</comment>
