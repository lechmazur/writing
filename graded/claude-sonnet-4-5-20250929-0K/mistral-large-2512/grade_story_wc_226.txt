<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Lira's defiance is established early and drives her choice to engage with Echo and pursue the poetry ritual, but her motivations remain largely abstract—"warnings were just another color on her palette" gestures toward personality without embodying a contradictory impulse acting in scene. The shift from needing to "break something first" to speaking poetry feels unmotivated; no on-page friction forces the change. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("alive" as the payoff emotion) and the final renunciation ("The ritual could wait") lacks visible cost or foreclosed path scaled to the established pressure. Echo's "innocently mischievous" trait is label-only and does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation debt is present: "who" (Lira) is named early, but "where" (the towers' geography relative to the pale spire) and "when" (how imminent is the ritual?) remain vague past the 120-word mark, and the effect does not pay off at closure—apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test and cap Q3 at 7.0. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density via poetic recursion and mist imagery), but the closure unit is weak: the final beat ("The ritual could wait. She had a truth to shatter first.") asserts a stance without showing cost or a decisive change on the page, reading more as postponement than Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. The spire's reveal (etched with Lira's words) is a conceptual turn, but it arrives via summary ("For the first time, Lira saw") rather than dramatized discovery that alters her options in the moment. No meaningful tightening occurs—pressure remains static across beats, and Echo's appearance complicates without escalating.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Cap applied at 7.0 per Orientation Test in Q2. Sensory detail is vivid (mist curling, bone shard pulsing, towers groaning) but largely ornamental—no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image. The pale spire's surface reveal is summary-told rather than explored through action. Spatial choreography is vague: the clearing's relation to the Bone Towers and the spire remains unclear, and Echo's movements are not tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Lira's need to "refract a single truth into many" before the ritual—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page cost. No meaningful tightening occurs: Echo's arrival offers enablement without complication, the poetry beats repeat without escalation (blade/whetstone, pale spire, canyon—each receives applause but no consequence), and the final choice ("The ritual could wait") defers rather than forecloses a path. Agency is present in Lira's decision to speak, but the cost is conceptual only ("courage to speak") and not dramatized as a trade-off that alters later tactics. Coincidence (Echo's timely appearance and the spire's convenient revelation) complicates without forcing harder choices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The theme—forgiveness as requiring speech rather than silence—emerges from Lira's poetic acts and the spire reveal, but the ending summarizes the insight ("The price of forgiveness wasn't silence. It was this: the courage to speak") rather than embodying it in a non-literal final image. The "refract truth" premise is echoed in dialogue and narration without shaping a thematic question that the closure answers through particulars. Recurrent motifs (mist, echoes, bone) are ornamental rather than accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The final line ("She had a truth to shatter first") gestures toward thematic resonance but reads as deferral, not synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira with controlled distance. Diction is elevated and consistent ("perpetual haze," "hollow ache," "chorus of ghosts") but leans into purple prose at peak beats—"forging truth" and "alive" as the climactic feeling are generic rather than character-particular. Dialogue pursues goals (Echo's prodding, Lira's resistance) but lacks subtext; lines like "Friends don't judge either, but you're about to" and "You're not refracting truth. You're forging it" are on-the-nose thematic declarations. Perceptual signature is present (Lira notices the bone towers' ivory curves, the spire's etchings) but does not modulate under pressure—her internal voice remains uniformly literary throughout. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") are acceptable but cluster in reflective beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Line-level clarity is generally high, but overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the first third uses metaphor or elevated diction ("swallowed sound whole, then spat it back," "warnings were just another color on her palette," "weight of unspoken apologies"), flattening rhythm and dulling immediacy—apply −0.5 for density without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in the poetry beats ("Forgiveness is a blade... sharpened on the whetstone of silence" / "how it stood unyielding, a monument to what was never said")—each follows the same declarative structure without variation, triggering −0.4. Stock metaphors ("blade," "whetstone," "monument") and therapy-speak ("alive" as payoff emotion, "courage to speak") in peak beats add −0.3. No paraphrase loops, and grammar is clean. Total artifact deduction: −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The core synthesis—poetry as ritual preparation in a setting of echoing bone towers before a ceremony—is atmospheric but derivative: the poet-speaker-in-mystical-landscape template is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The spire etched with Lira's words is a clever turn, but it arrives via summary and lacks groundwork in earlier beats (no prior mention of her writing or the spire's interactive properties). Echo's function as enabler-guide is stock, and the "courage to speak" resolution is a familiar thematic beat. Tone and imagery cohere, but the emotional arc (defiance → enablement → insight → deferral) follows a predictable path. No bold risk heightens stakes; the final choice postpones rather than confronts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Lira is present throughout and her defiance drives the choice to engage Echo and speak poetry, shaping two beats (initial refusal, then commitment to the impromptu session). Her final stance ("The ritual could wait") is a decision but lacks visible cost—she defers rather than forecloses a path. Setup is early, development is functional (middle poetry beats), but closure participation is weak: the choice does not transform prior material or crystallize under pressure. Swappable with a "rebellious seeker" archetype with minor edits. Two-gate fulfillment (setup + development) caps eligibility near 6.0; additive: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (weak) +0.3, closure linkage (present but weak) +0.4. Subtractive: swappability −0.4, ornamental trait label −0.3. Band guidance and limiter yield 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>The pale spire appears in the opening paragraph (setup) and returns in the final third when Lira sees its etched surface (closure participation), but it is not handled or used in between—middle development is absent, capping at 3.4 per the gate rule. The reveal reweights the stakes conceptually (her words are already inscribed), but this payoff is summary-told and does not constrain a present choice. Additive: early signal +0.6, closure linkage (reweights meaning) +1.0, lyric reprise (first paragraph → ending) +0.5. Subtractive: missing middle development gate cap at 3.4, ornamental first mention (description without action) −0.6, summary-only payoff −0.5. Lyric-resonance allowance permits 5.5–6.3 when the return reweights the stake; here the reveal lacks dramatized cost, placing it at the lower end. Final: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Forgiveness is mentioned explicitly in two narration beats ("This was the price of forgiveness" and "The price of forgiveness wasn't silence") and implicitly in the theme of speaking versus silence, but it does not shape on-page choices or tactics—Lira's poetry is framed as truth-refracting, not forgiveness-seeking, and the ritual's nature (penance? reconciliation?) is never clarified. Setup is present (first paragraph), middle development is absent (no choice or constraint tied to forgiveness), and closure participation is thematic assertion only. Additive: early signal +0.5, closure linkage (theme) +0.4. Subtractive: missing middle gate cap at 3.4, ornamental/thematic mention −0.5, swappable with "truth" or "authenticity" −0.6, no cost tied to forgiveness −0.5. Lyric allowance does not apply; the concept does not reweight prior material. Final: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>Echo is described as having "eyes that gleamed innocently mischievous" and grins frequently, but the trait is label-only and does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Setup is present (Echo's introduction), middle development shows Echo prodding Lira to continue the poetry session (functional presence), but no trade-off or consequence arises from the mischief—Echo could be replaced with a "supportive stranger" archetype. Additive: early signal +0.4, one beat (prodding) +0.4. Subtractive: label-only −0.5, swappability −0.6, no cost −0.4. Gate: setup + development permits up to 6.0, but weak causal role and ornamental treatment lower the band. Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Refraction is signaled early (Lira's stated goal: "to refract a single truth into many"), drives the poetry beats in the middle (each line refracts into "new shapes" via the echoes), and returns at closure when Echo declares "You're forging it" and the spire reveal shows her words multiplied. All three gates are met. However, the mechanics of refraction remain vague—no on-page demonstration of how the echoes constrain or enable tactics beyond atmospheric effect—and the action is easily swappable with "transform" or "amplify." Additive: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8. Subtractive: swappability −0.6, mechanics unclear −0.4, summary payoff −0.3. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Impromptu poetry is signaled when Echo announces "Poetry is the only way to refract truth here" (early second third), structures the middle beats (three distinct poetry attempts with escalating effects: blade/whetstone, pale spire, canyon), and the method's culmination ("You're forging it") charges the final reveal. All three gates are met. The method is specific and irreplaceable—removing poetry would break the story's escalation logic. Additive: early signal (late but functional) +0.4, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (shapes attempts) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Subtractive: late first appearance (second third) −0.3, mechanics (how poetry refracts) remain abstract −0.4. Final: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and canyon of echoes are present throughout (setup in opening, middle beats show towers groaning and amplifying Lira's words, closure beat mentions the towers shuddering and the mist parting), meeting all three gates. The setting enables the poetry's refraction (echoes multiply words), but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Lira's tactics remain unchanged by spatial features. Additive: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate enablement) +0.6, closure linkage (towers shudder) +0.5. Subtractive: postcard description in opening −0.4, spatial choreography vague (clearing's relation to towers unclear) −0.5, no choice constrained −0.6. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>The ritual is mentioned five times ("before the ritual," "not before the ritual," "The elders had demanded she prepare," "The ritual loomed," "The ritual could wait") but the timeframe never tightens decisions or alters tactics—no clock narrows options, and Lira's final choice defers the ritual without cost. Setup is present (title and opening beats), middle development shows the ritual as backdrop pressure (functional but vague), closure participation is the deferral decision. Two gates met, capping eligibility near 6.0. Additive: early signal +0.5, closure linkage (deferral) +0.4. Subtractive: vague/untracked time (no sense of how imminent the ritual is) −0.7, no tactic altered by clock −0.6, swappable with "before the ceremony" −0.4. Final: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Lira's desire to refract truth is stated explicitly in the opening ("to refract a single truth into many, to shatter the silence") and drives her engagement with Echo and the poetry session, meeting setup and development gates. Closure participation is weak: the final choice ("She had a truth to shatter first") restates the motivation without dramatizing friction between want and cost. Additive: early signal +0.7, two beats (engagement with Echo, poetry session) +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.6, closure linkage (restatement) +0.4. Subtractive: told-only in opening −0.4, no friction between want and fear −0.6, deferral rather than cost −0.5. Final: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Forged hush" as tone is implied by the setting (mist, silence, echoes) and Lira's defiance breaking it, present from the opening through the closure image where she chooses to "shatter" rather than maintain silence. Setup is early (opening paragraphs establish hush), development shows the tone modulating as Lira's voice grows louder (towers groan, mist thickens), and closure participates (hush is broken, "alive" emotion). All three gates met. However, the tone does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure—the ending reads as deferral, not crystallization. Additive: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, modulation under pressure +0.5. Subtractive: static mood in middle beats (repetitive atmospheric description) −0.5, final image lacks pressure −0.6, generic "alive" payoff −0.4. Final: 5.4.</comment>
