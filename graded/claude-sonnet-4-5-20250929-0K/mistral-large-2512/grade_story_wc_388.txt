<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "excavate truth" is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The stranger's pivot from potential antagonist to ally feels unmotivated—no prior causality establishes why they'd help now. Interior states rely on labels ("adrenaline," "pulse quickened") rather than embodied perception. The final choice to accept the diamond lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; Elias simply receives confirmation of what he already suspected.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The closure unit—Elias viewing truth through the diamond—lands on the page but the cost remains conceptual only; no visible price (relational, tactical, or opportunity) is paid in the final image. The stranger's appearance and instant alliance breaks motivated linkage; their earlier shredding of letters "to be reassembled" contradicts their role as silencer. One meaningful tightening occurs (letters → stillpoint → diamond) but the final beat delivers confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vivid and specific: "spongy soil," "blackened bark," "leaves shimmering with eerie light." The respirator and radioactive dust establish immediate constraints. The hollow tree and clearing at the center participate in plot turns. The diamond functions as lens/tool and charges the final image by revealing the orchard's healing nature, satisfying the micro-setting gate for high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the stillpoint and its suppressed truth—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the liquidation was a cover-up. However, escalation lacks agency-driven cost: the stranger arrives and offers help, the diamond is handed over, and the revelation is delivered without trade-off. The final image reweights knowledge but does not narrow options or exact a visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—buried truth versus institutional lies—emerges from concrete beats (shredded letters, liquidation, orchard thriving). The diamond as "lens" rather than cursed object reweights the premise. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "the government had tried to bury that knowledge forever" tells rather than charges the image. The stillpoint concept remains abstract; no particular cost or complication makes the truth morally ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("sickly moonlight," "confetti"). The stranger's dialogue carries some subtext ("I came to see if you'd *understand*") but pivots too cleanly to exposition. Elias's perceptual signature—sharply observant—is asserted in the prompt but doesn't consistently filter sensory selection; the orchard description reads generic rather than filtered through his investigative lens. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he realized") appear but don't dull immediacy significantly at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and opening. Some strong images ("nest of torn paper lay scattered like confetti"). Paraphrase loop appears: "The diamond wasn't cursed—it was a tool" followed by "It's not cursed... It's a lens" restates the same idea. Template cadence in early paragraphs: "He crouched... Elias exhaled... Hours passed as he pieced..." Minor clarity issue: "his body tensing" in high-pressure moment could be more specific. Information density is adequate; no major scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—conspiracy debunker in radioactive orchard discovers suppressed ecological healing—combines familiar elements (wasteland, cover-up, cursed object) without fresh synthesis. The "flawed diamond as lens" twist is clever but arrives late and resolves too neatly. Emotional arc is linear: Elias suspects, investigates, confirms. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the stranger's instant alliance deflates tension. Transformation test: swap names and setting, emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and his "debunker" role frames the investigation, satisfying setup and development gates. However, his key choices—piecing letters, accepting the stranger's help, holding up the diamond—are reactive rather than driving turns. The stranger delivers the diamond and the revelation; Elias observes. Eligible mid-band for presence across beats but lacks causal pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Diamond is mentioned early (setup), reappears when the stranger hands it over (development), and functions in the final image as lens revealing truth (payoff). All three gates present. It shifts from "cursed" to "key" to "lens," reweighting meaning. However, Elias does not seek or struggle for it; it is given freely. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift the score, but lack of cost tied to its acquisition caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stillpoint is named in the letters, sought, and reached at the orchard's center, satisfying setup and development. It appears in the closure image as the clearing of untouched earth. However, it functions as backdrop rather than active constraint; discovery does not alter tactics or impose cost. The concept shapes stakes thematically but remains abstract. Functional but replaceable with any "hidden zone."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is asserted in the text ("his own sharply observant instincts") and shown when Elias notices the precise tears in the letters and intuits reassembly. This enables the first plot turn. However, the trait does not constrain a later choice or impose cost; observation leads to confirmation without trade-off. Present in one key beat but does not recur or shape closure. Label-mention deduction applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears when Elias pieces together letter fragments and "began to intuit the patterns." This drives the mid-story turn (discovery of stillpoint and diamond's purpose). Setup and development gates met. However, the method could be swapped for "deduce" or "decode" without structural change. Not indispensable; close synonym would function identically. Mid-band for driving one beat without unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Shredded letters appear early in the hollow tree (setup), Elias spends hours reassembling them (development), and their content ("stillpoint," "diamond as key") shapes his knowledge at closure (payoff). All three gates met. The method is specific and drives the investigative turn. However, once reassembled, letters drop from view; no later beat revisits or reweights them. Strong early-middle integration but no closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wasteland orchard is present from the opening line, frames every beat, and the final revelation—orchard is healing, not toxic—reweights the entire premise. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The setting supplies the central mystery and the closure image. Radioactive dust and thriving trees create immediate contradiction that drives investigation. Removing the orchard would collapse story logic. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" anchors the investigation's motive (setup) and explains why the land was seized. However, timeframe does not constrain tactics or create urgency; no countdown or time-pressure appears. The story could occur at any point post-liquidation without changing choices. Functional for backstory framing but does not shape on-page decisions. Missing development and closure participation; caps apply.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated in the opening and drives his presence in the orchard. Setup gate met. The motivation sustains his investigation and letter-reassembly. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; no moment shows him weighing personal risk against the truth. Functional across beats but lacks friction or visible price. Mid-band for presence without embodied conflict.</comment>
