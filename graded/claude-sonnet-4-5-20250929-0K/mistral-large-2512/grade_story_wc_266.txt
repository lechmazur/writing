<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is shadowed by abstractions ("unused courage waits," "something inside her had cracked") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ticket-punch action feels symbolic rather than a micro-choice under pressure. Elias remains wise-guide flat, his motivations unexamined. The final step forward reads as gesture without visible cost foreclosing a concrete path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elias, Veiled Ridgeway, ferry). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: violet glow, star stamp, lanterns build toward the final step. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("she didn't feel like a passenger"), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt—no on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off. The backstory block (~20%) primes the present but doesn't tilt a concrete choice. One meaningful deepening (cove arrival) tightens atmosphere without narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Veiled Ridgeway, reeds, cove lanterns, and wet sand ground spatial choreography cleanly. The ticket punch recurs with evolving charge (worn edges, glowing faintly, pressed against air). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("damp earth and salt," "boots sinking"). The star stamp's glow at closure charges the final image, lifting the category into mid-7s despite minimal occupational depth for the ferryman role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find where unused courage waits") is signaled but remains abstract; no concrete live option is foreclosed. The cove arrival deepens atmosphere but doesn't narrow tactical choices. Mira's pressing the punch into air and stepping forward feel gestural rather than agency with visible cost. Escalation reads as atmospheric intensification (twilight → lanterns → stars) under the Accumulative lens, sufficient for mid-6s but lacks the trade-off or felt price for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (courage as traverse, not permission) emerges through particulars: the broken leash, the indirect routes, pressing the stamp into air. "Because it's where we see ourselves clearly" borders on platitude but stays grounded in the dark/lantern imagery. The final step offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "unused courage waits" and "the journey had only just begun" edge toward thematic echo, diluting full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is steady (Mira's focus on the punch, violet glow, shoreline sounds). Dialogue carries subtext ("You're not running from something" / "Then you're running *toward* it"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the cove. Free indirect style is clean. Elias and Mira carry distinct idiom in speech. Minor: "her courage locked away in the monotony of routines" slips toward telling, but overall voice is controlled and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts create visual cadence. Information density is high in the cove sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sharp against the fading sky" / "last sliver of sun disappeared" / "only a violet glow" restates twilight three times in quick succession. "The vigil in twilight had begun" / "The vigil in twilight was over" is a deliberate bookend but borders on template repetition. One filter-verb stack ("watched," "realized," "exhaled") in mid-beat. Stock metaphor: "stars burned brighter...as if welcoming her." Cumulative line-level debt −0.6 within Q7; no clarity break at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ferryman-guide and ticket-punch motifs are familiar; the transformation is modest. The indirect-routes concept and the punch pressed into air offer fresh inflection. Emotional specificity (Mira's broken leash, years waiting for permission) lifts above template. The cove with hooded figures and glowing stamp is vivid but not conceptually startling. Risk-taking is mild; the piece commits to its lyric mode without bold structural gambit. Mid-6s for competent synthesis with one or two fresh touches.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias appears early, steers through the inlet, hums, adjusts course at rocks, and delivers wisdom ("where we see ourselves clearly"). He observes and advises but does not make a choice that creates a key turn; Mira's actions drive the closure. Present across beats but functionally guide-as-backdrop. Swappable with any wise mentor archetype. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ticket punch with star stamp: introduced early ("edges worn smooth"), handled mid-beat ("glinted," "glowing faintly"), pressed into air at closure ("left no mark, but something inside her shifted"). Three beats, charged reprise at ending. The pressing gesture enables internal change but is not causally necessary—removal would soften but not break the arc. Solid 6.7: shapes the ending and recurs with reweighted meaning, but lacks irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"A vigil in twilight" is signaled early ("The vigil in twilight had begun"), tracks Mira's waiting posture through dusk, and bookends ("The vigil in twilight was over"). It frames tone and pacing but does not constrain a tactical choice or narrow options. Thematic presence without causal teeth. Mid-5s: purposeful echo that reweights mood but remains swappable with "waiting" or "passage."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" applied to Elias's humming ("his voice gently persistent, coaxing the ferry forward"). Label-only; the trait does not visibly enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. The humming occurs but is ornamental. Present once, mid-story, no closure participation. Low-5s: functional mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Traverse" is seeded early (Ridgeway crossing), thematized ("courage...was something you *traversed*"), and enacted at closure (Mira steps onto shore, takes steps forward). The action structures the entire arc: boarding → crossing → arrival → stepping into the unknown. Two major turns trace to it (inlet passage, cove landing). Removal would collapse the narrative spine. Solid 7.2: essential across beats and ending, with thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled mid-story ("Most take the straight path...But the best things hide in the bends"), enacted once (narrow inlet detour), and implied at closure (the cove as unexpected destination). The indirection enables the cove discovery but is not mechanically detailed or tested under pressure. Two gates (middle, ending), modest causal role. Exactly 6.0: shapes one key turn and primes closure without deeper integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Veiled Ridgeway: introduced early, central throughout (ferry, reeds, rocks, cove), and present at closure ("stretching behind her like a promise"). The narrow inlet and rock scrape alter tactics; the cove lanterns charge the ending. Setting supplies spatial constraints and atmospheric pressure. Strong three-gate presence, solid causal role. High-6s: essential across beats but not utterly indispensable—another liminal waterway could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" is backstory context ("The leash had broken years ago"), not a live timeframe pressure. No ticking clock; the twilight passage is durational but untimed. The "after" frames motivation but does not tighten present decisions. Setup only, no middle or closure participation. Low-4s: functional backstory anchor without present tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits": stated early, thematized mid-beat ("courage...was something you *traversed*"), and gestured at closure ("unused courage waited. And she would find it"). Desire is told more than dramatized; Mira's internal friction is thin. The motivation frames the journey but does not force a concrete trade-off on the page. Three gates, modest friction. High-5s: purposeful throughout but lacks embodied conflict between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" seeded early ("water lapped at the hull like a shoreline lullaby, soft and rhythmic"), sustained through Elias's humming and the "soft, murmuring" chorus, and contrasted at closure ("stars burned brighter"). Tone modulates from lulling calm to charged stillness, supporting the vigil-to-action shift. Coherent across turns, charges the final image. Solid 7.4: tone work is strong and integral, shaping atmosphere and closure without being mechanically indispensable.</comment>
