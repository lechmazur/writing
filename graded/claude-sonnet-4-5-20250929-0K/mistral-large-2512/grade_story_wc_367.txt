<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is stated clearly but her choices feel more observational than agonistic—she adjusts the lantern, witnesses visions, and laughs, but no visible cost or difficult trade-off is dramatized on the page. The backstory about newspapers exceeds the BRR default (~25% of the text) yet does not anchor a present micro-choice that alters tactics. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("breath caught," "promise of storms to come") and the final gesture—stepping into light—is declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear (who, where, when established early). The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the vision sequence and the final image reweights the premise. However, the closure unit—Veyra's decision to "step into the light"—is asserted in future tense without a visible, felt cost paid on the page; the vision's emergence feels passive, and no prior constraint is dramatized as foreclosed by this choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern, and wick are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (salt-laced dark, total internal reflection, starlight). The lantern's mechanics constrain Veyra's method across multiple beats (adjusting angle, pressing palm, bending light). The final image—lighthouse pulsing, city waiting—charges the closure by grounding the abstract promise in the established setting, satisfying the 9+ gate condition for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (shaping a new dawn via the lighthouse) is signaled early but escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin: Veyra adjusts the lantern and the vision clarifies without resistance, reversal, or visible cost. The woman's "We are ready" line is received without friction or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page, and the final decision to "step into the light" is projected rather than executed with a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—bridging old and new through light and shadow—emerges from concrete images (lighthouse, ink-stained fingers, unborn city) rather than statement. The recurring motif of shadows and starlight accumulates meaning and charges the final image. However, the ending declares "dreams were the first drafts of dawn" and "Veyra…was its architect," which tilts toward abstract summary rather than letting the image carry the weight without overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (laughing herald, light-as-loom metaphor). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent. Minor slips: "not quite memories, not quite dreams" and "caught the edges of what might be" edge toward stock phrasing, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("architect," "promise") slightly exceeds the established texture without obvious voice motivation, though the effect remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong imagery (blade of bottled lightning, roots into the dark). Minor artifacts include paraphrase loops ("not quite memories, not quite dreams" / "dreams were the first drafts of dawn"), a template opening stem ("Once, she had been…"), and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("knew better than," "had learned long ago"). These do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats, applying a −0.6 deduction within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-loom and total-internal-reflection mechanics offer a fresh synthesis of optics and prophecy. However, the core arc—visionary sees future city, decides to enter it—follows a recognizable template (herald answers the call) without transformation through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's declaration of readiness and stepping into light reads as a median choice that avoids bold risk, keeping the piece in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>
