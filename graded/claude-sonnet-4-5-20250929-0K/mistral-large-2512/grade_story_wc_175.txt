<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is poetic but often abstracts emotional states ("blushing stillness of the moment") rather than embodying them through concrete sensation. Her esoteric realist stance is declared more than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure. The story anchors her motivation to honor monarchs, yet she remains observational; her building of signals feels ritualistic rather than driven by internal conflict with visible trade-offs. No clear renunciation or cost forecloses a path—she simply packs and leaves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression, building density through the grotto setting and monarch arrival. Orientation anchors (grotto above clouds, Liora's solitary presence) arrive early. However, closure lacks on-page cost: Liora's departure and the fallen stones are asserted in summary ("The stones would fall") rather than shown as a felt loss or transformation. The final image reweights the signals as ephemeral, but no decisive change or visible price lands on the page to satisfy RR or CR with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The verdant grotto is vividly rendered with moss, mist, and ferns; sensory details are selective and atmospheric. Spatial choreography (stacked stones, reed lattice between saplings) remains clear. The grotto's suspension "between earth and sky" and the monarch migration's temporal pressure create mild constraint, though the environment does not materially narrow Liora's options or alter her tactics. The setting charges the final image but does not force a choice, placing it in the strong mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch migration—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure accumulates through the monarchs' arrival and Liora's signal-building, but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The butterflies depart and Liora packs; this is a natural conclusion rather than a choice that narrows tactics or imposes visible cost. Agency reads as witness and ritual rather than decision under friction, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from impermanence, overlooked histories, and "transiently rooted" structures. The final image—stones falling, reeds rotting, signal sent—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Liora's notebook entry and the monarchs' testing of the lattice. One phrase edges toward theme summary ("something vast and quiet, like the space between the beats of a heart"), but the particulars (moth wing, knotted twine, Oaxaca lesson) anchor abstraction well enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Liora's perceptual signature (tracing moth veins, noticing light on stones) is distinct and consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric, with purposeful compression ("the way a shadow lingered after the object casting it was gone"). Some figurative density ("mist curled tighter, the moss drank the light") borders on decorative in a high-pressure beat, but voice remains coherent and the prose reflects the contemplative stance. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; specificity is high (twine knot, cicada husks, reed lattice). Minor paraphrase loops appear: "The grotto held its breath. The mist curled tighter, the moss drank the light" restates stillness without adding pressure, triggering a small deduction. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "the air was thick with the ghosts of migrations" and "the world had paused to listen" approach stock lyricism. Clarity and propulsion remain strong outside these slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of esoteric realism, temporary signal-structures, and the last monarch migration offers a fresh synthesis grounded in specific detail (Oaxaca lesson, moth wing in notebook). Emotional truth and the lyric frame feel authentic. However, the premise echoes familiar elegiac nature-witness narratives; transformation is present but modest. The final image (stones fall, signal sent) is evocative yet predictable within the established logic. No bold structural risk elevates the piece into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her identity as esoteric realist frames the lens, but her choices are ritualistic observation (building signals, writing in notebook) rather than decisions that create key turns. She does not face a dilemma or alter tactics under pressure; the monarchs arrive and depart independently of her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in the opening (traced in notebook) and returns in the final paragraph ("her fingers brushing the moth wing one last time"), creating a lyric reprise that reweights impermanence. It is not handled in a middle beat or used to enable/constrain a choice, limiting causal pressure. The early-final frame qualifies it for mid-band under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is embodied in the monarchs' migration ("a cadence interrupted by winds that no longer carried them") and in Liora's temporary structures (loose knot, crumbling altars). It shapes the dominant stake and the ending's emphasis on signals that fade. The concept does not narrow on-page tactics but reweights prior material at closure, satisfying a lighter Accumulative role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is introduced early ("her time was transiently rooted—planted deep enough to matter, but not so deep it couldn't be uprooted") and echoed at closure ("things that were transiently rooted: they bloomed, they faded"). It characterizes Liora's stance but does not visibly constrain a choice or force a trade-off on the page. The reprise reweights meaning without demonstrating cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The knot appears once: Liora ties twine around the stone base, deliberately loose so it will unravel. This action seeds the impermanence theme and is recalled at closure ("The stones would fall, the reeds would rot"). It does not create a major turn or alter tactics mid-story; its primary work is thematic, qualifying it for modest mid-band credit under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Building temporary structures as signals is taught early (Oaxaca lesson), executed twice on the page (stacked stones with twine, reed lattice), and directly shapes the closure image ("The stones would fall, the reeds would rot, but the signal had been sent"). The method drives Liora's on-page actions and charges the ending, demonstrating causal presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The verdant grotto above the clouds is established early and anchors all action. It supplies resources (ferns, moss, saplings for the lattice) and atmospheric pressure (mist, suspended isolation). The setting does not materially constrain Liora's choices—she could build signals elsewhere—but it charges the final image and provides the spatial frame for the monarchs' pause, placing it solidly in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("during the migration of the last monarch butterfly") is declared in the opening and governs the three-day window. The monarchs' arrival and departure mark temporal progression. However, the migration does not tighten Liora's decisions or force urgency; she waits, they come, they leave. The timeframe contextualizes but does not constrain tactics, limiting it to a modest functional role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to honor overlooked histories is established early and governs her signal-building and notebook entry. It is dramatized through her actions (stacking stones, hanging cicada husks) rather than merely told. Yet the motivation faces no friction or competing desire; she enacts it without cost or sacrifice, reducing the conflict dimension. The ending reaffirms her purpose without testing it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Blushing stillness is embodied in "her breath shallow, her cheeks warm with the blushing stillness of the moment" and in the grotto's held breath at closure. The tone is coherent and lyric throughout, modulating subtly as the monarchs arrive and depart. It charges the final image ("the grotto held its breath") and supports the contemplative accumulation, demonstrating tonal control that elevates the ending.</comment>
