<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior life is heavily told through abstraction ("emotions she transliterated," "quiet turns of fate") rather than embodied contradiction. The final decision to accept missing pieces arrives via summary epiphany without foregrounding a live on-page choice that visibly forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (picking up the seed) but feel gestural rather than pressured by competing impulses. The character remains observational and interpretive throughout, with no dramatized internal conflict forcing a costly trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the piece gathers images and reflections toward a thematic reweighting). Orientation is clean. The closure—Liora deciding "some pieces were meant to stay missing"—reads as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her premise. However, the cost is asserted in summary ("that, she decided, was all right") rather than made legible through a forfeited action or visible consequence on the page. The seed discovery feels ornamental rather than a pressure point that alters her stance, softening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The iridescent cave is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, crystal facets, and spatial progression (center → tunnel → chamber). The crater glass glows and shifts color, guiding movement and reflecting interiority. The final chamber's "perfect, unbroken dome" and obsidian seed anchor the closure image. The setting constrains choice (the tunnel narrows, air thickens) and charges the final moment, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why some paths disappear—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The tunnel journey tightens space and light, and the crater glass's color shift from blue to red suggests escalation, yet no live option is foreclosed on the page. Liora's hesitation ("She stopped") deflates immediately without consequence. The resolution ("some pieces were meant to stay missing") is a philosophical acceptance rather than a choice that narrows tactics or pays a visible cost, leaving pressure more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (accepting incompleteness) emerges organically from the crater glass's shifting colors and the seed's promise. The final image avoids moralizing and offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the penultimate paragraph ("some things were meant to remain mysteries") borders on thesis statement, and the recurring phrase "missing pieces" functions more as prompt echo than a motif that accumulates fresh meaning. The emotional arc—aching acceptance—is earned by the journey's particulars, but the language trends toward abstraction at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction ("sea-foam recollectionist," "cheerful gloom") is voice-specific and stable. The prose maintains a meditative cadence that modulates appropriately when pressure rises (shorter clauses in the tunnel). Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated. One registration wobble: "transliterated" and "recollectionist" feel ornamental rather than idiomatic to the focalizer's lived lexicon, slightly distancing the reader from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several loops and scaffolds appear. "Missing pieces" is repeated across three paragraphs without functional reweighting. The phrase "the nature of her work" and "some things/pieces were meant to" create synonym churn at closure. Figurative density is high ("like a thousand tiny moons," "flickering like a dying ember," "like a wound") without pattern-teaching or added pressure, trending toward overwriting in descriptive beats. Information density is moderate; some beats (the bird-seed trail, the emotion-transliteration mechanic) are introduced but not causally developed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—recollectionist following scattered seeds to a crystal cave seeking why paths disappear—assembles several lyric/fantastical elements but does not synthesize them into a fresh causal or thematic necessity. The "cheerful gloom" tone is named but not deeply embodied in scene texture. The final acceptance of incompleteness is emotionally honest but arrives via a familiar arc (seeker learns to let go). Removing the fantastical labels (transliterates emotions, crater glass) and grounding the story in a naturalistic search would leave the emotional structure largely unchanged, suggesting surface novelty over transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and named, but Liora's role as "sea-foam recollectionist" functions more as atmospheric label than causal trait. She observes, walks, and picks up objects, but her choices do not create key turns. The decision to accept missing pieces is interior summary rather than an action that alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crater glass appears early, is handled in multiple beats (held up to light, clutched while walking, pulsing in the tunnel, tucked into pocket at closure), and its color shifts reflect escalating emotion. It guides movement and charges the final image by being pocketed alongside the seed. However, it does not constrain a choice or foreclose an option; it remains a reflective prop rather than a tool that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is the stated quest and returns in the final paragraph's resolution. It shapes the dominant stake and the thematic question. However, it operates primarily at the conceptual/thematic level rather than altering on-page tactics. The piece explores the concept more than it dramatizes a choice forced by a missing piece, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is mentioned in paragraph one and four ("emotions she transliterated...danced across its surface") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It reads as world-building flavor rather than a trait that shapes a turn or decision. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Conjecture" appears once in paragraph two ("she conjectured") as a verb describing Liora's thought process about the seeds. It does not drive a major turn or redefine options; the story would function identically if she "wondered" or "supposed." Functional but easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The scattered seeds are mentioned in paragraphs two and three as the trail Liora followed to the cave. They set up the journey (gate: setup) and are causally linked to the bird and the final seed discovery (gate: payoff). However, the mechanics are vague—how the seeds led her is asserted, not shown—and they do not constrain a middle choice (missing gate: development). Present and functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iridescent cave/geode is introduced immediately, anchors all action, and its spatial structure (center → tunnel → chamber) shapes the journey and escalates pressure. The crystal walls respond to Liora ("shimmering as if in agreement"), the narrowing tunnel forces hesitation, and the final dome contains the seed. The setting is indispensable to closure and constrains movement throughout, meeting all three gates with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" appears in paragraph two as backstory context ("Liora had come to this cave before memory faded"). It sets a vague temporal frame but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The phrase is atmospheric rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present in setup but without development or payoff pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is explicit in paragraph four and drives the quest framing. It shapes Liora's journey and the thematic question at closure. However, it remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page wants. No visible friction between this desire and a competing cost or fear; the motivation is singular and uncontested, keeping it in mid-band despite its centrality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Cheerful gloom" is named explicitly in the second-to-last paragraph and the prose sustains a melancholic-lyric register throughout. However, the "cheerful" dimension is less embodied than the "gloom"; most beats are wistful or aching without moments of levity or ironic brightness to create tonal tension. The tone modulates slightly (from wonder to unease in the tunnel) but remains static in register rather than charging the final image with a felt paradox.</comment>
