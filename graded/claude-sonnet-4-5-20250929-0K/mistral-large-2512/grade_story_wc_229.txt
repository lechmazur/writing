<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by a clear thesis (whispers travel farther than shouts) and his interiority is consistent, but his choices feel more demonstrative than conflicted—he never doubts his premise under pressure. The cork-and-vial experiment reads as a symbolic proof rather than a risky internal wager with visible cost. Maren's shift from scoffing to "something like understanding" is told rather than earned through a micro-choice that alters her stance on the page. Embodied emotion is present ("breath caught") but the peak moment relies on atmospheric confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear situational lens: Elias performs an experiment to validate his thesis, and the story accumulates atmospheric pressure toward a charged final image. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—the world "listening" reweights prior material and the dawn image crystallizes the thesis—but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt in a forfeited option or visible trade-off. The vial drop and echo constitute one meaningful tightening; causality holds under the situational lens, though the supernatural echo lacks established rules to constrain or surprise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, storm, and cliffs are vivid and purposeful; the lantern-room glass anchors Elias's sensory attention throughout. The cork's grooves and the phantom garden scent add tactile and olfactory specificity that charges the final beats. Spatial choreography (workbench, window, cliff edge) is coherent. The setting does not directly constrain a choice—Elias's experiment proceeds as planned—but the storm and dawn bracket the stakes and the lighthouse's vibrations echo the core concept, meeting the micro-setting threshold for 7+ without forcing deeper tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: proving the whisper thesis. The vial drop constitutes a single escalation that tests the premise, and the echo provides atmospheric confirmation. However, Elias faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off—Maren's skepticism is passive, and no cost (time, reputation, safety) is legibly paid for the experiment. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by a choice that forecloses an option. Under the situational lens, pressure is coherent but static; the story deepens texture without a turn that narrows Elias's path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—intent carried by quiet vibration—emerges through concrete particulars: the cork's grooves, the lighthouse lens hum, the reedy note, the garden scent. The final image (dawn, fogged glass, the world "listening") offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "purifying intentions" and "turning noise into meaning" veer toward abstract thesis language in the penultimate paragraph, and the ending asserts belief rather than dramatizing a thematic cost. The whisper/shout dichotomy is specific enough to avoid banality, and the recurring vibration motif charges the closure without becoming a checklist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elias's sensory attention and internal conviction. Diction is elevated and poetic ("dawn bled into the sky," "heat wave's dying breath") but consistent within the established lyric register. Maren's brief dialogue carries subtext (scoffing skepticism shifting to awed silence) but lacks distinct idiom; both characters share the narrator's cadence. The prose modulates with the storm's arrival and the vial drop, tightening rhythm at the peak beat. Filter verbs ("felt it," "knew") appear frequently but fit the reflective voice. Distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Syntax is varied and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchors ("damp earth, night-blooming jasmine") and clear propulsion through the experiment sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the way the world trembled" / "the way the air shifted" / "the way Maren's silence hummed" recycles the same stem structure. "Vibrations of intent" is repeated three times without evolving meaning, bordering on synonym churn. The final two paragraphs stack abstract claims ("purifying intentions, turning noise into meaning") that slow momentum. Minor template cadence in the storm description ("The rain fell harder, the air vibrated") but not pervasive. No major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper proving whispers travel farther via a supernatural experiment—combines familiar Gothic setting with an original sensory thesis. The cork as resonance object and the phantom garden scent are specific and non-obvious. However, the story adheres closely to a "proof-of-concept" template: skeptic, believer, experiment, atmospheric confirmation. The whisper/shout dichotomy is freshly embodied but not transformed by an unexpected moral calculus or risk. The ending reaffirms Elias's thesis without complication, avoiding the safety middle but also avoiding bold consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias drives all beats: he examines the cork, performs the vial drop, and interprets the echo. His role shapes the experiment and the closure image. However, his choices feel more like demonstrations than decisions under pressure—no alternative is weighed or foreclosed. Present early, active in middle and end, but lacks visible cost tied to his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cork appears in three beats: found and examined, blown to produce a note, pressed into the vial before the drop. Its grooves and reedy sound are specific and irreplaceable. It enables the experiment and is present in the closure via the echo it "held." Strong causal involvement and closure linkage; only slight swappability (another resonance object could substitute) and modest cost connection prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vibrations of intent frame the story (lighthouse lens hum, cork note, echo) and the phrase recurs explicitly. The concept shapes Elias's interpretation and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or impose a trade-off—Elias's experiment proceeds without friction. Functional across beats and thematically coherent but more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" appears once in the penultimate paragraph as an abstract claim about the garden scent. It does not enable or constrain an on-page action, nor does it carry visible cost. Label-only mention without causal pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cork's reedy note "beckons" and the garden scent "beckoned, not with sound, but with the promise of something just out of reach." The action appears twice and motivates Elias's experiment. However, its mechanics are vague and it could be replaced with "called" or "summoned" without structural loss. Present early and in closure framing but lacks specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The garden scent ("damp earth, night-blooming jasmine") is vividly described and reappears in the final paragraph, framing the closure. However, it is not a method Elias employs—it is an atmospheric element he perceives. Its mechanics do not shape his experiment tactics. Functional reprise but ornamental rather than instrumental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse anchors every beat: the lantern room glass, the cliff edge, the light's vibrations, and the dawn finale. Its verticality enables the vial drop and its sensory presence (hum, light, glass) charges Elias's thesis. The setting is indispensable to the experiment and the closure image. Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the heat wave" and the storm's arrival provide temporal brackets. The timeframe signals change and tightens the atmosphere but does not impose a deadline or alter Elias's tactics. The experiment could occur at any stormy dawn. Functional framing without causal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias's desire to prove the whisper thesis is stated early, motivates the cork experiment, and is affirmed in the closure. Maren's skepticism provides friction, and the echo dramatizes the proof. However, no competing want or fear complicates the choice—Elias never doubts. The motivation drives two beats and the ending but lacks internal conflict or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone blends lyric tenderness (sensory immersion, quiet conviction) with the storm's intensity. "Screaming tenderness" is arguably present in the contrast between the storm's rage and the whisper's delicate carry. However, the phrase is not foregrounded and the tonal interplay is subtle rather than sharp. Coherent modulation but the oxymoron is more implicit than charged.</comment>
