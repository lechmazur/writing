<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates some embodied particularity—the pale fingers, albino eyes sharp as broken glass—but his interiority leans heavily on generic tracker competence and serene anger that never complicates his choices. The woman and child remain functional props with no contradictory impulses. His decision to track "them" at the end feels declared rather than earned through a hierarchy of conflicting values tested on the page. The "consciously wild" trait and "why time slows in crisis" motive remain label-only claims without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens cleanly—who, where, when anchored by ~50 words—and attempts a causal chain: eclipse tension → drone → screaming child → ink manifestation → Elias's resolve. However, the closure is a statement of future intent ("he would track them") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The ink's resolution (child healed, mark vanished) removes the immediate pressure without foreclosing a path or altering Elias's present options in a legible way. The lens reads Causal early, but the ending gesture lacks the cost-on-page that would validate closure under that lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and eclipse aftermath provide sensory texture—dust, faded canvas, scent of distant rain—filtered through Elias's tracker perception. Spatial choreography of the outcrop, tents, and center clearing remains clear. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it functions as evocative backdrop. The ink pooling and rising is vividly rendered but operates more as spectacle than environment pressing tactics, keeping the score in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the child and understanding the ink-time theft—is signaled early and provides one clear tightening when Elias lunges for the ephemeral form. But the resolution is convenient: the ink solidifies just long enough for revelation, the child recovers fully, and Elias's next move is declared off-page. No visible cost alters his present options; the drone's escape does not foreclose pursuit. Escalation under a Causal lens requires a narrowing or trade-off with on-page price; this delivers exposition and a vow instead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of stolen time and crisis perception is signaled through Elias's motive and the ink's mechanics, but it never deepens beyond the opening claim. The final paragraph restates his determination without a resonant image or conceptual repricing. The ink as time metaphor is stated ("it was time itself, stolen and reshaped") rather than emergent from action. No particulars reweight the central question at closure; the ending offers intent, not thematic reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person close remains stable, with Elias's perceptual signature—broken-glass eyes, wind grooves traced by pale fingers—consistent. The phrase "consciously wild" jars as authorial label rather than enacted trait. Dialog from the woman is brief and functional. At the climax, diction holds ("his albino eyes burning with serene anger"), but the serene-anger register never modulates with the stakes; it's asserted at start and end without rhythmic intensification under pressure. Minor voice consistency without standout control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; the opening "wind-carved encampment clung to the edge of the mesa like a half-remembered dream" shows purposeful cadence. However, several beats loop or restate without added pressure: "time slows in crisis" appears three times without new detail. The ink's behavior is described vividly but at the cost of momentum—adjective stacks ("faint, shimmering," "ephemeral patterns") accumulate. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative minor scaffold and metaphor repetition (spilled ink, liquid shadow) dull propulsion in the middle third, warranting a −0.4 to −0.5 non-closure deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The albino tracker in a windswept, post-eclipse desert with disappearing ink and time theft is a competent genre synthesis, but the elements feel assembled from a prompt rather than organically transformed. The ink-as-stolen-time metaphor is stated directly; no fresh inflection emerges in hindsight. The drone, eclipse, and nomad encampment are all functional yet interchangeable with similar motifs. The ending vow to track "them" echoes countless tracker-pursuit frames without a memorable twist or specificity that makes this story irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes two key moves: sprinting to the child and lunging for the ink. His tracker role supplies observation (grooves in rock, mark on wrist) but these observations do not create turns; the ink's behavior drives the plot. His final decision to track is declared off-page. Present and functional, but his choices do not alter tactics or narrow options in a way that would push above mid-band. Early setup and mid-scene involvement qualify him for two gates (Setup, Development); weak closure participation caps him near 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drone appears early (setup gate met), veers from Elias's reach, lands on the child's shoulder to deliver the message (development gate met), then darts away at the end (closure gate met by presence). It's handled across three beats, but its function is ornamental delivery rather than constraint or reweighted meaning—removing it and having the ink appear directly would not break story logic. The message "They're taking the time" could be revealed without the drone. Functional across beats, but swappable, landing mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is mentioned early (the drone's trick, the woman's phrase "started after the eclipse," the ink on the wrist and ground), shapes the middle investigation, and is present at the end when the mark fades completely. It provides the visual mystery and ties to the time-theft reveal. However, the core conflict—Elias saving the child and vowing pursuit—could function with any supernatural marker. The ink is a vehicle, not an irreplaceable driver. Moderate integration across setup, development, and payoff, but replaceable, yielding ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" appears twice as authorial label—"he had always been consciously wild" and "lived on the edges of civilization"—but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It does not shape his tactics, filter his perception distinctly, or create a trade-off. Label-only mention without dramatized pressure. Ornamental, scoring low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Disappear" surfaces in the drone's disappearing ink, the child's threatened disappearance (breath slowing, bluish tint), the ink fading, and Elias's vow "he would not disappear." The concept threads through multiple beats but functions more as thematic echo than causal driver. The child does not actually disappear; the ink does, but it's a symptom, not an action that redefines options. Swappable with "vanish" or "fade" with minor edits. Present across beats, modest causal role, mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are signaled early (the shimmering mark, ink that pools and rises, ink twisting into shapes) and the mechanics matter—Elias grabs the ephemeral form, it solidifies briefly, then vanishes. The method is on-page and shapes his attempt to intervene. However, the ink's behavior is more spectacle than constraint; it resists, then cooperates just long enough for revelation. Functional, mechanics visible, but the ease of resolution weakens necessity. Two gates met (Setup, Development, weak Payoff), scoring low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is anchored early, provides the spatial stage (outcrop, tents, center clearing), and supplies the scent of dust and distant rain at the end. It does not constrain choices—Elias could run to the child anywhere—or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard description and spatial clarity without tactical pressure. Setup and weak payoff (final-line scent) met, but no development gate. Functional backdrop, cap 4.6 applies; score trends low-3s for lack of causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" is mentioned in the opening and the woman's line "it started after the eclipse," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics. No live clock pressures Elias's moves; he has leisure to crouch, sprint, kneel, observe, and lunge. The eclipse provides atmospheric context but does not function as a constraint. Mentioned early, absent in middle pressure, ornamental at end. Setup only, no development or payoff gates met, scoring low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to discover why time slows in crisis" is stated twice—once in exposition ("He had spent his life trying to understand why") and once at the end ("first, he had to understand why time slowed in crisis")—but never dramatized in a conflicted choice. The child's immediate danger does not force him to choose between investigation and action; he saves the child and vows future inquiry. Told-only motive without friction or on-page cost. Setup present, no development or payoff, ornamental, low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Serene anger is declared early ("his albino eyes burning with serene anger") and restated at the end ("his anger settling into something quieter, something more dangerous"), creating a purposeful early-final reprise. The tone modulates slightly (from burning to quieter-dangerous) but does not cohesively charge all middle beats—during the child-saving sequence, urgency and curiosity dominate without the serene-anger texture. The tone lands on the final image with some weight. Two gates met (Setup, Payoff), lyric reprise present, modest reweighting, low-mid 4s per the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
