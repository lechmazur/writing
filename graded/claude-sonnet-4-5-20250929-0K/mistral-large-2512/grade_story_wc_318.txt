<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his past as a conductor, but his interior life trends toward summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The girl's silent wonder and the mother's rusty laugh provide embodied emotion at closure, though the protagonist's trembling hands and exhaled relief remain somewhat abstract. The final choice to walk away feels earned by the setup, but the weight of renunciation could be more visceral. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weight of unspoken things," "tended to them like a gardener") that dilutes character particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through repeated attempts (police called, weeping, now listening) and the lullaby's spiral through the tunnel. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias walks away after the laughter returns, foreclosing further intervention with felt cost in his solitary exit. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening—the girl's emergence and the mother's laugh—reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the final image of Elias leaving into the dark, though the cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel functions as micro-setting, shaping the sound that Elias conducts and providing spatial choreography (mouth of the tunnel, far end, curved walls). The leaf blower's mechanics and the pull cord's frayed state ground the tool in tactile detail. The tunnel's acoustics constrain his method and charge the final image when laughter "fills the space like a symphony." Sensory hierarchy favors sound over other senses, which fits the concept but leaves some visual and tactile opportunities unexplored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore laughter to the household. Escalation traces a clear pattern (first police, second weeping, now listening) that deepens through Elias's repeated attempts. The girl's movement forward and the mother's laugh provide a meaningful tightening that forecloses further intervention. The leaf blower's sputtering fuel and Elias's decision to walk away impose a visible cost. No antagonist is required; the silence itself functions as opposition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the final turn could impose a sharper trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—tending to unspoken grief until it becomes speakable joy—emerges from the conductor/gardener metaphor and the off-key lullaby's "imperfections are the point" motif. The final image of laughter "playing itself" without Elias's conducting answers the central question through concrete action rather than statement. Subtext operates in the girl's silent wonder and the mother's "raw and rusty" laugh. Minor weakness: "The unspoken had been tended to" in the penultimate beat risks explicit theme statement, though it's brief and the final paragraph shifts back to image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Elias. Distance is stable; perceptual signature (conductor's ear, imagining the household) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("macerated into silence," "mournfully eager") that feels slightly imposed over lived-in voice. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not applicable. Free indirect access to Elias's breath hitching and trembling hands works cleanly. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the closure beat. Minor filter-verb presence ("he had once led," "he imagined") doesn't obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the final image ("following him into the dark") closes with purposeful weight. Template cadence appears in "The first time… The second time… Now, they listened" and recurs with "He adjusted… The lullaby twisted… The imperfections were the point," creating a mild mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loop: "He had done what he came to do" and "The unspoken had been tended to" restate the same closure content within two beats. Stock metaphor: "tended to them like a gardener to withered blooms" and "macerated into silence" elevate diction without fresh vehicle. Deductions −0.6 for template runs and −0.3 for paraphrase loop total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The leaf-blower conductor premise offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis of sound restoration and domestic grief. The off-key lullaby as therapeutic tool and the echo chamber tunnel as instrument transform familiar "healing through art" material. Emotional specificity (girl's fingers at throat, mother's rusty laugh) avoids generic templates. Minor derivative element: the silent child and grieving household follow a recognizable template, though the conductor angle and acoustic method add freshness. Risk-taking (unconventional sonic method, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias as conductor-turned-wind-artist frames the opening, drives the middle attempts (adjusting angle, yanking cord), and his decision to walk away shapes the closure. His choices (coaxing the lullaby, not correcting imperfections, letting the sound carry him) create key turns. Setup clear, development across multiple beats, payoff in final choice. Causal pressure: his repeated attempts and final renunciation foreclose further intervention with visible cost. Specificity: "conductor" role is irreplaceable in the thematic architecture. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = ~6.8 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pull cord handle appears in three distinct beats: opening ("dangled like a lifeline, frayed at edges"), middle ("yanked… and the leaf blower roared"), and late ("yanked… harder this time," then "slipped from his fingers, clattering to the ground"). The frayed detail and final clatter add tactile specificity. However, the cord's function is mechanical rather than causally transformative—any starter mechanism would serve. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.4, swappability −0.6 = ~5.2, rounded to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is named explicitly ("He knew the weight of unspoken things; he tended to them like a gardener") and governs Elias's tactics throughout: he doesn't speak to the family, he conducts wind to coax silence into sound. The concept shapes his method (off-key lullaby to create "cracks where… laughter might seep through") and the ending reweights it when "the unspoken had been tended to." Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, label-only mention −0.3 = ~7.0, adjusted to 7.1 for thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears once as a trait label ("He knew the weight of unspoken things; he tended to them like a gardener to withered blooms, mournfully eager to see them flourish again"). It colors his motivation but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. No mid-scene trade-off tied to this duality. Late first appearance −0.4, label-only −0.5, no beat involvement −0.9 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Macerate" appears once in the opening: "as if the air itself had been macerated into silence." It provides metaphorical texture for the post-accident quiet but does not drive a turn or redefine options. The silence could be described many ways without altering plot. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7, no beat involvement −0.9 = ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "half-sung lullaby" on "off-key wind" is the story's method, signaled early ("the wind was off-key, but that was the point"), executed in the middle beats (lullaby "curled through the tunnel, bouncing between walls," "twisted, warped by acoustics"), and present at closure ("The lullaby resumed, softer now"). The mechanics matter: off-key imperfections create "cracks where… laughter might seep through." Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7 = ~7.8 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is established in the opening line, shapes every sonic choice (curved walls amplify, acoustics warp the lullaby), and charges the final image when laughter "bounce[s] between the walls until it filled the space like a symphony." The tunnel's physics constrain Elias's method and enable the ending's resonance. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8 = ~7.6 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" sets a past-tense frame ("the world had gone quiet") but does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions. The phrase is poetic but functionally equivalent to "after the accident." No mid-scene time pressure; the leaf blower's fuel running low provides a minor ticking element, but it's not tied to the hourglass image. Ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.6, no beat involvement −0.9 = ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Restore lost laughter" is the named goal ("The household at the tunnel's end had not laughed in months") and drives all of Elias's attempts. The desire is dramatized through his repeated yanks on the pull cord, adjustments to the blower's angle, and imagining the household. Friction surfaces when the girl appears unexpectedly and he "had not come here to be seen," adding cost to the success. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5 = ~7.3 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone of "true haunting" coheres through the ghostly opening ("ghosts of forgotten melodies," "silence rushed in"), the girl's silent shadow, and the final image of Elias disappearing "into the dark." Tone modulates slightly when the mother's laugh breaks through, but the ending's solitary exit sustains the haunted register. Tone charges the final image by framing the restored laughter as an echo that follows rather than a full reunion. Setup +0.6, coherence across turns +0.8, closure charge +1.2, modulation +0.5 = ~6.9 after rounding down.</comment>
