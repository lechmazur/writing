<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction between prudent calculation and the final risk is present but largely told through reflective summary rather than dramatized pressure. The micro-choice to open the pillbox and use the key shows agency, but the cost—leaving behind the pillbox—reads more symbolic than visceral. Embodiment is intermittent: the scar-tracing gesture is strong, but emotion often surfaces as label ("felt the tilt...not as a threat, but as an invitation") rather than action. The reflection-heavy structure (≥30% of text) does anchor in present stimuli and tilts stance at closure, avoiding BRR penalties, but interiority leans toward epiphany-speak in places ("learning to see the light through them").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, Zephyr Bluff, post-fire aftermath) appear within ~120 words; no penalty. The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (mist, codes, pillbox, key, hidden door) and a cadence shift at the final paragraph reweights the dominant stake (redemption → carrying forward what was abandoned) with conceptual cost (accepting incompleteness). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the decision to pocket the file and leave the pillbox crystallizes Elias's stance with undeniable pressure, even if the relational cost is oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs when the key turns and the file's contents narrow options from personal absolution to collective responsibility. The causal chain is light but sufficient for the accumulative lens; the key's arrival feels seeded but slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff and the hidden door constrain Elias's final choice: he must physically descend and use the key, grounding the symbolic in spatial action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (mist "curled like smoke," zephyr "sharp with the promise of spring"), filtered through Elias's survivor lens. The codes in snow and the door half-buried in ivy charge the setting with history and consequence. However, the interior room (dust, maps, ledgers) remains under-developed; it does not alter tactics or impose friction, reading more as a symbolic terminus than a lived space. The body (scar, breath) and the pillbox function as micro-setting elements that recur and reweight at closure, lifting the score within the band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where unused courage waits / seeking proof beyond absolution) is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pillbox opens and reveals the key, narrowing Elias's options from passive remembrance to active choice. The descent to the door and the file's contents deepen the stake from personal redemption to collective responsibility, reweighting cost. Agency is present: Elias chooses to open the pillbox, use the key, and pocket the file; these are renunciations and endurances that foreclose paths. Cost is conceptual and relational (leaving the pillbox, accepting incompleteness) but legible in the final image. Pressure remains coherent throughout, though the key's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than earned through escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (redemption as carrying forward rather than erasing) emerges through accumulated particulars: codes in snow, the pillbox's engraving, the abandoned network, and the final act of pocketing the file. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question—"some things were never meant to be fixed—only carried forward"—without moralizing, though it edges close to articulation. Subtext operates in gesture (leaving the pillbox, scars that no longer ache) and the recurring image of the tilt toward spring reweights meaning at closure. The story resists tidy resolution by accepting incompleteness as cost. However, the phrase "learning to see the light through them" in paragraph five is a near-explicit thematic statement that dilutes resonance slightly. Overall, the ending reconfigures prior material with quiet force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct texture: elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "silver hush") and lyric syntax ("valley stretched like a wound") suit Elias's reflective, spy-trade lens. Perceptual signature is consistent (codes, scars, engraved surfaces) and filters setting through his survivor priorities. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("felt," "had come") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the knowledge that some things...") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. Compression under peak stress (opening the pillbox, turning the key) maintains texture without obscuring clarity. No dialogue; judgment limited to narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. However, several prose artifacts cluster: paraphrase loops ("He had come here not to remember, but to forget" / "He had not come here for absolution, but for proof"), synonym churn ("courage," "absolution," "redemption" cycle without added pressure), and template cadence in reflective beats ("It was...It was...It was" in paragraph eight). Stock metaphors ("valley stretched like a wound," "mist curled like smoke") appear in high-density runs without pattern-taught payoff. Register drift into elevated abstraction ("the knowledge that some things were never meant to be fixed—only carried forward") clashes slightly with the concrete spy-trade lens. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third. Information density is moderate; some beats (paragraph six's pillbox opening) compress effectively, while others (paragraph nine's ledger description) summarize rather than dramatize. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template cadence; artifacts do not touch the final image directly, so no 9+ disqualification, but cap high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The burned-spy-seeking-redemption premise is familiar, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational detail; the spy-trade elements (codes, cover loss, network) remain largely symbolic rather than tactically specific. The engraved pillbox and hidden door are vivid particulars, but the emotional arc (guilt → acceptance of incompleteness) follows a well-worn template. The tilt-toward-spring frame and the codes-in-snow method offer fresh inflections, yet the final insight—carrying forward rather than fixing—is conceptually sound but not startling. The story commits fully to its premise and avoids safety-hedging, but the closure feels inevitable in a conventional sense rather than through specific, non-obvious synthesis. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. Applying derivative premise adjustment: −0.7 within Q8 for template plot without deep transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias (burned spy) is present throughout, and his choices—opening the pillbox, using the key, pocketing the file—create the story's key turns. His burned-spy status shapes interiority (scar-tracing, codes, cover loss) and motivates the search for redemption, constraining tactics (he seeks codes, deciphers messages, descends to the hidden door). Setup is immediate, development constrains middle choices (the key unlocks the door only he would seek), and payoff is direct: his decision to pocket the file and leave the pillbox is the closure action. However, the spy-trade specifics remain largely symbolic; occupational detail (tradecraft, surveillance awareness, operational security) does not impose on-page friction or alter tactics in a tactically legible way. The character is indispensable to this exact story, but the burned-spy attribute could be swapped for "disgraced detective" or "exiled priest" with minimal structural edits. Cost is conceptual (accepting incompleteness) rather than operationally specific. Gates: all three present. Band: essential across beats with moderate irreplaceability. Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, beat involvement (three) +1.4, specificity +0.5, early signal +0.5; swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The engraved pillbox appears in paragraph four (within first third), is handled and opened in paragraph eight (middle choice enabled), and its contents (key and note) drive the descent and unlock the door at closure. The engraving ("For the hour you dare to be whole") seeds thematic expectation, and the object's three-year history with Elias adds weight. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. However, the pillbox itself does not constrain a tactical choice beyond prompting Elias to open it; the key inside does the causal work. The pillbox is left behind at closure, a symbolic relinquishment, but this cost is oblique. Removing the pillbox and having the key arrive by other means (hidden cache, messenger) would require moderate rewrite but not break the story's logic. Gates: all three. Band: drives two beats, closure-linked, but moderate irreplaceability. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.4; swappability −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, lift to 7.2 for charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core concept (fixing what's broken) is named in paragraph five ("to fix what he could no longer fix") and again at closure ("to fix what was broken...some things were never meant to be fixed—only carried forward"). It shapes the dominant stake (seeking redemption/proof) and reweights at the ending image with conceptual cost (accepting incompleteness). However, the concept is largely thematic rather than tactical: Elias does not attempt on-page repair actions that fail and force pivot. The file reveals abandoned agents, which could be "fixed" by resuming their missions, but this future action is off-page. The concept frames interiority and closure meaning but does not constrain middle choices or alter tactics in a visible way. Setup (implied early, explicit by paragraph five), development (shapes reflection but not action), payoff (reweighted at closure). Gates: setup late, development weak, payoff present. Closure linkage +1.2, thematic charge +0.6; late setup −0.3, ornamental mid-story −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.0 = 4.0, lift to 6.1 for strong closure repricing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The attribute (prudently daring) is stated in paragraph nine ("spent his life being prudently daring—calculating risks, weighing consequences") but not dramatized as a constraint or trade-off in prior action. Elias's choice to open the pillbox and use the key could illustrate this trait, but the text does not foreground the cost or friction of balancing prudence and daring in that moment. The trait is told-only and arrives late (final third), functioning as summary rather than shaping on-page choices. No visible trade-off or cost is tied to this specific attribute; the closure choice reads as acceptance rather than a calculated risk. Gates: missing setup and development; payoff is label-only. Late introduction −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, summary-only −0.5. Base 3.0 − 2.0 = 1.0, lift slightly to 5.3 for coherence with closure theme, though causal work is minimal. Cap at 4.6 per missing-setup gate; final 5.3 exceeds but reflects interpretive lift for thematic fit—revert to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The action (vouchsafe) appears in the note inside the pillbox: "Vouchsafe this to the man who needs it more than I do." It names the key's transfer and implies trust/guardianship, but the action itself is past (the giver vouchsafed the key to Elias off-page). On-page, Elias receives and uses the key, but "vouchsafe" does not describe his closure action—he pockets the file, does not pass it forward within the story. The word seeds a thematic note (trust, care) but does not create a major turn; swapping "vouchsafe" for "entrust" or "deliver" would not alter structure. Setup (mid-story, paragraph eight), development (the note enables the key's use), payoff (Elias's choice to carry forward could echo vouchsafing the mission to future action, but this is off-page). Gates: setup present, development weak, payoff oblique. Closure linkage +0.4 (oblique), beat involvement (one) +0.4, swappability −0.6, late setup −0.3. Base 3.0 + (−0.1) = 2.9, lift to 4.8 for thematic coherence, though causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Codes in accumulated snow appear in paragraph six: Elias crouches and reveals "codes etched into the accumulated snow—messages left by agents who had come before him." He added his own ("I was wrong, and I am sorry"), establishing the method early. The codes guide him to Zephyr Bluff and prime the network revelation in the file at closure, but the mechanics (how he deciphers them, what specific information they convey beyond plea/warning) remain vague. The method shapes the journey's premise but does not constrain middle attempts or impose friction. Setup (paragraph six, within first third), development (implies the codes led him here, but not shown on-page), payoff (the file's coordinates echo the cipher, linking codes to closure). Gates: setup present, development weak (told not shown), payoff present. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure +0.6; vague mechanics −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4, lift to 6.4 for purposeful setup and closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist is the story's spatial anchor: Elias stands at the cliff's edge (paragraph two), crouches to reveal codes in snow (paragraph six), and the mist parts to reveal the hidden door (paragraph ten). The setting pressures choice by forcing descent and discovery; the bluff's edge and the door's location (base of the bluff, half-buried) impose physical choreography. The mist modulates with narrative pressure (thickens in paragraph nine, parts in paragraph ten) and charges the final image ("stepped back into the light"). Setup (immediate), development (codes and door location constrain movement), payoff (mist-lift and light at closure). All three gates met. Environment constrains choices +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, beat involvement (three) +1.4, early signal +0.6, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, moderate to 7.6 to reflect that the mist's modulation, while atmospheric, does not impose hard tactical friction (Elias is not hindered or enabled by visibility in a way that alters his approach).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (tilt of the earth toward spring / first thaw) is signaled in the opening line and recurs in paragraphs nine and twelve ("for the first time in years, he felt the tilt..."; "The tilt...had done its work"). It establishes season and mood, and the thaw metaphorically mirrors Elias's emotional shift. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; there is no clock or seasonal deadline that alters tactics. The frame is lyric and atmospheric rather than causal. Setup (immediate), development (recurs but does not constrain), payoff (final paragraph reprises the tilt, reweighting tone). Gates: setup and payoff present, development weak. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, lyric reprise +0.4; no causal pressure −0.6, no urgency −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, lift to 5.8 for strong thematic charge at closure, though tactical impact is nil.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation (to find where unused courage waits) is stated in paragraph nine and drives the dominant stake: Elias seeks proof "that courage wasn't something you spent—it was something you found when you had nothing left to lose." This desire is dramatized through the choice to open the pillbox and use the key, and the file's revelation (abandoned network) redefines the target of his courage from personal absolution to collective responsibility. However, the motivation is told explicitly rather than inferred from conflicted action, and friction between want (absolution) and cost (accepting incompleteness) is present but understated. Setup (mid-story, paragraph nine), development (the key enables pursuit), payoff (file contents answer the question). Gates: setup mid-late, development present, payoff strong. Closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, beat involvement (two) +0.9; late setup −0.3, told-heavy −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, lift to 6.6 for strong closure integration despite late explicit statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone (silver hush) appears in paragraph eight ("his breath a silver hush in the air") and pervades the piece through restrained, elegiac diction, mist imagery, and quiet closure. The tone is coherent across turns and modulates subtly: reflective and somber early, tentatively hopeful at the pillbox opening, and quietly resolute at closure. It charges the final image ("stepped back into the light") without breaking into sentimentality. However, "silver hush" as a phrase appears only once and is not developed as a recurring motif; the tone is consistent but not dynamically reweighted. Setup (mid-story, paragraph eight), development (tone remains stable), payoff (tone supports closure image). Gates: setup mid-late, development static, payoff present. Closure linkage +1.1, coherence +0.8, specificity +0.5; single mention −0.3, late setup −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, lift to 6.9 for strong atmospheric coherence and closure charge, though the phrase itself is under-utilized.</comment>
