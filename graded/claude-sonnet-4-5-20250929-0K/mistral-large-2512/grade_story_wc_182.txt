<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's trait of being "carefully resourceful" is stated but rarely embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her motivations (finding her sister) are declared late and feel added rather than driving prior beats. The time traveler remains generic—his panic is told, his choices convenience-driven. Internal contradiction is absent; both characters move through the labyrinth without visible struggle between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered images, shifting shelves, the diary as breadcrumb). Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. Closure unit: the sister's appearance and Elara's realization ("Some lessons...never meant to be learned alone") functions as Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The "library of unlearned lessons" premise is seeded early but resolved by arrival, not by a choice that narrows options. One meaningful deepening (renegotiation, door-opening) is present, but the final image lacks felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (aged paper, creaking shelves, symbols that ache). Spatial choreography is clear through the descent. The botanical diary constrains one choice (the renegotiation) and charges the sister's drawing at closure, satisfying the micro-setting test. Elara's botanical expertise filters perception appropriately. Strong execution of purpose-driven detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the library) is signaled early. One tightening occurs at the renegotiation beat, where Elara trades expertise for a sister-search. The door-opening is a threshold but lacks visible cost—no stamina spent, no tool lost, no social credit burned. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final image adds information (sister found) but doesn't foreclose a live option or charge prior pressure with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of buried lessons and chosen solitude versus collaboration emerges through the library conceit and the final line. The botanical diary and the sister's flower sketch recur with shifted meaning. Subtext operates in gesture (door hesitation, the time traveler's breath hitch). No overt moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer (lessons shared) but the resonance is soft—prior material isn't decisively reweighted, and the sister's older, wiser state raises unanswered questions that diffuse rather than charge the moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Elara's perceptual signature (botanical lens, coded observations, reading the unspoken) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext ("You're the one who led me into this maze"). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Diction remains within POV lexicon. Some lyricism ("off-key note in an unheard symphony") elevates without obscuring. Distance control is solid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high in the descent sequence. Minor scaffold: "She had spent years..." appears twice in similar constructions. "Carefully resourceful" is stated rather than shown. Figurative density is elevated but coherent (mountain/bone, shelves/veins). No loops or paraphrase chains. Propulsion is steady. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The final line ("Some lessons...never meant to be learned alone") edges toward theme summary but lands as image-anchored realization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore, time traveler, and library of unlearned lessons combine familiar tropes (archive-as-maze, temporal outsider, lost-knowledge quest). Transformation is partial: the botanical diary and sister's flower drawing provide specific texture, but the emotional arc (reluctant partnership → shared lesson) follows template beats. The sister's appearance is a surprise but not earned by prior causality—she's a reveal rather than a turn. No close echoes of famous lines, but the synthesis feels derivative of archive-fantasy conventions without a fresh moral calculus or structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (arcane linguist specializing in plant languages) is present throughout and makes two key choices: following the time traveler and renegotiating terms. Her linguistics expertise is mentioned but never used on-page to solve a problem—she reads book-spines and observes, but doesn't translate or decode under pressure. The sister-search motive arrives late (~40% mark). Her decision to push the door open is pivotal but could be made by any determined character. Setup present, one middle choice (renegotiation), closure participation (enters library), but causal pressure from the linguist trait itself is weak. Swappable with "determined researcher" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in beat one (weight against ribs, pressed flowers, coded observations), is invoked as "lifeline" and "breadcrumb" during the descent, and the sister's flower sketch from it drives the renegotiation and final recognition. Three touches across setup, middle, closure. It constrains one choice (renegotiation leverage) and charges the ending (the sister's drawing connects to her reappearance). Strong setup and closure linkage. Causal role is moderate—it's a motive anchor more than a tactical tool. Irreplaceability is solid; the botanical/linguistic pairing is specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core concept "rescue missions" is obliquely present: Elara seeks her sister, the time traveler seeks the library key. Both quests are declared, but neither is dramatized as a rescue under pressure—no extraction under fire, no trade-off between saving one and the mission. The concept shapes stakes thematically but doesn't alter tactics on the page. Functional but generic; "search" or "recovery" would fit as well.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is stated twice (once as trait label, once as "carefully resourceful heart"). On-page evidence: Elara uses her diary as breadcrumb and negotiates terms. The trait constrains no visible action with cost—she doesn't ration supplies, choose a risky shortcut, or sacrifice a tool. Label-only at setup, one middle beat (negotiation), no closure cost tied to resourcefulness. Swappable with "determined" or "pragmatic."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" appears at the story's hinge: Elara demands the time traveler help find her sister in exchange for her expertise. This beat redefines the partnership and adds a second stake. The action is specific, dramatized in dialogue, and shapes the remainder (they move deeper with dual purpose). Setup (expertise mentioned), middle turn (renegotiation scene), closure participation (dual quest pays off when sister appears). Causal pressure is strong; removing it flattens the arc to a simple escort. Not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is mentioned once: "She had spent her life researching gaps, the silences between languages." The method is seeded but never shown—Elara doesn't analyze a gap, decode a silence, or use linguistic absence to unlock the library door. The time traveler's dissolving map and the shifting shelves are gaps, but Elara's expertise doesn't act on them. Thematic mention without mechanical use. Functional label, no middle or closure application.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is setup immediately (mountain with book-spines, bookstore carved into earth's bone, shelves winding deeper than roots). It pressures every move: shelves rearrange, air grows heavier, the door with aching symbols is the threshold. The setting supplies obstacles (the maze, the groaning structure) and charges the final image (veins of the mountain, the library's vastness). Three-gate coverage, high specificity, strong causal and atmospheric work. The bookstore isn't merely backdrop—it's an antagonist that shapes descent and frames closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the time traveler arrives" is anchored early ("three days prior"). The three-day window is mentioned once and never tightens decisions—no countdown, no time-driven urgency. The story unfolds in continuous present action without temporal pressure. The traveler's backward-running pocket watch is a motif but doesn't alter tactics. Functional setup, no middle or closure use. Swappable with "recently" or omission.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To find the library of unlearned lessons" is stated by the time traveler early and becomes the dominant stake. Elara adopts it as shared goal after renegotiation, adding her sister-search. The desire is declared rather than embodied in conflicted choices—Elara doesn't weigh competing paths or pay a visible cost to pursue it. The library's discovery is arrival, not earned breakthrough. Setup strong, middle participation (renegotiation redefines motive), closure participation (they enter), but friction between want and cost is thin. Told more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears once as metaphor ("his presence rippling through the stacks like an off-key note in an unheard symphony"). Tone is established as lyric-atmospheric with gothic mystery elements (mountain/bone, aged paper, panic scent, aching symbols). The tone is coherent through the descent and doesn't modulate sharply under pressure—maintains a steady dreamlike register. It doesn't charge the final image with new emotional texture. One vivid setup, no development or payoff, no tonal shift at closure. Functional metaphor but ornamental to structure.</comment>
