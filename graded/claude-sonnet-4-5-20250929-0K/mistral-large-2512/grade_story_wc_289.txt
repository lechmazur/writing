<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's occupation as a ghostwriter is established but her interior life reads as abstracted meditation rather than embodied contradiction. The peak choice—writing her own letter—arrives without prior micro-choices that test competing impulses; the shift feels declared rather than earned through visible cost. Relationships with the keeper and artist remain at arm's length, serving as oracles rather than applying direct pressure. Embodied emotion is thin; much of her interiority operates in figurative register without concrete sensation or stakes-driven hesitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-seeking, recurring twig/nest imagery, and a final image that reweights the opening spiral motif. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirror reflection, the twig in her hair, the keeper's affirmation), but the cost remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is legible in the final beats. The keeper's line "You found the pattern" and Mira's "I just stopped looking for it" function as thematic summary rather than a decisive image that makes the price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond anchor space; the installation of suspended mirrors provides a second locale. Sensory detail is present but leans heavily on visual metaphor ("voice the color of wet stone") without tactile grounding. The temple's petals and pond mist recur but do not constrain a choice—Mira moves freely between locations without spatial friction. The twig is handled across beats, qualifying as micro-setting, but its physical properties (smooth bark, spiral shape) do not alter her tactics or the final image's charge in a material way.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the pattern that connects all things—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options; the keeper and artist offer clues without cost, and Mira's letter-writing is recounted ("That night, Mira sat...") rather than dramatized. The artist's disappearance and the single mirror's appearance read as convenience rather than pressure; Mira arrives at insight without a visible tightening or trade-off. Agency is present in her decision to write her own letter, but the act forecloses no live path with legible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—secrets as threads, the pattern beneath disparate confessions—emerges through recurring images (nest spiral, mirror fragments, lotus fold). The final exchange with the keeper offers resonance without moralizing, and the thrush's song provides a lyric cadence shift. However, the artist's line "You rejoin what's broken" edges toward thesis statement, and Mira's epiphany ("It was here all along") feels familiar rather than surprising. The twig-as-key image has metaphoric weight but does not reweight prior material with fresh conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Mira's perceptual signature favors lyric abstraction ("voice the color of wet stone," "whimsy so inevitable it felt like gravity"). Dialogue carries subtext in the keeper's and artist's exchanges, though their idiom converges into oracular phrasing. Free indirect style is clean, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("incantation," "unspooled," "prismatic") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. The final beats maintain narrative stance, and the thrush's song closes with rhythmic purpose. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She wrote," "She folded," "She tucked") in the closing third slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language is purposeful in many beats. However, overwriting clusters in mid-story: "a whimsy so inevitable it felt like gravity" and "the sky fractured and reassembled in their depths" layer metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third ("She wrote... She folded... She tucked"), and the phrase "whimsical and inevitable" recurs as a descriptor without earned pattern. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the keeper's "Public secrets" and the artist's "This isn't a thread. It's a question" feel like thesis placeholders. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize transit or reflection that could have been elided.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghostwriter-seeking-her-own-pattern premise and the artist-who-weaves-broken-things-into-spirals are recognizable writing-template combinations. The lotus temple and twig spiral offer vivid particulars, but the emotional arc—external guide figures lead protagonist to self-insight—follows a familiar trajectory without a non-obvious turn. The mirror installation vanishing and reappearing as a single mirror reads as symbolic convenience rather than a synthesis grounded in prior causality. Risk-taking is modest; the piece stays within established lyric-literary modes without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as ghostwriter is signaled early and frames her search for pattern. She writes her own letter in the final third, which enables the ending's thematic closure, but the act does not create a key turn—no prior option is foreclosed. Her profession informs the theme but does not constrain tactics or generate friction. Present in setup and closure; absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twig appears in beat one (Mira tracing the nest's spiral), beat two (she plucks it and holds it out to the artist), and the ending (she tucks it into her hair). The artist's use of twigs to measure secrets links it to theme. Its spiral shape recurs but does not evolve in meaning or constrain a choice. Present across three beats and the final image, but its causal pressure is limited to thematic echo rather than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The keeper-of-secrets concept is embodied in Mira's ghostwriting and the temple keeper's role. The artist claims "Secrets have weight. I measure them in twigs," and the keeper delivers the thematic line "Secrets are just stories waiting to be told" at the end. The concept shapes the dominant stake but does not generate on-page friction or alter tactics—characters discuss it rather than enact it under pressure. Present in setup and closure; thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The keeper's suggestion is described as "whimsy so inevitable it felt like gravity," and Mira's final laugh is "whimsical and inevitable." The attribute is asserted twice but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. It functions as tonal label rather than a trait that drives choice. Label-only use; no middle beat involvement or closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Mira writes her own letter and folds it into a lotus, an act of rejoining or self-authorship. The keeper later holds the letter, affirming her pattern-finding. The action is recounted in summary ("That night, Mira sat...") rather than dramatized, and it does not drive a prior turn—it arrives as resolution. Present in the final third; thematic participation at closure but limited causal pressure. Late introduction and summary treatment cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The public art installation (suspended mirrors, twig spiral) is signaled in the first third and occupies the middle beat. The artist's instruction ("Write your own letter") pivots Mira's approach. The installation vanishes and reappears as a single mirror, shaping the ending's image. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure; its mechanics (mirrors reflecting fragments, spiral construction) matter to theme and final revelation. Causal role in two beats and ending participation elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond anchor the opening and closing beats; the installation provides a second locale. The temple's petals and pond are described vividly but do not constrain Mira's movement or choices—she visits both sites freely. The keeper meets her at the temple in the final beat, but the location does not supply resources or pressure that alter outcome. Present in setup and closure; descriptive rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the cloud bursts" is mentioned in the opening and once more ("after the clouds had burst again") but does not tighten decisions. Days pass ("every dawn," "that afternoon," "that night," "the next day") without a live clock or urgency. Time is tracked but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Functional but replaceable; no middle escalation or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find the connecting thread is stated early ("If I can find the thread...maybe I'll understand my own") and recurs in her exchange with the artist and the keeper. The motivation drives her visits to the temple and installation and culminates in her self-authored letter. However, the desire is articulated in exposition rather than tested through conflicting wants or visible costs. Present in setup, middle, and closure; told more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone is contemplative and lyric throughout, with elevated diction ("incantation," "unspooled," "prismatic quiet") and minimal dialogue. The mood remains steady—no sharp modulation under pressure—but the final image (twig in hair, thrush song) offers a cadence shift that reweights the opening spiral. Coherent across turns; the prismatic metaphor (mirrors, fragments, refracted sky) threads the piece. Static modulation slightly limits the upper band, but the ending's quiet charge aligns with the established tone.</comment>
