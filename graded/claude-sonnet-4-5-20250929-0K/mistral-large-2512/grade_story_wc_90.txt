<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's pacifism is stated but never tested by an on-page choice involving violence or mercy. Her emotional progression from morning happiness to closure smile reads smooth without contradiction or embodied cost. The stitching action shows method but not internal conflict—she never wavers, never doubts, never pays a visible psychological price for becoming "the wound." The final lightness feels asserted rather than earned through prior suffering dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sorrow through photograph beats and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ship enters the dimension; Liora remains, lighter). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure image—ship dissolving, Liora floating, locket empty—reweights prior material with felt cost (solitude, emptiness). One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket warms and she realizes she must "become the wound," narrowing her path to self-sacrifice. The causal step from stitching memories to opening the dimension relies on metaphor more than dramatized mechanism, but the lens accommodates pattern-driven intensification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The *Euthymia*'s recycled hull, algae glow, and papered photographs create vivid micro-setting. The photographs constrain Liora's method and charge the closure (she stitches them, they peel back, the ship enters). Spatial choreography is clean: engine heart, walls, images. The "locked dimension" remains abstract—a "silence," a "wound"—without sensory anchors or mechanics that would let the reader picture it, but the ship-as-reliquary grounds the present action sufficiently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: open the locked dimension. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last photograph (woman and child) accuses "You were supposed to save us" and Liora's needle trembles—her confidence cracks, then she presses the locket and succeeds. The escalation is accumulative (photograph by photograph) rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens. Agency is renunciation: she opens the door but does not enter, letting the ship dissolve and staying behind. The cost—solitude, the empty locket—is legible on the page. Coincidence does not resolve; her persistence does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of reparative witness and sacrifice emerges through the stitching metaphor and photograph progression. The final image—child laughing, soldier laying down gun, mother weeping in joy—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. "Shadow work" and "every sorrow ever wept" risk abstraction, but the photographs ground the concept in particulars. The piece resists tidy closure: Liora is "alone again, but lighter," an ambiguous lightness that doesn't erase cost. No thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric: "floating reliquary of human regret," "the residue of grief that had crystallized over centuries." Narrative distance contracts during photograph encounters (direct address, quoted accusations) then widens for summary closure beats. The perceptual signature—stitching wounds with memory, tracing shimmer—is consistent. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("suture," "articulate") but remains within a quasi-mythic narrator's lexicon. The opening "happy this morning" gravity detail feels slightly whimsical against the otherwise solemn tone but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening long sentence contrasts with later fragments. Information density is high: "colony vessel, then prison, then refugee ark" compresses history efficiently. Two minor loops: "shadows—the ones inside her, the ones clinging" and "The ship was gone, but the work was done" paraphrase prior lines without new pressure. Filter verbs ("She traced," "She pressed") cluster in action beats but remain voice-motivated. "Kwan Yin's Tear" and "liquid starlight" reappear purposefully. The phrase "long-dried tears" / "shimmer of long-dried tears" recurs across paragraphs without functional beat change. Figurative density ("pocket of the universe where time had folded," "wound where the universe had bled out") thickens the middle but remains legible. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loops; no closure-scene artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—stitching photographs with liquid starlight to heal cosmic trauma—feels specific and non-obvious. The "ship enters dimension, protagonist stays behind" reversal is earned in hindsight. Risk is present: lyric compression, metaphorical mechanics. The "last steadfast pacifist" frame and "shadow work" language trend toward archetypal convenience; transforming them through the photograph mechanic lifts originality. The emotional template—solitary caretaker performs ritual sacrifice—is familiar but rendered with sufficient specificity to avoid stock.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora is labeled "steadfast pacifist" in the opening but her choices never dramatize pacifism under pressure—no violence is offered or refused, no mercy withheld or extended. She confronts accusatory voices but never considers abandoning the task or harming anyone. Present in setup, absent from middle conflict tests, not causally active at closure. Functional but replaceable: she could be "steadfast healer" or "last witness" with identical beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears in setup (locket introduction), middle (she pulls thread from it to stitch memories), and closure (warms, seeps into photograph, opens dimension, then empty). Three distinct beats. The liquid starlight is specific and irreplaceable—without it, the stitching lacks mythic weight and the dimension mechanism collapses. The cost connection is visible: the locket empties, the resource spent. Causal pressure high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is named in setup ("the ones inside her, the ones clinging... Shadow work, the old texts called it") but remains thematic claim rather than on-page mechanic. The photographs show others' sorrows, not Liora's internal confrontation. She stitches external ghosts without dramatized internal reckoning. Present as label, absent as constraining force on her choices. Functional but not essential: removing the term would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Gravitationally lighter when happy" appears in setup (opening morning), returns at mid-point ("her feet no longer touched the floor at all" after stitching accumulates), and at closure ("floated there, smiling"). Three touches across beats. It constrains staging (she floats during high-emotion moments) and charges the final image (lightness after sacrifice). The cost tie is oblique—lightness could read joy or emptiness. Causal pressure moderate; lyric reprise clear. Reaches 6.3 via early seed, spaced recurrence, and closure participation despite lacking a single decisive choice hinge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stitching drives setup (method introduction), middle (three photograph beats where she stitches child, soldier, woman), and closure (final stitch opens dimension). Each major turn traces to this action. Removing "stitch" and replacing with "absorb" or "heal" would require rewriting the needle/thread imagery and the closure metaphor ("become the wound"). Specific mechanics (needle of light, thread from Tear) make it irreplaceable. Causal pressure high; closure linkage undeniable; cost visible (exhaustion implied, locket emptied).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shimmer method is signaled in setup ("She traced the shimmer of long-dried tears on the faces in the images") and middle ("Each one was a door"). It shapes her approach: she must find the photographs, identify the tear-traces, press them to open memory doors. At closure, the Tear seeps into the final photograph's shimmer to breach the dimension. Two beats plus closure. Mechanics matter: without the shimmer cue, she has no target. Causal and closure linkage strong; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The *Euthymia* is foregrounded in setup (recycled hull, algae, papered walls), provides the engine heart locale for middle action, and becomes the closure agent (the ship itself enters the dimension, not Liora). The photographs paper the walls—setting supplies the mechanic. Removing the spaceship setting would collapse the "reliquary" metaphor and the final image. Two beats plus closure participation. Causal role clear; irreplaceability high. Micro-setting (photographs, locket) also constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the last human is born" anchors the setup ("The last human had been born centuries ago") but exerts no pressure on Liora's choices. Time is untimed: no clock, no urgency tied to the timeframe. It enriches atmosphere (post-human melancholy) but is swappable with "after the war" or "after the exodus" without altering tactics. Present in setup, absent from middle and closure pressure. Functional background, not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locked dimension is named in setup, drives every middle beat (she stitches to open it), and is achieved at closure (dimension groans open). Desire is consistent but told more than conflicted—Liora never doubts the goal, only trembles once. Friction between want (open dimension) and cost (becoming the wound, staying behind) is present but muted. Two beats plus closure. Causal pressure moderate; specificity high (not generic "save the ship" but "open locked dimension"). Cost connection visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" coheres throughout: solemn, elegiac diction; spectral imagery (ghosts, shadows, photographs of the dead); Liora's calm persistence. Tone modulates subtly—her needle trembles once, she smiles at the end—without breaking the funereal register. The final image (child laughing, soldier at peace, mother weeping joy) charges resolution without sentiment. Rhythm and word choice maintain consistent atmosphere. Closure image reweights prior sorrow into quiet hope, a tonal payoff that elevates the throughline.</comment>
