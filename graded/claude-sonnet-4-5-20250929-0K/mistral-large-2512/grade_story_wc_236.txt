<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is specific and embodied—his sensory loss creates genuine constraint, and his "reading between lines" through touch and vocal tremor feels lived-in. Clara's stillness and the revelation that Elias was the boy his grandmother delivered create strong contradictory pressure: gratitude layered with grief. The final choice to etch the screw is motivated by prior causality, but the cost remains implied rather than viscerally felt on the page—what does Elias forfeit or endure in this act? Minor deduction: "humanize it" as a request reads slightly abstract for peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias holds absence-as-presence, and the final image reweights his loss without explicit change. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered backstory (fire, grandmother's naming, clamp's history) and the screw-etching beat charges the ending. Cost is felt (years of displacement now reconfigured as holding something) but not dramatically forfeited on the page, keeping this shy of 8.5+. Orientation is swift: shop, morning fog, Elias at work by line three.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The water clock and fogged windows anchor atmosphere early; the screw's worn threads and its tactile cold ground the exchange. The clamp's physical handling (rolling free, turned between fingers, etched) constrains the conversation and charges the closure image. However, the shop itself—gears, brass, clepsydra—remains scenic rather than pressuring choice. Sensory detail is vivid (fog's hush, breath on wrist) but the micro-setting doesn't alter tactics in the peak beat, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Clara seeks meaning restoration; Elias must map absence into presence. The request "humanize it" and Clara's revelation about the boy deepen pressure in one meaningful turn. The etching decision narrows options (he commits to symbolic labor), and the cost—emotional exposure, years of displacement confronted—is legible but not dramatized as a visible trade-off (e.g., no shown exhaustion, no other customer waiting, no grief physically manifested in the act). Escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second tightening point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—absence as presence, memory as pressure—emerges organically through the clamp, Elias's lost scent, and Clara's naming revelation. The etched "constellation of scratches" reweights the screw from relic to map without stating a moral. The final line's "ordinary miracles" risks light sermonizing but is anchored in the prior etching beat and Clara's smile, keeping it earned. Subtext operates in Clara's still hands, Elias's oil-stained fingers, and the pause before "Elias." No explicit thesis; the story trusts particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Elias's perceptual signature—touch and sound replacing scent—shapes every beat (brass grooves as braille, voice wavering). Dialogue is spare but goal-driven: Clara's "humanize it" and Elias's "Tell me about the last birth" pursue stakes directly. Minor deduction: "trembling at the edges" and "wind through reeds" lean slightly generic for this otherwise precise voice. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the etching beat. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well (short exchanges, longer reflective blocks), and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several overwriting slips: "the kind of hush that muffled footsteps" is scaffolding; "emotional terrain in the way others charted continents" is abstract; "a vow" and "a key turning in a lock" stack metaphors without adding clarity. The etching beat is concrete and propulsive. Paraphrase loop: "mean something again" / "not just a clamp anymore" restates without pressure. Template cadence in the opening (apothecary–tailor–aromatherapist) reads list-like. Deductions total ~−0.8 for non-closure artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost-scent repairman, midwife's tool, emotional cartography—feels specific and earned, not checklist. The etching beat transforms a repair-shop frame into grief work. However, the core emotional arc (stranger arrives with charged object, protagonist discovers personal connection, creates symbolic resolution) follows a familiar template. The named-boy reveal and screw-as-map lift it above derivative, but the final "ordinary miracles" line and "just needed someone to listen" edge toward epiphany phrasing. Risk-taking is modest; the piece executes its premise cleanly rather than subverting it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias (aromatherapist who lost smell) is present throughout. Setup: established by paragraph four. Development: his sensory loss constrains how he reads Clara (touch, vocal tremor). Payoff: the etching decision draws on his history of mapping by touch. Causal pressure: the loss enables his empathy and method. Cost: implicit (years of displacement) but not visibly traded on the page. Swappability: a craftsman with another sensory loss could function similarly with minor edits. Two-gate strength (development + payoff) with modest causal pressure and specificity cap this at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Midwife's birthing clamp screw is present in four beats: rolls free (intro), Elias examines threads, returned to box, etched with marks. Setup: paragraph six. Development: its worn threads and cold weight anchor Clara's request. Payoff: the etching transforms it from relic to map, charging the final exchange. Causal pressure: the screw's history (generations of births, grandmother's last case) drives Clara's visit and Elias's symbolic labor. Cost linkage: visible (etched marks foreclose its original function). High specificity: no generic tool could replace it. Strong three-gate integration with closure participation earns high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Core Concept (reading between lines) is stated in paragraph five and enacted when Elias infers "You're not here to fix the clamp." Setup: mid-story. Development: his interpretive skill (grip on pocket watch, pauses betraying grief) is described but not dramatized in a choice under pressure. Payoff: the etching itself is literal mark-making, not subtext-reading. The concept frames his expertise but does not constrain options or change tactics on the page. Modest causal role (explains his empathy) without visible cost or irreplaceability. Single meaningful beat (the inference) places this in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attribute (maps emotional terrain) is introduced in paragraph five and literalized in the etching beat ("Mapping… Not a place. A moment."). Setup: early. Development: the metaphor guides his approach but doesn't constrain a middle choice—he etches because of Clara's story, not because mapping itself forced a trade-off. Payoff: the etched "constellation" enacts the trait. Causal pressure: modest; the trait describes rather than drives. Swappability: another symbolic gesture (engraving names, words) could function similarly. Two-gate presence (setup + payoff) with lyric reprise but limited constraint caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Action (humanize) is Clara's explicit request (paragraph eleven) and the etching beat fulfills it. Setup: signaled at the story's midpoint. Development: the request pivots Elias from repair to symbolic labor. Payoff: the etching and Clara's "It's not just a clamp anymore" close the action. Causal pressure: the request drives the turn. Cost: Elias's emotional exposure is implied but not shown as visible effort or trade-off. Swappability: another symbolic transformation (polishing, inscribing) could satisfy the request with edits. Two strong gates (development + payoff) with moderate causal work place this in low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Method (through occluded views) is referenced in paragraph ten ("Elias understood occluded views") but not enacted as a visible tactic. Setup: stated late (60% mark). Development: the concept describes his empathy (reading grip, pauses) but these are backstory examples, not on-page choices under pressure. Payoff: absent—the etching is direct symbolic labor, not oblique reading. The method is thematic dressing rather than a constraint on action. Single weak beat (the statement itself) with no causal pressure or closure participation caps at mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting (water clock repair shop) is anchored in the opening paragraph and the water clock chimes at the end. Setup: immediate. Development: the counter, tweezers, and oil stains provide props but don't constrain Elias's choice—the etching could occur in any workshop. Payoff: the water clock's chime punctuates the ending but doesn't reweight meaning; it's atmospheric rather than causal. Micro-setting (the screw, Elias's hands) does more work than the shop itself. Two-gate presence (setup + closure cameo) without tactical constraint or cost places this in low-mid 5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Timeframe (within the hush of morning fog) is established in paragraph two and referenced at closure ("fog was lifting"). Setup: early. Development: the fog provides atmosphere but doesn't tighten decision or alter tactics—the conversation and etching unfold without time pressure. Payoff: the lifting fog is a symbolic grace note, not a reweighting of stakes. The morning window doesn't constrain or enable action; any quiet hour would function identically. Two-gate presence (setup + closure mention) without causal work or cost caps at mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Motivation (to unveil ordinary miracles) is stated in the final paragraph ("ordinary miracles didn't need to be unveiled"). Setup: absent until the ending. Development: not dramatized—Elias's choices are driven by Clara's request and his empathy, not an explicit desire to unveil miracles. Payoff: the phrase appears but as thematic commentary rather than earned insight from prior friction. The motivation is told, not shown in conflicted choice. Single weak beat (the statement) without setup or middle friction places this in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone (trembling calm) is established through "fogged windows," "hush," "voice steady but trembling at the edges," and sustained across the exchange and etching. Setup: immediate. Development: the tone holds through Clara's revelation and Elias's quiet labor without jarring shifts. Payoff: "Clara smiled" and the "clear and bright" chime modulate the tone toward resolution without breaking coherence. The tone charges the final image by maintaining restraint. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation across beats with closure linkage earn mid-6s; lack of dramatic tonal shift under peak pressure (the naming reveal) keeps it shy of 7+.</comment>
