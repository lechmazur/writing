<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied in the opening ("his breath fogging the salt-crusted glass"), and his micro-choices—deciding to investigate via gaps, sitting beside the empty space—are character-particular. However, the borrowed-memories passage veers into convenient epiphany: "A mountain pass, a woman in a red shawl, the bitter taste of absinthe" arrive as atmospheric download rather than embodied perception earned through Elias's lived experience. The final promise to tend the story feels asserted rather than tested under pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path shapes that choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: it layers perception, memory-as-artifact, and atmospheric density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias accepts the boutonnière as bequest and keeper role. The orientation test is satisfied (Elias, dock, twilight by ~60 words). Cost is legible but oblique: he inherits an unasked burden, "softly persistent," which reweights his routine. A single meaningful deepening—the shift from observer to keeper—suffices for this length. The closure lands on the page, though the "promise" risks summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight anchor immediately and filter through Elias's seventeen-year familiarity. The boutonnière functions as micro-setting, its brittle petals "like parchment" returning with "slightly less brittle" texture after mist contact—a small constraint that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong (salt-crusted glass, the "crunch of snow" borrowed memory). The lighthouse beam's recurrent sweep provides spatial rhythm without becoming static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early. Pressure coheres through Elias's investigative choice ("not by digging through pockets… observe the gaps"), and the borrowed memories deepen understanding in one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is modest: Elias encounters no opposition, and the final decision to keep the boutonnière does not foreclose a live alternative path with visible cost. The stranger's passive death and Elias's receptive role limit agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the boutonnière's shift (brittle → breathable) and the contrast between Elias's empty routine and the stranger's heavy grief. The final image—"tend to it, softly persistent, like the light"—reweights prior material without a stated moral, offering a quiet answer to isolation and burden. Subtext operates in the gaps Elias observes and the "borrowed memories" he inherits. A small thematic echo ("softly persistent" reused from the stranger's lingering presence) borders on label but remains tolerable within the lyric design.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, anchored to Elias's perceptual signature: "salt-crusted glass," "the sea's endless patience." The borrowed-memory passage introduces minor distance wobble—Elias acquires detailed alpine images (cowbells, absinthe café) without clear transmission mechanism—but the piece signals this as lyric inheritance rather than realistic flashback. Diction remains mostly voice-consistent; "the gaps between what was said and what was left unsaid" is slightly thesis-like but serves closure. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "mist that curled like ghostly fingers," "breath escaping like a whisper lost to the wind," "memories… fit, like pieces of a puzzle," "opal planks." In the borrowed-memory beat, three consecutive sentences use simile or metaphor without respite, creating overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence appears in "He'd come to pass on… The memories, the grief, the unspoken love… all of it, borrowed and now bequeathed" (list-driven summary). Paraphrase loop: "borrowed memories" restated three times across adjacent paragraphs. Apply −0.8 for density + template + loop within the non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper inherits a stranger's memories via boutonnière—reads fresh in its particulars (opal dock, alpine Edelweiss, "borrowed" as exact verb). However, the emotional arc (solitary keeper finds meaning in tending another's loss) fits a familiar lyric template: the empathic witness. The "gaps" investigation method is signaled but not enacted with sufficient specificity—Elias claims to observe gaps yet the borrowed memories arrive as gift rather than deduction. Execution is competent but does not transform the template into an inevitable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes two on-page choices: to investigate and to keep the boutonnière. The second choice shapes the ending. However, his decisions do not create reversals or alter tactics under opposition; he receives rather than pursues. Early setup (paragraph 1), middle development (investigate decision), and closure participation all present, satisfying the three gates. Causal pressure is mild: he could walk away with no on-page cost. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, minus swappability −0.6 (another observer role could replace him) = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The boutonnière appears in three beats: Elias finds it (paragraph 5), observes its brittle state and alpine scent, then at closure notes its petals "slightly less brittle" after mist contact, which primes his decision to keep it. Early setup (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2), and the textural shift (brittle → breathable) provides specificity (+0.5). No major cost is tied directly to the object itself (−0.3). Total ~7.8, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are named and thematically central, but the concept does not shape on-page tactics or choices in a causal way. The memories arrive as atmospheric gift (mountain pass, woman in red shawl, absinthe) without altering Elias's investigative method or constraining his options. Setup late (second third, −0.3), one beat (the memory-vision paragraph, +0.4), closure linkage as thematic echo (+0.5), but ornamental use (−0.7) and summary-only presentation (−0.6). Total ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is attributed twice: first to the stranger's lingering presence, then to Elias's keeper role in the final line. It modulates from passive observation to active endurance, constraining Elias's stance at closure (he will tend the story "softly persistent"). Early setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), but the trait is label-adjacent and does not visibly enable or constrain a discrete action with cost (−0.5). Total ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Investigate" is signaled explicitly ("He decided to investigate") and frames the middle third: Elias chooses observation over physical search. This decision defines his method and leads to the borrowed-memory insight. Setup (paragraph 13, ~mid-first-third, +0.4), one major beat (the investigation paragraph, +0.4), closure participation via the knowledge it yields (+0.9), but swappable with "reflect" or "contemplate" (−0.5). Total ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is articulated on-page: "not by digging through pockets… observe the gaps. The things the stranger hadn't done… The things he had done." The method shapes one beat (the investigation paragraph) and primes the borrowed-memory insight. Setup (paragraph 13, +0.5), one beat (+0.4), closure connection (+0.6), but the mechanics remain abstract—Elias does not demonstrate gap-observation with specific deductions, just receives memories (−0.4). Total ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock is present in the opening line and final paragraph, and the mist's tactile effect on the boutonnière (making petals "slightly less brittle") subtly alters Elias's perception at closure. Early setup (+0.7), two beats (opening and ending, +0.9), closure linkage via the mist-as-transformation agent (+1.0), micro-setting that charges the final image (+0.6). Minor: the dock itself does not constrain a choice, but the mist does reweight the boutonnière (−0.2 for partial constraint). Total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named in the opening and provides atmospheric anchor ("bruised sky"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track causally—two hours pass offstage between the stranger's arrival and Elias's approach, and no clock pressure shapes Elias's choices. Setup (+0.5), one mention (+0.4), but ornamental use (−0.7) and no causal constraint (−0.5). Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—decode the stranger's final gesture—is stated and dramatized through Elias's investigation and the borrowed-memory insight. It drives the middle beat and primes the closure choice to keep the boutonnière. Setup (paragraph 8, +0.5), two beats (investigate + closure, +0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), but no visible friction between wants and costs; Elias's desire is unopposed (−0.5). Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent from the opening ("no one had ever set foot on this dock except him—until tonight") through the stranger's solitary death and Elias's solitary vigil. Tone modulates subtly: loneliness at the start, shared solitude in the memory passage, quiet communion at closure. Present in all three sections (+1.4), charges the final image ("those who still wandered in the dark," +1.2), early setup (+0.6). Minor: tone remains static across beats rather than escalating (−0.3). Total ~7.3.</comment>
