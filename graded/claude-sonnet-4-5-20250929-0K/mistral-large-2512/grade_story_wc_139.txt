<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear—he's weighing whether to hand over the ink pot or help the woman—and his internal contradiction (son of a con artist who wants to "bend the world back") lands on the page. The woman's backstory about her brother arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices. Elias's final decision ("Prove it") reads as a stance crystallization, but the woman's embodied reaction ("reached for it, then stopped") is undercut by her line "This isn't how it works," which tells rather than shows her internal conflict. The mother's reflection anchors present choices adequately, but the diplomat's death and the ink pot's properties are told, not dramatized through Elias's engagement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (prep room, Elias, night) land by ~80 words, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Situational: the woman's arrival forces Elias to crystallize his stance on the ink pot, and his final offer ("by waiting actively") reweights the situation without a decisive plot turn. The closure is a Charged Poise—options are made legible, pressure is undeniable, but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page. The ink pot's mechanics (fractal patterns, equations) are described but not causally linked to Elias's choice; he decides based on the woman's bruises and plea, not the pot's demonstrated power. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman names the pot, narrowing Elias's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep room is anchored early (formaldehyde, old roses, steel tables, embalming counter) and filtered through Elias's familiarity ("clung to Elias like a second skin"). Spatial choreography is clean: ink pot on counter, woman at door, pot set "between them." The ink pot's tactile properties (cool, smooth, ink that "didn't dry") constrain Elias's exploration and charge the final exchange. Sensory detail modulates with pressure: the opening catalog narrows to the woman's bruises and the ink's shimmer at closure. Minor slip: "the city hummed with the deathly vitality" is told atmosphere rather than filtered through Elias's perception in the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias will hand over the ink pot—is signaled when the woman names it. Pressure tightens once: her demand narrows Elias's options from refusing to testing her ("Prove it"). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elias's choice to set the pot "between them"), but the cost remains implicit; we don't see what Elias forecloses by not keeping or surrendering the pot outright. The woman's backstory (brother in a cell) arrives late and is told, not tested, reducing the felt weight of the trade. The final beat ("by waiting actively") reweights the situation but doesn't force a visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (fair trade as mathematics, bending systems) emerges through the ink pot's fractal equations and the mother's teaching, avoiding overt statement until the closure line. The final image—ink shimmering "as if it had been listening," the woman stopping mid-reach—offers a non-literal answer to whether rigid systems can be liquefied. Subtext operates in the woman's hesitation and Elias's exhale. Minor drag: "something new began to take shape" in the final paragraph edges toward moralizing summary rather than trusting the image. The phrase "deathly vitality" is repeated in the last paragraph, but its recurrence doesn't reweight prior material; it restates the opening tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices the ink pot's chipped rim, the woman's "trapped" eyes, and codes objects as con tools. Dialogue carries subtext ("You're trespassing" / "I need what he had") and advances the negotiation. Voice modulates under pressure: the opening's leisurely catalog ("a scent that clung to Elias like a second skin") tightens to clipped exchanges at closure. Minor slip: "the dead watched him from their steel tables" is a stock phrase that doesn't feel Elias-particular. The woman's voice ("This isn't how it works") is distinct from Elias's dryer register, but her single scene limits full voice differentiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the first third (prep room, mother's death, diplomat's body, ink pot in one paragraph). Template cadence appears in the opening: "Not that he ran scams; he just kept the books... Not that... but..." and "The ink pot was. / It sat..." uses repetitive stems that dull momentum. Paraphrase loop: "She didn't flinch" followed by "'I need what he had'" restates her determination without added pressure. The phrase "But this wasn't math. / This was something else" is conceptual hedging that tells rather than shows the difference. Figurative language is controlled except for "shifting like oil on water," which is clear. No grammar or continuity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise (con artist's son inherits a funeral home, finds a political asylum tool) synthesizes familiar elements with specificity: the ink pot's fractal equations and the funeral-home setting avoid generic trappings. The turn—Elias testing the woman rather than simply trading—grows from his established ambivalence about his mother's legacy. Risk: the "by waiting actively" closure is oblique and may puzzle rather than resonate. The concept (liquefying rigid systems) is signaled through the ink's behavior and the diplomat's flight, but the mathematics-of-fair-trade motif is told more than demonstrated. The ending avoids safety-hedging by leaving the exchange unresolved, though the final paragraph's "something new began to take shape" gestures toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (con artist's honest child) is present throughout and his decision to test the woman rather than complete a simple trade turns the closure beat. His choice grows from the established tension between his mother's legacy and his desire to "bend the world back." He appears in setup, drives the middle negotiation, and delivers the closure line. Cost: he risks the pot and the woman's trust by imposing a test. Deduction for late clarity: the "honest child" contrast isn't dramatized until the final third ("he'd spent just as long wondering what it would look like if someone bent it back").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot is handled in setup (Elias uncorks it, dips a finger, presses his thumb), drives the middle negotiation (woman demands it, Elias pulls it from his pocket), and is set "between them" at closure where it shimmers "as if it had been listening," reweighting its earlier description as inert object. Three distinct beats with evolving use. Cost: Elias's choice to share rather than keep or surrender it outright hinges on the pot's presence. Minor deduction: the pot's mechanics (fractal patterns, equations) are described but not causally linked to Elias's decision; he acts on the woman's bruises, not the pot's demonstrated power.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Political asylum is mentioned twice: the diplomat "had been seeking asylum, or so the paperwork claimed" and the woman's brother "is in a cell three countries away." It frames the diplomat's backstory but doesn't constrain Elias's present choice; he could make the same decision if the diplomat had been fleeing debt or crime. The concept is told rather than dramatized—no asylum process, border logic, or legal pressure appears on the page. Present in setup and invoked at closure, but swappable with other flight motives.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is demonstrated through the ink's behavior (fractal patterns, equations, "turned rules into suggestions and borders into suggestions") in the first third and verbally invoked at closure ("the only way out is if I prove the numbers are wrong"). It shapes the thematic stake but doesn't constrain a physical choice—Elias doesn't use the ink to alter a document or test its properties on the page. The attribute is present in setup, colors the middle negotiation, and charges the closure image (ink shimmers), but its mechanics remain told. Two-gate lyric reprise without middle dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Breach appears once, in the line "in the world of cons, nothing was ever just an object. It was always a breach waiting to happen." The word is used metaphorically to describe the ink pot's potential but doesn't drive a plot beat—no security is breached, no system is penetrated on the page. The woman's mission (proving numbers wrong to free her brother) could be framed as a breach, but the term itself is ornamental. Single mention, thematic echo only, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"By waiting actively" appears only in the final exchange: Elias says it, the woman stops, and the ink shimmers. The method is not signaled earlier or dramatized—we don't see Elias or the woman enact it. The phrase reads as a thematic assertion rather than a tactic that shaped prior attempts. Present at closure but not in setup or middle development; the piece does not teach the reader what "waiting actively" means through action. Late arrival with no causal preparation caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is anchored early (formaldehyde, old roses, steel tables, embalming counter) and provides the resource (the diplomat's body, the ink pot in his pocket) that initiates the conflict. The setting pressures Elias's identity ("his mother's last con") and supplies the woman's entry point (she knows where to find him). Spatial choreography is clean: Elias at the counter, woman at the door, pot set "between them." The prep room's function (place where "corpses were drained of blood") contrasts with the ink pot's life-rewriting potential, charging the closure. Three gates met with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is Elias's inherited frame (his mother's teaching: "a fair trade... was just math with a human face") and surfaces in his final challenge to the woman. The desire is told in reflection ("he'd spent his life watching her bend the world") rather than tested in a prior choice. At closure, Elias imposes a test ("Prove it") that seeks fairness, but the mathematics remain abstract—no calculation, ledger, or quantified cost appears on the page. Present in setup, invoked at closure, but the friction between wanting fairness and the woman's urgency is asserted rather than dramatized. Two-gate lyric without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is signaled in the opening ("the dead watched him") and recurs in the final paragraph ("the city hummed with the deathly vitality of a world that refused to stay buried"). The tone—life and death intertwined—is coherent through the prep room setting and the ink pot's paradox (liquefies rigidity, found on a corpse). It modulates with pressure: the opening catalog is elegiac, the woman's arrival sharpens to urgency, and the closure mixes stillness (woman stops mid-reach) with potential (ink shimmers). The final invocation is told ("deathly vitality") rather than enacted, but the image of "something new" emerging in the prep room charges it. Three gates with modest intensification.</comment>
