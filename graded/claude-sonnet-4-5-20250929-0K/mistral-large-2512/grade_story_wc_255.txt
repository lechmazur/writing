<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's colorblindness shapes his perception and creates internal conflict ("not about the colors...about the weight of them"), but his choices feel more reactive than agentive—he agrees to Liora's bargain without visible deliberation or cost in that moment. The final painting choice is signaled more as relief than a hard-won shift that forecloses a prior path. Mara and Liora remain functional but slightly interchangeable in their symbolic roles (wisdom-giver, mysterious bargainer) rather than individuals under their own pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (glassblower's courtyard, Elias painting, his colorblindness). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: jasmine awakens, glass shard appears, final painting integrates these gifts into a moment of artistic confidence. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elias no longer fears the canvas, and the courtyard "hums with possibility"—but the cost is implied (years of struggle) rather than shown as a fresh forfeiture in this scene, keeping it just shy of high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as more than postcard: molten silica scent, jasmine trellis, spiral of potted plants, and the kiln-warm glass shard all return and constrain or enable Elias's choices. The glassblowing details (helix of gold and crimson, phoenix color) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection (touch, scent, light-on-glass) reflects Elias's professional bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elias seeks to overcome the wall of colorblindness and capture twilight's exact hue. The jasmine's violet awakening offers a tightening—proof that "different sight" might suffice—and the final brush dip signals a shift in confidence. However, the escalation is gentle; Liora's price ("a painting...of what you feel") is accepted without visible friction or trade-off dramatized on the page, and no live option is foreclosed with felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in imperfection, sensation over precision—emerges through concrete images (storm-cloud texture, cracked jasmine, phoenix shard) rather than statement. Liora's line "Find beauty in the cracks / That's where the light gets in" borders on epigram but is anchored to the wilted leaf and earned by prior struggle. The final image (painting "the color of awakening") reweights the premise without moralizing, though it leans close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (touch and memory over hue). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—Liora's "innocently cunning" grin, Mara's "You're communicating with someone"—and each speaker's idiom is distinct (Liora's riddling economy vs. Mara's directness). Diction remains within the artisan register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "He nodded, though he couldn't see her clearly" repeats information from prior lines, and "The jasmine trembled. Petals...unfurled" could compress further. Template stems recur lightly ("Elias [verb]" openers), and "innocently cunning" reads close to oxymoron without embodied cost. No loops touch the closure beat, keeping line debt modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The colorblind painter premise is familiar from craft exercises, and "bartered awakenings" leans toward portal-fantasy convenience without clear world rules (Why this courtyard? What limits Liora's power?). The combination of glass, plants, and synesthetic painting is specific, and the final image (cobalt as "the color of awakening") avoids cliché. Risk-taking is present but modest; the story commits to its lyric-accumulative mode without bold structural deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Colorblind painter: setup early, drives the canvas anxiety and the bargain motivation, returns at closure when he dips the brush "this time, he didn't hesitate." Causal role in two beats (bargain acceptance, final painting) and shapes the ending's charge. However, his colorblindness does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost—Liora and Mara offer gifts, and he accepts. Mid-range for presence across beats without a middle tradeoff that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Concertina reed tongue: introduced in beat two when Liora plucks it and blows to awaken the jasmine; returns at dusk when she tucks it into her belt and plays "a note" to make plants sigh. Two distinct beats, but the reed's mechanics are vague (how does breath on a reed command plants?), and it does not constrain Elias's choices or reweight the closure—it remains Liora's tool. Mid-band for spaced use without causal pressure on the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings: concept framed early by Liora, jasmine demonstration shows it in action, and the ending's "color of awakening" phrase reprises it thematically. However, the barter price (a painting "of what you feel") is accepted without on-page negotiation or visible cost, and we never see the painting delivered or its consequence. The concept enables the plot but does not narrow options at closure. Mid-band for setup and thematic echo without middle or closure friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Innocently cunning: applied once to Liora's grin ("the kind that made you trust her right before you realized you shouldn't"), but no on-page moment where her cunning extracts cost or her innocence disarms a suspicion. Label-only mention without dramatized trade-off. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Awaken: the jasmine unfurling is the story's first reversal, proving Liora's power and motivating Elias's bargain; the plants' sigh at dusk repeats the action; the final "color of awakening" reprises it conceptually. Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. The action enables the plot and charges the ending metaphor, though the protagonist does not perform it himself. Solid integration with causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Communicating through plant arrangements: Elias arranges potted plants in a spiral at night; Mara notices and says "You're communicating with someone." The method appears once, mid-story, without prior setup or closure participation. Its mechanics (who reads the spiral? what message?) remain unclear, and it does not constrain choices or alter the ending. Functional but replaceable, low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glassblower's courtyard: anchors setting from the opening line, provides the kiln and jasmine trellis, and recurs at closure ("The glassblower's courtyard hummed with possibility"). The space supplies resources (glass shard, plants) that enable Elias's final confidence. Strong setup, middle involvement (spiral arrangement in the courtyard), and closure reprise. Micro-setting (courtyard as crucible) alters tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>After the phoenix rises: Mara's glass shard is "the color of the phoenix's first flight / After it rises, the world looks different." Metaphor appears once, mid-story, with no prior setup or closure participation. The timeframe is symbolic rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. Ornamental mention without causal pressure or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To find beauty in imperfection: motivation is stated by Liora ("Find beauty in the cracks"), anticipated by Elias's self-description of the canvas as "a mess of overlapping strokes," and enacted at closure when he sees the blank canvas as "imperfect, waiting" and paints without fear. Setup, middle friction (accepting the "weight" over precision), and closure participation. Visible desire-to-acceptance arc with modest cost (letting go of precision). Solid integration across beats.</comment>
