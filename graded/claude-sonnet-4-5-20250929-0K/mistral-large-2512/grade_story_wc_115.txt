<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is established as reckless and skeptical, traits that drive his entrance and his choice not to flee. The final offering of the valve wheel shows agency, but his interior remains somewhat generic—"his mind raced," "he swallowed hard"—and the stated motivation ("the truth he'd been running from") is abstract, arriving late without concrete grounding in earlier choices. The figure's facelessness and the mannequin comparison feel more symbolic convenience than embodied threat that tests Elias's specific contradictions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece holds a situational lens: Elias enters, observes escalating strangeness, and crystallizes a stance by offering the valve wheel. Orientation anchors (mill, explorer, flashlight, night) arrive early. The closure—handing over the wheel, the clanking stops, "the hush that followed was louder than any confession"—reads as Charged Poise: options reconfigure and pressure is undeniable, though the conceptual cost (accepting the ghost shift's reality) is somewhat oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs when the figure turns and Elias chooses to stay and offer the object rather than flee.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective: wet concrete, old oil, broken glass crunch, cold air in the tunnel. The beaded valve wheel is handled twice (discovery, offering) and the tunnel barrier's torn plywood matters to access. The mill's "rusted bones" and the control panel constrain the figure's work, shaping Elias's final choice to complete the gesture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—facing "the things that moved at night" and the truth Elias has been running from—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure tightens when the figure turns and Elias chooses to stay rather than run, then deepens when he offers the valve wheel. The clanking's cessation registers as consequence, but the cost (what Elias forfeits by acknowledging the ghost shift) is felt more than visible. One meaningful turn occurs; coincidence (the wheel fitting the panel) assists resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory of labor, the haunting of unfinished work—emerges through the ghost shift concept and the figure's faceless persistence. The valve wheel's return and the final hush offer a non-literal answer, but "the truth he'd been running from" and the talk-radio psychics feel like imposed scaffolding rather than organic particulars. The ending's "hush...louder than any confession" leans toward direct thematic statement. Subtext operates in the figure's touch and Elias's silence, but the psychic-caller framing adds clutter without deepening the core question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"his flashlight cutting through the dust like a knife through stale bread," "drowsy alertness sharpening"—and psychic distance modulates with pressure. The phrase "religiously skeptical" and the late-arriving psychic-radio callback feel slightly forced in register. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he thought") are acceptable but cluster in peak beats without voice necessity. Elision (the unspecified "truth") is purposeful but not fully paid off on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid pure template runs, but mild artifacts appear: "Elias crouched... Elias had heard... Elias froze... Elias followed... Elias stepped... Elias exhaled" clusters character-name sentence openings across the middle third. "The kind of" repeats four times ("the kind of scent," "the kind of explorer," "the kind of man," "the kind of cold"), a signature phrase that becomes visible. Information density is generally high, and the final line's hush image is strong, but the psychic-radio aside mid-piece interrupts momentum without clear payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned-mill-explorer premise is familiar, but the ghost shift concept (memory of labor rather than spirits) and the faceless worker offer a fresh angle. The valve wheel's tactile return and the figure's pianist-like gesture at the levers are specific. However, the talk-radio psychics feel like ornamental detail imported to satisfy a prompt requirement rather than organic to Elias's arc, and "the truth he'd been running from" remains generic. The transformation is partial: the ghost-as-worker is promising, but the closure hinges on a convenient fit (wheel to panel) rather than a bold, irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's recklessness drives his entrance over the fence and deeper into the mill, and his choice not to flee when the figure turns is key. The final decision to offer the valve wheel alters the outcome. Early signal, involvement in two beats (entrance, offering), and closure linkage are present, but the action is somewhat reactive—he observes, then completes a gesture the figure's reach invited—rather than a high-stakes gamble with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in three beats: discovery and examination, the figure's touch, and Elias's offering that stops the clanking. It is handled on the page, its brass surface and weight noted, and its return charges the closure. The wheel's unique properties (fitting the control panel) matter, though the fit reads as convenient rather than hard-won. Strong integration with minor swappability (any missing part could serve a similar function).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ghost shift is named and described (hours after midnight, memory of labor), shaping Elias's expectations and the figure's faceless persistence. It constrains his interpretation—he appraises the figure as "something that had outlived the mill's death"—but does not directly alter his tactics until the final offering. The concept frames theme more than it drives on-page choices. Present in setup and thematic closure, but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is stated early and motivates Elias's scoffing at ghost stories, but it does not constrain a later choice with visible cost. When the figure turns faceless, Elias "should have run. But he didn't"—the trait is overridden without dramatized friction. The phrase itself reads slightly forced in register. Label-only use with no on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears once in Elias's reflection: "He needed to appraise this, to find the weight of the truth he'd swallowed years ago." The verb is abstract and does not trigger a visible action or alter tactics. The earlier appraisal of the valve wheel (weight, dullness) is concrete but not tied to this verb. Mentioned but not dramatized as a distinct turning action; swappable with "understand" or "assess."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Talk-radio psychics are mentioned in one paragraph: Elias recalls their advice ("Listen to the silence. The truth is in the hush that follows") and it colors his final interpretation of the hush. The method does not shape his approach to the mill or his decision to stay and offer the wheel. Late mention, ornamental, no causal work. The psychics feel imported rather than organic to Elias's established skepticism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is entered in the middle third, provides colder air and darkness that sharpen Elias's alertness, and houses the figure and control panel. The torn plywood barrier matters to access. The tunnel setting enables the encounter and the final offering, but the choice to enter is driven by following the clanking rather than by the tunnel's unique properties. Functional across two beats with closure participation, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The phrase "the hush that follows a sudden confession" appears only in the final sentence, reinterpreting the silence after the clanking stops. Time is not tracked as a live constraint during the scene; "during the hush" reads as a brief moment at closure rather than a window that tightens decisions. Lyric reprise with thematic charge, but no middle development or time-pressure shaping tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated late ("the truth he'd been running from, the truth that had led him here") and colors Elias's decision to stay and offer the wheel, but the truth itself remains abstract—never specified or dramatized. The motivation frames his arc but does not create visible friction between competing wants. Thematic presence with oblique cost; no concrete trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is named once and the tone is present in "his drowsy alertness sharpening into something like fascination" when Elias watches the figure. The mill's dust and cold, the "slow, rhythmic clanking," and Elias's careful observation support a liminal, hypnagogic quality. The tone modulates under pressure (sharpening, then exhaling into the hush) and charges the final image. Coherent through turns, though the single naming feels slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
