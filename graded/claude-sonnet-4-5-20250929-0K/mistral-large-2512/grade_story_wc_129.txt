<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and her arc—from watching "from the edges" to believing she belongs—lands on the page. Interior work is present but relies heavily on abstract yearning ("ache of being both present and untethered") rather than embodied contradiction. The travelers function as chorus rather than pressure; their acceptance feels granted rather than earned through dramatized friction. The final choice (placing the sculpture) forecloses isolation, but the cost reads more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around the search for Veyra's tag and moves through search → discovery → acceptance, with the arbor's transformation serving as the closure image that reweights Liora's isolation. Orientation anchors late (~150 words for spatial clarity). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: Liora's hand appears as a new line, signaling graft-into-community), and cost is legible in the sculpture's disappearance and her "luminescent ache." One meaningful deepening when the tag is found and the arbor blazes, narrowing her path from observer to participant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and liquid-silver crater are vivid and purposeful. The arbor constrains the climactic choice (Liora must place the sculpture against it) and charges the final image when her handprint appears. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard and crater edge, and the glass-bark world rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (graft onto community) is signaled early and tightens once when Liora sees the tag and places the sculpture, narrowing her options from solitary observation to public participation. The travelers' discovery and the arbor's blaze provide one meaningful pressure point. However, the turn feels more granted than fought; the tag appears just as she's about to give up, and acceptance follows immediately without friction or trade-off that would raise the cost into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (kinship as chosen graft rather than blood origin) emerges from the arbor's transformation and the shift from hollow reed echoes to living integration. The ending reweights prior material—the sculpture disappears, replaced by Liora's own mark—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the scarred woman's palm-press and the arbor's silent "invitation." Minor slip: "webs of kinship" and "luminescent ache" are named rather than wholly implied, nudging toward thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Liora notices glass edges, hollow echoes, the arbor's "living light"). Dialogue is sparse but functional and carries subtext ("Some say the tag only appears when you're ready"). Prose modulates under pressure when the arbor blazes. Minor register drift: "boldly sympathetic" and "luminescent ache" feel slightly elevated for a marsh-reed sculptor's internal lexicon, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (the sculpture's "river stones" eyes both describe and evoke loss). Overwriting in the opening third: figurative language appears in most sentences ("weight of centuries," "whispers of lost languages," "invisible threads binding") without pattern-teaching, triggering density penalty (−0.5). Stock metaphor "eyes like polished river stones" and the phrase "luminescent ache" approach cliché. No major loops, but several lines hover near paraphrase ("not as they were, but as they might have been" feels slightly redundant with "glimpses of their kin"). Propulsion is present but occasionally slowed by ornamental phrasing in high-concept beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and street-artist-tag premise offer a fresh synthesis of tactile world-building and kinship-as-art. The choice to graft via sculpture rather than dialogue or confrontation feels purposeful. However, the core arc (outsider seeks belonging, community accepts them) follows a familiar template, and the tag's appearance just as Liora is about to give up leans on narrative convenience. The arbor's transformation is visually striking but doesn't fully escape symbolic convenience—it performs the theme rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora appears in setup (opens the story), development (decides to join the search, mid-scene choice), and closure (places the sculpture, final action that triggers the arbor's transformation). Her choice to "look together" alters tactics from solitary observation to shared search. Placing the sculpture is causally central to the ending beat, and her agency drives the final turn. Early signal, two distinct beats (join search; place sculpture), closure linkage, and causal pressure present. Slight friction: the travelers initiate the tag conversation; Liora's agency is responsive rather than originating.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arbor appears in setup (Liora's goal), development (she and the travelers scan it, discovering the tag), and closure (she places the sculpture against it; it blazes and produces her handprint). It is handled/used in three beats: described as destination, searched, and physically touched at climax. The arbor's transformation from silent invitation to active marker reweights its meaning. Early signal, high beat involvement, closure linkage, causal pressure (the sculpture must touch the arbor for the graft to succeed), and specificity (obsidian glass, living light) all strong. Minor swappability: another magical surface could serve similarly with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kinship is signaled in setup ("webs of kinship… thicken into something tangible") and named at closure ("webs of kinship no longer invisible"). It shapes Liora's goal (graft onto community) and the ending image (her hand joins the pattern). However, it functions more as thematic echo than tactical constraint—no middle beat shows kinship rules altering her options or imposing a cost. The concept charges the final image but remains largely abstract, not operationalized through choice. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) allows mid-band eligibility; lack of middle development and ornamental treatment (named more than dramatized) cap higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once in setup, describing the arbor's silence. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; Liora does not take a bold, sympathetic action, nor does the trait create friction. The phrase is label-only and ornamental, applied to setting rather than character. Absent from development and closure. One-gate presence (setup mention), no causal pressure, no cost connection, ornamental use, and swappability all apply. Decorative mention (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is signaled in setup ("she would dedicate her latest sculpture") and executed at closure (she places the sculpture against the arbor). The act triggers the arbor's transformation, making it causally central to the ending. Two-gate presence (setup intention, closure execution), closure linkage strong, and causal pressure clear (without the dedication, no graft occurs). Minor friction: the action is straightforward placement rather than a conflicted choice with visible trade-off during the beat itself; the cost (sculpture's disappearance) follows immediately but is not wrestled with on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shared search is signaled in development (travelers discuss it; Liora joins) and drives the middle beat (they spread out, scan the orchard). Discovery of the tag is the method's payoff. Two-gate presence (development signal and middle use, closure participation via discovery that enables the final placement). The mechanics matter: scanning bark, leaves, stones. Causal pressure moderate (the search narrows to the arbor, where Liora will act). Friction: the tag appears passively ("she saw it") rather than through sustained collaborative effort; the "shared" aspect is more stated than dramatized through distinct contributions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater edge anchor the scene in setup and provide the search space in development. The arbor (within the orchard) is the site of closure. The glass branches and liquid-silver lake supply vivid sensory anchors. The setting constrains the search (they scan trees, bark, stones) and the arbor's location within the orchard makes it the convergence point. Three-gate presence (setup, development search space, closure site), causal pressure (the orchard houses the arbor, which is indispensable), and closure linkage clear. Minor swappability: another liminal, magical landscape could serve with edits, though the crystalline/obsidian motif is specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears in the opening as atmospheric flavor ("her breath curling… like the whispers of lost languages") but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks a clock. The story unfolds in a single continuous scene with no time pressure. The phrase is poetic setup only, absent from development and closure. One-gate presence (setup mention), no causal pressure, no cost connection, ornamental use, and no tactical constraint. Decorative mention (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's desire to graft onto community is signaled in setup ("in the hope that it might graft her onto the community"), dramatized in development (she joins the search, a micro-choice showing willingness), and fulfilled at closure (the arbor integrates her mark; "You're one of us now"). Three-gate presence, causal pressure (the motivation drives her to place the sculpture), and closure linkage strong. Minor friction: the motivation is largely told in setup and the ending grants it without sustained on-page friction between want and cost during the climactic beat itself; the ache is named ("luminescent ache") rather than fully embodied through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named in setup (describing the arbor's sympathy) and at closure ("her chest tight with a luminescent ache"). The tone is coherent across the piece—longing, wonder, melancholy—and modulates with the arbor's blaze (intensity peak). It charges the final image. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise), closure linkage clear, and cadence shift present (the ending exhales after the blaze). Minor friction: the phrase is stated twice rather than wholly implied through image and rhythm, nudging toward label-only treatment. Tone is more static mood than dynamic modulation; the ache persists rather than transforms.</comment>
