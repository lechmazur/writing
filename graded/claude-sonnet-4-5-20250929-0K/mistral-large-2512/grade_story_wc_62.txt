<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is established early (honoring the dead, seeking connection with his father) and his actions align with those drives. The interiority shows genuine emotional specificity in moments like tracing his father's handwriting, but the final shift—from isolation to feeling "not alone"—arrives without visible internal contradiction or a difficult trade-off. The piece leans on reverent description rather than embodied struggle; Elias observes and receives more than he chooses under pressure, which limits agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: weekly visits deepen connection through ribbon, poem, and memory until the final reweighting. Orientation anchors quickly (Elias, workshop, Eldermere). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias drapes the ribbon as a communal banner and recites the poem, crystallizing collective grief—with conceptual cost (renouncing private mourning, opening the space to others). The lens holds and the final image recharges prior material, but the spectral voice and poem feel convenient rather than earned by prior causality, lowering the ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The workshop, greenhouse, and ribbon are vivid and particular: wet granite, jasmine vines, cracked glass panes. The greenhouse functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's path ("retracing his father's steps") and charging the final image where he drapes the ribbon over its entrance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (lavender and rain, fireflies, monarchs), filtered through Elias's reverent attention. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting evolves across weeks, supporting both atmosphere and the closure gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding his father's loss and his own grief—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the spectral ribbon, the poem discovery, and the butterfly migration metaphor. However, escalation is passive: Elias waits, finds, and realizes rather than making a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The final act—draping the ribbon—is symbolic but not a trade-off that forecloses another path. The story deepens meaning but does not tighten through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and event: grief as bridge, collective mourning, spectral mentorship. The ribbon, greenhouse, and butterflies recur with shifting weight, and the father's poem—"The shape of grief is not a wound, but a bridge"—feels earned by prior particulars rather than imposed. The final gesture (draping the ribbon as a banner) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question. Minor deduction: the phrase "thundering calm" and "shape of collective grief" risk abstraction, though they are anchored in concrete images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with Elias's perceptual signature evident in reverent attention to texture (wet granite, frayed ribbon, brittle paper). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, matching the character's meditative occupation. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Minor friction: the narrator occasionally drifts into elevated register ("quiet alchemy," "thundering calm") that, while poetic, edges toward a unified lyric voice rather than strict character-bound observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled: "mist clung to the hills like a shroud," "monarchs drifting like embers on the breeze." Information density is high and sentences advance atmosphere and stakes. However, the piece carries template-cadence artifacts (several "He had…" and "Elias had…" stems) and synonym loops ("soft as old paper" / "brittle with time"). The figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching, and phrases like "thundering in its calm" and "quiet alchemy" read as elevated diction that slightly obscures rather than sharpens. These non-closure issues accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral-mentorship premise and the gravestone-carver protagonist offer a fresh angle on grief narratives. The ribbon as a guiding object and the greenhouse as a cathedral of memory are particular and well-integrated. However, the core arc—mourner receives wisdom from a spectral guide, then opens his heart to community—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The butterflies and ribbon feel symbolic but not transformed by Elias's specific choices. The story is well-executed but does not take bold risks that heighten stakes beyond the genre template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's occupation is present in the opening beat (carving names, honoring the dead) and signals his meditative nature. His choice to drape the ribbon over the greenhouse entrance (closure) is enabled by his reverent craft. However, the carving itself does not constrain or enable a middle turn; it frames his character but does not drive beats. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in beat two (discovery in the ledger), beat three (unspooled in the greenhouse), and the closure (draped as a banner). Its scent, warmth, and glow evolve across uses, and it guides Elias's weekly visits. The final draping reweights it from private link to communal symbol. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but it does not narrow options under stress—Elias follows rather than chooses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is present: the grandmother's lore, the ribbon left "by the spectral mentors," the whispered poem line, and the father's guidance through the greenhouse. It shapes the story's stakes and Elias's understanding. However, the concept remains thematic rather than tactical—Elias does not make a choice constrained by spectral rules or presence. Two-gate coverage (setup, payoff) with moderate thematic integration but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute is signaled early ("patience that bordered on reverence," "each letter was a meditation") and recurs in his greenhouse vigil. It colors his approach but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is consistent but ornamental, fitting the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Retracing his father's path is the inciting action that brings Elias to the greenhouse, frames the weekly visits, and sets up the closure gesture. The ribbon is unspooled "along the path his father had once walked." The final draping completes the retracing arc. Three-gate presence with moderate causal pressure, but the action could be swapped for "remembering" or "honoring" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The custom is mentioned in the middle third ("had died with him") and indirectly paid off when Elias recites a poem at the end. It seeds the poem's importance but does not shape a middle attempt or constrain tactics. The method appears in setup and payoff but lacks development; it is functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is present in three beats: Elias enters and remembers his father, he unspools the ribbon along the path, he drapes it over the entrance at closure. It supplies jasmine, fireflies, and spatial metaphor (cathedral), and the setting's abandonment/life tension mirrors the grief theme. The final gesture requires the greenhouse's entrance as a physical anchor. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The butterfly migration appears in the opening as metaphor ("thundering calm"), frames the middle reflection ("wondered if grief moved the same way"), and marks the closure timing ("by the time the last butterflies had flown south"). It provides a seasonal clock and thematic resonance but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Two-gate lyric reprise with thematic weight but low tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire is stated explicitly ("wondered if grief had a shape") and dramatized through Elias's weekly returns and his father's poem ("The shape of grief is not a wound, but a bridge"). The closure gesture (draping the ribbon for "the living and the dead") embodies the shift from private to collective mourning. Three-gate presence with moderate friction between solitary grief and the pull toward community, though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone is established early ("patience that bordered on reverence," "quiet alchemy") and recurs with the butterflies' "thundering calm" and the whispered poem. The final line ("thundering calm of knowing he was not alone") charges the closure image with the tone. However, the phrase risks abstraction and the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure. Two-gate lyric reprise with strong closure linkage but limited tonal range.</comment>
