<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior is largely emblematic—"silence into music," "weight of failure"—rather than contradictory and embodied. The "silently expressive" trait remains label-only; no on-page moment forces a choice between his communicative limits and his goals. Liora has steady amber emotions and supportive function but no pressure that tests Elias. The tuning-fork strike at closure feels willed rather than earned by prior contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the heat-map erupts in color, Elias "finally heard the music," silence gains a language. Orientation is prompt (conservatory, Elias, satchel, tuning fork case). The weeks-long middle compresses goal-directed work without escalation or reversal; the final strike transforms the frame but the stakes never narrow or face contradiction. Cost is implied (silence "vast and suffocating" persists) but the page shows triumph more than trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Winterglass panes, frosted patterns, and heat-mapping device are vivid and purpose-driven. The conservatory's "unshaken marvels" premise anchors Elias's quest and the final glass-strike. Spatial choreography is clean (Elias at glass, Liora behind, device on tripod). The capsized-ship backstory and three-day drift add texture but do not constrain a present choice, slightly diluting economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: rectify silence into perceivable music. The weeks in the conservatory compress learning without on-page reversal or narrowing. The glass-strike at closure operates as discovery rather than earned escalation; nothing was foreclosed or risked to reach it. Liora provides support, not opposition. One meaningful deepening (silence reframed as canvas) but no visible price paid before the triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—silence as absence versus sum, language beyond sound—emerges through image and the heat-map device rather than statement. The tuning fork's vibrations and the final color-burst offer a non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "You've done it" and "the silence wasn't gone. But now, it had a language" edge toward overt thematic summary in the final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited on Elias is stable. Perceptual signature is present ("silence vast and suffocating," "vibrations he could almost remember") though not highly character-particular. Liora's dialogue is functional; her line "You're trying to translate silence into music" reads slightly expository. Filter verbs ("watched," "feeling") appear but remain voice-consistent. Prose modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are distinct. Minor scaffold: "The tuning fork case never left his side. Sometimes, he would strike…" and "It wasn't sound, not really, but it was something" are paraphrase-adjacent clarifications. "Eyes like polished obsidian" is stock. The closure beat ("streaks of crimson and sapphire bloomed… twisting into shapes") leans figurative without muddle. Information density is moderate; the weeks-long middle tells rather than dramatizes key learning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions and synesthetic translation offer a fresh angle on disability and music. The winterglass conservatory and "unshaken marvels" premise are specific. Execution follows a familiar template: protagonist with sensory loss, mentor figure, training montage, breakthrough moment. The transformation test is borderline; the emotional arc (loss → isolation → discovery) could transfer to other sensory modalities with modest edits. No bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (capsize survivor) is the POV throughout. His choice to come to the conservatory is backstory; on-page, he traces books, learns the device, and strikes the tuning fork at closure. The glass-strike is a protagonist action that produces the color-burst, altering his perception of silence. Two gates (setup, payoff) but limited middle development; the weeks of learning are summarized. Cost is muted (silence persists but now has language). Early signal +0.6, two beats (archives, glass-strike) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.5 (another traumatized seeker would fit), summary middle −0.6, late true agency (final third strike) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Tuning fork case introduced early ("the case at his hip") and recurs ("never left his side"). The fork is struck twice: once to watch vibrations register blue, once at closure against the glass. Static between those beats; no evolving use or reweighted meaning. Two gates (setup, payoff) but middle development is absent. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, swappability −0.6 (any resonant object could serve), ornamental middle −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is Liora's thematic label for the conservatory's purpose. It frames expectation but does not constrain Elias's on-page choices or alter tactics. Appears in exposition, echoed implicitly at closure (the tuning fork "unscratched," Elias's triumph). Present but replaceable; a generic "preserve beauty" premise would function similarly. Early signal +0.4, thematic echo only −0.8, swappability −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears once as a summary phrase ("his expression silently expressive"). No on-page moment where this trait enables or constrains action with cost. Label-only. One gate (setup mention). Ornamental −0.9, label-only −0.6, no beat involvement −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rectify" (silence into music) is Elias's stated goal, driving his conservatory stay and the closure glass-strike. The action shapes two beats (learning the device, final strike) and the ending. Cost is implied (silence persists) but not foregrounded. Swappable with "translate" or "restore" without structural loss. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, swappability −0.5, cost muted −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping device introduced mid-story (Liora shows him "the heart of the conservatory"), mechanics explained, used once to register blue vibrations, then erupts in color at closure. Two gates (middle intro, payoff). Late first appearance (past 40%) −0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure (enables the final discovery) +0.8, resolves problem it didn't help create −0.8, introduced second third −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is named early, described (frosted panes, domes), and the largest pane is the site of the closure glass-strike. The setting pressures Elias's choice (the cold glass, the visual patterns) and supplies the device. Three gates (setup, middle work, payoff). Early signal +0.6, three beats (arrival, weeks of work, glass-strike) +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +0.9, specificity +0.5, swappability −0.5 (any symbolic art-space could host the arc).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" is the inciting condition (capsizing ruptured his ears). Present in backstory and sustained as context; no on-page tightening or countdown. The timeframe is static rather than dynamic. Setup gate only. Early signal +0.4, one beat (frames quest) +0.4, no causal pressure (time does not narrow options) −0.6, swappability −0.5 (any post-trauma window would serve).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Translate silence into music" is Elias's explicit goal, stated by Liora and enacted at closure. Desire is told more than dramatized in friction; no on-page moment where this want conflicts with cost or fear. Two gates (setup, payoff). Early signal +0.6, two beats (stated goal, glass-strike payoff) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, told-only middle −0.7, no friction between want and cost −0.4.</comment>
