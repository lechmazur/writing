<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is concrete and embodied—the rough texture of wood, the weight of contained space. Her grief manifests through contradictory impulses (letting the kettle build vs. pouring tea, hesitant carving vs. decisive strokes) that act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to set down the carving and accept the loft's "rust-hued peace" is earned by the prior causality of her three-year arc and the on-page carving process, though the cost feels more emotional resolution than foreclosure. Minor weakness: the "trying to harvest lessons from loss" realization edges toward abstraction rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by ~80 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through density increase (reflection on grief, steam imagery, carving strokes) toward a cadence shift in the final paragraph where the "rust-hued peace...felt like enough" reweights the dominant stake. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara stops trying to escape or harvest lessons and accepts holding what cannot be contained—a stance crystallization with felt cost (relinquishing the pursuit of meaning-making). The reflexive bulk (~35%) anchors in present stimuli (wood grain, kettle whistle, carving knife) and tilts present stance through the micro-choice to carve, satisfying BRR exception tests.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The loft is rendered through selective, mood-consistent detail (damp wool, warped floorboards, rain-beaded skylight) filtered through Elara's familiarity. The ash wood blank and carving knife function as micro-setting: both constrain the final choice (she picks up the knife, carves, then sets the lion down) and charge the closure image. The skylight's muted light in the final beat softens the carving's edges, directly supporting the tonal shift to acceptance. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (stove → window → carving blank).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's relationship to grief and the uncarved blank. One meaningful tightening occurs when she moves from letting the kettle boil (passive ritual) to picking up the carving knife—a decision that narrows options and forecloses the prior stasis. The carved lion is not Jarek's roaring beasts but "quiet...both fierce and still," reweighting what remains after loss. The cost is legible on the page: she stops trying to "harvest lessons" and accepts that "some things couldn't be contained, only held." Agency is decision (to carve) followed by renunciation (setting it down), with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of wood grain, kettle ritual, and the carved lion rather than statement. The piece resists tidy resolution: Elara's insight that grief "wasn't something to escape...to contain" is earned through three years and the on-page carving act, not declared. The final image—tea's bitterness grounding her, the loft feeling "like enough"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One minor slip: "hauntingly practical in its patience" edges toward authorial observation rather than strict POV texture, though it remains character-filtered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices texture (rough grain, warped floorboards), domestic rituals (kettle whistle, tea unfurling), and the quality of absence. Diction stays controlled and purposeful ("fractured light," "drowning dancers," "crystallize time"). No head-hopping. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she imagined," "the image dissolved") in the kettle-pouring beat is voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the carving sequence, and the final paragraph's compression ("for the first time in years") reflects earned closure rather than summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or the carving act. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph lengths create visual breathing room. Two minor issues: "the way the sound filled the silence without demanding anything in return" is slight overwriting (two abstract nouns in succession), and "hauntingly practical" + "rust-hued peace" both lean toward elevated diction that, while voice-consistent, brushes against register drift. The carving sequence is propulsive and clear. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—widow carving a lion while a kettle boils—transforms the familiar "artist processing grief" frame through specific, grounded choices: the ash wood blank as anniversary gift, the distinction between Jarek's roaring lions and Elara's crouched one, the kettle ritual as both stalling and accompaniment. The carved lion as companion rather than cage is a fresh inflection, though the overall arc (grief → acceptance through art) follows a recognizable template. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, and the synthesis of elements feels organic rather than checklist-driven.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout; her choice to carve (middle beat) and to set the lion down (closure) are key turns. Her observation and reflection dominate the first half, which trends lower, but the carving act and final acceptance alter tactics (from ritual stalling to embodied making to release). Present in setup, middle choice, and ending; causal pressure is moderate (the widow identity frames the stake but doesn't narrow options sharply); cost is emotional rather than relational or material.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ash wood blank is handled in three distinct beats: initial tracing (setup), the carving sequence (middle), and setting it down softened by light (closure). It constrains the middle choice (she must engage with it to move forward) and charges the final image (the lion as "companion, here and gone"). Irreplaceability is high: Jarek's gift status and the material's "hauntingly practical" patience are load-bearing. Visible cost: moving from blank potentiality to fixed form forecloses other carvings and cements her relationship to his memory.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Here and gone" shapes the final image explicitly ("a companion, here and gone in the same breath") and implicitly structures the piece (Jarek's presence/absence, steam curling and dissolving, the carved lion as embodiment of transience). It's seeded early (the ghost-testing steam) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, it functions more as thematic overlay than a constraint that alters tactics; the choices Elara makes (to carve, to set down) would proceed similarly under a different concept. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus lyric reprise justify mid-5s to low-6s range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is applied twice: to the blank's patience and implicitly to Elara's ritual. The blank's practical patience enables her to delay engagement for three years without rot or decay (setup), and the trait's tension (haunting vs. practical) mirrors her need to hold grief without escaping it. However, the attribute is more label than constraint—it doesn't narrow a choice or impose visible cost on the page. Present in setup and thematically echoed, but swappable with "patient" or "enduring" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Contain" structures the dominant stake: Elara realizes grief "wasn't something to escape—it was something to contain," then revises to "some things couldn't be contained, only held." The lion carving is both container (carved form) and uncontained presence (companion). The action shapes two beats (initial realization, final revision) and the ending image. Cost is visible: accepting that containment fails forecloses the prior ritual of letting the kettle boil as a holding pattern. Strong causal pressure; moderate irreplaceability (could substitute "hold" or "grasp" with edits, but the container/lion metaphor is load-bearing).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" appears once in a reflection beat ("loss could crystallize time into something sharp and unyielding") as description of grief's effect, not as a method Elara employs. The carving act might operationalize it (fixing memory in wood), but the mechanics are not signaled early or dramatized as a means. Present thematically in the middle but absent from setup and not clearly active at closure. Two gates (middle, payoff) would support ~5.0–5.5, but the method is more metaphor than tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The loft (rain-beaded skylight, warped floorboards, stove, window) is present in setup and every beat. The skylight's light state changes (fractured → muted) and directly affects the final image: "its edges softened by the diffused glow." The confined space pressures Elara to engage with the blank rather than flee. The setting supplies the resources (stove for tea ritual, space for carving) and its micro-details (steam, rain rivulets) mirror her internal state without overt symbolism. Three gates, causal involvement, and closure linkage; high irreplaceability (the loft's contained intimacy is structural).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The kettle boils early and cools by the carving's completion, bracketing the action. However, elapsed time is vague—carving a recognizable lion would take hours, not the ~10 minutes of a boil. The timeframe functions more as atmospheric marker than live clock; no decision is tightened by the boiling duration. Present in setup and mentioned at closure ("by the time the kettle had cooled"), but does not constrain tactics. Two gates, but swappable with any short domestic duration; no visible cost tied to the deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is dramatized as Elara's prior stance ("spent so long trying to harvest lessons") and conflicted in the carving choice: she moves from passive ritual to active making, then revises the goal ("maybe the lesson was simpler: that some things couldn't be contained, only held"). Friction between wanting meaning and accepting its limits drives the arc. Cost is legible: relinquishing the harvest metaphor forecloses the prior year's pursuit. Three gates, strong causal pressure, moderate irreplaceability (could substitute "extract meaning" with edits, but "harvest" ties to the agricultural patience of the wood).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears only in the final sentence but is tonally signaled throughout: the muted palette (damp wool, ash wood, bergamot, rain), the slowed rhythm (letting the kettle build, the wood resisting then yielding), and the quiet closure. Tone is coherent through the reflective bulk and modulates slightly as Elara moves from passive ritual to active carving. The phrase charges the final image by naming the achieved state without summary. Two gates (setup as pattern, payoff as explicit naming); strong closure linkage and specificity ("rust-hued" is irreplaceable color/texture). Cost: accepting this modest peace forecloses grander resolutions.</comment>
