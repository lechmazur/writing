<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's resourcefulness is embodied through concrete actions (hoarding the key, following puddle reflections, uploading the drive), and her final smile carries contradictory weight—triumph and acceptance of erasure. However, interiority leans toward stock revolutionary phrasing ("the tyranny of indifference," "hold the line") that flattens character-particular texture. The enforcers' wavering rifles and her step forward suggest agency, but the cost of her choice—capture, erasure, or death—remains abstract rather than viscerally grounded in bodily or relational stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece infers a Causal lens: key → tunnel → console → broadcast → enforcer hesitation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs (Lira, auric lagoon, post-coup present). The closure unit is a Decisive Change: the broadcast cracks the regime's narrative monopoly, and Lira's smile + forward step reconfigure her from drifter to catalyst. Cost is visible in the enforcers' presence and the implication of capture, though the exact price (death, imprisonment) remains off-page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the upload succeeds and the world "holds its breath."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon's golden shimmer and the puddle-map anchor the opening and guide Lira's path, constraining navigation. The maintenance hatch, tunnel water, and humming servers ground the infiltration with tactile, sensory specifics. The starlight filtering through grates in the final beat charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (reeds → hatch → tunnel → chamber → doors burst open), and the environment supplies both clue (puddles) and obstacle (enforcers).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing revised histories to crack the regime's illusion—is signaled early and escalates through the tunnel descent, console discovery, and enforcer arrival. Lira's agency drives each turn: she chooses to use the key, to upload the drive, to press ENTER despite armed opposition. The broadcast succeeds, and the enforcers' hesitation dramatizes immediate consequence. Cost is legible in her forward step toward capture, though the final price (death or imprisonment) is deferred off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of erasure versus persistence emerges through concrete images (dead screens, *YOU WERE NEVER HERE*, the broadcast spilling truth) and Lira's final assertion that "the past wasn't just revised. It was rewritten. And so was she." However, the closing paragraph risks direct thematic statement ("the tyranny of indifference," "new rebels would rise") that edges toward summary rather than earned resonance. The auric lagoon's return in the final lines offers a charged reprise, but the didactic tone slightly undercuts ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and Lira's perceptual signature—selective attention to reflections, ruins, screens—reads character-specific. Diction is controlled with purposeful compression ("liquid fire," "ghost of voices"), though phrases like "the tyranny of indifference" and "hold the line" feel slightly elevated beyond her lived idiom under crisis pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains tight. The rat cameo and Lira's bitter laugh add texture, but the final paragraph's declarative certainty ("And so was she") slightly flattens voice modulation at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (auric lagoon, liquid fire, jagged lines) remains coherent without muddle. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character goal, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in "She had known, of course—everyone whispered" (filter + summary) and "No one would remember the resistance. No one would remember *her*" (paraphrase loop), but these do not obscure causality. The final image's syntax ("the auric lagoon's glow painting her path in gold") sustains propulsion through closure. No significant loop or artifact clusters; clarity and momentum hold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The revised-histories premise and puddle-map method offer specific, non-obvious inflections on resistance narratives. The phone booth key as relic of an erased network is a fresh detail. However, the emotional arc (underestimated rebel broadcasts truth, regime cracks) follows a familiar template without deeper transformation: Lira's internal contradictions and the regime's human cost remain under-explored. The auric lagoon and starlight motifs add texture but do not fundamentally alter the trajectory. Risk-taking is present in the lyric compression and the quiet ending, yet the piece does not fully commit to a bold structural or moral calculus that redefines genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira (underestimated rebel) is present throughout and makes key decisions: following puddles, entering the tunnel, uploading the drive, pressing ENTER despite enforcers. Her choices drive all major turns. The "underestimated" trait is signaled early ("dismissed as just another drifter") and paid off when the broadcast succeeds and enforcers hesitate. Cost is visible in her forward step toward capture. Three gates met (setup, middle choice, closure participation) with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears in paragraph 2 ("fingers tightening around the phone booth key"), is used to unlock the hatch (paragraph 9: "The key fit"), and burns in her pocket at closure (final paragraphs). The key's defunct-network origin ties thematically to erasure but does not materially constrain tactics beyond unlocking one door—a functional but somewhat replaceable role. Three gates met (setup, development, closure mention), but causal pressure is moderate and specificity is limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Revised histories shape the dominant stake: Lira discovers *REVISION IN PROGRESS* on the console, uploads files exposing "the real shape of the coup," and the broadcast cracks the regime's narrative control. The concept drives her goal, the enforcers' arrival, and the ending's consequence (enforcers hesitate, new maps/rebels will rise). Three gates met with strong causal pressure and decisive closure linkage. Cost is visible in the regime's shaken control and Lira's likely capture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is labeled (paragraph 12: "she had always been carefully resourceful, hoarding scraps of truth") and shown through the key, the puddle-map, and the drive. However, the trait does not visibly constrain or complicate a choice with trade-off—her resources work smoothly without forcing sacrifice or error. Setup and middle presence met, but limited causal friction and no visible cost tied to the attribute itself. Score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reappear" is invoked thematically in the final lines ("New maps would appear. New rebels would rise") but does not function as a concrete action Lira performs or that another character performs on-page. The broadcast makes hidden truths visible, which loosely echoes "reappear," but the connection is metaphorical and late. Setup absent; payoff present but weak; causal role minimal. Score low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map is signaled early (paragraph 6: "The map wasn't on paper—it was in the way the light bent, in the way the water remembered paths"), guides Lira's navigation to the hatch (paragraph 7: "She followed the suggestion of the puddles"), and the puddles return in the final line ("in the puddles of the city, the reflections would shift again"). Three gates met. The method shapes one key choice (finding the hatch) and charges the closure image, but does not impose friction or cost. Score mid-band with closure bonus.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The auric lagoon frames the opening (paragraph 1: shimmer, golden waters, liquid fire) and returns in the final paragraph ("the auric lagoon's glow painting her path in gold"). It supplies atmospheric grounding and the puddle-map mechanic, influencing Lira's path to the hatch. Setup and closure reprise are strong, but the lagoon does not constrain middle choices or impose tactical friction. Lyric early-to-final reprise with moderate causal role; score mid-band with closure lift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when plans unravel") is dramatized on-page: "The resistance's plan had unraveled hours ago—betrayal, or maybe just the slow rot of too many promises." This unraveling pressures Lira to act alone and frames urgency when enforcers arrive. The ticking clock (upload progress, doors bursting open, "for a heartbeat") tightens the climax. Three gates met with clear escalation and closure participation. Cost is visible in her isolation and the narrow window to succeed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation ("to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference") is stated (paragraph 19: "She had come to hold the line") and dramatized through her refusal to run, her upload choice, and her forward step despite enforcers. The desire conflicts with the cost of erasure (*YOU WERE NEVER HERE*) and likely capture, creating visible tension. Three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure participation. Slight deduction for label-like phrasing ("tyranny of indifference") that edges toward declaration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" as tone is signaled through the auric shimmer, the hidden network, the encrypted histories, and the puddle-map—freedom encoded in ruins and reflections. The tone remains coherent through turns (discovery, threat, broadcast) and modulates with pressure (Lira's bitter laugh, the enforcers' hesitation, her smile). The final image ("the auric lagoon's glow painting her path in gold") charges the tone with possibility. Three gates met; tone shifts purposefully and supports closure, though the connection to "coded" is somewhat abstract.</comment>
