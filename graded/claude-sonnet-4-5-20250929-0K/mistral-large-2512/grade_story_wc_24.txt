<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias functions as a single-POV observer with embodied attention (adjusting eyepiece, squinting, pressing thumb to razor edge), but he remains largely reactive until the final beat. The blood-sacrifice choice arrives late without prior micro-choices that establish a pattern of risky physicality or mystical thinking. Interior texture relies heavily on contemplative observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The backstory fragments from Harkin's logs anchor present stance but do not create a trade-off between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers details (fjord quiet, hydraulic hum, razor edges, horizon waver) and deepens through the blood-drop moment that snaps the horizon into focus. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "Clocks didn't measure time—they measured resistance." Cost is conceptual and felt (the pain, the clean line returning), meeting the CR standard. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words ("horizon measurement station," "Elias Voss, the hydraulic clock shepherd," "cliffs ide," "fjord quiet"). The Harkin backstory intrusion at mid-story (~40% mark) briefly stalls forward pressure but ties back to the closure realization. One meaningful deepening occurs (the blood-on-clock beat reweights all prior material).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station's physical particulars—iron girders, gas lamp, hydraulic pipes, master clock's pendulum—constrain Elias's troubleshooting moves and charge the final image. The horizon itself functions as both setting anchor and object of measurement, wavering "like heat off a stove" and snapping back after the blood drop. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: professional shepherd notices gears, pipes, pendulum hesitation. The micro-setting (workbench, clock face, razor edges) narrows spatial focus and enables the climactic thumb-press. Fjord quiet bookends the piece, modulating from oppressive to "deeper than before."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: restore the clocks' function and understand the horizon anomaly. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mantle-clock key refuses to catch, forcing Elias to the master clock and then to the blood-drop choice. That choice forecloses passivity and enacts a physical cost (the bright, clean pain). The escalation is visible but thin: most beats are observational until the final act. No secondary reversals complicate the path; the Harkin logs supply context but do not alter Elias's present options until he integrates their metaphor at the end. Cost legibility is present but arrives late.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—time as resistance, not flow—emerges through concrete images: the pendulum's hesitation, the key's refusal to catch, the razor edges "for holding on." The blood-drop beat embodies the concept without stating a moral. Harkin's margin note ("Time is not a river... a tide, and we are only foam") seeds the thematic question early. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "resistance... the friction of moments trying to slip away." No overt philosophizing in the final paragraph; the fjord quiet returning "deeper than before" reweights the opening's "eminently peculiar" scent. Elias's internal arc (understanding through sacrifice) is inextricable from the thematic inquiry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-limited POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: Elias notices "razor edges glinting," "the weight of time," hydraulic hiss "like a kettle." Voice texture is consistent—elevated diction ("eminently peculiar," "monstrous thing of water and gears") fits a clock shepherd's idiom. No head-hopping. The countdown interludes ("Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight. Fifty-seven.") function as ritual markers and modulate psychic distance without breaking focalization. Purposeful compression ("Outside, the wind carried...") anchors early. Filter verbs ("He had seen it before") are infrequent and voice-motivated. The prose coheres under pressure, though a few phrases ("something thicker, like the air itself was folding") lean toward stock metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high in physical beats: "adjusted the brass eyepiece with fingers that knew the weight of time better than most knew their own names" does multiple jobs (establishes trade, embodiment, voice). Some paraphrase loops appear: "The problem wasn't the key; it was the lock" restates what the prior paragraph demonstrated. Template cadence emerges in the countdown sections: "Fifty-nine. The station's walls... Fifty-eight. The hydraulic pipes... Fifty-seven. Elias picked up..." Stock metaphor "heat off a stove" and "like a kettle left too long on the flame" are functional but generic. The final paragraph achieves propulsion: "The clocks ticked. And the fjord quiet returned, deeper than before." No major loops or clarity breaks at closure. Minor scaffold present but does not obscure cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock-tending, horizon measurement, and blood sacrifice offers a specific angle on the "time as resistance" premise. The hydraulic-clock shepherd role and fjord-station setting are particular rather than generic. The blood-drop beat feels inevitable in hindsight (razor edges established early, Harkin's frantic marginalia primes mystical intervention). However, the core "understanding through sacrifice" arc echoes numerous quest-for-knowledge templates. Transformation is present but not radical: swap the station for a lighthouse and the hydraulics for mechanical gears, and the emotional arc holds unchanged. No close echoes of famous lines; tone and world cohere. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric countdown and conceptual closure elevate but do not fully escape the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his final choice (pressing thumb to razor edge, turning the key) creates the closure beat. Setup clear by first paragraph. Middle development is thin—he observes and reflects more than he acts. The blood-drop choice alters tactics (from mechanical troubleshooting to embodied sacrifice) and lands at closure. Causal pressure moderate; the choice is signaled by prior razor-edge mentions but arrives late. Cost visible (pain, blood). Specificity: the "clock shepherd" role is unique, but his observational stance until the end limits beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mantle clock key appears early ("lay on his workbench"), is picked up and turned mid-story (refuses to catch), and returns at closure ("picked up the mantle clock key. This time, when he turned it, the station hummed to life"). Three distinct beats. The key's failure drives the middle tightening; its success at the end follows the blood-drop cost. Causal work present but the key itself is somewhat swappable—any tool that requires correct conditions could serve the same function. No unique mechanical property matters; it's a lock/key metaphor. Closure linkage solid but specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Razor edges" appear multiple times: gears' edges glinting, clock hands' edges "sharp enough to draw blood," and the conceptual claim "razor edges weren't for cutting; they were for holding on." Setup early, payoff at closure. The trait constrains the climactic choice (Elias presses his thumb to one). However, the edges function more as thematic ornament than mechanical necessity—any sharp object could deliver the blood-drop beat. The concept "razor edges = resistance" is told in Elias's final epiphany rather than dramatized through prior choices. Present in multiple beats but swappable with minor edits; conceptual cost is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" describes the scent "like ozone after a storm that never came" in the opening paragraph. It sets tone but does not constrain any on-page action or return with reweighted meaning. Mentioned once, no middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental descriptor. No visible cost or causal pressure tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elias squints at the gears early ("Elias squinted at the gears, their razor edges glinting"). The action signals close observation but does not create a turn. No middle beat where squinting alters tactics or reveals new information that changes his approach. Not present at closure. Setup only; functional but replaceable with "examined" or "inspected." Swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through counting backwards" appears twice: first as a calming method his father taught ("began through counting backwards, from sixty to zero"), then repeated in a second countdown that frames the blood-drop beat ("He counted backwards again, slower this time. Fifty-nine... Fifty-eight... Fifty-seven."). Setup early, middle ritual use, and the second countdown accompanies the closure moment. The method shapes the pacing and frames the protagonist's mental state under pressure. However, the counting itself does not mechanically enable the solution—the blood drop does. The method is present and purposeful but not irreplaceable; Elias could steady himself another way. Moderate causal work; lyric reprise charges the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station is established in the opening line and its components—iron girders, gas lamp, hydraulic pipes, master clock—supply resources and constraints throughout. The station's purpose (measuring the horizon) directly ties to the central problem (horizon wavering, clocks stalled). The workbench, clock face, and razor edges form a micro-setting that enables the blood-drop choice. The station's "single gas lamp" and "walls hummed with pressure" create atmospheric pressure. Closure beat occurs within the station; the fjord quiet outside bookends the piece. Setup immediate, middle beats shaped by the station's tools, payoff clear. High causal pressure and specificity; removing the station would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" is mentioned once in the opening: "He had blown the whistle three hours ago... but the station's clocks had not moved since." The three-hour stall establishes urgency but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track across beats. No countdown pressure, no reference to elapsed time shaping Elias's choices in the middle or at closure. Setup present, no middle development, no closure participation. Functional context but replaceable; the story could begin "The clocks had stopped" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To understand what clocks really measure" is stated explicitly early ("To understand what clocks really measured, he had to go deeper than ticks and tocks") and again at closure ("He understood then, or thought he did. Clocks didn't measure time—they measured resistance"). The motivation drives Elias's investigation and frames his epiphany. However, the desire is more thematic anchor than dramatized conflict—Elias does not face a choice between understanding and safety, or between rival interpretations. The blood-drop beat serves the clock-repair goal; the insight arrives as a byproduct. Told-only at both ends; no middle friction where the want to understand conflicts with cost. Setup and payoff clear, middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" bookends the piece: opening line "fjord quiet" and closing line "the fjord quiet returned, deeper than before." The tone modulates subtly—from oppressive (groaning girders, hissing pipes, humming walls) to resolved. The quiet functions as both setting atmosphere and thematic counterpoint to the clock's ticks. Coherent through turns; the return of quiet charges the final image by reweighting the opening's unease as earned stasis. Lyric reprise with purposeful shift. No middle beat where the tone actively pressures a choice, but the accumulative design supports tone-as-frame. Strong setup and payoff; moderate causal work.</comment>
