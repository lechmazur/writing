<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are clear—preserve lost songs, reconcile with scholarly failure—and embodied through tactile interactions (tracing spines, holding the meteorite). The reinvention of identity carries weight, though the final choice to "stay" feels slightly abrupt given limited dramatization of internal resistance. Lena is functional but lightly sketched; her offer creates pressure without deep relational stakes. Minor deduction for the trembling-hands moment, which edges toward stock embodiment at a key beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust motes, paper trails, and recurring objects (meteorite, ledger, lyric sheet) build density toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (attic, Elias, three months) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias crystallizes his choice to stay and "help piece it together," foregrounding cost (end of running, acceptance of collaboration) with the pigeon cooing as a charged echo of his courier identity. One meaningful deepening when Lena produces the lyric sheet. Cost is present but could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic is vividly rendered—warped floorboards, yellowed paper, skylight rectangle, dust motes—and functions as a crossroads that constrains Elias's choices (hidden ledger behind false panel, Lena's entrance). The meteorite and ledger are handled across beats, grounding abstract pursuits in tactile objects. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image (pigeon on windowsill, light on meteorite) and the sense of "ruin and resurrection" tonally supports the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve/recover the lost songs, signaled early and tightened when Lena reveals the lyric sheet. The ledger discovery mid-story deepens mystery and narrows Elias's options (run or stay). Lena's offer forces a trade-off between solitude/safety and collaboration/exposure. The cost of choosing to stay is legible but understated—more crystallization than visceral sacrifice. One clear pressure point (ledger → lyric sheet → Lena's invitation) suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—recovery, homecoming, preservation versus loss—emerges organically from objects (meteorite, dust motes, songs) and Elias's arc. The meteorite's refrain ("some things survive… find their way home") reweights at closure without overt moralizing. The attic as crossroads and the pigeon cooing offer resonant, non-literal closure. Subtext operates in Lena's skepticism ("Or that some things are just lucky") and Elias's choice to stop running. No thematic echo or thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Elias's musicologist-turned-trainer lens. Perceptual signature: tracing spines "like a blind man reading braille," dust motes as "tiny worlds." Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Lena's voice distinct ("most people use graphs"). Minor register slip: "All sharp angles, but her eyes were soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again" feels slightly essayistic for the focalizer's stress level. Psychic distance modulates purposefully around revelation beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with vivid specifics ("rust-red stone," "water-stained ledger," "slow decay"). Rhythm varies and sentences do multiple jobs. Two minor issues: "Each one a tiny world, each path a story" edge toward stock lyricism, and "her shadow cutting through the skylight's glow" is a small spatial impossibility (shadow can't cut *through* glow without repositioning light source). A faint template cadence in the revelation sequence ("About the songs. About the fire."). Overall momentum is strong with no major loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The attic-as-crossroads and "mapping dust motes to predict the past" offer fresh texture. The pairing of courier pigeons with musicology avoids obvious choices. However, the "lost archive fire" and "stay or run" structure lean on familiar scholar-redemption templates. The meteorite-as-talisman and dust-mote divination are specific but not fully transformed into irreplaceable causality. Solid synthesis with one or two non-obvious angles, but the emotional arc (failure → recovery via collaboration) follows a well-worn path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (courier pigeon trainer) is the POV and drives the ending choice to stay. His identity is mentioned early and echoed at closure (pigeon on windowsill). The trainer role is more label than mechanics—birds don't constrain tactics on the page. The musicologist past does heavier causal lifting (ledger, songs). Functional but the "trainer" element is somewhat ornamental relative to his scholar history.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mars meteorite chip appears in three beats: introduced on desk with backstory, picked up by Lena mid-scene, turned in Elias's hand at closure. It's tied to the theme ("some things survive… find their way home") and charged at the ending. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics—its role is primarily symbolic anchor. Present across arc with thematic weight, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paper trails are signaled early ("paper trails had led him here"), materialized in the ledger and lyric sheet, and drive the central mystery. The ledger's discovery tightens the stake; Lena's lyric sheet narrows options at closure. The concept shapes both investigation tactics and the attic's function as a crossroads. Strong integration across setup, middle discovery, and ending convergence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias "reinvented his personal history" by burying the musicologist beneath the trainer identity. This is setup early, informs his shame/avoidance, and the ending choice to stay reverses that concealment with visible cost (exposure, collaboration). The attribute enables the arc but could be more viscerally tested—Lena's discovery of the ledger does the heavier work. Present across arc with thematic coherence; one key constraint (avoidance) lifted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Balance" appears once in the opening beat ("He balanced on the warped floorboards") as spatial detail. It does not create a turn, constrain later action, or return with reweighted meaning. The physical act is replaceable (could be "knelt," "stood," "crouched") without altering stakes. Functional descriptor but ornamental to plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes under the skylight is introduced early as Elias's three-month obsession, tied to predicting his "fractured past." The method charges the attic's atmosphere and symbolically frames his search for patterns. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic—the ledger and lyric sheet do that work. The method is present at setup and echoed lyrically ("the dust motes swirled faster") but not causally active at closure. Thematic presence without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic is setup immediately, supplies key resources (false panel → ledger, *Golden Bough* → lyric sheet), and functions as the crossroads where Elias and Lena converge. The skylight and warped floorboards are handled tactilely. Spatial details (desk, door, windowsill) anchor action and the pigeon on the sill charges the ending. The setting constrains movement, pressures discovery, and shapes the final image. Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Learning to trust again" is implied in Lena's arc ("her eyes were soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again") and thematically present in Elias's choice to stay and collaborate. However, the timeframe is more conceptual than on-page—trust is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible progression of micro-choices. The ending crystallizes a stance toward trust but doesn't track its incremental building with cost. Lyric presence without tight causal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is Elias's core motivation, introduced early with the *Lament of the Hollow Men* backstory and the fire. The ledger discovery (someone else tracking the songs) and Lena's lyric sheet directly advance this desire. The ending choice to "stay" and "piece it together" enacts the motivation with cost (end of running, acceptance of collaboration). The desire is dramatized in beats and conflicted (shame, avoidance vs. hope). Strong integration with visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" tone is present in the attic's "ruin and resurrection," the meteorite's survival theme, and the songs' ash-to-recovery arc. The tone modulates from melancholy mapping (dust, decay) to cautious possibility (Lena's offer, pigeon cooing). The final image ("Some things found their way home. He made his choice.") balances hope with prior loss. Coherent tonal pairing that charges the ending, though the "blooming" aspect is more implied than vividly embodied in sensory detail.</comment>
