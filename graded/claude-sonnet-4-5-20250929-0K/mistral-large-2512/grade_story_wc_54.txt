<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her professional lens shapes perception ("calculating load-bearing points"), but the final choice to sketch the greenhouse feels more like documentation than a decision with visible cost. The woman's years-long endurance has weight, yet her sudden appearance and immediate recognition read as convenience. The "functionally creative" label is asserted but never dramatized through a micro-choice that tests competing impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through water/greenery pattern, and the final sketching act reweights the assessment task into a blueprint for resilience. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the terminal shifts from ruin to beginning), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; Mara forfeits nothing on the page, and the woman's gesture ("take it") lands as gift rather than trade-off. The sextant's return at the end charges the image, yet the escalation from discovery to encounter feels more like reveal than tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The spaceport's "lattice of collapsed walkways," "broken turnstiles," and jury-rigged irrigation system are vivid and specific. The greenhouse's fogged glass and thriving plants constrain the encounter and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The carnival's "neon residue" anchors the timeframe without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's assessment, reweighted at closure into a search for resilience. The water's redirect and the woman's presence deepen the puzzle, but no on-page reversal narrows Mara's options—she follows the trail and is rewarded with answers. The woman's endurance carries implied cost, yet it occurred off-page; Mara's sketching is documentation, not a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—hope through redirected flows—emerges from concrete irrigation and plant survival rather than assertion. The sextant's shift from "question" to "new constellation" reprices the assessment task without moralizing. "The maze of intentions" appears twice as a thought rather than a dramatized constraint, and the final paragraph's "blueprint for resilience" edges toward summary. The greenhouse image resonates, yet the woman's one-line philosophy ("Hope isn't about grand gestures") flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's professional idiom ("load-bearing points," "calculating") anchors voice. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and the woman's weary tone distinguishes her. The repeated phrase "redirected flows" and "maze of intentions" feel slightly imposed rather than spontaneous thought. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from observation to reflection without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is strong in the water-trail sequence. Minor scaffold: "Mara thought of the terminal's bones, the way the water flowed, the way the sextant had led her here" loops conceptually without adding pressure. "A maze of intentions" and "redirected flows" recur as labels rather than evolving through action. No figurative muddle or template cadence; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spaceport-as-ruin and makeshift greenhouse combination is specific, and the sextant's shift from navigation tool to symbolic question adds texture. The carnival departure and water-redirect method feel fresh. Yet the core arc—engineer discovers hidden caretaker sustaining life in abandoned place—follows a familiar template, and the resolution (woman gifts artifact, engineer gains new perspective) avoids risk. Transformation is modest rather than indelible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity drives her into the terminal and deeper along the water trail (two beats). Her final act is sketching the greenhouse, which reframes her assignment but does not alter tactics under pressure or foreclose a path with cost. Early signal present; middle development via following water; closure participation via sketching. Swappable with "observant intern" with minor edits. Two gates plus lyric reprise, but no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: discovery, pocket-carry with reflection, and handoff at the end. Its brass gleam and constellation engravings are specific. The woman's recognition and the final "new constellation" line reweight it, yet its mechanical use (navigation) never constrains a choice—it remains symbolic freight. Early signal, middle reflection, closure reprise with reweighting qualifies ~6.0–6.3 range for charged lyric object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" appears twice as Mara's abstract thought ("The terminal had been designed for departures, but now it was a labyrinth of stalled purpose" and the final paragraph). It never shapes on-page tactics or narrows options; the water trail is the functional guide. Present by first third, echoed at closure, but ornamental—a thematic claim rather than a dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is mentioned once as her supervisor's label and noted as a "backhanded compliment," but no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Mara sees patterns in water and stone (told), yet her sketching is straightforward documentation without visible trade-off between function and creativity. Label-only; no development or closure work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Resurrect" governs the woman's off-page work (greenhouse, irrigation) and Mara's final realization that "it was about resurrecting what was already there." The concept drives the thematic turn and charges the closure image. Signaled early via "stubborn greenery," developed through the greenhouse discovery, and reprised in the final paragraph. The woman's years-long effort is causal, but Mara's own resurrection is conceptual rather than a performed action with cost. Three gates; strong thematic linkage; no protagonist enactment at closure caps high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—jury-rigged irrigation, rerouted water flows—is discovered mid-story and shapes Mara's understanding. She follows the water's path (beat two), finds the greenhouse (beat three), and her final sketching captures "the irrigation paths, the equations of survival." Early absence (not signaled in first third) but clear mechanics and closure participation. Two beats plus closure; causal but late; −0.3 for late first appearance within band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport structures every beat: collapsed turnstile, shattered viewport, central atrium's lattice, broken pipe, and scavenged greenhouse panels. The irrigation system enables the woman's survival and Mara's discovery. Spatial choreography is clear, and the terminal's "bones" provide the resources that make resurrection possible. Early signal, middle constraint (water system), and closure participation (greenhouse as proof). Essential across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The carnival's departure anchors the opening and explains the "neon residue" atmosphere, but time pressure never tightens Mara's choices—she explores at her own pace. The timeframe sets mood and provides a transition marker (carnival left / woman stayed), yet no clock or deadline alters tactics. Present in setup, mentioned at closure ("The carnival leaves"), but passive framing rather than active constraint. Two gates with thematic linkage, no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in the final third ("a new equation for hope," "blueprint for resilience") but not dramatized earlier through conflicted micro-choices. Her curiosity drives exploration, yet the story presents no friction between hope-seeking and professional duty or personal cost. The motivation is told and reprised thematically at closure, not tested under pressure. Late explicit framing; lyric reprise; no visible cost tied to wanting hope.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" coheres across the piece: Mara's professional lens coexists with awe at the sextant and greenery; the woman's "weary but unbroken" smile; the quiet final image of growth amid howling wind. Tone modulates subtly (calculation → question → quiet resolve) without emotional swings, and the ending's restrained optimism ("It was a beginning") charges the closure. Consistent through all beats, supports the accumulative lens, and inflects the final reweighting.</comment>
