<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation is clear and his internal journey from guilt to action is legible, but the transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he moves smoothly from self-forgiveness to preservation work without friction. The embodied emotion is strongest in "the weight in his chest ease" and the rope "technically gentle in his hands," but much of the interiority leans on abstraction ("silence he had once accepted"). The foundry collapse backstory anchors his guilt, yet the lack of on-page resistance or cost during the rope-weaving sequence flattens what could be a more fraught renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening lines) and the accumulative lens holds: Elias moves from kneeling with the frayed rope through transcription to the final coiling, each beat adding density. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he chooses to preserve forgotten names with felt cost ("given their names a place to live, if only for a moment")—and the aurora's final shimmer charges the image. However, the stakes remain abstract throughout; no live obstacle or reversal tests his commitment, which keeps the tightening modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elias's attention ("emerald veins pulsing," "ice seemed to sigh"). The rope's texture—"fibers yielding only when warmed by his breath"—functions as micro-setting that constrains his gesture. The final image of the aurora pulsing brighter charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for this category, but the sanctum itself provides no spatial constraint or obstacle during the central action, which limits integration to atmosphere rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained, but no reversal or obstacle complicates Elias's work; he proceeds from transcription to weaving to completion without friction. The ending offers a felt price ("if only for a moment," "their voices...ardent and fleeting"), yet the lack of on-page tightening or trade-off keeps escalation minimal. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but here the beats layer rather than narrow options, which places the score in the functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the lost-wax metaphor, the punched-card scrap, and the rope's braids all embody preservation and forgiveness without overt statement. The final image—"the rope's song still humming in his bones"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how memory endures. The piece avoids moralizing, and the aurora's approval reads as earned rather than symbolic convenience. A slight thematic echo appears in "The world forgot too easily, but he would not," which trends toward assertion, but the closure remains rooted in action and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and textured, with purposeful diction ("as if the sky itself were listening") and a perceptual signature filtered through Elias's craft ("metal, like memory, had to be coaxed, not forced"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity at the ending. However, phrasing like "the quiet breath of the aurora" and "a river of sound" occasionally drifts into elevated register that tensions against the focalizer's grounded, artisan perspective, and a few filter verbs ("He had learned," "He had spent months") dull immediacy in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., the rope's "resistance a quiet insistence that this work was sacred" conveys both texture and theme). However, several scaffolding phrases repeat structure: "He had come," "He had found," "He had spent," "He had learned," "He had not brought"—a template cadence that flattens propulsion across the first half. The figurative language is dense ("emerald veins pulsing," "steam from snowmelt," "a river of sound") but mostly coherent; no paraphrase loops or unclear action order mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, ceremonial rope-braiding, and sound preservation offers a specific, non-obvious premise that feels earned in hindsight. The particulars—punched card, aurora, foundry collapse—are concrete and purposeful, avoiding generic abstraction. However, the emotional arc (guilt → self-forgiveness → preservation work → peace) follows a familiar redemption template without a bold turn or moral calculus that complicates it. The risk-taking in the extended metaphor and lyric tone elevates the score within the mid-band, but the premise does not fully transform its scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's choice to weave the punched card into the rope drives the central action and shapes the ending, meeting setup, development, and closure gates. However, his decisions proceed without visible friction or cost—he kneels, transcribes, weaves, and coils in smooth sequence. The lack of a complicating choice or trade-off during the weaving limits causal pressure, placing the character in the "shapes one key turn" band rather than "essential across beats."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The punched card appears early (setup), is handled during transcription (development), and its pattern is woven into the rope at closure (payoff). It enables the preservation tactic and its holes serve as syllables, demonstrating specificity. However, the card itself does not constrain a choice or undergo reweighting; it functions as a blueprint Elias follows without friction. The lack of evolving use or charged reprise caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transcribed memory shapes stakes throughout: Elias transcribes the organ's melody into the rope's structure, the act defines his goal, and the closure hinges on the names "preserved in the braids of time." The concept drives tactics (reconfiguring braids to hold vibrations) and appears in the final image ("the rope's song still humming in his bones"), meeting setup, development, and closure gates with clear causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears once in direct phrase ("The rope was technically gentle in his hands") and is demonstrated when "its fibers yielding only when warmed by his breath." This constrains his approach—he must coax, not force—meeting setup and development gates. However, the trait does not recur at closure or impose a visible trade-off during a key choice, limiting its integration to a single beat's texture rather than sustained pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is signaled early ("The act of illuminating the forgotten was enough") and defines the ending's charge: Elias gives names "a place to live" and "felt the warmth of forgiveness." It shapes his goal and the closure effect, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the action itself is abstract and could be replaced with synonyms like "reveal" or "honor" without structural loss, which caps the score below the "essential" band despite strong thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rope-braiding method is signaled in the opening ("frayed edges of a centuries-old ceremonial rope"), drives the middle action ("reconfiguring its braids to hold the vibrations"), and the closure image ("coiled the rope back into its ceremonial form"). The mechanics matter: the braid structure encodes the melody's pattern, and the rope vibrates with the preserved names. This meets all three gates and demonstrates causal pressure and closure linkage, though swapping "rope" for "tapestry" or "cloth" would require only minor edits, preventing a top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are present throughout, providing vivid atmosphere and a charged final image ("the aurora shimmered one last time"). The setting meets setup and closure gates. However, it supplies no tactical constraint or resource—Elias could perform the same work in any quiet chamber—so its integration remains lyric rather than causal. The aurora's "approval" at closure reweights the setting emotionally, lifting the score into the mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after forgiving himself" is stated in the third paragraph and frames Elias's emotional arc, meeting the setup gate. However, it does not tighten decisions or shape tactics during the rope-weaving sequence; the narrative unfolds in a single continuous present without a clock or urgency. The element functions as backstory context rather than a live constraint, capping it in the "functional but replaceable" band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is signaled early ("preserving something that had no physical form"), drives every beat (transcription, weaving, the rope's vibration), and anchors the closure ("he had given their names a place to live"). Friction appears in the phrase "if only for a moment," which acknowledges the fleeting nature of his success. This meets all three gates with sustained causal pressure and a visible trade-off (permanence vs. ephemeral presence), placing it in the "essential across beats" band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is embodied in "their voices rising like steam from snowmelt, ardent and fleeting" and modulates across the piece: the sanctum's cold quiet, the rope's warmth under his breath, and the final "warmth of forgiveness." Tone is coherent and charges the ending image. However, the phrase itself appears only once, late in the piece, missing the setup gate and limiting integration. The tone's presence in sensory detail and emotional progression lifts it into the mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
