<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's gift of seeing time-threads is established but remains abstract; his motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to sketch is presented as epiphany ("Elias understood then") without prior dramatized resistance or cost that would make the decision feel earned. Internal life leans on summary ("his curse was less a burden") and label-only emotion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: time-stretched setting, family sketching ritual, and the anomaly build density toward the final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~120 words. The closure is a Charged Poise—Elias at threshold, pencil trembling, about to draw—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible as a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The anomaly's appearance and compass reaction provide a tightening, yet the final beat asserts possibility without dramatizing what Elias risks or loses by crossing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observation deck's time-dilation and star-ribbons are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elias's perception. The compass heats and spins, charging the final moment. Spatial choreography (glass, railing, pinned sketches) remains clear throughout. The setting constrains Elias's isolation and enables the anomaly's visibility, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the deck itself does not force a tactical choice at closure—it remains frame rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping time and making the station a library—is signaled early. The anomaly's flicker provides one meaningful tightening that narrows focus to the tear in the void. Elias's agency at closure is decision (reaching for the sketchbook), but the text does not show what he forgoes or what immediate price crossing the threshold will exact. The compass and sketches complicate the moment, yet escalation under the Accumulative lens needs a visible or felt cost in the final image to enter the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—"true north is not a direction, but a choice"—emerges through the compass, the family ritual, and Elias's shift from isolation to threshold. The final image reweights "confusion into exploration" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the warming compass and trembling pencil. However, the epiphany "Elias understood then" narrates insight rather than letting the reader infer it from concrete image and action, and the prompt-adjacent phrasing ("not a destination, but a moment") risks thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully (close during interior reflection, wider for setting description). Diction is controlled and poetic ("frozen breath against the void," "lazy ribbons") without clashing with the reflective tone. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling") are voice-motivated. The perceptual signature—time as tapestry, stars as alive—is character-specific. Psychic distance occasionally drifts into expository summary ("his motivation had always been simple") that flattens immediacy, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Figurative language is dense ("tapestry," "ribbons," "ghost of its purpose," "threshold") but mostly coherent. Minor artifacts: "the silence around him deepened, no longer empty, but full of possibility" and "It was gone before he could be sure" are near-clichés; "blessed pariah" and "temporally stretched" appear as labels without immediate embodiment. Paraphrase loop: the paragraph beginning "His motivation had always been simple" restates the setup without adding pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines (e.g., compass description) serve atmosphere more than plot. No filter-verb stacks or major template cadence, but cumulative minor issues prevent the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The time-dilation station and protagonist who perceives time as tapestry offer a specific SF premise. The family sketching ritual and gilded compass add texture. However, the arc—isolated seer finds anomaly, realizes threshold, decides to act—follows a template structure without a non-obvious twist. The final beat's phrasing ("not a prison... a threshold") and epiphany mode echo genre conventions. Transformation test: swapping names and replacing time-dilation with another isolation mechanism would leave the emotional arc largely intact, signaling mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias (blessed pariah) is present throughout and his isolation frames the setup. His decision to sketch at the end is signaled, but the choice does not create a key turn—it confirms the trajectory already established by the anomaly's appearance. The "pariah" status is told (shunned, left behind) rather than dramatized through on-page conflict or a tactical constraint that his outsider state enables or complicates. Two gates: setup and payoff. Mid-development, his pariah trait observes but does not alter tactics. Score in functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique is introduced early (pocket, worn edges, family promise), handled at midpoint (Elias traces the needle), and returns at the anomaly beat (burns with heat, needle spins). Three touches across distinct beats. The compass enables the anomaly's direction but does not constrain a choice or exact a visible cost. Swappable with another heirloom device. Strong setup and middle involvement lift the score; lack of causal pressure or irreplaceable specificity at closure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"True north" is seeded early (compass promise), echoed in the epiphany ("not a destination, but a moment"), and shapes the final stance (threshold as choice). However, it remains thematic rather than a tactical constraint. The concept does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page—it frames the protagonist's realization. Two-plus gates (setup, payoff via theme) with lyric resonance, but no middle causal pressure. Score in the purposeful-reprise band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" describes the setting (stars as lazy ribbons, time bleeds slower) and is present throughout. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with cost—it provides atmosphere and explains Elias's refuge. No tactical trade-off or enablement tied to the trait itself. The anomaly is a "tear in the fabric of stretched time," linking the attribute to the climax, but the link is descriptive rather than causal. Functional but replaceable; score below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Glimpse" drives the key turn: Elias glimpses a flicker in the stars, which triggers the compass reaction and reveals the anomaly. The action redefines options, shifting the story from reflection to decision. Present in setup (tonight's difference) and payoff (the tear prompts sketching). Two gates with strong causal role. The glimpse is specific and irreplaceable—removing it collapses the plot hinge. Score solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced early (great-grandmother's belief, years of drawings pinned to walls), appears in middle reflection (anniversaries as ritual), and recurs at closure (Elias reaches for sketchbook, begins to draw). Three gates. The ritual shapes the final action but does not constrain an earlier choice or create visible cost. The sketchbook date (grandfather's death anniversary) adds resonance. Causal involvement at closure and specificity (not just any drawing) justify one-key-turn band; lack of middle pressure or irreplaceability caps higher ascent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-dilation observation deck is present throughout: curved glass, dormant machinery, stars stretched into ribbons, isolated refuge. It enables the anomaly's visibility (tear in stretched time visible through the glass) and constrains Elias's existence (left behind when crew fled). The deck's unique properties—time bleeding slower, station abandoned yet pulsing—are causally active in setup, middle isolation, and payoff (glass as interface for the glimpse). Three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. The setting is irreplaceable; swapping it for a generic station would break the time-dilation logic. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors backstory (reactors failed, crew fled) and explains Elias's solitude. The timeframe is present in setup but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the on-page scene—it provides context. No middle constraint or urgency tied to post-shutdown conditions. The anniversary date (grandfather's death) is mentioned at closure, but "after the shutdown" itself does not shape the final beat. Setup gate only; minimal causal work. Score in functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is stated explicitly and guides his years mapping the sky. It frames the setup and recurs in the epiphany ("confusion became clarity, fear became curiosity"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost. No on-page friction between the desire and a competing need. Two gates (setup statement, payoff echo) with thematic resonance but no middle causal pressure or trade-off. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly; lack of embodied conflict caps it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is established early ("silence was not the absence of sound, but the presence of something deeper"), modulates through the piece (hush, pause between heartbeats, motionless stars), and charges the final image ("silence around him deepened, no longer empty, but full of possibility"). Tone is coherent and intensifies with the anomaly's appearance. The shift from empty to full reconfigures the silence's meaning at closure, meeting the high-integration test. Specificity (echoed vs. mere quiet) and closure linkage justify the essential band; the tone does not constrain a tactical choice, preventing the indispensable band.</comment>
