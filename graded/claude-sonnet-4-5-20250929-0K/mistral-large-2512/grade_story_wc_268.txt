<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and her purpose-driven competence reads as consistent, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"weight of her purpose," "sharp enough to cut"—without embodied contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The scroll discovery feels more procedural than conflicted; no micro-choice forces a visible tradeoff. The year-long investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, and the final smile lacks the cost or renunciation that would ground her stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around pattern and image accumulation—iron gall ink, the rune, constellation pauses—building toward a Charged Poise closure where Liora tucks the scroll and the constellations shift, crystallizing her readiness with undeniable pressure. Orientation is swift (temple library, Liora, pretender's reign by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scroll reveals the rune's mechanics and Liora internalizes its pulse, narrowing her path to truth-wielding rather than force. Cost is felt conceptually—she has kept silence, the pretender will crumble—but the final image stops at preparation rather than a decisive act or visible forfeiture on the page, capping closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple library is vividly rendered—sagging arches, cracked glass, warped shelves—and the loose stone mechanism delivers a concrete constraint that enables the scroll's discovery. The iron gall ink pellet and the scroll's singed edges anchor tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clean (shelf, hollow, scroll handling). The setting pressures Liora's search and the "regally unpretentious ruin" tag modulates tone without forcing micro-setting choices at peak beats, keeping the category shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmask the pretender by proving his use of the rune—is signaled early and tightens when Liora finds the scroll and internalizes the rune's pulse, which narrows her tactic from general investigation to truth-wielding. Agency is present in her year-long tracing and the decision to claim the scroll, but the escalation is cognitive rather than a choice under competing pressure; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost on the page. The pretender remains off-stage, and the resolution is poised rather than paid, capping the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth written in margins versus imposed lies—emerges organically through the iron gall ink, the erased king Veythas, and the rune's requirement of the "unbroken." The scroll and constellation imagery recur with reweighted meaning at closure: Liora's silence becomes her claim, and the pause ends as she moves. The final image resists overt moralizing and offers a resonant answer to the thematic question. Minor: "sharp enough to cut" and "the truth...waiting to sunder" edge toward stated thesis, and the scroll's pulse ("a heartbeat that had been waiting for her") risks symbolic convenience, holding the score below 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct register—"a diminutive titan," "the gravity of forgotten gods," "each mote a silent witness"—that modulates with pressure. Diction remains elevated and controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. The prose carries a singular texture in rhythm and word choice. Minor: at peak moments ("she pressed the scroll to her chest, feeling the rune's pulse") the narration tilts toward generic embodiment rather than Liora's specific perceptual signature, and the final smile ("sharp enough to cut") recycles an earlier image without fresh charge, nudging the score below 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no loops or synonym churn. Grammar and tense are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image effectively. Overwriting appears in clusters: "dust swirled...each mote a silent witness," "the weight of her purpose, which pressed upon her like the gravity of forgotten gods," "the expression sharp enough to cut" all layer figurative language without forward pressure. The metaphor "the truth...waiting to sunder his reign like a blade through parchment" mixes vehicles (truth as blade, reign as parchment). These artifacts in non-closure beats trigger −0.6 to −0.8 per the density and coherence checks, capping the category at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—scholar traces cryptic messages to unmask a time-manipulating pretender—follows a familiar template (hidden truth in archives, usurped throne, magical sigil). The piece transforms it through specific detail: iron gall ink chemistry, the rune of drift mechanics, Veythas the Forgotten, and Liora's unbroken silence as her claim. The final turn (Liora claims the rune without storming the throne) offers a fresh tactical angle. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (template quest-in-library with magical McGuffin); transformation via lived scholarly detail and the unbroken requirement mitigate but do not fully overcome the stock frame, holding the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora ("diminutive titan") drives the search, interprets clues, and claims the scroll—three beats. Her choice to take the scroll and her year-long investigation shape tactics. The attribute modulates her self-concept but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Setup early, development across middle beats, closure present (she tucks the scroll). Swappable with "small but determined scholar" without major rewrites. Causal pressure moderate; no cost tied specifically to her stature or titan-like resolve. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.6, label-only attribute −0.3 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears once in paragraph seven ("she had found such a pellet once, tucked into the spine of a book...crushed it...watched the ink bloom like a bruise across the page"), then as iron gall ink in paragraph five. Two touches, both reflective/summary. No on-page handling during the present scene; no evolving use or reweighted meaning at closure. Setup present (paragraph five mention), middle development (paragraph seven backstory), closure absent. Score: two beats +0.9, summary-only −0.8, no closure −1.0, swappable with any archival clue −0.6, ornamental −0.5 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rune of drift is introduced in paragraph four ("*The rune of drift answers only to the unbroken*"), explained in paragraph ten (bends time, erased Veythas), and claimed in paragraph eleven (Liora feels its pulse, tucks the scroll). Three beats. It narrows Liora's tactic from general investigation to truth-wielding and shapes the closure image (she now holds the tool to unmask the pretender). Setup early, development (explains mechanics and constraint), closure (she claims it and the constellations shift). Irreplaceable: story logic hinges on this exact sigil and its "unbroken" requirement. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" modifies the library ruin in the final third (paragraph twelve). One mention, descriptive only, no on-page action constrained or enabled. No setup, no development, closure cameo without causal weight. Swappable with "humble yet grand" or "faded grandeur." Score: late appearance (final third) −1.0, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.6, label-only −0.3, cap at 4.6 for missing setup, further reduced by cumulative frictions = ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears twice: paragraph two (truth will "sunder his reign like a blade through parchment") and implicitly in Liora's plan to unmask (closure). The action is metaphorical in both uses; no on-page physical sundering. Setup early (frames stakes), development (Liora's tactics aim toward this outcome), closure (implied by the scroll claim and constellation shift). The word is specific but the action itself is abstract; removing "sunder" and substituting "unmask" or "topple" would not break story logic. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability (metaphorical, not irreplaceable) −0.7, summary-only at closure −0.4 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cryptic messages in library books are signaled in paragraph three (Liora traces "cryptic messages left in library books"), exemplified in paragraph four (marginal treatise line), and implied in paragraph seven (pellet in spine, name revealed). Three touches. The method shapes Liora's year-long investigation and leads her to the scroll. Setup early, development (examples across middle beats), closure indirect (scroll is the final message, though not in a book margin). Mechanics matter: she interprets, traces, finds. Swappable with "hidden notes in archives" without major rewrites. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure indirect +0.5, swappability −0.6, ornamental final touch −0.3 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is anchored in paragraph one, described across paragraphs one–three (sagging arches, cracked glass, warped shelves, crumbling scrolls), and drives the search: Liora moves through shelves, pries a stone, finds the scroll. Four beats. The loose stone mechanism enables the discovery—without this micro-setting feature, no scroll, no closure. The library pressures Liora's patience and the "regally unpretentious ruin" charge recurs at closure. Setup immediate, development (tactile navigation), closure (the library "groaned around her" as she claims the scroll). Irreplaceable: story hinges on this exact archive. Score: early signal +0.8, four beats +1.6, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4 = ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Pause of shifting constellations" appears in paragraph five (three cycles), paragraph thirteen (pause ending), and closure (constellations shift above the roof). Three touches. The timeframe establishes duration (three cycles = pretender's reign length) and frames the closure (pause ends as Liora acts). Setup early, development (implicit pressure: the pause held too long), closure present. The mechanic is poetic but vague—no on-page clock tightens decisions; Liora's search spans "the last year" in ordinary time. Swappable with "three years" without structural loss. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (weak, no live tightening) +0.3, closure linkage +0.8, swappability −0.7, vague mechanics −0.5 = ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to unmask the pretender is stated in paragraph two, implied across her year-long search (paragraph three), tested when she finds the scroll and internalizes the rune's pulse (paragraphs ten–eleven), and drives the closure (she tucks the scroll, ready to act). Four beats. The desire faces friction: she has kept silence for a year, the pretender's lies are entrenched, the truth is buried. The final choice to claim the scroll forecloses passivity with conceptual cost (she commits to confrontation). Setup early, development (sustained across beats), closure (she smiles, tucks scroll, constellations shift). Score: early signal +0.7, four beats +1.6, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5, friction between silence and action +0.4 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Graceful collapse governs tone from the opening ("stone arches sagging like the shoulders of an old king," "slow unraveling of time") through the middle (iron gall ink "ate through paper over centuries," scroll "singed as if rescued from a fire") to closure ("the library groaned," "his crown crumbled to dust"). The tone modulates with pressure: elegiac in setup, purposeful in Liora's moves, charged at closure as the pause ends. Coherent across turns; the final image fuses decay and agency. One minor slip: "sharp enough to cut" (twice) edges toward hard triumphalism, tensioning the graceful register without full integration. Score: coherent setup +0.8, modulates with pressure +1.2, charges final image +1.4, specificity +0.6, minor tonal clash −0.3 = ~7.3.</comment>
