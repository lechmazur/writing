<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is established early with concrete interiority (the shard as talismanic object, his ritual with mirrors). His motivation to "reimagine that entire civilization" reads clear but stays abstract; the final act (speaking verse to activate mirrors) feels unmotivated by prior on-page choices—no earlier beat shows him testing this method or paying a smaller cost. Liora functions as functional opposition but remains a voice rather than a pressure that forces Elias into a hard trade-off. The ending gesture (slumped, breathless, eyes alight with hope) lands as label-only emotion rather than embodied consequence with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: the archaeological dispute frames pressure, the temporal storm supplies atmosphere, but the peak turn (Elias activating the mirrors with verse) arrives without prior causal setup—no earlier beat demonstrates this method or its mechanics. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "I gave them back their voice"), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically visible (we see exhaustion but not what Elias forfeited or risked to succeed). The reversal from dispute to mystical success bypasses on-page escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, Obsidian Archive, and temporal storm supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's reverence (chipped vase shard, light fracturing, ceiling arched like ribs). The mirrors function as micro-setting that charges the final image, and the ritual of covering them establishes spatial constraint. Minor slip: the storm's "visible threads of time" remains metaphoric decoration without altering tactics or choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elias vs. the Core's reductive cataloging. Pressure is declared (the team will "strip the asteroid bare") but remains off-page threat rather than escalating on-page confrontation. The peak choice—returning to the deepest chamber, placing the shard, speaking verse—arrives without prior failed attempt or visible cost that narrows options. Liora's challenge ("You're erasing it") supplies thematic friction but does not force a trade-off or adaptation in Elias's tactics. The ending gesture reads as unearned success rather than a decision with legible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning vs. data, poetry vs. equations, emerges organically from the dispute and Elias's interiority. The shard as "fragment of a story" anchors thematic resonance without overt moralizing. The final exchange ("I gave them back their voice / maybe I gave us back ours") risks thematic echo but stays character-bound and tied to the action. Minor penalty: the asteroid's "true story" unfolding "in verse, in the poetry of a civilization" tells rather than shows the reconfiguration, and the mirrors' blank stillness at dawn undercuts the tangible payoff of Elias's act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Elias) with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (burnished sorrow, reverence for beauty, ritual caution). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("baroque spires twisting into the dark," "air hummed with the weight of time made visible"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit (Liora's "sentiment won't rebuild" vs. Elias's "it might remind us why we should"). Minor slip: "burnished sorrow in his chest aching like an old wound" leans into label-plus-stock-metaphor rather than fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and strong imagery ("ceiling arched like the ribs of some great beast"). Opening grounds voice and stakes; closing image recharges the shard motif. Deductions: paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 ("scholars claimed… but Elias knew better" restates the dispute without adding pressure); "burnished sorrow" and "baroque spires" risk elevated register that edges toward ornament; the phrase "not in data, but in verse, in the poetry of a civilization that had dared to dream" stacks abstraction without concrete payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 cumulative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The setup (revolutionary-turned-archaeologist, temporal anomalies, mirrors that trap the past) offers fresh genre synthesis. Execution, however, leans on familiar beats: the idealist vs. corporate reductionists, the mystical solution that validates sentiment over science, the exhausted-but-hopeful posture at closure. The mirror-activation method arrives late without groundwork, reducing inevitability. The ending's hope-versus-data binary and Elias's unearned success trend toward template resolution rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his revolutionary past colors his motivation ("last revolution he had helped spark"). His key choice—returning to the deepest chamber and speaking verse—drives the ending beat. Deduction: the choice feels ornamental to his "defunct revolutionary" status; the verse-activation could plausibly be executed by any character with poetic conviction, and no on-page moment shows him leveraging revolutionary tactics (e.g., defiance, coalition-building, sacrifice under fire) in a way only a former revolutionary would.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shard appears in beat 1 (Elias tracing its edge), beat 2 (he holds it up to Liora, letting light catch it), and beat 3 (he places it on the floor to catch reflections, clutches it at dawn). Its meaning evolves from talisman of past failure to active tool for reimagining the civilization. Caps: the shard's final use (positioned to catch light) reads as setup for the mirrors rather than a discrete, irreplaceable causal force; swapping it for any reflective fragment would yield the same mechanics. Cost is asserted (Elias exhausted) but not tied to the shard's unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dispute is established early (Core archaeologists vs. Elias) and frames the dominant stake. Liora's confrontation dramatizes the conflict in dialogue. Deduction: the dispute shapes theme and motivation but does not constrain on-page tactics or alter outcomes—Elias bypasses the dispute by enacting a solo mystical ritual, and the ending does not show the Core's reaction or Elias's new standing. The concept trends toward thematic backdrop rather than live pressure that forces adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's poetic inclination is signaled early ("people who had built this place had not just survived, but thrived in beauty, in meaning") and voiced in his exchange with Liora. His final act—speaking verse to activate the mirrors—uses the trait. Deduction: the trait is label-heavy (he is "poetically inclined" because the prompt says so) without showing how his verse-making constrains his prior choices or imposes cost; we do not see him composing, rehearsing, or trading tactical advantage for aesthetic commitment. The trait enables the ending but is not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Devise" appears in the ritual of covering mirrors ("a ritual he had devised years ago") and implicitly in the final beat when he devises the verse-activation plan. Deduction: the covering-mirrors ritual is past-established and does not constrain on-page choice; the verse-activation is executed without prior on-page trial or failure, so the act of devising is summarized rather than dramatized. Swapping "devise" for "attempt" or "enact" would require only minor edits, signaling replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The mirror-covering ritual is introduced in beat 2 ("a ritual he had devised years ago") and motivates the final act (he leaves mirrors uncovered in the deepest chamber). Deduction: the method is told rather than shown in action—no on-page beat dramatizes Elias covering a mirror or suffering the consequence of failing to do so. The uncovered mirrors in the final chamber supply the mechanics for closure but the covering habit itself does not shape prior attempts or impose trade-offs. Late thematic payoff without middle development caps score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and Obsidian Archive are anchored early and supply atmospheric pressure throughout. The deepest chamber with uncovered mirrors becomes the spatial locus of closure. The setting's "carved elegance" and "temporal distortions" filter Elias's perception and frame the stakes. Deduction: the setting does not constrain Elias's choices (he moves freely, the storm rages outside but does not force adaptation), and the asteroid's baroque details trend toward postcard description rather than tactical resource. The mirrors charge the final image, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the Great Unraveling, when the fabric of moments stretched thin" is established early and supplies the story's reality rule. The temporal storm outside provides urgency ("Elias knew he was running out of it"). Deduction: time as live pressure is declared but not tracked—no on-page clock or countdown shapes Elias's tactics, and the resolution occurs "that night… at dawn" without showing how elapsed hours altered his options. The timeframe flavors atmosphere but does not tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to reimagine that entire civilization, to prove that the people who had built this place had not just survived, but thrived in beauty") and drives Elias's confrontation with Liora and his final act. Deduction: the desire is told and thematized but not dramatized in conflicted micro-choices—no on-page beat shows Elias sacrificing a tactical advantage, safety, or relationship to pursue this vision. The ending gesture fulfills the motivation but the cost (exhaustion, hope) is asserted rather than earned through visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone of "burnished sorrow" is signaled in the opening (Elias's shard from "a revolution that had burned too bright and left only ashes") and modulates through reverent interiority, ritual caution, and the final hope-infused exhaustion. Diction and rhythm ("jagged sliver of beauty," "sky writhing with visible threads of time") maintain coherence. Deduction: the tone edges toward static melancholy in the middle beats (Elias's exchanges with Liora replay the same elegiac register without tonal shift under pressure), and the closing hope reads as tonal pivot rather than earned modulation. The final image charges the tone but does not fully reweight prior sorrow with visible cost.</comment>
