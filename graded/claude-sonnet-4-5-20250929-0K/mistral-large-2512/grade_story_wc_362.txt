<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions is clear and embodied through his physical engagement with the prism and quartz. Internal contradictions emerge between belief and doubt, and his micro-choices (raising the prism, pressing his palm to quartz) show purposeful action under pressure. However, the memory of the grieving man arrives fully formed rather than being discovered through Elias's struggle, which softens agency at the key turn. The final understanding feels more received than earned through on-page contradiction forcing a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the arbor hums, memories surface, patterns accumulate toward a conceptual repricing—objects are mirrors, not sponges—that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (Elias, quartz arbor, mist, cold air) land early. The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: "not just memories, but the spaces between them," paired with the melted frost suggesting transformation. Cost is oblique—Elias sought proof but found "something else"—which registers conceptually but lacks a felt forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the man's memory unfolds, but the accumulation of vibrations, frost patterns, and prism work feels more like thematic layering than a tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor is vividly rendered—crystalline branches, spectral shards, residual hum—and the frost patterns on the car window provide a recurring image that charges the closure ("patterns gone... simply shifted"). The prism constrains Elias's method: angling it toward the arbor's core to split light is the tactic that surfaces the memory. Sensory detail is purposeful (cold air, visible breath, numb fingers) and filtered through Elias's mystic lens. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The arbor and frost work as micro-setting that shapes both attempt and final insight, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elias's communion attempt: frost reading, prism use, palm to quartz. One meaningful deepening occurs when the man's memory surfaces and reframes the premise. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on thematic reweighting rather than a turn that narrows live options or forces a trade-off. The resolution (understanding objects as mirrors) is conceptual; no visible price is paid, no path foreclosed on the page. Agency is present but cost legibility at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: prism light bending, frost patterns as echoes, the quartz as vessel. The mother's prism memory seeds "truth is never one thing," which the ending image—melted frost "absorbed into the world's quiet fabric"—reweights without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "shifted hush" and "truthful lies" framings. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("They had simply shifted...") rather than trusting the image alone. The conceptual repricing is present but the cost remains abstract, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Close third-person focalization is stable and clean; perceptual signature is consistent (mystic lens, tactile engagement, attention to vibrations). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout, maintaining an elevated register appropriate to Elias's character. The mother's dialogue ("See how light bends?") feels natural and carries thematic weight without exposition. Psychic distance modulates smoothly from close interiority to memory without head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the man's wife is not explained, leaving productive ambiguity. No filter-verb stacks or voice leakage under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled; sentence openings vary and no loops or scaffold appear. Information density is strong in early paragraphs. However, figurative language becomes dense in the final third without pattern-teaching: "truthful lies," "shifted hush," "quiet fabric" cluster without sharpening the closure image. The line "The frost did not lie, but it did not speak plainly either" is elegant but borders on overwriting for a high-pressure beat. Minor register drift ("residual energy," "dendritic veins") pulls slightly away from Elias's embodied experience. No major artifacts touch closure, but density in the final moves reduces propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—objects absorb emotions, read through frost patterns—offers a fresh angle on memory and grief. The quartz arbor and prism synthesis feels specific to this story. However, the mystic-seeking-proof frame and the "truth bends like light" insight are familiar territory, and the emotional arc (man seeking lost wife, Elias finding communion) follows a well-worn template. Transformation is present in the mirror-not-sponge reframing, but the stakes and calculus remain abstract. The frost-window method is distinctive; the thematic payoff is competent but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his observation is attentive, but key turns—memory surfacing, understanding shift—arrive rather than being forced by his decisions. His micro-choices (raising prism, pressing palm) are purposeful but do not visibly alter tactics or foreclose options. He is the lens more than the agent of change. Meets two gates (setup, closure presence) but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism appears in the opening beat, in the mother's memory, and is raised at the arbor's core to split light and surface the man's memory. It returns warm at the end, signaling transformation. The prism enables Elias's method and its light-bending property ties directly to the theme. Three beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the prism's specific function matters) push this into the essential range. Cost connection is oblique but present (warmth as residue of communion).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" is named multiple times and described as "a presence of something deeper," but it does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. It functions as a thematic label for the arbor's quiet rather than a dramatic force. Setup and closure presence are met, but development is absent—Elias does not navigate or test the hush in a way that changes his options. Mid-band functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is stated once in the opening and echoed in the closing paragraph's metaphor of absorption into "quiet fabric." It reads as a spatial descriptor (standing between pillars) rather than a trait that enables or constrains action. No visible cost or trade-off tied to groundedness; Elias's choices are not shaped by this attribute. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Commune" is the stated goal and drives multiple beats: listening with "the part of him attuned to the unseen," pressing his palm to quartz, focusing with the prism's light. The man's memory surfaces during communion, and the ending reconfigures it as "communion... with the man who had stood here before." Setup, middle, and closure all hinge on this action. However, the communion is passive reception rather than a forced negotiation with cost, which limits indispensability. Strong causal role but swappable with "connect" or "merge" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The frost patterns are introduced early, studied for hours, and described as showing Elias a face—"the man's reflection in the ice, his mouth open in a silent scream." The method is signaled and its mechanics (reading grief absorbed into frost) matter causally. The patterns melt by the end, marking transformation. Three gates met, but the mechanics are told more than shown in action; we do not see Elias decode the frost on the page, only the result. Functional across beats but lacks irreplaceability—another medium could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz arbor is the spatial anchor throughout, described with sensory specificity (crystalline branches, spectral shards, cold surface, residual hum). It pressures Elias's choices: he presses his palm to it, angles the prism toward its core, and the arbor "seemed to breathe" at the key moment. The arbor is not just backdrop; its properties (absorbing emotions, transforming them) are the story's premise. It shapes tactics and is inseparable from the closure image. All three gates, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" is named once and implied in Elias's shift from belief to doubt, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The story unfolds in a single extended moment without a live clock or escalating temporal pressure. The phrase functions as thematic framing rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Setup present, but development and closure participation are weak. Functional label, not a dramatic force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to prove that objects absorb emotions"—is stated clearly and drives Elias's actions: studying frost, using the prism, seeking communion. Friction between belief and proof is present ("belief was not proof"). The ending reframes the motivation: objects are mirrors, not sponges, and proof becomes secondary to communion. Setup, middle involvement (the search drives beats), and closure reweighting are all met. However, the dramatized cost of this reframing is absent—Elias does not lose or forfeit anything on the page when his hypothesis shifts. Strong causal role but the want/cost friction is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" is named explicitly and echoed in "truth was never pure... always bent, always fractured." The tone is coherent—ambiguous, layered, contemplative—and modulates with pressure (cold air, numb fingers, the arbor's pulse). The final image (melted frost, absorption into quiet fabric) charges this paradox. However, the tone is more a thematic claim than a felt tension that shapes choices; it colors the voice but does not pressure Elias's moves. Setup and closure presence met; middle development weak. Lyric reprise eligible for mid-band.</comment>
