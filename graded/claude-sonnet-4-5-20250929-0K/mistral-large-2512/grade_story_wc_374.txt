<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism is established early and her motivation to understand weather-carriers is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on expository backstory (UV glow, taste-sensing discovery, grandfather's stories) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The meeting with the storm-man feels passive; she asks questions but makes no choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final grip on the compass ring is a gesture, not a decision that alters her stance or options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative hybrid: the convergence of Elara and the storm-man under the aurora crystallizes the story's central question. Orientation anchors (Lavender Bluff, aurora, forests) arrive early. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara watches the trees march and tightens her grip, but no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallized with felt price. The encounter delivers exposition about "emergent compass" and "terrestrially cosmic" without dramatized consequence, reducing the ending to thematic assertion rather than reconfiguration with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aurora, bluff, and forest election create vivid atmosphere; the sensory detail (copper taste, rain scent, mycelial hum) is selective and filtered through Elara's POV. The compass ring warms and spins, functioning as micro-setting that guides her movement. The forests' synchronized march at closure supplies a charged environmental image, though it does not constrain Elara's final choice—it reinforces theme without altering her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled: Elara wants to understand why some carry weather. The compass pulls her to the storm-man, creating one meaningful tightening—she follows curiosity into the clearing. However, the encounter delivers answers without forcing a trade-off; the storm-man's revelations are given freely, and Elara's acceptance carries no visible price or foreclosed alternative. Escalation stalls when exposition replaces pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (cosmic connection, listening to the universe) emerges through concrete images: the voting forests, the compass, the storm-man's rain sphere. Yet the final dialogue ("the universe is trying to tell us something") states the theme rather than dramatizing it through Elara's choice or renunciation. The trees' march offers a resonant image but does not reweight Elara's internal question with cost—it illustrates rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; her perceptual signature (skeptic who dismisses the unexamined, taste-sensing, UV glow) is character-specific. Dialogue between Elara and the storm-man carries subtext (his certainty vs. her wariness) and advances plot. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she wondered," "she thought") and one expository block about the compass's inheritance slightly dull immediacy, but voice remains controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied; opening and closing images anchor voice and atmosphere. Information density is high in the forest-election and aurora descriptions. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "She'd scoffed at the time, but now...she wondered" echoes a template stem, and "He didn't seem surprised to see her" followed by his immediate knowledge of her reads as minor scaffold. No artifact touches closure directly, so cap non-closure debt at −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voting forests and emergent compass offer fresh angles; "terrestrially cosmic" and weather-carriers synthesize folklore and ecology in a memorable frame. Yet the core encounter (protagonist meets mysterious figure who explains their shared gift) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific cost or moral calculus. The premise is intriguing but the execution resolves into exposition rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara ("luminous skeptic") is present throughout and her skepticism frames her perspective, but her choices are limited to following the compass and asking questions. Her final grip on the ring is gestural, not a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and development are present; closure participation is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tin compass ring appears in three beats: pulled from pocket, warms and pulls her forward, spins wildly at the end. It enables the convergence and is handled on the page. However, its mechanics are explained by the storm-man rather than tested by Elara, and the final spin does not reweight its meaning with cost—it confirms rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Emergent compass" is named and explained by the storm-man but does not shape Elara's tactics or constrain her choices before the encounter. It functions as thematic label rather than stake-driver. Introduced late (second half) and resolved through exposition, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is explained in dialogue ("tied to the earth and the sky") but remains a label without on-page cost. Elara's UV glow is mentioned in backstory but does not enable or constrain any action in the present scene. The attribute is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Converge" drives the plot: Elara descends the bluff, follows the compass, and finds the storm-man in the clearing. The meeting is the story's structural hinge and the convergence delivers the thematic question. However, swapping "converge" for "meet" or "discover" would not break the logic—it is essential but not irreplaceable in specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's ability to taste weather (copper tang before storms) is seeded early in backstory and named by the storm-man ("You're the one who tastes the weather"). It does not shape her tactics in this scene—no storm arrives to test it—but it establishes her as a weather-sensitive person, creating thematic coherence with the convergence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lavender Bluff under aurora is established in the opening line and anchors the setting throughout. The bluff's elevation positions Elara above the voting forests, and she descends to follow the compass. The aurora provides atmospheric charge but does not constrain her choices. The forests' election at closure supplies a resonant environmental image, though it reinforces rather than alters her stance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The forest election is signaled early, hums through the middle, and concludes with the trees' synchronized march at closure. It provides a live clock and environmental pressure, but Elara's actions are not tightened by the timeframe—she could follow the compass before or after the vote without changing her arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to learn why some people carry weather" is stated and drives her descent from the bluff. The storm-man's answer partially satisfies it ("the universe is trying to tell us something"), but the question is resolved through exposition rather than a choice with cost. The motivation is present across setup, development, and payoff but lacks friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" is legible: the data archive, mycelial networks, and aurora blend speculative science with folkloric heirlooms (tin compass, grandfather's warnings). Tone is consistent across beats and charges the final image of the marching trees. However, it does not modulate with pressure—Elara's internal state remains steady wonder rather than shifting between loss and discovery.</comment>
