<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's interiority shows genuine contradiction—she wears the ribbon as both reminder and wound, and her response to the girl's question about promises reveals embodied hesitation. The micro-choice to give repair advice that doubles as self-reflection ("some promises don't break, even when they're supposed to") demonstrates hierarchy of values under pressure. The girl's personality is vivid through gesture and sharp dialogue, though her arc is more device than struggle. Minor: the mender occupation remains label-level; we see the repair but not the professional knowledge under strain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors WHO (Liora, quartz-eye mender), WHERE (cathedral orchard), and WHEN (after breach of contract) within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered image (ribbon, pendant fracture, orchard vows) and converges at closure when Liora's repair wisdom lands in the peach-exchange beat, reweighting "persist" with quiet cost (she accepts the gift, internalizing the lesson she taught). The RR is Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes mutual care and the decision to "let things grow" with felt pressure. Cost is oblique but legible: both carry fractured keepsakes forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and specific: moss-covered pews, skeletal rafters heavy with peach blossoms, dappled light. Micro-setting qualifies—the low-hanging bough enables the girl's perch and frames the exchange. The orchard's remembered vows and the pendant's fracture in sunlight charge the final peach handoff, making the setting an active constraint on tone and closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (Liora steps over pew, girl hops down, both handle objects). The setting reweights "persist" through the trees that outlasted their makers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora seeks to persist and bridge wisdom after a breach. The girl's broken pendant introduces a tightening—repair becomes a test of that persistence. The exchange of ribbon commentary and the final peach gift constitute one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting "safety" from talisman to self-knowledge. Agency is decision and endurance with visible cost (Liora keeps the ribbon, accepts the peach, internalizing loss). Pressure coheres but remains gentle; no reversal narrows options sharply, keeping the score mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the ribbon, the fractured pendant, the orchard vows that "turned deciduous." The final exchange—"It'll remind you that you already are" and the peach gift—offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to persist without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (ribbon-twisting, the girl clutching her own ribbon) and in Liora's hesitation. The piece resists tidy resolution; the pendant is "whole, if not unscarred," and wisdom is shown as accrual, not arrival. Minor: "quiet wisdom in knowing when to let things grow" edges toward summary, though it follows scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Liora; perceptual signature filters setting through her mender's eye (chipped mortar, hairline fracture, faded crimson silk). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—the girl's "endearingly feisty" voice is distinct in rhythm and directness ("My grandmother said you could fix anything with a crack"). Diction remains within Liora's lexicon; purposeful compression in the orchard-vow passage ("turned deciduous, shedding their meaning") elevates without obscuring. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the peach-bite closure, pulling back slightly to frame reflection without losing immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "its skeletal rafters now heavy with peach blossoms and the weight of time" anchors decay, life, and theme). Rhythm varies, though several mid-story beats open with "Liora + verb" or "The girl + verb," creating minor template cadence (−0.3). "Forgotten bag contents, she thought, though she knew better" is a paraphrase loop that restates the preceding action without adding pressure (−0.2). The closure image—peach juice, orchard, vows—propels cleanly. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Overall strong line-level control with minor scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion is a fresh synthesis; the framing of "deciduous vows" transforms familiar broken-promise material into something specific and resonant. Liora's occupation (quartz-eye mender) and the pendant-repair beat offer concrete, grounded inflection. The ribbon-matching detail and the girl's parallel gesture add earned specificity. However, the emotional arc—fractured keepsake repaired, wisdom bridged across generations—follows a recognizable template, and the final peach exchange, while purposeful, feels anticipated. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safety-middle hedging, landing it in the solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's choice to repair the pendant and her verbal framing ("some promises don't break") directly shape the girl's stance shift and enable the peach exchange. Present early, drives two beats (repair decision, final acceptance), and participates in closure when she internalizes the lesson by biting the peach. Causal pressure is moderate; the mender role enables the repair but does not narrow options under sharp constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in paragraph one (Liora's wrist), returns when the girl clutches her matching ribbon mid-scene, and charges the final subtext (both wear them, signaling shared loss). Two distinct beats; the reprise reweights "promise" with quiet cost. However, the ribbon is not handled or used to alter tactics—it remains symbolic anchor rather than active constraint, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The phrase "deciduous vows" appears once in paragraph two as backstory framing; the concept (promises that shed meaning) echoes thematically in Liora's line about promises that don't break. It shapes the thematic question but does not directly alter on-page tactics or narrow a choice under pressure. Functional but more ornamental accent than engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The girl's "endearingly feisty" trait is embodied: sharp eyes, decisive statement ("You're the mender," not a question), the hop-down landing, and her direct challenge ("Why do you still have hers?"). The trait enables the confrontation that prompts Liora's key verbal choice and the peach gift. Two beats; modest causal pressure with visible effect on closure tone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Persist" is named in paragraph two, drives Liora's repair decision, and is directly invoked in her instruction ("if you persist, the cracks can hold something new"). The final peach-bite and reflection on "quiet wisdom in knowing when to let things grow" reweight persistence as patient accumulation rather than rigid endurance. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure payoff; causal linkage is strong. Irreplaceable as the story's central verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bag is opened in paragraph three (mortar, pestle, lavender, iron-smelling parcel = silver wire and resin). The contents enable the pendant repair, which is the story's pivotal transaction. Signaled early, used in one key beat with visible mechanics. However, the method is straightforward application rather than improvisation under constraint, and the bag does not return or complicate later moves, limiting elevation beyond mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral fusion is established in the opening line and pressures every beat: the peach blossoms frame tone, the low bough enables the girl's entrance, the dappled light illuminates the repair, and the peach gift at closure directly ties setting resource to thematic payoff. The orchard's "remembered" vows create the conceptual constraint Liora navigates. Setup, development, and closure participation all clear; the setting is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" appears once in paragraph one as backstory anchor. It primes Liora's motive (she came here because of broken promises) but does not create a live deadline or tighten decisions on the page. The timeframe is atmospheric context rather than active pressure; easily swappable with similar phrasings.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire to "bridge generational wisdom" is named at the moment Liora recognizes it ("she hadn't known it until that moment") and dramatized through the repair-and-teaching exchange with the girl. The motivation drives the pendant-repair choice and the verbal counsel, both of which shape closure. However, the motivation is more realized than conflicted—Liora does not face a trade-off or doubt that tests this want under pressure, keeping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is quiet, contemplative, layered with melancholy and gentle hope throughout. The opening's lush decay, the mid-scene repair focus, and the peach-exchange closure all modulate within the "accidental wisdom" register—knowledge accruing without declaration. The final image (juice sweet on her tongue, thinking of vows that outlasted makers) charges the tone with earned resonance. Coherent under pressure; modest modulation as the girl's arrival shifts Liora from solitary to relational mode.</comment>
