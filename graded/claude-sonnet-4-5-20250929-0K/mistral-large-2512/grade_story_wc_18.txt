<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mirror maker's interiority is filtered through poetic compression but remains consistent—his practical grounding contrasts with the pull toward mystery. Embodied action (breathing sync, climbing, holding the dream) anchors emotional progression. The final realization about trust over possession earns the shift, but the dream's loneliness is asserted rather than dramatized through prior contradiction. Minimal internal conflict weakens the agency test; he moves toward the dream without meaningful hesitation or cost to his choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph (mirror maker, ruined orchard, foggy twilight). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the sextant's hum triggers the fog-walk, the glass mountain materializes, and the dream's capture resolves through a Resonant Reconfiguration (trust replaces possession, the sextant mends). Closure cost is conceptual—the mountain dissolves, the orchard's bones remain—but the felt price to the protagonist is oblique; he smiles without visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening (the climb and the dream's trembling vulnerability) suffices for this length, though causal linkage between the sextant's pulse and the mountain's appearance is more associative than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, fog, frost-kissed grass, and glass mountain are vivid and purposeful. The glass mountain constrains the climb and sings under his boots, charging the final image when it dissolves into mist. Sensory detail (fog curling, twilight frost, wind-through-chimes sound) is filtered through the mirror maker's perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across the cottage, path, and summit. The sextant as recurring small object charges both the opening and the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The glass mountain's sudden appearance and the climb provide escalation, and the dream's descent offers a reversal (it comes to him when he matches its rhythm). However, the protagonist faces no meaningful trade-off or visible cost; the sextant mends, the fog recedes, and he smiles. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but the price legibility is weak, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust and boundaries, loneliness versus possession—emerges from the dream's trembling and the mirror maker's realization without overt statement. The glass mountain of forgotten things and the mended sextant charge the ending image, reweighting earlier motifs (reflections, fog, waiting lantern). The dream's loneliness is asserted cleanly but could be more deeply embedded in prior action. Subtext operates in the synchronized breathing and the fog's response. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature favors poetic compression ("shimmer of twilight frost," "glass mountain"), consistent with a reflective maker of mirrors. Diction elevates slightly (e.g., "metronome," "shards of memories") but reads voice-motivated rather than register drift. No dialogue. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (short declarative beats, imagistic density) are taught early and sustained. One filter-verb cluster ("he felt," "he understood," "he realized") in the final third slightly dulls immediacy but does not break coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives anchor urgency; longer cadences for description). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "ribs of a dying bird," "comet's tail," "wind through chimes." Mixed-metaphor tension at "the fog curled around his ankles... in its depths, he saw a flicker" (fog as both physical and visual medium) blurs sense slightly. One paraphrase loop: "too afraid to return" / "too afraid to descend" within two paragraphs. Minimal scaffold; information density is high. No major loops or template cadence, but the peak climb sequence could tighten further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mirror maker's occupation and the glass mountain of forgotten things offer fresh synthesis. The premise—capturing a runaway dream through synchronized breathing—is imaginative but leans on familiar liminal-quest structure. Emotional specificity (the dream's trembling, the trust over possession turn) avoids template sentiment. The sextant's three-winters backstory and starlight smudge add texture. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the mountain's sudden materialization heighten atmosphere, though the closure's safety (mended sextant, smile) pulls toward median satisfaction rather than bold ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early (mirror maker as protagonist). Development: his decision to follow the fog-path and to climb drives the middle. Payoff: he holds the dream and understands trust, shaping the closure reconfiguration. Two beats (following, climbing) plus closure participation. Causal pressure is moderate—he acts, but alternatives are not dramatized. Swappability: another liminal guide (ferryman, cartographer) could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: sextant introduced paragraph two with vivid detail (bent brass, starlight smudge, fused gears). Development: it hums tonight, triggering the fog-walk; he carries it in his pocket during the climb. Payoff: it is "whole once more" at the ending, signaling the boundary's mending. Three beats. Causal role is moderate—it pulses and quickens but does not materially constrain tactics. Closure linkage is clear but the mending is told, not shown with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: implied in "boundary between his skin and the air dissolve." Development: the synchronized breathing and the trust-over-possession realization echo boundary themes. Payoff: the glass mountain dissolves, erasing the separation. Present thematically but does not shape on-page choices or alter tactics. The concept is more ornamental resonance than causal engine. Scores in functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one, "firmly grounded... too practical for dreams, too rooted to wander." Development: the evening lantern ritual hints at tension, but the trait does not visibly constrain or enable any on-page action. He follows the dream without struggle against his grounded nature. Label-only mention without tradeoff. Swappable with minor edits (e.g., "solitary" or "cautious").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two, he "tried to mend" the sextant and uses glass shards "to recreate the faces of those who had vanished." Development: his mirror-making skill is invoked but not dramatized in the dream-capture sequence. Payoff: the act of holding the dream "lightly, carefully, like a bird" parallels recreation but is not mechanically tied to shaping reflections. One clear beat (the craft is backstory, the holding is on-page). Causal link is weak; he could be a watchmaker or sculptor with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph four, "his own lungs syncing to the rhythm without thought... through synchronized breathing, he felt the boundary... dissolve." Development: the method is used again in paragraph nine, "through synchronized breathing, he matched the dream's rhythm, and slowly, it drifted toward him." Payoff: it enables the dream's capture at the summit. Two clear beats plus closure linkage. Mechanics matter—matching rhythm is the tactic. Specificity is high; no near-synonym (meditation, focus) works identically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one, the ruined orchard with fog and skeletal trees frames the entire sequence. Development: the fog parts to reveal a path, the orchard's center holds the glass mountain, and the climb occurs within the setting's logic. Payoff: the orchard's bones are revealed at the end, silvered by frost. Three beats. The fog and terrain constrain the protagonist's approach and the mountain's materialization is setting-as-event. Irreplaceable; no other locale (forest, moor) works without rewriting stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: title moment, "upon the shimmer of twilight frost," and the evening lantern ritual. Development: twilight persists through the sequence as ambient light ("catching the last of the twilight"). Payoff: the orchard is revealed in frost at the end. Present across all three gates but does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. Atmosphere rather than pressure. Swappable with dawn or dusk with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph five, the runaway dream flickers and he's "never tried to capture one." Development: the desire drives the fog-walk and the climb. Payoff: the dream settles into his palms, and he realizes it sought connection, not capture. Clear throughout. The motivation is told more than conflicted—he pursues without hesitation or competing desire. One cost (the climb) but no friction between wanting and losing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: the glass mountain appears at the orchard's center, "jagged and translucent, its peaks catching the last of the twilight." Development: its glass surface sings under his boots; it is made of "forgotten things—shards of memories, fragments of wishes." Payoff: it dissolves into mist, leaving the orchard's bones. Tone is crystalline, fragile, liminal—coherent across turns. The mountain charges the final image as the resolution mechanism. Modulates with pressure (singing ascent, quiet dissolution). Not merely a motif but a structural hinge.</comment>
