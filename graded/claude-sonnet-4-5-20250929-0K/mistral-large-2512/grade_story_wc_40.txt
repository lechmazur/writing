<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is anchored in reverence and obsession, with embodied micro-choices (pressing the crystal to temple, whispering "Grow"). Internal contradiction appears briefly—silence as both refuge and now urgency to testify—but his motivation feels largely static contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final realization ("silence was not the absence of sound") arrives through reflection more than dramatized struggle. Agency at closure is present but tilts toward epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural.** Orientation anchors who/where/when by opening lines. The piece accumulates density through repeated crystal interactions (whisper, hum, temple press) and the final conceptual repricing: gardens "weren't mutating; they were remembering." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the crystal as witness and the library as court, reweighting the premise of growth as recorded sound-memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when he hears the heartbeat pattern. Cost is conceptual—the weight of discovery—but the final image ("promise") feels more hopeful setup than felt closure with sacrifice. Meets accumulative lens but cost legibility is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library is vividly anchored: aged paper, beeswax, vaulted ceilings, predawn gloom, cold morning air. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The crystal functions as micro-setting—handled across multiple beats (desk, lips, temple)—and charges the final image. However, the environment itself (shelves, shadows, windows) remains largely backdrop; it does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics. The crystal satisfies the 9+ gate, but the larger setting does not.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode the crystal's pattern to explain impossible garden growth. Elias performs escalating experiments (whisper, hum, temple press) that deepen his understanding in one causal sequence. The accumulative lens allows pressure to cohere through density rather than reversals. However, no visible trade-off or foreclosed option appears; the discovery arrives without cost to tactics, relationships, or resources. The ending reweights meaning but lacks an on-page price that charges the final image under the selected lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—silence as the space where sound becomes meaning, memory encoded in growth—emerges through concrete action with the crystal rather than statement. The gardens-as-memory concept offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the decoding quest. The final image (crystal as witness, library as court) reweights prior material without moralizing. However, "All that remained was to testify" leans toward summary intent rather than enacted pressure, and "promise" at the close edges toward abstraction. Subtext in gesture and implication is present but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-limited, stable distance. Voice has texture: "reticent scholar," "sonically reflective," "suspended hush," perceptual filter anchored in reverence. Psychic distance tightens purposefully when he presses the crystal to his temple and the world "blurred, then sharpened." No head-hopping. Diction mostly fits the scholarly register, though "sonically reflective" (unusual phrasing for non-technical narration) and "demanding to be heard" (slight cliché) introduce minor roughness. Elision is minimal and purposeful. Consistent tense and clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in action beats (crystal experiments). However, **paraphrase loop** appears: "He had spent years listening to the silence here, learning its rhythms, its secrets" closely echoes "He had spent his life studying the past" three paragraphs later—both summarize dedication without adding pressure (−0.2). **Template cadence** in two paragraphs: "He believed… He had found… He had spent…" and "He placed… He began… The crystal…" (−0.4). "Suspended hush" recurs five times, risking thematic churn. Minor filter-verb reliance ("seemed to") but not clustered enough to trigger the stack penalty. Clarity and propulsion are otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal-as-sound-recorder device offers a fresh angle on mutation/memory. Linking botanical growth to acoustic memory via a chandelier shard is specific and non-obvious. However, the scholar-decoding-mysterious-artifact frame is widely templated, and the execution leans heavily on atmospheric setup without transforming the template through sharp emotional cost or moral calculus. The gardens remain off-page; their stakes are told rather than dramatized. Emotional specificity (reverence, obsession) is present but not deeply contradictory. Proximity to "ancient knowledge hidden in object" templates lowers the band despite the sonic twist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, and his choices drive all three crystal experiments (whisper, hum, temple press). His final realization alters understanding and frames the ending ("testify"). However, the turn is cognitive rather than a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path with cost. Observation dominates; no tactical trade-off or visible price appears. Setup clear, development present, payoff participates but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal appears in setup (desk, opening paragraph), drives three distinct middle beats (whisper/pulse, hum/levitate, temple/heartbeat revelation), and anchors the final image ("facets catching the light like a promise"). Early signal strong (+0.8), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage present (+0.9), specificity high (sonically reflective edges, recording function) (+0.6). However, it does not constrain a choice with cost—Elias never sacrifices or loses anything to use it. Swappable with another recording device with minor edits (−0.5). Totals ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" recurs frequently as atmosphere and is named explicitly five times. It frames the library's quality and Elias's listening practice. However, it does not materially shape a choice or alter tactics on the page; it remains thematic backdrop. Setup present, development ornamental, payoff echoed in final reflection but not causally active. Fits 3.0–4.9 band (functional but replaceable). Late-paragraph reflection lifts it slightly within band to ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" is established early (crystal "cut to amplify rather than scatter sound") and enables all three experiments. The attribute constrains method—he uses sound to interrogate the crystal—but does not force a visible trade-off or cost. Setup strong (+0.8), two beats (whisper/hum) (+0.9), closure linkage indirect (+0.4), specificity high (+0.6), but no cost connection (0.0). Totals ~5.4, fitting the one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Testify" is named as motivation in paragraph four ("Now, he needed to testify") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("All that remained was to testify"). However, no testimonial act occurs on the page—no audience, no speech, no dramatized proving. It remains intent rather than action. Summary-only use (−0.6), late middle introduction (~40% mark, −0.3), swappable with "prove" or "demonstrate" (−0.5). Totals ~3.8, functional but not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" is named in paragraph four ("the truth… came through fractured sequences") and echoed in the final paragraph. The crystal's experiments proceed incrementally (whisper, hum, temple) but are not dramatized as broken or non-linear; causality is smooth. The method is more asserted than shown. Setup present (~30% mark, late but acceptable −0.2), development ornamental, payoff label-only (−0.4). Fits functional-but-replaceable band, ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The library anchors setting throughout: predawn gloom, shelves, cold air, slanting light, ancient timbers. It provides the spatial frame for all action. However, it does not pressure choices—Elias could perform the same experiments elsewhere. The desk supplies a surface; the acoustics ("sound… bouncing between the shelves") enrich one beat. Setup immediate (+0.8), one beat (acoustics) (+0.4), closure linkage present (library as court) (+0.7), but no tactical constraint (0.0). Totals ~6.2, one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last dictionary is printed a decade ago") is mentioned once in paragraph one and never constrains a choice or creates urgency. No ticking clock or decision deadline appears. The predawn-to-morning progression is atmospheric, not tactical. Ornamental mention (−0.7), no beat involvement, no closure participation. Totals ~2.1, present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To decode the pattern of growth" is named explicitly in paragraph six and drives all three crystal experiments. Setup clear (+0.8), three beats (whisper, hum, temple revelation) (+1.4), closure linkage strong (discovery that gardens "were remembering") (+1.2). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through friction; no competing want or cost appears. Specificity moderate (+0.4). Totals ~6.7, essential across beats but lacks conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is not named but the tone—reverent scholar, "predawn gloom," "aged paper," discovery framed as "promise"—attempts a blend of fatigue and wonder. Coherent through turns and modulates from stillness to intensifying experiments to quiet realization. However, the final image ("promise") tilts optimistic rather than weathered, and innocence is not dramatized as tested or lost. Setup present, development consistent, payoff charges the image but does not fully embody the weathered half. Totals ~5.9, shapes one key turn.</comment>
