<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" is clear and his final choice to add a note to the file shows agency, but interiority remains largely declarative ("his heart ached," "chest tighten") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The arc from grief-paralysis to active memorialization is legible but earned more through summary of his research than through on-page micro-choices that reveal cost. Daniel exists only as archival trace, which fits the premise but limits relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: button discovery → boarding house visit → postcard reveal → note-writing closure. The final act (writing the note) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Elias reweights his archival mission with visible emotional cost ("no longer felt like a burden"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One notable slip: the landlady's drawer-postcard feels convenient—no prior signal that she kept correspondence or that Daniel would have written to her—but does not break causality outright.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The file room's "yellowed paper and old glue" and "dust patterns" anchor setting early and the button's brass tarnish provides tactile detail. The boarding house "crumbled facade" mirrors memory decay purposefully. Spatial choreography is clean across two locations. However, the file room does not constrain Elias's choices—he moves freely from archive to boarding house without logistical friction—so setting remains atmospheric rather than pressure-bearing, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering Daniel's story—is signaled early and tightens once (button → landlady → postcard). However, the escalation relies on convenient information handoffs rather than protagonist-driven reversals: the landlady "remembered" and "pulled out a postcard" without prior setup or cost to Elias's inquiry. The resolution (writing the note) feels like a culmination of research rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible price, keeping this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—histories overlooked, small objects as vessels of meaning—emerges organically from the button, dust patterns, and final note without overt moralizing. The ending image (button returned to file with added note) reweights prior material: Elias shifts from passive mourner to active custodian. The last line "one file at a time" risks mission-statement feel but stays specific enough to avoid full sermon. Subtext operates in the landlady's hesitation and Daniel's postcard signature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; distance is consistent and sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (short clauses during discovery, longer reflection in transit). Perceptual signature is clear: Elias reads dust and wear as narrative. The landlady's dialogue ("He kept to himself...") feels natural and goal-driven. One minor slip: "the way lives could be reduced to fragments and still hold so much meaning" edges toward essayistic register but remains tethered to Elias's archival perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports mood, but paraphrase loops appear: "The button was small, brass, and tarnished" closely echoes "He turned the button over in his palm, the weight of it unfamiliar"; "unknown histories" recurs three times in near-identical phrasing without accumulating new pressure. "Through accumulated dust patterns, Elias had learned to read" template-stems another paragraph's "That was why he had come here tonight, not just to catalog, but to unfurl." These loops dull momentum mid-story, triggering −0.6 in Q7. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken-hearted archivist reading dust as text offers a fresh angle, and the button-as-compass structure is purposeful. However, the core emotional arc (grieving loner finds meaning through detective work and memorialization) follows a familiar template without bold transformation. The boarding-house landlady and drawer-postcard feel convenient rather than inevitable. Specificity (infantryman's button, 1923 case file) anchors universals, but no single turn surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in every beat and his decision to follow the trail and write the note drives the ending. However, his choices are largely research moves (reorganizing, visiting, asking) rather than renunciations or trade-offs with visible cost. Present across setup, development, and closure; causal in two beats (button discovery → investigation, final note-writing); but swappable with "determined archivist" or "grieving historian" without major edits. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The button is handled in three beats: discovery in file (setup), turned in Elias's palm (development reflection), and returned to file with note (closure). Its brass tarnish and infantryman origin are specific and it charges the ending by becoming a bridge rather than artifact. However, its causal pressure is modest—it prompts research but does not narrow options or impose cost—and the landlady's memory (polishing nightly) substitutes for on-page button work in the middle. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames Elias's archival mission from the opening and shapes his motivation to investigate Daniel. It appears in closure ("weight of the unknown histories no longer felt like a burden") with reweighted meaning. However, it operates more as thematic umbrella than tactical constraint: Elias pursues the trail without friction from the unknownness itself. Two gates (setup, closure lyric reprise) but minimal middle development; functional resonance but replaceable with "forgotten lives" or "buried stories."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is mentioned once ("He decided to follow the trail, tactfully hopeful") but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait could describe his tone but does not alter tactics—he asks straightforward questions and the landlady volunteers information. Label-only: present in middle third but not dramatized through action or trade-off. Below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears twice: as mission statement ("to unfurl the stories") and implied in his file reorganization. It sets tone but is not the action that creates key turns—those come from "follow the trail," "asked," and "slipped it back." The verb is metaphorically apt yet swappable with "uncover" or "reveal" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable; no distinct cost tied to the act of unfolding.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is signaled early as Elias's method ("the way grief and hope left their marks") and returns in setup, but its mechanics never shape a middle choice or constrain his investigation. He reads dust to infer history but does not use dust evidence to decide next steps—the landlady's memory and postcard provide the trail. Setup present, closure implied (he continues the practice), but middle development absent. Functional mention, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The file room anchors the opening and closing beats and its "yellowed paper and old glue" establish mood. Elias's reorganization after emancipation provides the discovery moment (button in Case #47-1923). However, the room does not constrain choices—he leaves freely to visit the boarding house—and serves primarily as frame rather than pressure-bearing micro-setting. Setup and closure participation present; modest causal role in one beat (discovery); could be a library or museum archive with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the emancipation, when the state had finally released the last of the children" provides historical anchor and explains why Elias is reorganizing, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No narrative clock; the investigation unfolds at Elias's pace. The postcard "came a few years back" but elapsed time does not alter tactics. Setup present, minimal causal pressure, no closure participation. Context only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is Elias's stated motivation, signaled early ("Elias's motivation had always been to magnify small kindnesses") and drives his decision to follow the button's trail and write the memorial note. Desire is clear and tested once (he chooses to investigate rather than catalog mechanically). However, friction between want and cost is modest—no on-page sacrifice or competing obligation complicates the choice. Setup, one beat, closure linkage; functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone is contemplative and elegiac throughout, modulating slightly from initial "comfort and sorrow" to final relief ("no longer felt like a burden"). The register remains stable (literary-reflective) and the examined quality is present in Elias's dust-reading and the landlady's memory. However, tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with surprise—mood is consistent rather than dynamic. Coherent but static; one-note rather than crescendo.</comment>
