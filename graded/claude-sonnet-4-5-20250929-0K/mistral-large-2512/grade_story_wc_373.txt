<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's interior is well-embodied and filtered through her smuggler upbringing; embodied tension ("fingers tightened") and micro-choices (stepping forward, holding up the watch fob) show agency under pressure. Her final realization—"she'd just delayed it"—demonstrates genuine renunciation with visible cost. Minor weakness: the men's characterization is thin and functional, and Lena's motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" remains somewhat abstract rather than grounded in a concrete personal want.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Situational accent; orientation anchors who/where/when by line 4. The escalation (bumped man → guttered lantern → knife confrontation) narrows options through because/therefore linkage. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lena accepts she's only delayed betrayal, foreclosing the path of full prevention with felt cost. The watch fob's return at the end charges the final image, and the truce-as-constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pier and pirate market are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt, rust, spilled rum; rotting planks, flickering lanterns) that reflects Lena's familiarity. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the confrontation. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to step forward and charging the closure image. Minor slip: the "truce of hush" as a setting rule could press harder on tactics in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thwarting the deal's unraveling—is signaled early and tested concretely at the knife confrontation. The escalation tightens through two false starts, then forces Lena's agency (stepping forward, invoking her father's reputation). The resolution is earned by her choice, and the cost is legible: she's only delayed betrayal, not stopped it. One meaningful tightening (the knife lowering "just an inch") forecloses the immediate violence with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—trust as fragile, broken agreements temporarily mended—emerges from the watch fob's symbolic weight and the "sound of trust breaking" pursued through action. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: trust holds "just once" through her father's legacy, reweighting the watch fob without moralizing. Minor weakness: "capture the sound of trust breaking" verges on meta-commentary in the setup, though the closure image rescues it by grounding the abstraction in her shaking hands and warm palm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (smuggler's daughter filters the market through danger and betrayal). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Gentlemen, I believe you've both been misled"); the men's speech carries subtext (knife-wielder's "This ain't your business, girl" conveys dismissal and threat). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the climax. Minor slip: "Remember who you are" in italics feels slightly over-signaled, and the victim's line "You're Elias's girl" is convenient recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in the confrontation. Figurative language is controlled ("the pier groaned," "wavering fingers across the water"). Minor loop: "the sound of trust breaking" appears three times with near-identical phrasing (setup, middle, end), creating slight synonym churn. Template cadence in the false-start sequence ("The first false start… The second came…") is functional but mechanical. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonshine runner's daughter as mediator in a pirate market is a specific synthesis, and the watch fob as talisman of reputation transforms the trust-breaking trope. The "truce of hush" concept is fresh. However, the knife-to-throat standoff and invoking-a-parent's-legacy beats follow familiar templates without deep transformation. The ending's earned ambiguity ("delayed it") lifts the piece above median but doesn't reach bold risk territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (moonshine runner's daughter) is present throughout, makes the key choice to intervene (stepping forward, showing the watch fob), and her identity as Elias's daughter directly shapes the men's response. Her final realization that she's "just delayed it" is the story's Earned Stasis closure. Setup, development (the confrontation turn), and payoff (shaking hands, warm fob) are all present. Specificity: her lineage constrains and enables tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The antique watch fob appears in three beats: Lena adjusts it early (setup), holds it up at the confrontation (causal pressure—its brass surface and her father's reputation lower the knife), and feels it "warm against her palm" in the ending (charged reprise). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. It shapes one key turn (the knife lowering) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Cap at mid-6s: it's essential but not indispensable; a similar token could replace it with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "truce of hush" is introduced early, described as shaping market behavior (no shouting, no gunfire), and Lena notes "the truce of hush held" at the end after the deal completes quietly. Setup and payoff present; middle development is implied (the men's restraint) but not dramatized as a visible constraint on Lena's tactics. It frames stakes but doesn't directly narrow her options in the confrontation beat. Functional but one gate short of higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" modifies the silence/quiet once early ("the silence curiously steadfast"), then is never revisited or tested. Setup gate only; no middle development or closure participation. The trait is told, not shown through action or cost. Ornamental mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Thwart" is Lena's explicit goal ("to thwart whatever deal was about to unravel") and her stepping forward to interrupt the knife confrontation is the action that prevents immediate violence. Setup (stated goal), development (the confrontation intervention), and payoff (the deal completes, betrayal delayed) are present. It drives the story's central turn. Minor limiter: the thwarting is only partial (she delays, not stops), so the cost is visible but the action's scope is narrower than full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through false starts" is signaled early ("The first false start… The second came…") and those two beats shape Lena's readiness when the real confrontation arrives. Setup and development present. Payoff is oblique: the final image doesn't explicitly callback the false-start method, though the "delayed" ending rhymes thematically. The method shapes attempts in the middle but doesn't charge the closure image directly. One gate arguably missing (weak closure link); functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the pier is anchored early with vivid detail (stalls, lanterns, salt/rust smell) and provides the spatial arena for all action. Setup strong. Development: the market's layout (corner plunged into darkness, slipping between stalls) enables Lena's movement and the confrontation's staging. Payoff: "the market's rhythm steady once more" in the ending. The setting constrains and enables tactics. All three gates met; causal role in at least two beats. Cap at high-6s: a different illicit venue could replace it with moderate structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is mentioned once early ("keep their dealings quiet until sunrise") as the truce's endpoint but is never tracked or tightened in the middle or ending. Setup gate only; no development or payoff. The clock doesn't alter Lena's tactics or pressure the final choice. Functional background detail without causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" is stated early and guides her goal to listen and intervene. Setup present. Development: her stepping forward at the confrontation dramatizes the friction between observing and acting. Payoff: the ending acknowledges she's "captured the sound" but also heard "fragile, stubborn hope," reweighting the initial desire. Lyric early-to-final reprise with cost (shaking hands). All three gates met but the abstraction ("sound of trust") remains slightly ornamental; a more concrete want would strengthen causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" (the truce's "curiously steadfast" quiet, danger mixed with ritual) is established early and modulates through the false starts and confrontation. The ending's "fragile, stubborn hope" maintains the tone's duality. Setup, development (tension at the knife scene), and payoff present. Tone coherence across turns is strong. Minor limiter: the phrase "comforting unease" itself never appears, so integration is thematic rather than lexically anchored; still, the emotional texture charges the final image.</comment>
