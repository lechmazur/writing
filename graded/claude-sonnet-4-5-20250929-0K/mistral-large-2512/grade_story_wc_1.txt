<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's character is established through concrete details (glass artist, scars on wrists, the ledger strip) and her "steadily adaptive" nature is mentioned but not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The confrontation with Jaren provides a moment of agency, but her internal conflict between seeking understanding and self-preservation remains largely told rather than shown through embodied struggle. The backstory of the fire and suicide attempt is substantial but anchored to present investigation; however, the final choice to keep the ledger feels inevitable rather than costly—no visible path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (Liora, canyon creek, post-fire) and follows a causal-investigative lens: ledger → frost patterns → Jaren → revelation. The closure moment—Liora folding the strip and keeping it as "a choice"—reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing her shift from victim to agent, though the cost (what she's choosing to risk or forfeit) remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jaren's confession reframes the fire from personal attack to systemic threat, changing her understanding and options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: frost patterns guide her investigation, the creek provides spatial continuity, and the cold night atmosphere mirrors her emotional state. The ledger strip and glass beads function as micro-setting elements that recur with meaning. Spatial choreography (kneeling by creek, following upstream, Jaren appearing ahead) remains clear. The setting constrains her search to physical traces and charges the final image of her pocketing the ledger "the weight of it steady against her thigh."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why the fire happened—is signaled early and tightens when Jaren reveals the broader conspiracy. Liora's agency drives the investigation (following frost patterns, confronting Jaren), and the revelation meaningfully escalates from personal victimhood to systemic threat. However, the cost at closure is understated: her decision to keep the ledger implies future risk but doesn't foreclose a visible path or exact an on-page price in the final beat, keeping escalation just below high-band threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding "purpose in the pauses" emerges through concrete investigation rather than declaration, and the ledger/frost patterns accumulate symbolic weight. The shift from artist to investigator, from victim to agent, provides thematic resonance. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement "the canyon had always been a path, but tonight, it was also a choice" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The "scorched testament" and "steadily adaptive" concepts are more asserted than dramatized through pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liora's perspective. Voice carries a consistent lyric-noir texture through controlled diction ("luminous glass artist," "scorched testament," "weight of silence") that suits the character and mood. The dialogue exchange with Jaren is spare and carries subtext (his deflection, her insistence). Perceptual signature is strong: she notices patterns in frost, traces ink "as familiar as the scars on her wrists." Distance remains consistent with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("canyon walls hummed with the weight of silence," "breath curling in the cold air"). Some template constructions appear: "She had been...once" / "She had spent the weeks since" / "She had thought" creates a mild pattern of past-perfect stems. Minor paraphrase loop: "the fire had come for her...not for her work, but for what she knew" restates the motive shift without advancing pressure. The closure beat is clean, but figurative density in early paragraphs ("veins," "testament," "bones") occasionally clusters without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous glass artist investigating charcoal smuggling via frost patterns offers a specific synthesis, though the investigative frame (wronged protagonist retracing steps to confront conspirator) follows familiar noir-mystery beats. The frost-as-clue mechanism is fresh but underexplored—it appears as a guiding map without clear mechanics or cost. Emotional specificity (scars from suicide attempt, ruined studio, Jaren's guilt) personalizes the material, but the ending choice (keep the ledger, face the threat) resolves predictably without a surprising final inflection that reweights prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora drives the investigation by following frost patterns and confronting Jaren, creating two key beats (discovery, confrontation). Her final choice to keep the ledger participates in closure. However, her glass-artist identity is largely backstory; the text emphasizes investigator over artist, making the specific occupation somewhat replaceable. Present early, involved in multiple beats, shapes ending—meets all three gates but with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in four distinct beats: found in ruins, traced by firelight, held up to Jaren, and pocketed at closure. It functions as evidence that reframes the fire's motive and becomes the object of her final choice. The weight "steady against her thigh" charges the ending. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and visible cost (keeping it implies risk) earn strong integration despite modest irreplaceability—another document could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" appears once as a phrase describing the aftermath and operates more as theme-label than stake-shaper. The fire's aftermath drives her investigation, but the specific concept of "testament" (witnessing, record) doesn't constrain tactics or alter options on the page. It flavors tone but remains ornamental rather than mechanically essential. Present but not dramatized through choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is explicitly named ("Liora had always been steadily adaptive, bending like the reeds") but functions as character summary rather than visible trait. Her on-page actions (following clues, confronting Jaren) could belong to any determined investigator; no moment demonstrates adaptive flexibility trading off against rigidity or forcing a visible cost. Label-only mention without enabling or constraining a choice trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Retracing drives the entire investigative structure: she follows the creek upstream, aligns frost patterns with ledger routes, and revisits the night of the fire through confrontation. The action shapes two major beats (pattern-following, Jaren encounter) and the revelation reframes her understanding. Setup early, multi-beat involvement, closure participation. However, another investigative verb (pursue, track, investigate) could replace it with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns guide her upstream and align with ledger routes, functioning as the mechanism that enables discovery. They appear in two beats: initial observation and active following. However, the mechanics remain vague—how do frost shapes encode routes?—and the element doesn't return at closure or impose a cost. Setup present, middle development yes, payoff absent. Functional but underdeveloped and replaceable with another tracking method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The canyon provides spatial continuity (creek, frost-covered rocks, upstream path) and atmospheric pressure (cold, silence, isolation). It enables the investigation by preserving frost clues and stages the confrontation with Jaren. The final image grounds her choice physically ("weight...against her thigh"). Early anchor, multi-beat involvement, closure presence. However, another isolated outdoor setting could serve similarly; specificity is good but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors backstory (weeks since the fire, prior suicide attempt) but doesn't function as live pressure. No urgency or ticking clock tightens her investigation; the night unfolds at a steady pace without time constraining tactics. The temporal frame is present and consistent but passive—mentioned rather than dramatized through deadlines or escalating risk. Functional setup, no middle or closure development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The desire "to discover purpose in the pauses" is stated explicitly and shapes her investigative goal throughout. She moves "between breath, between heartbeats, between what was and what could be," seeking understanding rather than revenge. The motivation drives her confrontation with Jaren and informs her final choice. However, it's more asserted than dramatized through conflicting wants—no visible tension between purpose-seeking and another desire that creates friction or cost. Early setup, multi-beat presence, closure relevance, but told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is consistent and purposeful: lyric-noir diction ("hummed with the weight of silence," "scorched testament"), controlled pacing, and atmospheric cold create a contemplative, elegiac mood. Tone modulates subtly—quiet observation shifts to spare confrontation dialogue, then back to weighted resolve. The final image's physical concreteness ("folded...tucked...weight...steady") grounds the drifting resonance in body and object. Coherent through turns, charges the ending, distinct perceptual signature maintained under pressure.</comment>
