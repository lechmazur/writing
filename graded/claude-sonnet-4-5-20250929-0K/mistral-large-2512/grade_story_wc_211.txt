<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his profession is clear, but his interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The pomegranate omen and phonograph work feel like symbolic gestures he performs without visible internal resistance or cost. His "realization" that the foghorn's silence is an invitation arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized pressure. The final smile and red-stained fingers read as thematic closure without a demonstrated character choice that forecloses a meaningful path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (foghorn, orchard, pomegranate, wax cylinder) toward a final cadence shift. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias understands the silence as invitation and commits to "listen." Cost is implied (his old role is ending, new one beginning) but the before/after lacks on-page friction or visible forfeit. The orientation anchor is clear (Elias, rooftop orchard, post-foghorn silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the playback voice becomes "a chorus of whispers," but the protagonist does not make a choice that narrows options—he simply packs the phonograph and walks away smiling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard atop the Spire is vivid and specific: pomegranate tree, roots through steel beams, hidden aquifers. Spatial choreography is clean (table, tree, fruit falls at his feet). The setting charges the final image—orchard leaves "whispering in a language only the wind understood"—and the juice-stained fingers echo the place. The body (his hands, juice-stained fingers) functions as micro-setting and recurs at closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint or charged final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: document the city's grief and determine if silence is "void or vessel." No reversal or tightening narrows options; Elias performs ritual actions (recites languages, records sounds) without facing a decision point or trade-off. The "accidental prophecy" realization shifts his interpretation but does not alter his tactics or exact a visible cost. Pressure remains descriptive rather than escalating under the accumulative lens; the final act (packing the phonograph) confirms understanding without dramatized consequence or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—listening to what the city speaks through silence—emerges from images (foghorn memory, orchard breath, pomegranate pulse) rather than statement. The final line "The foghorn's silence had been a beginning, not an end" borders on moralizing but is anchored by prior particulars. Subtext operates in the juice drip onto wax, the chorus of whispers. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection, but the epiphany ("Some prophecies were never meant to be spoken—they were meant to be lived") edges toward thesis-statement territory, weakening the earned quality of the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Voice is distinct: "venerable oath scribe," "Book of Unspoken Vows," diction elevated but coherent. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices bark texture, needle tremor, juice weight) but does not shift under pressure. The prose remains even-toned throughout; no modulation from observational to urgent. Elision is minimal and purposeful (we don't see the Archives' full instructions), but the lack of compression or intensity at the realization beat flattens the voice's dynamic range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: "The children had laughed as the sound rattled their ribs, but Elias had felt something else—the way the noise had *immersed* them all, binding them in its resonance." Figurative language is controlled and earns its place (wax "glinting," words "curling into the air like smoke"). Minor register drift: "venerable oath scribe" and "Book of Unspoken Vows" feel slightly ornamental in early paragraphs but stabilize. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Strong propulsion and clarity throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—archiving emotional patterns via wax cylinder after a foghorn silences—offers a fresh angle. Specific details (pomegranate juice onto wax, dead languages as prophecy medium, orchard atop skyscraper) are vivid and non-generic. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: silence invites new listening. However, the "accidental prophecy" and "some prophecies were meant to be lived" frame edges toward familiar mystical-scribe territory. The risk (lyric accumulation without plot turn) is bold but does not fully pay off because the protagonist's stance shift is asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role (oath scribe) frames the mission. He performs actions (recites languages, adjusts phonograph, presses pomegranate to horn) but none of these choices create a key turn or narrow options. His "realization" is internal and does not alter tactics or impose visible cost. He is observer and performer, not decision-maker under pressure. Present in closure (packing phonograph, smiling) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Phonograph appears in ≥3 beats: initial setup, recording dead languages, pressing pomegranate juice onto wax, playback revealing chorus, and packing at closure. It evolves from passive recorder to vessel that captures "the shape of his breath" and "the orchard's breath." The wax cylinder "now warm in his hands" at the end reweights its meaning. However, the phonograph does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it is a witness and container, not an agent. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but no causal pressure or cost connection (−0.8 swappability, could be any recording device). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, closure participation ✓.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Accidental prophecy" is named on-page ("It was an accidental prophecy, he realized") and the playback voice becomes "a chorus of whispers, as if the dead had borrowed his tongue," suggesting unintended revelation. However, the concept does not shape stakes or tactics; Elias does not struggle with the prophecy's content or consequences, nor does it force a choice. It functions as theme label rather than active driver. Present in middle and closure but ornamental. Gates: setup ✗ (named at ~25%), development ✓ (middle realization), closure ✓ (confirmed in final paragraphs). Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias "spoke dead languages fluently, though no one alive could verify his pronunciation." He recites Old Sumerian, Etruscan, and "a language so old it had no name." The trait enables the recording action but does not constrain or impose cost; any ritualistic speech would serve the same function. Label-only in first mention, then performed in three beats, but swappable with chanting or singing. No visible trade-off or price tied to this skill. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✗ (not referenced in final image). One beat involvement (+0.4), early signal (+0.3), swappability (−0.6), ornamental use (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Immerse" appears once as noun/concept: "the way the noise had *immersed* them all, binding them in its resonance" in the field-trip memory. The memory is thematically linked to the ending's understanding of silence as invitation, but "immerse" does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The action is retrospective and interpretive, not on-page. It shapes Elias's stance but does not constrain present choice or tactics. Gates: setup ✓ (memory in first third), development ✗, closure ✗ (echoed but not active). Lyric reprise with thematic charge but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "third-grade field trip to the docks" memory is signaled early (~30%) and provides the resonance that Elias seeks to recapture. It is the origin of his understanding of collective binding through sound. The memory does not shape on-page attempts or mechanics; it is backstory anchor rather than method. It primes the closure insight (silence as binding in a new way) but does not enable or constrain a tactic. Gates: setup ✓, development ✗, closure ✓ (echoed in final understanding). Lyric reprise (+0.8), early signal (+0.5), summary-only (−0.6), no causal pressure (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "ancient orchard garden atop the Spire" is named immediately and anchors every beat. Trees "older than the skyscraper," roots through steel beams, pomegranate falls at his feet, leaves whisper in final image. The orchard supplies the pomegranate (resource) and its "breath" is recorded. It charges the closure: "The orchard rustled behind him, its leaves whispering in a language only the wind understood." Environment is witness and co-author rather than constraint, but its specificity and presence across beats earn strong integration. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Early signal (+0.8), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (+0.6), no direct choice constraint (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the foghorn falls silent" is established in the opening line and repeated ("three months ago"). It frames the mission and stakes (city's new quiet, need to archive grief). However, the silence does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elias performs his ritual without a clock or deadline. The timeframe is premise, not pressure. Gates: setup ✓, development ✗, closure ✓ (confirmed as "beginning, not an end"). Early signal (+0.7), closure linkage (+0.9), no tactical pressure (−0.9), vague tracking (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To archive emotional patterns—something the Archives had never deemed necessary before" is stated early and frames Elias's mission. He performs actions toward this goal (records languages, pomegranate sound, orchard breath). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflict or friction; he does not face a choice between archiving and another want. The juice-drip recording and final packing demonstrate commitment but without visible cost or competing desire. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (multiple recording beats), closure ✓ (packing the cylinder). Early signal (+0.7), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), told-only friction (−0.8), no visible trade-off (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" is not named but the tone is consistent: hushed, ceremonial, uncanny. "The foghorn's deep groan swallowed," "words curling into the air like smoke," "chorus of whispers, as if the dead had borrowed his tongue," "leaves whispering in a language only the wind understood." Tone modulates subtly from observational curiosity to mystical realization and charges the final image (smile, red-stained fingers, rustling leaves). Coherent through turns, supports accumulative pressure. No single static mood; the disquiet deepens into invitation. Strong tonal control that elevates the ending.</comment>
