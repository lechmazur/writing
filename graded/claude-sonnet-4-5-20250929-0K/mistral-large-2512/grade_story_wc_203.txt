<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's observational trait is embodied through concrete details (dust spirals, cobweb tremors, handprint in grime), and her agency drives the final action. The moment she presses the mainspring barrel against the fracture shows contradictory impulses—professional duty versus metaphysical intervention—acted out in scene. Interiority is largely concrete ("the weight of something lift"), though "ghosts didn't care about union hours" edges toward wry summary. No motivational break at closure, and the cost (years of watching, ongoing vigilance) is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fracture seals, ghosts sleep, Mira's burden lifts but her vigilance continues) with visible cost—she remains bound to her watchful role. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust layers, the mainspring's mysterious presence, and sensory details (sawdust, caramel corn) build density that the final image reweights. Orientation anchors (ticket office, elevator Car 3, after hours) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira theorizes "time was leaking" and acts on it, narrowing her stance from observer to intervener.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The circus ticket office is vivid (peeling marquee, faded gold letters, dust stratification) and the mainspring barrel's physical presence constrains the final choice—Mira must press the object against the fracture. The ceiling's hairline crack functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: dust patterns dominate in calm observation, then warmth and smell (sawdust, caramel corn) spike during the climactic act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sealing the temporal wound to free the ghosts—is signaled early and tightens when Mira moves from observation to action. The barrel's application is protagonist-driven and narrows options (she cannot simply repair the elevator mechanically). One meaningful pressure point: the discovery of the fracture forces her theory into a test. Cost is present (the lift of burden, ongoing vigilance) but somewhat abstract; a sharper price—failed first attempt, tool damage, or a visible renunciation—would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cracks as wounds in time, dust as memory sediment, the mainspring as a tool to rewind loss. The final image (dust settling, fracture sealed, Mira's watchfulness continuing) answers the thematic question—"someone had to notice them before they split wide open"—without overt moralizing. The child's laughter and caramel-corn scent avoid symbolic convenience by linking to the circus setting established early. Subtext operates in the gap between mechanical repair and metaphysical healing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (dust spirals, cobweb tremors, sediment layers) is distinct and selective. Diction stays within her observant, slightly wry register ("ghosts didn't care about union hours"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climax (short sensory bursts: cold-warm-burning, sawdust smell, laughter). No dialogue appears, so voice is tested solely through narration, which handles compression (decades of hands, years of ceiling-watching) without filter-verb stacking or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer observational passages) and information density is high—most sentences advance situation or character. Minor loop: "The dust here was thicker, layered like sediment" → "each stratum telling a story" restates the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). "She'd seen them before: the faces in the plaster, the whispers in the wiring" uses list-like construction but remains voice-motivated. The final paragraph's repetition ("The elevator would run… The ghosts would sleep… And Mira?") is purposeful cadence, not template artifact. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—elevator technician who repairs temporal leaks in a circus ruin via a horologist's part—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms "ghost story" through occupational detail (gearbox, mainspring teeth worn smooth) and a fresh metaphor (time leaking through cracks). Execution avoids the explain-everything ending; Mira's vigilance continues rather than resolving into tidy closure. The story commits to its premise without hedging, though the emotional template (burden lifted but duty remains) is familiar to the wounded-healer archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira appears throughout; her ghost-seeing trait frames the stakes (elevator stuck, "ghosts didn't care about union hours") and her choice to press the barrel against the fracture drives the climax. Setup early, develops through observation, and causally active at closure. Her decision alters tactics from passive repair to metaphysical intervention with visible cost (ongoing vigilance). Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel is introduced early (toolkit mention), handled physically in the middle (turning it over, examining worn teeth), and pressed against the fracture at closure—three distinct beats. Its properties matter: brass surface, worn teeth, mysterious presence behind the gearbox. The object's transformation (dull → cold → warm → burning → cool) charges the final image and the repair could not occur without it. Irreplaceability high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is literalized as the hairline fracture in the ceiling and extends metaphorically to temporal wounds. The concept shapes stakes (sealing the crack to free ghosts) and the climax (pressing the barrel against the fracture). Setup present ("time was leaking… through cracks in the façade"), development through discovery, and payoff in the sealing action. The concept constrains the protagonist's method—she must address the crack, not merely the elevator mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is embodied in multiple beats: noticing dust spirals, cobweb tremors without wind, the perfect circle of undisturbed dust, and the hairline fracture. The trait enables the discovery that drives the climax and constrains her method (she must notice the crack before acting). The attribute is shown through specific perceptions rather than labels. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate (without observation, no fracture discovery).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Engage" appears as direct statement ("the way the air turned thick when the dead decided to engage") and is enacted when Mira presses the barrel and the child's laughter echoes. The action is central to closure but lacks mid-story development; it's framed as past experience then performed once. The term could be replaced with "interact" or "respond" without major structural loss. Setup present, closure participation strong, but swappability and single-beat use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Analyzing dust patterns is signaled early (dust spirals, sediment layers, handprint, undisturbed circle) and enables the discovery of the temporal anomaly. The method shapes one key choice—recognizing "the patterns were wrong" leads to the fracture discovery. However, the method does not constrain the climactic action (the barrel press) and could be replaced by other observation forms. Setup and middle development present; closure participation indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies the spatial frame, the ceiling that hides the fracture, and the nostalgic charge (sawdust, caramel corn) that validates the repair. The setting's decay (peeling marquee, cobwebs, layered dust) embodies the temporal leak. Early setup, middle detail (ticket counter, floor grime), and closure participation (the scent echo ties the ghost's release to the circus past). The setting is irreplaceable; a generic warehouse would not carry the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" anchors the opening beat and marks the shift from mechanical to metaphysical work. However, the fluorescent's death is mentioned once and does not track forward to tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time remains vague after the initial signal; no live clock pressures Mira's choices. Setup present, but development and closure participation absent; swappable with "after the lights failed" or "in darkness."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is stated explicitly ("She knew what ceilings hid") and dramatized when Mira kneels, examines the fracture, and acts to seal it. The desire drives the climax but lacks visible friction—no cost shown on the page for pursuing this knowledge (e.g., risk, hesitation, failed attempt). Setup, development through discovery, and closure participation all present; causal pressure moderate. Cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" reads in the opening's "sudden silence heavier than the machinery's usual groan" and the ending's "felt the weight of something lift" while her vigilance continues. The tone coheres—quiet dread modulates to quiet release without vanishing—and charges the final image. The paradox (burden that lifts yet persists) is purposeful. However, the tone is stable rather than dynamically shifting with escalation. Setup and closure participation present; middle development subtle.</comment>
