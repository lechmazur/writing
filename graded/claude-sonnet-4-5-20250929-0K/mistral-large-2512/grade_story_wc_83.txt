<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to hunt is rooted in grief over her destroyed wedding, and her actions—crouching, moving through the observatory, confronting the ghost—are consistent with her drive to find answers. Interior glimpses ("Fear was a luxury she had burned away") hint at her transformation, but much of her psychology is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to run feels reactive rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization that forecloses a path with visible cost. The scientist-ghost appears too briefly to test her values or force a meaningful trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, though the "three years since the strike" backstory competes with present action. The piece reads as accumulative/textural—grief pooling, the geode pulsing, fragments of the past colliding with the present—but the ending ("The hunt wasn't over. It had only just begun") declares continuation rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The alarms and her running exit constitute a micro turn but not a closure effect that reweights prior material. Cost is implied but not legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vividly rendered: rusted girders, fractured glass, cooling circuit breakers, flickering screens. The geode's warmth and the cooling breakers impose a time constraint that affects Lena's urgency, and the metal grating and equipment detritus provide spatial grounding. The charred wedding dress functions as a micro-setting element that charges her grief. However, the final image does not hinge on a specific environmental constraint, and the observatory's specifics (dome, server farm wreckage) do not force a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding answers about unused potential and grief—is signaled early and Lena's hunt drives her forward. The geode flaring and the ghost solidifying create a mid-story tightening, but the ending reverts to "the hunt wasn't over," which undercuts closure rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The alarms and her flight constitute complication, not escalation driven by her agency. No visible price is paid at the end; she simply runs, leaving the cost off the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of unused potential pooling in loss and grief is woven through imagery—the geode, the charred dress, the ghost of the scientist—but the final paragraph ("Back to the wreckage, back to the fire, back to the moment the sky had torn open") veers toward thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The geode as a symbol is overexplained ("amplify what was already there, raw and unchecked"), reducing subtextual charge. The ending does not reweight prior material with a fresh insight; it loops back to the inciting trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's POV is stable and her perceptual signature—grief-soaked, wary, attuned to sound and heat—is consistent throughout. Diction like "dying beast," "ghost of a drone's hum," and "hunger in its hum" creates a distinct voice under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Show me") feels purposeful and minimal. Filter verbs ("she knew") appear frequently but do not obscure interiority. No head-hopping or distance breaks mar the execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("the sky split open," "grief pooled in the hollows of her bones") is vivid, though some phrases edge toward over-writing ("jagged shards," "wavering shadows"). The final paragraph loops through thematic echoes ("back to the wreckage, back to the fire") without propelling new information. No major line-level artifacts obscure causality, but the closure beat is dulled by summary rather than a sharp image. Information density is high in descriptive passages but falls in the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination of post-apocalyptic setting, grief-driven protagonist, and a mystical geode feels familiar, though the "floating observatory" and "perturbation theory" add specificity. The bride-turned-hunter arc is not transformed beyond surface details; the emotional beats (loss, hunting for answers, unresolved continuation) follow predictable paths. The geode and the ghost-scientist hint at fresh world logic but are not fully integrated into a non-obvious moral or causal synthesis. The ending's open continuation avoids risk rather than embracing a bold stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena's identity as a drone strike wedding survivor is signaled early and frames her grief and motivation. It shapes her decision to hunt and her lack of fear when confronting the ghost. However, her choices in the present scene (crouching, moving, running) do not hinge on this specific trauma; a survivor of any catastrophic loss could act similarly. The attribute colors her psychology but does not create a unique turn at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The geode appears in multiple beats: found in the wreckage, pulsing in her pocket, flaring to repel the ghost, searing her skin as she runs. Its properties (warmth, luminous veins, "unfiltered awakening") constrain her actions and enable the confrontation with the ghost. The final image of clutching it tighter reweights its cost. However, its mechanics ("perturbation theory") remain vague, and its role in the ending is reactive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is mentioned once as a lab term and echoed thematically ("amplify what was already there, raw and unchecked"), but it does not shape Lena's tactics or choices on the page. The geode's function remains abstract; the concept is told rather than dramatized through consequences or trade-offs. It colors the setting and stakes but does not alter options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" appears in exposition ("to make the intangibly tangible") and when the ghost solidifies ("grief made manifest, potential given form"), but it does not constrain an on-page action with cost. The ghost's shift from smoke-like to almost-human is observed, not leveraged in a choice. The attribute is thematic decoration rather than a mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena's hunt drives the entire structure: she enters the observatory, searches for answers, confronts the ghost, and flees when alarms sound. The action frames her motivation and the geode's use. However, the ending declares "the hunt wasn't over" rather than resolving or transforming it, making the action swappable with "search" or "quest" without fundamental change. The hunt does not create a unique closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perturbation theory" is mentioned once in lab logs as "a way to nudge the unseen" but is never operationalized. Lena explicitly states "she didn't know the math," and no mechanics of the method shape her tactics or the geode's function. It is ornamental jargon that could be replaced with any pseudo-scientific term without altering the story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory is anchored early and its specifics—rusted girders, fractured glass, cooling circuit breakers, graveyard of equipment—pressure Lena's urgency and provide resources (the geode, the ghost). The cooling breakers impose a time constraint that forces her to act quickly. The setting is integral to the atmosphere and her discovery, and the alarms at the end force her to flee. Removing this exact setting would require significant structural changes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cooling circuit breakers are mentioned ("she had minutes, maybe less") and the system reboots at the end, triggering alarms. This creates a ticking clock that adds urgency, but Lena's actions inside the observatory do not race against the timer in dramatized beats. The breakers cool off-page while she explores; the time constraint is told rather than felt as a live pressure shaping her choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena's desire to "find where unused potential pools" is stated multiple times and drives her into the observatory and toward the ghost. Her confrontation with the scientist-ghost ("Show me") dramatizes the want. However, the motivation is more thematic claim than on-page friction; no scene tests her willingness to pay a cost for the answer. The ending loops back to the trauma rather than resolving or complicating the search with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone mixes dread (rusted girders, dying beast, ghost) with forward momentum (she hunted, she ran, the hunt had only just begun), creating a "bleak exhilaration" effect. Imagery like "the sky split open" and "grief pooled in the hollows of her bones" sustains bleakness, while her lack of fear and determination add exhilaration. The final image of running as alarms wail charges the tone, though the ending's thematic summary dilutes the charge slightly. Tone is coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
