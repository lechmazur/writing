<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to compile fragments is clear and her "reactively visionary" trait shapes her perception of the valves as a key. However, her interior life remains somewhat generic—"her fingers trembling" and the weight metaphor feel stock rather than character-particular. The partnership with Dain introduces status dynamics but their relationship lacks friction; he delivers exactly what's needed without complication. Interiority doesn't show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, which keeps the characterization in the competent but not exceptional range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: Liora seeks valves → finds second → retrieves third → discovers map/truth. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—"They erased us" realization plus the decision to "sound the truth"—delivers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the city's historical erasure is now undeniable). One meaningful tightening occurs when all three valves reveal the map. The ending feels slightly abstract; "sound the truth" remains a promise rather than an on-page act with visible consequence, which prevents entry into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor setting is vivid and filtered through Liora's archivist lens—"pale docks slick with residue," "scent of wet stone and distant cooking fires." The watchtower functions as a goal-location that structures the quest. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain choice; doors open when knocked, the third valve sits waiting on a table. The rain-soaked streets create atmosphere but remain postcard-level rather than altering tactics or charging the final image, keeping this below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: reunite the valves to reveal suppressed history. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the three valves together form the harbor map, narrowing ignorance to knowledge. The grizzled guard's cooperation and Dain's reliable intel feel convenient rather than hard-won—no credible loss or tactical shift occurs when obstacles appear. The conceptual cost at closure (historical erasure confirmed) is legible but the protagonists don't pay a visible personal price on the page, which prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the valves-as-map conceit: absence, erasure, and the recovery of suppressed memory. The "navigated absences" concept integrates without overt statement. The ending image—valves revealing the pre-exile map—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what was hidden?" without moralizing. Subtext operates in Dain's murmured "They erased us" and the recurring weight/fragment imagery. Minor slip: "to stitch together the absences that gaped like missing teeth" edges toward overt thematic declaration, but the overall restraint and image-driven approach support the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Liora's perceptual signature—archivist filtering sensory detail through salt, parchment, echoes—is consistent. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; Dain's exchange ("Did you find it?" / "Third one's in the old watchtower") advances plot efficiently. However, both characters speak in similarly clipped, utilitarian cadences with no distinct idiom to separate them; under pressure their voices converge. Free indirect style is clean, and diction stays within Liora's plausible register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong rhythm variation: "The ivory harbor glistened" (longer, atmospheric) alternates with "She wiped her brow" (clipped action). Information density is high; sentences routinely do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs mar the text. Figurative language—"absences that gaped like missing teeth," "herald's trumpet valve…humming with the faintest resonance"—is controlled and voice-appropriate. One minor slip: "herald's trumpet valve" terminology feels slightly underexplained for immediacy, but the overall line-level execution is clean and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist and post-exile setting offer fresh specificity. The valves-as-map-fragments conceit transforms a standard quest into a puzzle grounded in archival detail. However, the underlying structure—collect three objects to unlock truth—is a familiar template, and the emotional arc (determined seeker finds answers) doesn't surprise. The "reactively visionary" attribute and "staggered intervals" method feel more like prompt ornaments than transformative choices. Solid execution of a recognizable frame rather than a bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora shapes all key turns: she recognizes the valve as a key, seeks Dain, travels to the watchtower, and reaches for the third valve. Her archival lens filters perception throughout. Present in setup (opening), middle (watchtower journey), and payoff (map discovery). However, her decisions feel low-friction—no visible trade-off or cost attached to her choices, which limits the score to mid-6s despite consistent presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in four beats: Liora's belt (setup), Dain's second valve reveal (middle complication), the watchtower retrieval (climax approach), and the map discovery (payoff). Its "faintest resonance" and tarnished surface evolve from relic to key to map component. The object constrains the quest (must find all three) and charges the closure (reveals pre-exile harbor). Strong integration across the arc with causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" shapes stakes (recover suppressed history) and appears thematically in "the absences that gaped like missing teeth" and the erasure revelation. It constrains Liora's archival method and reweights at closure when the map fills the gap. However, the concept remains more thematic echo than tactical pressure—it doesn't force a hard choice or visible cost on the page, keeping it in the 5–6 band despite lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is introduced early ("she saw patterns where others saw only noise") and enables one key inference (valve as key). However, it's mostly label-only; we don't see her pattern-recognition create a mistake or trade-off. The trait doesn't constrain a choice or impose cost—she's simply correct. Present but functional without friction, placing it in the low-mid 4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears once in concept: "This was how they would hearten the city…through staggered intervals." It's tied to motivation but remains abstract—no on-page act of heartening occurs, only the promise to "sound the truth." The action is announced rather than dramatized, and the story would hold if "reveal" or "awaken" replaced it. Functional mention without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is explained once ("small revelations that built toward something greater") and loosely shapes the collect-three-valves structure. The method is signaled but its mechanics don't meaningfully constrain tactics—Liora simply gathers the valves sequentially as they become available. Swappable with "piece by piece" or "step by step." Present in setup and implied at closure but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor frames all action: slick docks, rain-soaked alleys, watchtower. Sensory details (seawater spray, lamp oil scent) are vivid and filtered through Liora's archivist perception. The setting provides spatial coherence and the watchtower functions as a goal-location. However, it doesn't constrain a choice—characters move freely, doors open, no environmental obstacle alters tactics. Postcard atmosphere rather than tactical pressure, landing in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" is anchored early ("ended only a fortnight prior") and motivates urgency (the city "hummed with restless energy"). Time pressure is implied but not dramatized—no clock tightens decisions, no deadline forces a trade-off. The timeframe sets context and appears at closure (pre-exile map revealed) but doesn't actively constrain tactics. One gate (setup + payoff thematic link) with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to compile fragments into meaning" drives every beat: collecting parchment, recognizing the valve, seeking Dain, retrieving the third piece, discovering the map. The motivation is dramatized through action rather than told. Minor friction appears when "the fragments she had gathered felt heavier than ever," hinting at burden. Present across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal linkage, though without a sharp internal conflict or visible cost that would push it higher.</comment>
