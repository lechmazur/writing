<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to store wonder") is established but remains abstract throughout; his "peripherally focused" trait is asserted rather than shown constraining choices. The recognition scene with his younger self delivers a realized moment, but the shift from "storing wonder" to "letting it go" arrives as epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses dramatized in action. Interiority leans heavily on poetic summary ("the harvest of echoes," "liquid gold") without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated attempts with the timer, chalk marks, quartz adjustments, culminating in the boy-reflection and the timer's restart. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (realization that wonder must be released, not stored) with conceptual cost (abandoning his months-long project's original purpose). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure image is legible but the cost remains largely conceptual and asserted ("trusting the echoes") rather than foregrounding a visible forfeiture or tactical shift that the prior causality forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern with quartz veins and skylight is vividly rendered and anchors the piece spatially. The quartz functions as a tool in the climax: Elias tilts it to sharpen the reflection, which directly enables the boy's appearance and the timer's activation. Sensory details (hum of quartz, damp stone, fogging breath) are purposeful and filtered through Elias's attentive gaze. The setting charges the final image (echoes swirling like fireflies in the cavern) and thus meets the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: repair the timer to capture wonder. One meaningful tightening occurs when the timer mechanism first stutters, then the quartz adjustment births the reflection. However, escalation is thin—Elias kneels, pries, adjusts—but no live option is visibly foreclosed or traded off on the page. The boy's touch solves the problem without Elias making a high-cost choice; coincidence (the reflection appearing at this moment) resolves rather than complicates. Cost is conceptual (abandoning "storage" model) but not felt in tactics or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (wonder cannot be stored, only released) emerges from the timer's behavior and the boy's intervention. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "echoes finding their way home." Yet the thematic turn is stated rather than discovered through Elias's contradictory actions; the penultimate paragraph announces "He understood then" and explicates the harvest metaphor. Subtext operates in the quartz reflection and the boy's smile, but the ending paragraph edges toward moralizing by spelling out the lesson. The recurring motif (echoes, light angles) charges the closure but the articulation is direct.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close; no head-hopping. Voice is poetic and consistent ("peripherally focused," "the lull of a wounded season"), with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices light fractures, gear teeth). Diction remains elevated throughout, matching the meditative tone. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks. The piece does not contain dialogue. Under pressure (the reflection's appearance) the prose maintains rhythm without syntactic monotony, and the final image ("sound of time rewinding") sustains the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high; spatial choreography and temporal flow are clean. Several near-paraphrase loops appear: "the harvest of echoes" is defined, then restated as metaphor in the following paragraph; "The timer was his first attempt" and "The mechanism was broken" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence is visible in parallel "He had…" constructions across paragraphs 5–7. Figurative language is dense ("liquid gold," "fireflies," "smoke") but mostly coherent; "wounded season" and "teeth sank in" mix vehicle slightly. No clarity break at closure, so deductions stay within the non-closure cap. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding ("He believed," "He understood then") could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The reflective craftsman seeking to capture ephemeral wonder is a familiar template (echoes Romanticism, jeweler-philosopher tropes). The marble cavern and quartz-reflection mechanism add specificity, but the arc—man obsessed with control learns to let go—follows a well-trodden path without a sharp inflection. The boy-as-younger-self reflection is evocative but not structurally surprising. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and executes competently, yet the synthesis does not feel inevitable or non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his repeated adjustments (dismantling, prying with quartz, tilting to sharpen reflection) drive beats. However, the key turn—timer activation—is performed by the boy-reflection, not Elias's choice. His realization at the end is observation rather than decision that alters tactics. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is passive. Swappable with another observant craftsman archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timer appears in the opening paragraph, is dismantled and adjusted mid-story, and restarts at closure—three beats. Its broken state constrains Elias's months-long project and its activation charges the final image ("syncing with Elias's heartbeat"). Causal pressure is present: the timer's failure drives his study of reflection angles. Closure linkage is strong. Irreplaceability is high; removing the timer would collapse the plot and ending resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is named early and explained as "quiet moments when the world holds its breath." It frames Elias's motivation but remains thematic rather than a mechanism that shapes tactics. The concept does not constrain on-page choices—Elias's actions (dismantling, studying angles) would read identically if he sought "preserve silence" or "capture stillness." Functional but replaceable. No visible cost tied specifically to "harvest" versus any poetic synonym.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is asserted in the opening line ("his gaze lingering on edges") and restated in his study of light angles and gear teeth. However, it does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. The trait could be removed and all actions remain unchanged. Label-only; no dramatized tradeoff (e.g., missing a central detail because of peripheral bias). Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" is named as Elias's attempt to build a vessel for wonder, and his dismantling/adjusting of the timer across multiple beats enacts it. The action is setup and developed but does not pivot the ending—the timer activates via the boy's touch, not Elias's reverse-engineering success. The method shapes his months-long study but the closure turn bypasses it. Could be replaced with "repair" or "unlock" with minimal structural change. Two gates (setup, development) met; payoff is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is signaled early (paragraph 5: chalk marks, dawn versus dusk) and supplies the method for the climax—Elias adjusts the quartz to sharpen the reflection, which births the boy. The method matters causally: without angle study, the reflection would not appear. However, the mechanics are summarized ("marked the walls," "noted the way light bent") rather than shown shaping a middle choice. Setup and payoff gates met; development is thin. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern with quartz veins and skylight anchors every scene. The quartz wall supplies the sliver Elias uses to pry gears and the surface for the reflection; the skylight governs his angle study. Setting resources alter tactics at two beats (prying, tilting) and charge the final image (cavern fills with echo-light). Spatial choreography is clean. Irreplaceability is high: a workshop or study could not provide the quartz or the acoustic hum. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"The lull of a wounded season" (autumn ending) is named and appears in the final line ("stretched around him, endless"). Time does not tighten decisions—Elias has "spent months" and tonight's attempt is one of many with no clock pressure or seasonal deadline forcing the choice. The seasonal marker is atmospheric and reprises lyrically but does not constrain tactics. Functional metaphor, not a causal timeframe. Two gates (setup, payoff) met but no middle tightening. Cap at 4.6 for missing development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is named early and drives Elias's months-long project. It supplies both his goal (build a vessel) and the thematic friction resolved at closure (shift from storage to release). However, the motivation is told and reflected upon rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—Elias never faces a scene where storing versus releasing creates a trade-off he must navigate on the page. Setup and payoff gates met; development is expository. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the storage model) but not felt in a visible forfeiture.</comment>
