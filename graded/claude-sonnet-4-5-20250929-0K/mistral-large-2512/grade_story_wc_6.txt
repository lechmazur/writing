<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena's past-as-firefighter motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("grafted her past," "scars could sing") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The encounter with the girl shows surface gentleness but no genuine internal friction—no competing wants that force a visible cost. Backstory dominates without tilting present stance through micro-choices; the reflection is anchored to the coin and sand but does not alter her options on the page. The final choice to teach the girl feels declared rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated sensory touchstones (lagoon, coin, black sand, clouds) gather toward a final image. However, no decisive tightening occurs—Lena arrives reflective and departs reflective with the same stance. The girl's arrival is coincidental and does not narrow options or deepen cost; the ending image ("the lagoon held them all—past, present, and the promise of peace") restates the opening mood without visible or felt cost. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a foreclosed path or paid price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and firefighter boots provide vivid, POV-filtered anchors. The coin is handled twice (touched, then observed by the girl) and the sand sifts through Lena's fingers, meeting the micro-setting standard. The lagoon's stillness mirrors Lena's reflective state but does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure. Sensory detail is selective and effective ("kelp-drift peace," "grains clinging to her calloused hands"), and the black sand's volcanic origin ties to the fire/transformation motif. The setting charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics or participate causally in the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing, demonstrating healing over destruction—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested. No on-page tightening or trade-off occurs; Lena's decision to teach the girl is unopposed and costs nothing visible. The girl's question ("Why do you come here?") offers a beat of mild curiosity but no reversal or escalation. The siren in the distance is a token gesture toward external pressure but does not force a choice. Under the Accumulative lens, a deepening or cadence shift is required; here the mood remains static from first to last paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation, healing, legacy—emerges through the coin, black sand, and fire/water imagery. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("she had come to prove… but she had stayed to teach others how to hear the song"), restating the premise rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The coin as a "beacon of what had been and what could still be" is symbolic convenience, arriving late with charged language but no earned complexity. The girl's understanding is asserted ("she nodded as if she understood") without dramatized friction. Subtext is present in the sand-sifting gesture but the thematic closure lands as a tidy summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; diction mixes firefighter particulars ("boots," "calloused hands") with elevated, poeticized phrasing ("kelp-drift peace," "gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion"). The dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in the exchange with the girl, carrying mild subtext. However, register drifts into abstract lyricism in high-reflection beats ("grafted her past onto her present," "scars could sing"), weakening voice specificity under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent (fire-and-ruin filter) but lacks urgency modulation. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are generally strong; sentence rhythm varies and no major loops appear. However, figurative density is high throughout without escalation ("obsidian lagoon," "kelp-drift peace," "scars could sing," "coin… a beacon," "sand shifted… testament to the earth's resilience")—metaphors accumulate without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing propulsion. The phrase "scars could sing" recurs three times without transformation, approaching template cadence. The final paragraph stacks abstract clauses ("the promise of peace," "what had been and what could still be") that dilute the closure image. No major artifacts touch the ending directly, but density moderates momentum across the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter-turned-firefighter frame is familiar (trauma-into-vocation template) and executed without a fresh angle; the core emotional arc—proving healing over destruction—could transfer to any mentor figure with minor edits. The black volcanic sand and obsidian lagoon provide specific texture, but the transformation (fire → sand → healing) is overt rather than surprising. The coin as inherited talisman and the teaching-the-child ending follow well-worn paths. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece opts for poeticized safety over narrative friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The character (arsonist's daughter firefighter) is present throughout and frames motivation, but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or cost. Observation and reflection dominate; the choice to teach the girl is unopposed and costs nothing. Setup is clear (opening paragraph), but middle and closure beats lack causal pressure tied to this identity. The attribute appears in exposition more than action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Black volcanic sand is handled twice (grains cling to her hands in paragraph 2; she sifts a handful in paragraph 9) and returns with metaphoric weight ("This place reminds me that light can come from the darkest places"). Setup occurs early, middle involves a physical gesture that illustrates theme, and closure references it indirectly ("the black sand whispering beneath their feet"). However, it does not constrain a choice or drive a beat; its role is primarily symbolic. The lyric reprise reweights meaning moderately but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The concept (unyielding compassion) is echoed thematically in Lena's gentle teaching and the phrase "unyielding compassion" appears once (paragraph 11). It does not shape on-page tactics or force a trade-off; instead it functions as a thematic label. The girl's trust and Lena's patience illustrate the concept but do not test it under pressure. Functional but replaceable; any mentor-virtue could serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The trait (gracefully alert) appears once as a descriptor ("gracefully alert to the world around her") without enabling or constraining action. It reads as label-only; no on-page choice demonstrates heightened perception or costs of vigilance. Mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The action (graft) is used metaphorically once ("grafted her past onto her present, stitching together the ashes of her childhood with the purpose of her work") and does not drive a beat or turn. It illustrates backstory integration but is not a live verb that alters present tactics. Introduced mid-story without setup; easily swappable with "stitched" or "wove."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The coin (foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread) is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled twice (Lena touches it; the girl asks about it), and participates in the ending image ("glinted in the fading light, a beacon"). Setup and closure gates are met; however, the coin does not enable or constrain a choice. Its role is symbolic (reminder of father, inheritance) rather than causal. The two-beat lyric reprise reweights the father motif moderately but lacks tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is established in the opening line and anchors all action; its stillness mirrors Lena's reflective state and the black sand provides tactile grounding. However, the lagoon does not constrain choice or alter tactics—it is a backdrop that supports tone rather than pressing decisions. The final image ("the lagoon held them all") reprises the opening motif with thematic weight. Setup, middle presence, and closure participation are all met, but causal pressure is absent. The lyric reprise moderately reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe (during the migration of clouds) appears in the opening and closing but does not track elapsed time or tighten decisions. Clouds are referenced as "slow migration," "thickening," and "drifted on" without creating urgency or altering tactics. Time is vague and ornamental; the piece could occur in any reflective moment. No gate is met robustly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation (to prove that scars can sing) is stated twice explicitly and frames the arc, but is never tested or conflicted on the page. Lena arrives with this belief and departs teaching it; no friction between want and cost appears. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Setup and closure mention it, but middle development lacks pressure. Functional framing but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tone (kelp-drift peace) is named once and sustained through quiet, reflective phrasing and the lagoon's stillness. Tone remains consistent across beats without modulation under pressure—the mood at opening matches the mood at close. The siren's wail in the penultimate paragraph offers mild contrast but does not shift the dominant register. The final image ("quiet hum of healing") reinforces the established tone. Coherent but static; the tone does not charge the closure with new weight.</comment>
