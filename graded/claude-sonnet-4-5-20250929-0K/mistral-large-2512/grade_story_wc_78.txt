<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation to transform obstacles is clear, and his embodied connection to the sea ("soles of his feet," "salt in his veins") grounds interiority. However, the internal arc flatlines after the midpoint: he faces no genuine friction or contradictory impulse, and the final laugh arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece defaults to competence without struggle—he simply executes his vision—which undercuts the earned-change requirement for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation (who, where, when) lands cleanly within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is evident: rhythmic layering builds toward the climactic mallet strike and sky-glowing resonance. However, closure lacks legible cost—the world "sings back" and Leeward is "heard," but no prior option is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes with felt price. The ending reads as pure escalation without the decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing required on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood setting is vivid and specific, constraining Leeward's platform and providing the raft-as-instrument. Sensory details (salt, sun-bleached planks, fruit "tasted of brine and stubbornness") filter through his tide-prophet lens. The setting participates in the climax (driftwood spins, trees groan) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint. Minor over-description in the middle third slightly dilutes momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming obstacles into euphony—is signaled early and propels each beat. The mallet-striking sequence tightens rhythmically, and the clouds' fractal shift offers visual escalation. Yet the accumulative pressure never narrows options or imposes a trade-off; Leeward encounters no resistance, miscalculation, or refusal. Without visible cost or a live choice that forecloses a path, escalation reads decorative rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of obstacles-as-instruments emerges through concrete action (mallet, driftwood, sea resonance) and avoids overt moralizing. The image of clouds becoming a xylophone frame is striking and specific. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("beauty of it, the way the obstacles had become something so much greater") rather than trusting the image alone. The ending offers resonance but not a non-literal reweighting with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature is consistent: Leeward perceives through tidal and musical metaphors ("fractal paths," "harmonics," "sea's audience"). Diction stays grounded in his idiom. A few lines drift toward elevated register under peak stress ("euphony," "restless heart of the world"), but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates purposefully with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats. However, the middle third shows paraphrase loops: "He struck the driftwood again" recycles prior action without advancing pressure, and "The mallet moved faster" summarizes rather than dramatizes. The final paragraph stacks near-synonyms ("across the water, but through it, through the salt and the sky") that blur propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; closure beat remains clear, capping non-closure deduction at −0.4 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood premise is fresh, and the tide-prophet role avoids archetype. The xylophone-mallet-as-world-tuner synthesis feels specific. Yet the emotional arc—solitary artist achieves transcendent communion—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through unexpected friction or moral calculus. Transformation test: swap "tide prophet" for "sound mage" and the core journey remains unchanged. The specificity of setting and object elevates but does not overcome template emotional beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leeward appears in every beat and his decision to strike the driftwood drives the climax. However, his choices are execution rather than dilemma—no on-page moment where he weighs cost or alters tactics. Present throughout, causally active, but never forced to decide between competing goods or face a consequence that redefines his path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet is introduced early (paragraph 2), used physically in multiple beats (dubbing, striking, raised higher, brought down with a crack), and shapes the climax when its strike "split the silence" and sends the raft spinning. It is irreplaceable—no generic tool would carry the musical metaphor. Closure linkage is strong, though the mallet does not return with reweighted meaning; its function remains consistent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" as concept is signaled early ("fractal paths the wind carved," "resonance into the air") and governs the stakes: Leeward aims to make the sea and sky resonate together. It shapes tactics (dubbing to send pulses, striking for harmonics) and appears in the climax ("the air thickening with sound," "resonating"). However, it functions more as atmospheric theme than a constraint with visible cost; swapping "resonance" for "harmony" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is mentioned early ("interprets cloud movements," "tonight they were not omens—they were collaborators") and colors his perception throughout. Yet the trait never constrains a choice or imposes cost—he reads the clouds effortlessly and they cooperate. The skill is label-only; no scene shows misreading, ambiguity, or a trade-off tied to this specific ability. Present and thematically consistent but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "dub" is introduced early ("to press its tip against the driftwood and let the vibrations travel") and recurs ("dubbing the driftwood in quick, precise taps"). It is the method that initiates the raft's song and builds toward the climactic strike. However, "dub" could be swapped for "tap" or "press" with minimal loss; the specificity of the term does not alter outcome or cost. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is seeded early ("fractal paths the wind carved," "The fractal generating had begun") and reappears at the climax ("fractal patterns in the clouds began to glow"). It names the process Leeward triggers and links wind, sound, and sky. Yet the mechanics remain abstract—what makes it fractal versus circular or harmonic is never shown on the page. The method is present and thematic but not causally specific enough to constrain tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood setting is established in the opening sentence, provides the physical platform for all action, and becomes the instrument (raft shivering, driftwood struck, trees leaning and groaning). The setting's instability (floating, swaying) is embodied and participates in the climax when the raft spins. Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic; a fixed stage would lose the interplay of sea, raft, and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The blue hour is named early ("The blue hour had settled") and mentioned at the ending ("The blue hour deepened"). It provides atmospheric tone and marks the liminal moment. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a visible clock—Leeward's actions are not constrained by fading light or an approaching deadline. The timeframe is present and coherent but ornamental; any twilight synonym would serve equally well.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is dramatized early (orchard as proof, sea as collaborator) and drives every beat. Leeward's final laugh and the sea "playing along" fulfill the desire. However, the motivation faces no friction or conflicted cost—he wants to transform, and he does. No moment shows him weighing a price, risking failure, or choosing this path over an alternative. Desire is clear and causally active but not tested with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "restless euphony" is established early (sea's chaos folding into rhythm, "raw and wild" laugh) and modulates through the piece: quiet observation → rhythmic striking → ecstatic crescendo. Diction choices ("euphony," "harmonics," "resonating") sustain the musical register, and the final image ("the world was singing back") charges the closure with that tone. The tone is coherent and purposeful, integral to the piece's effect.</comment>
