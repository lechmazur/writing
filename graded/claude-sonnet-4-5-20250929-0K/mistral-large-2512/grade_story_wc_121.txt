<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is given a clear want (escape whispers, conquer the labyrinth) but internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—he moves through visions and encounters without embodied tension between competing impulses. The scarred-self confrontation declares stakes ("You've come to kill me") but Elias's hesitation and final choice feel asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that test his hierarchy of values. Interiority leans abstract ("fractured—split between who he was and who he might have been") without the specific, embodied perception that would anchor his state under pressure. The ending grants wholeness as summary rather than visible cost that forecloses a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early (Elias, viaduct) but "when" remains vague throughout; the storm-cleared sky and rain bookend offer atmosphere without a time-window that tightens decisions. The closure unit—letting go of the door, labyrinth collapse, return to viaduct—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization), but the cost is told ("he didn't feel fractured… felt whole") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or image that makes the price undeniable. Drive lens is Hybrid (causal tablet-touch triggers the labyrinth; accumulative visions and echoes; situational pressure from other selves), coherent through the middle but the ending summarizes the shift rather than landing it via a decisive image or action. The "way out" line offers conceptual closure but the felt cost required by the rubric is missing from the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The viaduct is vivid and specific (wet stones, arches humming with energy, ozone and wet stone smell) and recurs at closure to bookend the journey. However, spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is abstract—"streets and alleys branching into infinite permutations" and "the room around them flickered" lack concrete anchors for movement or proximity. The tablet constrains one choice (palm-press triggers the labyrinth) and the door is a physical threshold, so micro-setting does participate. The glowing stone and runes tie viaduct to door to tablet, creating a material through-line, but the labyrinth itself remains a white room of visions rather than a lived-in space with tactile friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (conquer the labyrinth of self) and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias faces the scarred self and the choice crystallizes: "you can choose which version of yourself gets to walk out." However, the escalation is largely situational—visions complicate but do not force trade-offs with visible cost. The protagonist's final act (letting go of the door) is his decision, but the labyrinth collapse and return feel granted rather than won through a forfeiture that narrows live options on the page. Pressure is present but does not narrow options through a felt price at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fractured-self theme is coherent and emerges through concrete images: the accidental float, the tablet visions, the scarred alternate, the whispers quieting. The final image (standing whole, mud, rain) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, and the labyrinth-as-choice realization avoids platitude. However, "You are periodically eternal" and the explain-everything exchange with the scarred self edge toward direct thematic statement rather than pure subtext. The ending earns its shift but the scarred-self dialogue ("you can't conquer the labyrinth, but you can choose which version") verges on thesis articulation, slightly dulling the oblique power of the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias with appropriate narrative distance (he "knew then what he had to do" fits his reflective register). Perceptual signature is present but not always character-particular—"the weight of something unsaid" and "mad cartographer" feel more authorial than Elias's specific way of noticing. The scarred-self dialogue ("You've come to kill me") is clean and goal-driven, but Elias's replies are elided, reducing on-page voice distinction. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("permutations," "labyrinth of self") without clear grounding in Elias's idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and peak beats (the float, the tablet touch, the door encounter) carry momentum. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The labyrinth was still there, but so was the way out" echoes "he didn't feel fractured… felt whole" without adding new pressure. Template stems recur in the labyrinth sequence ("He turned… He clenched his fists… He reached out"). Stock metaphor "map drawn by a mad cartographer" and the abstract "infinite permutations" lean generic at a high-pressure turn. No major opacity, but scaffold sentences and elevated diction ("periodically eternal," "mad cartographer") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Line-level control is solid outside these slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—protagonist confronts alternate selves in a fractured-timeline labyrinth—closely follows a widely used self-discovery template (hero's internal journey, literal manifestation of psyche, realization-as-resolution). The viaduct setting and procedural-generation frame offer specific texture, but the core arc (escape whispers → enter labyrinth → meet shadow self → accept wholeness) is structurally familiar. Transformation is limited: the emotional calculus (you choose which self walks out) is stated rather than embodied through a non-obvious cost. The rain-bookend and the tablet-as-warning twist are solid inflections but do not fundamentally alter the template's predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices (brush the tablet, press palm, let go of the door) create turns. The final choice (letting go) triggers the labyrinth collapse and return, altering outcome. However, the middle beats (floating, encountering visions, hearing echoes) are largely observations without decisions that narrow options. The ending choice is decisive but the cost is told rather than shown through a visible forfeiture tied to his agency. Setup early, development partial, payoff present but cost implicit. Two gates met solidly, third gate (causal pressure with visible cost) partial.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tablet appears at ~15% (beneath the bridge), is handled (wiped, fingers brush runes, palm pressed), triggers the labyrinth entry, and is noted as "gone" at the end with its runes faded. Two distinct beats (discovery/touch, post-return absence) with causal linkage to the middle journey. The ending note ("The tablet was gone. The runes had faded") reweights its function as catalyst rather than prize. Setup, development (triggers labyrinth), and payoff (absence signals closure) all present. Could be swapped for another mystical object with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced at tablet-touch ("map drawn by a mad cartographer… every decision spawning new timelines") and shape the labyrinth's structure (visions of other selves, "some where Elias had won, some where he'd lost"). The concept enables the scarred-self encounter and informs the stakes (choose which version walks out). However, the mechanics remain abstract—timelines are described but do not constrain tactics on the page; Elias does not navigate competing versions or trade-offs, he simply witnesses them. Setup ~40%, development thematic, payoff conceptual. Two gates met, but causal pressure is low; the concept frames meaning more than it shapes on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears once as a whispered phrase ("You are periodically eternal") with no prior setup, no action enabled or constrained, and no return. The label is evocative but ornamental—it does not affect Elias's choices, tactics, or cost. Missing setup, missing development, missing payoff. One mention, no causal work, swappable with any mystical phrase. Late first appearance, ornamental, summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" is stated as intention ("he'd have to retrace every path he'd ever taken") and implied in the labyrinth's structure (visions of past choices, encountering alternate selves). However, Elias does not perform retracing as an on-page action with visible steps—he is shown visions rather than actively revisiting. The concept informs stakes but is not dramatized as a method with cost. Setup present, development thematic, payoff absent. One mention, no distinct causal beats, swappable with "confront" or "revisit." Could be removed with minor edits to the intention line without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Procedural generation is named once ("procedural generation, not of code, but of time") at the labyrinth entry and shapes the middle description (branching timelines, shifting labyrinth). The concept frames the labyrinth's logic but does not constrain Elias's attempts or tactics—he does not navigate generation rules or make choices based on how the space is created. Setup ~35%, development thematic, payoff absent. One beat (entry description), no causal pressure, swappable with "infinite permutations" or similar. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct appears in the opening (wet stones, glowing arches, humming energy), grounds the tablet discovery (beneath the bridge), and returns at closure (glow dimming, rain falling again) to bookend the journey. The setting enables the inciting accident (foot caught on loose slab) and the final grounding moment. Three distinct beats (opening run, tablet discovery, return), causal linkage to the journey's trigger and resolution, strong closure participation via the rain-bookend that reweights the opening. Setup immediate, development (discovery), payoff (return). Specificity (humming arches, loose slab) is high and the viaduct could not be easily swapped without losing the glow/rain motif that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" appears once at labyrinth entry ("suspended in the moment before impact, before consequence") as metaphor for the threshold state. It does not structure the narrative timeline or create a live clock that alters tactics. The phrase is evocative but ornamental—time remains vague throughout (storm-cleared sky, rain returns) without tightening decisions. Missing setup, one thematic mention, missing payoff. Swappable with any threshold metaphor. Late first appearance (~35%), no causal beats, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to conquer the labyrinth of self") is stated early ("he knew then what he had to do") and dramatized through the journey: tablet-touch, labyrinth entry, scarred-self encounter, final choice. Internal friction appears when Elias hesitates ("This wasn't the confrontation he'd expected") and when the scarred self reframes the goal ("you can't conquer… but you can choose"). The ending cost (wholeness as acceptance rather than conquest) shows want versus reality. Setup early, development through middle encounters, payoff at the door choice. Three beats, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong. The want is tested but the friction could be sharper—Elias's internal conflict is more told than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone opens with darkening brightness (storm-cleared sky, glowing viaduct, wet stones shimmering) and closes with dimming glow and rain returning, creating a coherent frame. The labyrinth middle shifts darker (ozone, heavy air, monstrous alternate) then resolves to quieter brightness (wholeness, mud, breathing hard). The modulation supports the arc from dislocation to integration. Setup immediate, development present, payoff in the dimming-glow return. However, the tonal palette is somewhat static—brightness dims but does not sharpen internal pressure through rhythm or image choice at peak beats. Purposeful but not deeply charged at closure.</comment>
