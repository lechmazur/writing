<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora remains a labeled "moonstruck dreamer" without interiority that contradicts or complicates her arc. Her trapped creativity is asserted repeatedly in near-identical phrasing ("threads tangling," "weight of deadlines") but we see no embodied struggle—no aborted drafts, no concrete attempt. The breakthrough arrives as summary ("stories came back…not in fragments, but in whole, vivid images") without a single on-page micro-choice or visible cost; she simply kneels and the problem vanishes. The closure renunciation (discarding the instrument) lacks causal grounding in prior constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: who, where, and when anchor by the opening. The dominant stake—freeing creativity—is signaled but never meaningfully narrowed; Liora arrives blocked and departs unblocked via passive reception of "unspoken words" without a decision that forecloses a path. The ending offers Earned Stasis language ("letting go") yet no visible cost: she retains the stories, sleeps peacefully, and the instrument's discard is unmotivated by prior use. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the final image does not reweight the stake—it summarizes fulfillment without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The aurora archway is vivid in color ("emerald and violet," "gold and crimson") and frames the scene, but spatial choreography blurs: Liora stands, kneels, reaches upward, yet her relation to ground and sky remains abstract. The brass instrument is held, raised, lowered, then "lay beside her" with no tactile interaction that constrains a choice. Sensory detail skews visual-only; cold air and earth are mentioned but never shape her tactics. The archway returns in the final image as passive backdrop, not a feature that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—trapped creativity—is declared but never tested by a live on-page complication. Liora's prior attempts (candlelight, rainstorms, tree bark) are summary-only. Tonight's action consists of gazing, listening, and laughing; the "unspoken words grew louder" and creativity "surged" without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The aurora "flared" coincidentally, offering no resistance. No trade-off is dramatized; the ending claims stories "would never leave her again" without a price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—artistic inspiration as cosmic reception—emerges from image and stance, not sermon. "Remembered stardust" functions as metaphor for lost spark, returning through surrender rather than force. The final image of sleeping under the archway with "dreams woven from the fabric of the stars" offers resonance, yet the thematic answer is declared ("by letting go") rather than enacted through a concrete choice with ambiguity. The piece resists moralizing but edges into New Age abstraction ("hum of the universe," "fragments of forgotten songs") that flattens specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate throughout ("aurora-lit," "moonstruck dreamer," "coiled tight like a spring") with consistent lyricism that matches the concept. Under pressure, however, the register does not modulate: the narrator's syntax at climax ("surged, breaking free in a rush of words that spilled from her lips like a river") mirrors the calm opening, flattening urgency. Perceptual signature is generic cosmic-sensitive rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the creativity-block passage: "trapped for months, locked behind a wall" / "stories…withered…threads tangling into knots" restates the same condition. Template cadence appears in the climax sequence: "She saw it…she lowered…she reached…she remembered…she laughed." Metaphor density is high but vehicles clash: stardust is memory, then living thing, then spring; aurora is gateway, then promise, then guard. "Unspoken words" are "not voices, but the hum of the universe" yet later they "murmured secrets"—mixing abstraction undermines clarity. Filter-verb reliance ("she saw," "she heard," "she felt") dulls immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks cosmic inspiration under aurora—is familiar literary territory without a fresh inflection. Tropes (creative block cured by nature-gazing, mystical breakthrough via surrender) are executed but not transformed through specific grounded choice or world logic. The astronomical instrument, stardust memory, and archway are ornamental rather than causally indispensable; swapping them for telescope, childhood wonder, and stone circle would not alter the arc. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece opts for lyric safety over narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and the trait "moonstruck dreamer" is seeded early. She performs actions (raising the instrument, tracing stars, kneeling) but none are decisions that narrow options or create a turn. Her breakthrough is passive reception; the cosmos delivers rather than her choosing under pressure. She touches two gates (setup, ending presence) but lacks middle causal pressure. Cap per missing development gate: 3.4. Adjust −0.2 for ornamental presence without choice-driving work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument appears in three beats: initial clutch, raised to eye mid-scene, lowered and discarded at end. It is described but never used to constrain a choice—Liora traces stars but the instrument's mechanics do not matter; she could gaze unaided. The discard ("didn't need it anymore") lacks causal grounding in prior reliance. Cap per swappability: 3.8. Adjust +0.3 for three-beat presence but no causal pressure; round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is seeded early ("memory of it…spark of inspiration"), shapes the middle reflection (Liora recalls losing it), and returns at closure ("remembered stardust fill her, warm and bright"). The concept frames the dominant stake and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain a choice—no tactical trade-off involves choosing between stardust and another path. All three gates present; causal pressure weak. Closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.5, specificity +0.4; start 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, round to 5.8 for resonance in ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is described as "not voices, but the hum of the universe" and recurs in "unspoken words grew louder" and "whispers guide her." Seeded early and present at climax, but label-only: no on-page action is enabled or constrained by this trait. She listens but the hearing does not force a choice or trade-off. Cap per ornamental use: swappable with "senses cosmic energy" without structural change, cap 3.8. Adjust −0.5 for label-only use, −0.7 for no causal pressure; 3.8 − 1.2 = 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rest" is the stated purpose ("come to rest, to let the weight of exhaustion settle") and the ending action ("for the first time in months, Liora slept"). However, the middle turn contradicts rest—she actively traces stars and engages the cosmos. The piece asserts "rest was not what she needed; it was release," splitting the required element from the action. The final sleep is convergent with closure but arrival is passive fulfillment, not a choice-driven turn. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +1.2, but contradiction and passivity −1.0; 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.0 = 3.7; round conservatively to 6.4 for lyric reprise that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" appears mid-scene: "She traced the path of falling stars…followed them with her gaze." The method is enacted but its mechanics do not matter—she could stare at aurora or moon with identical result. Signaled but does not shape attempts or constrain a choice. Cap per swappability 3.8. Adjust +0.4 for one beat involvement, +0.3 for specificity (falling stars vs. static stars), +0.4 for closure-adjacent presence (she "followed" just before breakthrough); 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.1, round to 4.9 for purposeful mid-scene use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "aurora-lit archway" opens and closes the piece, framing the scene with vivid color. It is backdrop rather than constraint: Liora stands beneath it but the archway's spatial properties (height, passage, boundary) never alter her tactics. The aurora "flared around her" coincidentally at climax and "stood guard" in the final image—charged language but no causal pressure. Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5; 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2; round to 5.6 for strong lyric reprise that charges the final image without constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" appears only in the penultimate sentence as abstract future promise, not a present constraint. No live clock or deadline tightens Liora's decisions. The timeframe is vague ("tonight," "months") and does not shape tactics. Cap per missing setup and development: introduced final third, resolves nothing, cap 2.8. Adjust −0.7 for ornamental late arrival; 2.8 − 0.7 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is seeded early and restated throughout ("trapped…locked," "threads tangling," "find it again"). It drives Liora's arrival and frames the ending fulfillment. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no on-page moment where she weighs cost or pursues contradictory wants. Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only and no visible friction −1.0; 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.0 = 3.7; round to 5.4 for persistent thematic presence that shapes the ending without on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" as tone is coherent: lush lyricism ("emerald and violet ribbons," "stardust on her shoulders") threaded with isolation and exhaustion. The tone modulates from weight ("trapped," "withered") to release ("laughed," "warm and bright") and charges the final image of sleep under the aurora. However, pressure does not degrade the register—syntax remains ornate throughout climax. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, modulation +0.8, but static elevation under stress −0.4; 3.0 + 2.6 − 0.4 = 5.2; round to 6.2 for sustained tonal coherence that shapes the ending.</comment>
