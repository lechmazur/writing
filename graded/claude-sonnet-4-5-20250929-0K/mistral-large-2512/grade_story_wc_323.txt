<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation is coherent—she is drawn to alien navigation methods—but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The shift from doubt to resolve ("Then we will make them ours") arrives quickly without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices during experimentation are summarized ("slow work, fraught with failure") rather than dramatized with visible cost, and the elder Tael's reversal lacks earned causality. The final choice feels asserted rather than compelled by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation early (benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien arrival) and follows a causal progression: Lirien observes alien vessels → salvages chain link → forges tools → tests starlight navigation → gathers students for expansion. However, closure cost is implied rather than legibly paid on the page; "It was time to expand" declares intent without showing what path has been foreclosed or what price Lirien has accepted. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat delivers aspiration rather than a felt consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (the alien vessel alignment moment), meeting minimum escalation for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The benthic city is vivid in opening description ("corpse of coral and steel," "pressure-forged alloys") and the abyssal plain provides consistent spatial grounding. The chain link receives concrete attention (rusted, pitted, "perfect, unyielding curve") and reappears at closure, but it does not constrain a choice—it functions as symbol rather than tool that alters tactics. The observatory setting is present but generic; sensory hierarchy tilts visual without leveraging pressure or depth. Micro-setting standard is met minimally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight—is signaled early and drives the arc. Pressure tightens when Lirien observes the alien vessel aligning with her tracked star, a meaningful turn that narrows her understanding and opens the path to teaching. However, escalation is mostly procedural (salvage → forge → experiment → understand) without visible trade-offs or losses; the "slow work, fraught with failure" is told rather than shown. Tael's skepticism dissolves without friction, and the ending declares expansion rather than testing commitment with a legible cost. One tightening is present but agency at closure is aspirational, not decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of crossing boundaries and expanding horizons emerges from the benthic/celestial contrast and the chain link as connective metaphor. "The stars are not our enemies...They are our new horizon" verbalizes the theme rather than letting the final image carry it, reducing subtext. The piece resists overt moralizing elsewhere, but the ending leans toward thematic summary ("the promise of something greater") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. The chain link recurs but its meaning shift is more decorative than causally earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lirien throughout; no head-hopping. Focalization is controlled, though perceptual signature remains generic in stress moments—"her heart swelling with somber marvel" tells emotional state rather than filtering perception through her navigation-trained lens. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Tael's voice does not distinguish from Lirien's narratorial diction. Psychic distance holds steady, and there are no filter-verb stacks or tense breaks. The prose lacks a strong rhythmic or lexical signature specific to this character under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "horizons had unfolded" / "unfolded horizons" early on, and the closure paragraph recycles "horizons had unfolded" again without added pressure. Template cadence is present in the experimentation summary: "They used...They built...It was slow work." Figurative language is controlled but occasionally strained ("abyssal plain...spires clawed at the dark"). Information density is moderate; the middle section summarizes weeks of work rather than dramatizing key beats. No severe artifacts, but momentum sags in the experimental montage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The underwater city discovering stellar navigation offers a fresh spatial inversion, and the chain link as template for lens-forging is a specific, grounded detail. However, the emotional arc—skeptic becomes believer, closed world opens—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived contradiction or non-obvious moral calculus. The alien arrival functions as external catalyst rather than forcing Lirien's own flaws or limits into the foreground. The piece commits to its premise but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirien is present throughout and her role as navigation instructor frames the premise. She makes one key choice—deciding to teach stellar navigation—but this choice is declared at the end rather than tested with cost. Her instruction work is mostly told in summary ("teaching others to read the currents") and the final gathering of students restates intent without altering tactics. The character shapes one turn (the realization during the alien vessel pass) but does not drive two distinct beats with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chain link appears early (salvaged from wreck), is handled in the observatory scene (held up, turned in palm, placed on table), and recurs at closure ("picked up...familiar in her hand"). Its edge geometry is cited as the template for lens-forging, giving it functional presence across beats. However, the link does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it enables the solution without cost. The final reprise reweights its symbolic meaning (tools can expand) but lacks causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept "unfolded horizons" is named three times on the page and shapes the thematic frame—Lirien's world expands from seabed to stars. It motivates the stakes (learning starlight navigation) but does not constrain tactics or generate visible cost. The aliens unfold the horizon off-page before the story begins; the on-page work is application rather than discovery. The concept is present and coherent but functions more as theme than as an active stake-shaper with trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious—drawn to their knowledge, but wary of the abyss between their world and hers" is stated once in paragraph three and never tested on the page. Lirien's actions show curiosity (studying alien ships, experimenting with lenses) but no visible wariness or trade-off between attraction and caution. The trait is label-only; it does not enable or constrain a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Expand" is the final word and frames the ending intent; Lirien's weeks of experimentation and the final gathering of students are stages of expansion. The action shapes the middle (forging tools, building lenses) and recurs thematically, but the key turn—understanding the alien trajectory—does not itself "expand" so much as "align" or "decode." The action is present across beats but could be restated as "learn" or "reach" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is named once as the design principle for the chain link and reappears when Lirien forges "new tools with the same edge geometry" to refract light. It is present in setup and middle use, but its mechanics are not dramatized—how the curved edge enables focusing starlight is asserted, not shown. The method does not constrain an attempt or force a failure; it simply works. No closure participation or specificity that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The benthic city is established vividly in the opening and provides spatial grounding throughout (abyssal plain, trench, observatory, city's edge). Pressure and depth are thematic anchors. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Lirien operates within it but does not navigate its social or physical obstacles in a way that forces trade-offs. The city functions as backdrop and tone-setter rather than as crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is established in the opening exposition ("after the aliens had come") and frames the premise. However, discovery is historical; the aliens are already present and static above the trench. The on-page timeframe spans "following weeks" of experimentation, told in summary, and "one evening" for the key observation—time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to learn starlight navigation is stated early ("drawn to their knowledge"), demonstrated through Lirien's nightly observations and tool-building, and voiced at closure ("The stars are not our enemies"). It drives the arc and is present across beats. However, the desire is not conflicted—Lirien encounters skepticism from Tael but no internal friction or cost between her curiosity and another want. The motivation is clear and consistent but lacks dramatized trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is embodied in the opening imagery ("corpse of coral and steel," "frigid water," "eerie precision") and returns in the ending ("somber marvel" is named directly). Tone is coherent through the arc—wonder tempered by the abyssal setting's weight. The final image ("her heart swelling with somber marvel") names the tone rather than charging it through a specific sensory or action beat, reducing its resonance. Tone modulates minimally; the piece holds one steady register rather than shifting under pressure.</comment>
