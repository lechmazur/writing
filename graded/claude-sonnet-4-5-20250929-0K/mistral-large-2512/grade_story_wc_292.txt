<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven through most beats ("nervous confidence" embodied in trembling fingers, determination to decipher journals). The final choice to continue Elias's work feels somewhat abrupt—"whether she was brave enough to finish what he'd started" reads as announced rather than earned through contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Elias's backstory is vividly reconstructed but remains largely reflective; Mira's present micro-choices (finding the nail, unlocking the furnace) advance plot without deep internal contradiction under pressure. The ending hovers between decision and deferral, weakening the sense of visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative touches (coded stanzas, nail-as-key mystery). Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN by the second paragraph. The nail → furnace lock is a clean reversal that narrows options and reweights Elias's exile from punishment to mission. Closure lands on-page: Mira realizes "Exile is reversible, but so is the sky" and "He'd been sent," which reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (she inherits a hidden mandate). The final beat—"whether she was brave enough to finish what he'd started"—feels slightly告知 rather than crystallized in action, reducing felt immediacy. Cost is legible but not viscerally paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cliffside station is vividly anchored with rusted girders, salt-warped shelves, mildew/ozone scent, and the failing generators. The copper nail functions as micro-setting: it constrains Mira's search and unlocks the hidden passage, directly enabling the closure revelation. Spatial choreography (archives → furnace → passage) is clear. The "new sky" and shifted jet stream add atmospheric pressure without becoming a postcard. The nail's flattened head and the furnace lock are specific, purpose-driven details that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: honor Elias and decode his warnings. Pressure tightens through the nail discovery, reversible-stanza puzzle, and furnace unlock—each narrows options under the causal lens. The "exile is reversible, but so is the sky" revelation and "He'd been sent" reweight the ancestor's story with conceptual cost (Mira now faces the same hidden mission). Agency is present but leans interpretive: Mira reads and unlocks rather than making a high-stakes trade-off in the moment. The final "whether she was brave enough" flags future cost without paying it on the page, softening escalation's bite at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth hidden in exile, the reversibility of judgment and fate—emerges organically from the nail, coded journals, and Elias's "sent" status. The final line "Exile is reversible, but so is the sky" reweights the premise without overt moralizing, though "He'd been sent" flirts with explication. Subtext operates in the nail's dual function (coffin → boat repair → key) and the mutineers' "mercy or joke." The resolution invites reflection on legacy and bravery without reducing to a tidy moral. Minor slip: "whether she was brave enough" slightly externalizes the thematic question rather than embodying it fully in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance tightens appropriately under discovery. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices marginalia, reversible lines, the nail's flattened head—details filtered through her scholar's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("spongey dread," "the new sky," "unchartable"). No dialogue appears; internal voice carries specificity without filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean ("The nail had been meant for his coffin, but Elias had used it to repair the boat"). Brief tense consistency slip: "She had come" (past perfect) followed by simple past without clear temporal pivot, but the effect is minor and does not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines advance mystery, setting, or character. Minor paraphrase loop: "The nail had been the key all along—not just to the furnace, but to the truth. And the truth was that Elias hadn't been exiled. He'd been sent." The two-beat restatement ("the truth was... And the truth was") slightly deflates momentum at closure. Figurative language is controlled ("clinging like a dying man," "spongey dread") without overwriting. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Proofreading is clean; no grammatical errors observed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reversible-exile premise and ancestor-mystery frame are familiar but executed with specific touches: copper nail from coffin repurposed as boat repair and later a key, coded stanzas read backward, "exile is reversible, but so is the sky." The weather-station setting and jet-stream backstory add fresh context. The "He'd been sent" twist reframes exile as mission, though the reveal leans slightly toward announced insight rather than inevitability in hindsight. Emotional specificity ("nervous confidence," "spongey dread") elevates stock elements. The combination feels competent and engaging but not wholly surprising; risk-taking is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout but her "idealistic" quality is largely asserted in setup ("deciphering secrets no one else cared to read," "to honor an ancestor's bravery") rather than tested through on-page idealism-versus-pragmatism friction. Her choices (search journals, decode stanzas, unlock furnace) are investigative and purpose-driven but do not hinge on idealism creating a visible cost or tactical constraint. She is more "determined scholar" than "idealistic" in dramatized action. Label-only trait application and swappability with "curious" or "obsessive" cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three distinct beats: exhumed from Elias's coffin (setup), carried in Mira's pocket and examined (middle), and used as the key to unlock the furnace passage (closure). Its flattened head shifts meaning from coffin nail → boat repair → literal key, constraining the final revelation. The nail is indispensable to closure logic and charges the "truth" metaphor. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; only minor gap is that the nail's keyhole is not foreshadowed earlier, slightly reducing inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" shapes the dominant stake and tactics: Mira decodes reversible stanzas, discovers Elias survived and returned, and realizes "Exile is reversible, but so is the sky" at closure. The concept constrains her investigation (she seeks the reversible pattern) and reweights the ancestor's story from punishment to test/mission. It appears in setup (the mutiny/exile backstory), drives middle beats (the reversible lines puzzle), and anchors the final revelation ("He'd been sent"). High causal pressure and closure linkage; the concept is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is signaled early ("trembling—not from fear, but from the nervous confidence of someone who had spent years deciphering secrets") and embodied in Mira's determined but shaky actions (adjusting glasses, hands shaking as she turns pages). The trait enables her persistence through the mystery but does not create a visible cost or constrain a key choice—she never hesitates or second-guesses in ways that trade confidence against caution. The attribute colors her manner without driving a beat's outcome. Lyric reprise at closure is absent. Functional but mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Question" drives the investigation: Mira questions the official exile story, decodes Elias's warnings, and ultimately questions "whether she was brave enough to finish what he'd started." The act of questioning enables the nail-key insight and the "He'd been sent" revelation. It appears across beats (journals → reversible stanzas → furnace unlock → final stance) and shapes closure by framing her inherited mandate. Strong causal role and closure linkage. Minor swappability: "investigate" or "decipher" could serve similar functions with edits, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals" appear in setup (Elias's marginalia), drive the middle beat ("When the wind turns its back... reversible, she realized—read backward, they pointed to the station itself"), and enable the furnace discovery by teaching Mira the pattern. The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter: reversibility is the key to unlocking both the stanzas and the nail's function. The method is indispensable to Mira's success. Minor gap: the stanzas' direct connection to the nail-key is implied rather than explicitly foreshadowed, slightly reducing inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The experimental weather station frames the entire narrative, supplies the archives and furnace (resources that enable discovery), and ties to the jet-stream shift that validates Elias's warnings. The setting's cliffside isolation and rusted, failing infrastructure create atmospheric pressure. The furnace's hidden passage is a direct causal tool at closure. The station is indispensable to plot logic and thematic resonance (science outpost as both exile site and truth repository). Strong setup, development, and closure participation; only minor swappability (another remote research outpost could serve similar functions) prevents highest band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the jet stream shifts" anchors the timeframe in setup ("three winters ago") and motivates Mira's investigation (Elias predicted the change, was exiled for it). The shifted storms create urgency at closure ("The storms were coming again, the jet stream twisting like a living thing. The station's alarms wailed"). Time does not impose a live countdown that alters tactics beat-by-beat, but it contextualizes stakes and charges the final image with imminent danger. Functional across beats; moderate causal role. Missing tight tactical constraint prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To honor an ancestor's overlooked bravery" is stated in setup ("She had come to honor an ancestor's bravery") and tested at closure ("whether she was brave enough to finish what he'd started"). The desire drives Mira's archive search and nail investigation. Friction emerges subtly: honoring Elias means inheriting his hidden mission and facing the same storms/exile. The motivation is dramatized through action (decoding, unlocking) but the cost is projected forward rather than paid on the page, slightly weakening integration. Solid causal role and closure linkage; visible trade-off at closure is implicit, not explicit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is embodied early ("nervous confidence draining into spongey dread") and sustained through escalating discovery: salt-warped archives, ozone scent, furnace rumbling to life "on its own," wind "howling like a thing betrayed." The tone modulates with pressure—determination → unease → dread—and charges the final image (Mira facing inherited mission amid wailing alarms). Coherent across beats and integral to atmosphere. Minor gap: the phrase "spongey dread" appears only once as a label; the sensation is otherwise conveyed through imagery, slightly reducing specificity of integration.</comment>
