<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is told ("to explore ethical storytelling") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The argument with her brother is summarized backstory; we never see her make a micro-choice under pressure that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority leans abstract ("half-lit epiphanies," "quiet revelations") without embodied sensation. The final smile declares serenity but no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early (acceptable). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, candle ritual, and storytelling without causal because/therefore linkage. Closure unit is ambiguous—the candle gutters then returns, Liora smiles, declares "the work was just beginning." No decisive change, no visible cost, no felt price that reconfigures prior material; reads as a setup rather than a resonant reconfiguration. Cost proof test fails: cannot point to an exact sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dome's curved walls and acoustics are vivid and purposeful ("swallowed sound," "breath sound like a whisper from the heavens"). Sensory detail is selective. The candle and shadows charge the final image, and the dome's history (listening for enemies) mirrors Liora's work. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains atmosphere but does not alter a tactical choice on the page, capping the score below 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming how stories are told—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The argument with her brother is summarized, not dramatized. Liora's ritual (lighting candle, tracing symbols, speaking a story) proceeds without opposition or cost. The final line ("The work was just beginning") postpones stakes rather than testing them. No visible price paid that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (ethical storytelling, questioning narratives) emerges from events and the dome metaphor. The story stick and puppet shows are concrete particulars. Subtext operates in the fisherman parable and echo-collector tale. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("If stories were weapons, then she wanted to wield them with care") and the closure offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only a declaration that work continues. Theme is signaled but not transformed by the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and elevated, fitting an urbane calligrapher's register. Perceptual signature is present (ink-stained fingers, precision vs. ivy metaphor). Psychic distance is controlled. However, reflection dominates (~50% of text) and some phrasing trends abstract ("half-lit epiphanies," "meteor hush of distant waves"). No dialogue to test voice distinction. Prose rhythm supports atmosphere but does not vary under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images anchor tone. Information density is adequate. Minor issues: "The argument with her brother had left her raw, but it had also clarified something" is tell-summary where scene would sharpen. "Uncommonly serene" is a label without embodied proof. Stock metaphor "coiled around truth like ivy, choking it or letting it breathe" mixes vehicle (ivy chokes by tightening, not by breathing choice). Filter verbs ("seemed to move") in the candle beat slightly dull immediacy. No major loops or artifacts, but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Premise—calligrapher stages subversive puppet shows to explore ethical storytelling in a decommissioned radar dome—is specific and non-obvious. The dome's history (listening for enemies) mirrors her listening work, a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (from argument to serene declaration) is familiar and the closure postpones stakes rather than reweighting them. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a linear meditation without cost. Transformation test: plot unchanged with different names and locale.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her choice to come to the dome frames the story. However, her on-page actions are ritual (lighting candle, tracing symbols, speaking) without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The argument with her brother is summarized; no key turn traces to her agency. Present in setup, middle, and closure but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story stick is signaled early ("years ago," "talisman"), handled in two beats (tracing carvings, bird symbol animation), and present in the closure paragraph. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it serves as atmosphere and metaphor. Lyric reprise (early seed → final return) without causal pressure caps score around mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" appears once as theme claim ("woven from half-lit epiphanies") without shaping stakes or tactics on the page. No on-page moment where partial insight changes options or constrains choice. Echoed as label but not developed through action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is declared once ("uncommonly serene despite the weight of her task") without demonstrating a tradeoff or enabling an action. No on-page cost tied to this trait. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reverse" is signaled early ("She had come to reverse something") and thematized (unraveling stories, questioning narratives). Present in setup and closure ("not to build narratives, but to question them"). However, no major turn traces causally to reversing; the concept frames theme but does not redefine options. Functional but swappable with "transform" or "deconstruct."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are mentioned in setup ("staged subversive puppet shows," fisherman parable). Signaled but not shown; mechanics do not constrain on-page action. Summary-only use caps score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Decommissioned radar dome is signaled immediately, provides vivid acoustics and atmosphere, and its history (listening for enemies) mirrors Liora's work at closure. Present in setup, middle (acoustics amplify her breath and voice), and ending (the dome "would listen to her"). Does not pressure a tactical choice but charges the final image with thematic resonance. Two gates plus closure linkage and irreplaceability push score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Hush left behind by a heated argument" is signaled ("just days before," "the argument with her brother") and frames the opening atmosphere. Present in setup and referenced at closure paragraph. However, no live clock tightens decisions; the argument is summarized, not dramatized, and no urgency alters tactics. Functional background but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is stated early ("Her motivation was simple") and reiterated at closure ("If stories were weapons, then she wanted to wield them with care"). Present in setup and ending. However, desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page friction between want and cost. Declared but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in the opening ("meteor hush of distant waves") and is sustained through "stillness," "the dome's acoustics made even her breath sound like a whisper from the heavens," and the guttering candle at closure. Tone is coherent and modulates with the ritual. However, no escalation or pressure break; mood remains static. Lyric reprise without cost caps score at mid-6s.</comment>
