<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is concrete and embodied ("the silence was a living thing, coiled around her ribs"), and her grief over her brother drives the journey to the lagoon. The feather choice and her decision to wade in show micro-choices under pressure. However, the epiphany about "harmonizing discord" arrives more as contemplative realization than as a hard-won choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she arrives at insight without meaningful renunciation or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through image (feather, woven dawns, the water) and deepens from grief-tending to hope-recovery. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira begins writing, reweighting her grief into creative possibility, and the final image ("even broken things could sing") charges prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt (she accepts incompleteness) but remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible price that alters tactics. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lagoon after rain is vividly rendered ("cobalt lagoon lay still after the rain, its surface a sheet of hammered metal") and anchors Mira's emotional journey. The feather, the water at her ankles, and the woven dawns in the reeds all constrain her perception and charge the final image when she begins writing. The setting is filtered through her poet's eye and guides her choice to wade in and later to write. Micro-setting (body, feather, water) functions effectively to deepen stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: tending to grief and discovering a way forward. The piece tightens once when Mira sees the woven dawns and decides to write—this moment reweights her stance from passive observation to active creation. The kite string snap complicates but does not resolve. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is meaningful but the cost remains conceptual (accepting incompleteness) rather than a visible on-page price that forecloses a path. No reversal or hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the feather, the lagoon, and the woven dawns: beauty lives in the incomplete and broken. The final image ("even broken things could sing") reweights prior material without moralizing, and the insight is earned through Mira's journey rather than asserted. The piece resists tidy closure—"The poem would never be finished—none of them ever were"—and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Slight over-articulation in places ("she'd forgotten how to see the light spilling through them") but the particulars hold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited, with Mira's perceptual signature clear ("the silence was a living thing," "shattered stained glass"). Diction is poetic and controlled, matching her vocation. However, figurative density is high throughout, and some constructions drift into elevated literary register that risks overtaking the character's urgency ("the burnished hush of the lagoon wrapped around her like a second skin" in a moment of creative breakthrough feels more authorial than felt). No dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative freight ("hammered metal," "lace," "shattered stained glass," "living thing," "woven dawns," "bubbles from the lagoon's depths"), creating a rich but sluggish texture that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "She had spent years chasing beauty in the unfinished" is restated as "beauty didn't need perfection" and again as "Beauty lived in the incomplete." Template cadence: "She wrote of... She wrote of... And when..." Stack of filter constructions in reflective passages. The density prevents propulsion in peak beats (the moment she begins writing). Apply −0.6 for overwriting and loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—grief-tending poet at a lagoon discovering beauty in incompleteness—is familiar literary territory and closely aligns with introspective-epiphany templates common in lyric shorts. The feather and woven dawns are fresh images, but the emotional arc (sorrow → insight → hope) follows a well-worn path. The final insight ("even broken things could sing") feels earned but not surprising. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the template through unexpected conflict or cost. No bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (quiet shoreline poet) is present throughout, and her choices—kneeling, lifting the feather, wading in, beginning to write—shape the arc. Her vocation primes her perception and the closure turn. However, "quiet shoreline poet" as a label does most of the work; her professional particulars (verse-making, published identity) do not constrain a key choice on the page. The writing act at the end is the payoff, but her poet identity is more thematic lens than causal engine. Setup clear; development minimal; payoff present. Two gates met; lyric reprise lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears early, Mira lifts it and tucks it in her belt, and it returns as "a quill in her hand" at closure—three beats. The feather seeds the beauty-in-incompleteness theme ("incomplete, missing the downy fluff") and charges the final image when it transforms into the writing instrument. Setup, development (she carries it), and payoff (becomes quill) are all present. However, the mid-section handling is minimal (it's mentioned but not used), and the quill transformation feels symbolic rather than causal. Swappability is moderate—another incomplete object could serve. Strong setup and payoff; weaker middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appears once in the middle ("threads of pink and gold tangled in the reeds") and is echoed thematically at closure ("The poem would never be finished... Beauty lived in the incomplete"). It does not shape a choice or tactic; Mira observes it, and it reinforces her theme but does not alter her options or impose cost. No setup (not present in first third), weak development (one image), thematic echo at closure. Ornamental use. Missing setup gate caps at 4.6; apply −0.4 for ornamental/swappable use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" modifies the water's patience ("lapped at her ankles with warmly attentive patience") once in the middle third. It colors tone but does not constrain or enable an action with cost—Mira wades regardless. Label-only use, no causal work, no payoff at closure. Missing setup and closure gates; present only in one beat. Cap at 3.4 (no middle development when action is not altered); apply −0.3 for ornamental descriptor, but the element is present in a functional beat (wading), so raise slightly to 3.8 within tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tend" frames Mira's journey from the start ("She had come to the lagoon to tend to her grief") and recurs at closure ("She had come to the shore to tend to her grief, but she was leaving with something far greater"). The action structures the arc: tending becomes the lens through which she approaches the lagoon, examines the feather, and ultimately writes. Setup, development (implicit throughout as she observes and reflects), and payoff (reframed at closure) are all present. The verb is specific enough that swapping it (e.g., "heal," "process") would weaken thematic coherence. Strong integration across beats; causal and thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is explicitly named mid-story ("Perhaps, she thought, healing wasn't about mending what was broken, but harmonizing discord") and implicitly realized at closure when she begins writing and the grief becomes creative material. The method is signaled and shapes her stance shift, but its mechanics are abstract—we see the result (writing) but not the tactical how on the page. Setup in reflection, payoff at closure; no middle beat where harmonizing alters a concrete choice. Two gates met; lyric reprise present. The method feels more thematic than procedural, limiting causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout: Mira kneels at its edge, the feather washes ashore, she wades into the shallows, and the water "laps at her ankles with warmly attentive patience." The lagoon supplies the feather, the woven dawns, and the setting for her transformation. Setup, development (the wading choice, the reeds), and payoff (writing beside the water) are all present. The post-rain stillness primes tone and her reflective state. Micro-setting (water, sand, reeds) constrains perception and charges the final image. Strong integration; the lagoon is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"As a kite string snaps" occurs once in the middle third as an auditory event ("A kite string snapped somewhere above the cliffs, the sound sharp as a bone breaking"). Mira flinches, it feels "like a wound reopening, but also like an invitation," and she then wades in. The snap complicates her emotional state but does not tighten a decision clock or alter tactics—she would likely wade regardless. No setup, weak development (one beat), no closure payoff. The timeframe is more atmospheric trigger than pressure device. Missing setup and closure gates; ornamental use. Cap at 3.4; raise slightly for beat involvement to 3.1 within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to discover beauty in the incomplete" is dramatized early (lifting the feather, "the way it gleamed made her pulse quicken") and drives her choices: she wades in, examines the woven dawns, and begins writing. The motivation is coherent and tested—her grief could overwhelm, but she chooses engagement. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. However, the friction between her want (discovery) and cost (accepting incompleteness, living with grief) is more conceptual than visceral; no on-page moment where pursuit costs her something immediate. Strong thematic spine; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is named in the opening ("the air hummed with the kind of burnished hush that made her chest ache") and modulates through the piece: the silence is "a living thing," the kite snap breaks it, and the final paragraph returns to it ("the burnished hush of the lagoon wrapped around her like a second skin"). Tone is coherent, supports the accumulative design, and charges the final image. Setup, development (modulates with pressure: ache → flinch → embrace), and payoff are all present. The tone shapes perception and primes closure. Strong integration; the phrase is specific enough to be irreplaceable.</comment>
