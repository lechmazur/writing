<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior voice carries specificity—"virtuously mischievous," the pressure metaphor—but key choices feel underdetermined. The decision to turn the bolt counterclockwise and reject the swap arrives without embodied tension between competing desires; we see the choice but not the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final pivot to teaching feels tacked on, a thematic hedge rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (farm, volunteer, bolt by line three). The porthole turn provides a reversal, and Elias's choice to collapse the void rather than step through gestures toward Earned Stasis. However, the cost remains abstract—"something had shifted" tells rather than shows the forfeited path—and the ending pivot to pyramid-scheme education reads as summary rather than on-page consequence. Lens is Causal-leaning Hybrid; closure RR is present but cost legibility is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm delivers vivid, purpose-driven detail (mycelium mats, ozone, spiraling growth) that charges atmosphere and supports the "concepts become physical" frame. The submarine porthole embedded in the tunnel wall serves as a micro-setting constraint that focuses the climax. Spatial choreography remains clean through the descent and return, and the sensory hierarchy (blue light, damp earth, warmth of the bolt) reflects Elias's urgency without catalog padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape from regret via the quantum swap—is signaled early and tightens at the porthole. Turning the bolt counterclockwise forecloses the easier path, but the price (keeping his broken history) is told in summary rather than felt in the beat. The pivot to teaching workers arrives off-page, undercutting agency at closure. One meaningful tightening is present; cost clarity is the limiting factor for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pressure/diamond conceit integrates well—carbon squeezed by time, regret forming gems—and the porthole moment offers a non-literal answer to whether Elias will trade his brokenness for an easier life. However, the final paragraph moralizes the choice ("teach the other workers how to spot a pyramid scheme") rather than trusting image and implication. The warm diamond in his pocket gestures toward resonance, but the thematic answer is over-articulated, lowering subtextual charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: "virtuously mischievous," the bolt's hum, Mara's riddles processed as maps. Focalization remains stable, and psychic distance tightens effectively during the porthole sequence. The text messages' jagged pixels and the void's "colors that shouldn't exist" feel voice-matched. Minor filter-verb stacks in the opening ("come," "found," "had always been") dull immediacy slightly, but the rhythm modulates well under pressure and diction stays in register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the porthole sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "pressure isn't just force. It's potential" echoes Mara's earlier diamond metaphor without adding new pressure, and "the bolt in his pocket grew cold" / "the bolt now just a bolt" / "the diamond in his pocket was warm" form a repetitive symbolic triplet. The opening's passive constructions ("had come," "had swallowed") dilute propulsion. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The quantum-porthole premise and the "concepts become physical" frame offer a fresh angle on regret and parallel lives. The bioluminescent farm as grounding for metaphysical stakes is specific and non-obvious. However, the text-message mechanic and the parallel-self swap echo familiar SF tropes without strong transformation; the ending pivot to pyramid-scheme education feels like a prompt echo rather than an inevitable synthesis. The pressure-to-diamonds conceit is vivid but borders on symbolic convenience, introduced late and harvested at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening and frames Elias's escape motive. The choice to teach others at the end ties back to the scheme, offering causal closure. However, the trait is mostly told in backstory; on-page decisions (turning the bolt, collapsing the porthole) are not visibly shaped by his survivor status in the moment. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bolt appears in beat one (wedged in mycelium), is touched and examined, fits the porthole frame, and is turned twice (clockwise to unfold, counterclockwise to collapse). Its warmth/coldness registers Elias's stake shifts. The object drives two key beats and charges the ending when it becomes "just a bolt," reweighting the quantum promise. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; specificity (rusted threads, vibration) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The text message declares "A quantum promise" explicitly, and the porthole offers a swap between parallel selves. However, the concept remains largely metaphorical—Elias never tests what "quantum" means mechanically, and the stakes (trade places or not) could function as a straightforward magic portal. The concept is present in setup and closure but does not constrain tactics or enable new options mid-scene. Functional but somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Label-only. "Virtuously mischievous—enough to know when a system was rigged, but never quite bold enough to burn it down" is told in exposition. No on-page action demonstrates the trait under pressure; Elias's choice to reject the swap and later teach others could align, but the connection is retrospective summary, not dramatized tradeoff. Introduced early but never constrains a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Volunteering brings Elias to the farm, frames his escape motive, and sets the stage for the porthole discovery. The ending pivot—volunteering to teach workers—reprises the action with reweighted meaning. However, the middle beats (finding the bolt, opening the porthole) do not hinge on the volunteer role; another framing (hired worker, visitor) would serve as well. Early setup and thematic payoff earn mid-band; causal necessity is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Text messages appear in two beats (3:17 AM, coordinates) and deliver the porthole location, shaping Elias's path. The "glitchy" pixels and parallel-dimension framing are mentioned but never tested—no signal breakdown, no cross-dimensional static, no second message from another self that complicates choice. The method is functional and present at setup/middle but does not constrain the climax or charge the closure; the porthole does the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm provides vivid sensory anchoring (blue glow, mycelium mats, ozone, spiraling tunnels) and houses the embedded porthole. Mara's diamond metaphor ties farm cultivation to pressure/transformation, charging theme. The setting constrains Elias's discovery (he must descend into old tunnels) and the damp, underground atmosphere supports "shadowseam wonder" tone. Strong setup and middle presence; the ending's return to surface signals closure but does not add new constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When concepts become physical" frames the world but does not function as a timeframe in the plot—no ticking clock, no urgency tied to a temporal window. The narrative unfolds across days (first bolt discovery, later text messages, descent), but duration is vague and never tightens decisions. Mara's "carbon squeezed by time" is thematic metaphor, not a dramatized constraint. Present as conceptual backdrop; absent as tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The diamond Elias receives from his parallel self literalizes the motivation. Pressure-into-diamonds is introduced via Mara's metaphor, tested at the porthole (the void forms diamonds from "what ifs"), and reprised at the end (warm diamond in pocket). However, Elias never articulates a desire to make diamonds before the porthole; the motivation is inferred retroactively. Setup is mid-late (~30%), payoff is clear, but friction between want and cost is told in summary rather than dramatized in beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone—eerie blue light, ozone, swirling impossible colors, "quiet vibration that whispered of other worlds"—is coherent and atmospheric. It modulates effectively at the porthole (wonder intensifies) and softens at closure (mushrooms "glowing softly in the dark"). However, "shadowseam" as a descriptor never appears on the page, and the wonder is more conceptual than embodied; Elias's reactions are muted, lacking the visceral charge that would elevate tone into felt pressure. Consistent but not transformative.</comment>
