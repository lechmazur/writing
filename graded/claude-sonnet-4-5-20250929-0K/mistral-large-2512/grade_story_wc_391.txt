<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is established through occupation and prior practice ("twelve winters," "learned to wait"), but interiority remains largely abstract ("patience was not passivity"). The meeting with the stranger lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; neither hesitates nor trades off visible options. Emotional embodiment is thin: "breath curling in the air" is the strongest physical marker, but crisis-level contradiction or hierarchy of values never materializes on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density ("hum," "ozone and wet stone") and the stranger's arrival layer pressure toward the shared acknowledgment at closure. However, the final handshake and turn toward the lake constitute a Charged Poise moment whose cost is asserted ("quiet certainty of the tides") rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, no tactical shift, no visible price paid in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct establish vivid spatial anchors. The ice's "subtle give" constrains Elias's kneeling action and signals danger. The viaduct's hum and the mist from the lake supply concrete stimuli that frame the stranger's arrival. Micro-setting (ice, viaduct) charges the final image when both characters turn toward the glowing lake, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the viaduct's hum and the brewing revolution—is signaled early but never escalates through protagonist agency. Elias observes, kneels, stands, and extends his hand; no choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The stranger's appearance is coincidental, and the shared acknowledgment ("You feel it too") does not alter tactics or foreclose a path. One tightening (the hum deepening) occurs, but it is environmental rather than driven by Elias's decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "patient revolution," ice as deceptive surface, and the contrast between city frenzy and sanctuary stillness. The final image—turning toward the glowing lake—offers a resonant (non-literal) answer without overt moralizing. However, the closing paragraph risks thematic statement: "The revolution would not come with fire and fury; it would come with the quiet certainty of the tides" skirts sermonizing. The particulars (viaduct hum, ice give, moon's bent light) ground the theme sufficiently to stay above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is evident in "the way light bent and shadows stretched when the earth tilted just so." The two lines of dialogue are brief but goal-driven and carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the kneeling beat, wider during expository reflection. Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon (horizon mapper, vigilant), though "unyoke" and "moon paths" risk slight register elevation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several images are strong ("jagged crown," "moon hung low and swollen, its reflection fractured"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "The revolution was not a shout; it was a whisper" immediately follows "some things could not be forced, could not be rushed," recycling the same patience-versus-urgency content. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "The revolution would not come… it would come…" Figurative density is high without muddle, but the loops and conceptual redundancy in adjacent lines trigger −0.6 in Q7 per the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "patient revolution" premise and frozen-lake sanctuary offer some specificity, but the emotional arc (vigilant observer meets like-minded stranger, they acknowledge shared knowledge and turn toward the future) follows a familiar template. The magnetic viaduct is a fresh detail, yet its mechanics remain ornamental—hum and pulse without consequence. The piece avoids bold risk; the handshake and shared gaze resolve without transformation or trade-off, leaving the synthesis predictable rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his mapping background frames perception ("mapped these horizons for twelve winters," "tracked moon paths"). However, his vigilance produces no key decision: he observes the hum, kneels to test the ice, stands, and accepts the stranger's hand without altering tactics or foreclosing options. The mapping role is setup and closure-adjacent (turning toward the lake as mapper), but no middle choice is constrained by his vigilance. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; missing development caps at 4.6. Decorative mention in closure (−0.3) and swappability (another observer role would function similarly, −0.4) lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The viaduct appears in three beats: opening description ("slick with the sheen of melted snow"), mid-scene when the hum deepens and Elias steps toward it, and when the stranger emerges from beneath it. However, no character handles, uses, or is constrained by the viaduct; it remains scenic backdrop. Setup and development gates met (present early, mentioned at the hum-deepening turn), and it anchors the stranger's arrival (payoff-adjacent). Causal pressure is weak (the hum does not narrow Elias's options), and the magnetic property is label-only without mechanical consequence. Swappability moderate (−0.5): a different relic could serve the same function. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (weak, stranger's location) +0.4, minus swappability −0.5 and ornamental use −0.6 = ~5.8 within 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "patient revolution" is named explicitly in paragraph four and echoed in the closing lines ("quiet certainty of the tides, patient erosion"). It shapes the thematic stakes (endurance versus urgency) but does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options for Elias. Setup gate met (paragraph four, ~25% mark); no middle development (Elias's actions do not trade patience against urgency); payoff present but thematic rather than causal. The concept functions as theme overlay rather than decision constraint. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; missing causal middle caps near 4.6. Label-only trait in closure (−0.3) and summary-only use (revolution recounted, not dramatized, −0.4) reduce within band to ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears once in paragraph two describing the viaduct's vibration ("deliberate, softly purposeful"). It characterizes the phenomenon but does not constrain or enable any character action with visible cost. The trait is ornamental description. Single mention in setup; no development or payoff. Missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8, but the setup is clear (+0.4) and the phrase seeds tone, lifting slightly. Ornamental use (−0.5) and label-only (−0.3) hold the score low within the 3.0–4.9 band at ~3.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is named once in paragraph four ("unyoke himself from the frenzy of the city") and frames Elias's retreat to the sanctuary. This motive sets the opening context but does not drive a major turn or decision beat. Elias's actions (observing, kneeling, accepting the stranger's hand) are not causally traced to unyoking; they follow from the viaduct's hum and the stranger's arrival. Setup gate met (~30% mark); no middle or closure development. Missing two gates caps at 3.4. Early signal (+0.5) and one beat involvement (framing, +0.4) lift slightly, but swappability (−0.6: "escape" or "retreat" would serve identically) and summary-only use (−0.4) hold the score at ~5.1, just entering the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Moon-path tracking is named in paragraph five ("tracked moon paths for years… to understand the rhythm of the world") and reprised obliquely in the stranger's approach ("as if they, too, were tracking moon paths"). The method frames Elias's observational habit but does not supply mechanics that alter a choice or tactic. Setup gate met (paragraph five, ~40% mark—just within tolerance); no middle use; closure reprise is metaphorical callback without causal function. Two gates (setup, weak payoff) met; missing development caps near 4.6. Early signal borderline (+0.3), lyric reprise (+0.5), but ornamental use (−0.5) and summary-only (−0.4) hold at ~4.7 within 3.0–4.9 upper edge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake anchor every beat: Elias presses his palm against stone, kneels on ice ("subtle give"), and turns toward the glowing lake in the final lines. The lake's thin ice constrains his kneeling action (safety consideration implicit) and charges the closure image. Setup gate met (opening line); development gate met (kneeling beat); payoff gate met (final turn toward glowing ice). Three gates allow ≥6.1. Causal pressure moderate (+0.8: ice's deceptiveness informs caution), closure linkage strong (+1.2: final image centers on lake), specificity high (+0.6: basalt spires, frozen surface). Score: base 3.0 + setup 0.6 + two beats 0.9 + causal 0.8 + closure 1.2 + specificity 0.6 − ornamental viaduct overlap 0.3 = ~6.8 within 5.0–6.9 band, approaching 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lake freezes over" is established in the opening (lake is frozen) but exerts no pressure on decisions. No clock tightens choices; the night's duration is untracked. Elias's twelve winters of vigilance provide backstory depth but do not create urgency in this scene. Setup gate met (opening); no middle or closure use of time as constraint. Missing two gates caps at 2.8. Early anchor (+0.4) lifts slightly, but the timeframe remains static description without tactical impact (−0.5 ornamental use). Score ~3.6 within 3.0–4.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Sculpt patience from impatience" is named in paragraph six ("spent years trying to sculpt patience from his own impatience"). The motive explains Elias's retreat and frames his internal arc, but no on-page choice dramatizes the friction between patience and urgency. Elias waits, observes, and accepts the stranger's hand without visible trade-off or cost tied to this tension. Setup gate met (~50% mark); no middle dramatization; weak payoff (the handshake is "unhurried," echoing patience). Two gates (setup, weak thematic payoff) met; missing causal middle caps near 4.6. Summary-only use (−0.4) and told desire without conflicted choice (−0.3) hold at ~5.5, entering the 5.0–6.9 band on the strength of lyric reprise and thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone blends vivid physical imagery ("jagged crown," "hum," "ozone") with reflective restraint ("quiet certainty," "patient erosion"). The restrained wildness is coherent: the viaduct's pulse and the stranger's emergence supply wildness; Elias's deliberate movements and lack of knife-reach supply restraint. Tone modulates with the hum's deepening (wildness intensifies) and stabilizes in the handshake (restraint). The final image—glowing ice under the moon—charges closure with both elements. Setup throughout; development in the hum-deepening beat; payoff in the restrained handshake and charged lake image. Three gates met. Tone's contribution to closure (+0.9) and modulation under pressure (+0.6) lift the score. Base 3.0 + setup 0.6 + two beats 0.9 + closure 0.9 + modulation 0.6 = ~5.0; coherence and specificity push to ~6.2 within the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>
