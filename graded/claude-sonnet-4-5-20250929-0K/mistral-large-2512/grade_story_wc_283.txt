<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—spinning a prophecy into raw possibility—is established through concrete actions (turning the hourglass, cataloging buttons), and her refusal to gasp or smile at the reversal shows earned restraint. However, her interior life remains thin; the seven-year tenure and the moment she "first unscrewed the lid" are told rather than dramatized, and no contradictory impulses complicate her steady patience. The final choice to turn the hourglass over again forecloses wonder in favor of continuation, a credible stance, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when promptly (amber warehouse, Mira, seven years of turning). Causality is loose but coherent under the accumulative lens: cataloging buttons → finding the last button → sand reversal → Mira's deliberate re-turn. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses continuation over fulfillment, and the canyon echo's "single, soft note" charges the final image with shared wisdom. Cost is legible—she relinquishes the prophecy's promised transformation—but the price feels more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vividly rendered (wooden beams groaning, single window casting amber light) and the highest shelf, workbench, and hourglass corner provide clear spatial anchors. The canyon echo jar on the highest shelf recurs meaningfully and the warehouse's "underside of the cliffs" location evokes secrecy and weight. The buttons' tactile variety (brass crown, mother-of-pearl chip, dull plastic) and the warehouse's amber glow charge the final reversal, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy through button cataloging—is signaled early and drives the middle. Pressure tightens as the catalog nears completion, and the discovery of the last silver button triggers the sand reversal. However, the escalation is gradual accumulation rather than a sharp turn, and Mira's agency at closure (turning the hourglass over again) is a renunciation that forecloses wonder with visible cost. The lack of a secondary complication or visible tactical trade-off keeps the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—prophecies as raw material for transformation rather than destiny—emerges organically from Mira's cataloging and the final re-turn. The canyon echo's "shared wisdom, passed from one keeper to the next" and the closing realization that "prophecies weren't meant to be fulfilled" offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The hourglass and buttons recur with reweighted meaning, and the amber light charges the final image. Minor thematic echo in "spun into something new" risks over-articulation but does not fully sermonize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric texture ("groaning under the weight of forgotten things," "wisdom that didn't demand to be heard"). Perceptual signature is controlled: Mira notices tactile detail (brass crown, mother-of-pearl chip) and the warehouse's amber glow. However, some phrases lean ornamental ("secret," "dissolved into the wind") and the phrase "shared wisdom" appears twice in close proximity, risking template repetition. Distance is consistent but the voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register without stress justification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She didn't believe in prophecies, not really, but she believed in the weight of things" followed closely by "buttons, echoes, the slow unraveling of time" recycles the concept. "The truth, perhaps. Or maybe just the shape of it" is a hedged scaffold. Filter-verb reliance is moderate ("she had learned to listen," "she realized") but not clustered enough to trigger heavy penalty. Stock metaphor "sharp as a blade" and "riot of colors" lower density slightly. Information density is generally strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of warehouse keeper, prophecy, and button cataloging is specific and the final image—sand flowing upward then deliberately re-turned—offers a fresh inflection on prophecy fulfillment. The canyon echo jar and the amber light are particular to this voice and setting. However, the prophecy-on-a-scrap and hourglass reversal are familiar tropes, and the emotional arc (patient keeper chooses continuation over transformation) is executed well but not radically reconceived. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise without retreat, earning solid mid-7s for ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her final choice—turning the hourglass over again—alters tactics (continuation over fulfillment). However, the seven-year tenure and most cataloging work are summarized rather than dramatized in key turns, and her agency is most visible only at closure. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar appears early (highest shelf, amber glow), hums in the middle to guide Mira's sorting, and emits a "single, soft note" at closure, reweighting "shared wisdom." Three touches across beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. However, the jar is never physically handled on the page—Mira listens and observes but does not unseal or move it after the initial mention—reducing tactile integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shared wisdom appears in the canyon echo's voice description ("wisdom that didn't demand to be heard, only to be passed on") and the final note "shared wisdom, passed from one keeper to the next." The concept frames the ending's stance but does not constrain middle choices or tactics; it functions more as thematic accent than plot driver. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is present in "she had learned to listen for it, to let its quiet inspiration guide her fingers as she sorted." The trait enables the cataloging action but is label-only; no on-page moment shows inspiration creating a tradeoff or visible cost. It does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image specifically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unscrambling is the dominant action: Mira catalogs buttons "not because she had to, but because the act of sorting them…felt like unscrambling something larger." The act drives the middle and the discovery of the last button triggers the reversal. However, the unscrambling is more process than decisive turn; the verb could be swapped for "cataloging" or "sorting" with minor edits. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is signaled early ("Mira had been cataloging them for months"), shown in action (brass crown, mother-of-pearl, dull plastic disc sorted by size/material/wear), and its mechanics matter: the act reveals patterns and unscrambles truth. The discovery of the last button triggers the sand reversal. All three gates are met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The method is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is anchored early, provides spatial detail (highest shelf, workbench, hourglass corner, single window), and the amber light charges the final image. The setting's "underside of the cliffs" secrecy and the warehouse's forgotten-things weight support atmosphere and slightly pressure the choice to continue. All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate but the amber glow distinctly charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears once in the penultimate section ("One evening, as the truth unraveled around her like a spool of thread") and frames the discovery moment. However, the timeframe is vague—seven years are mentioned but the cataloging duration and the evening's progression are not tracked as live pressure. Setup is weak (appears late), development is absent, payoff is present via the evening's realization. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Spinning the prophecy into raw possibility is stated explicitly ("She had come to the warehouse to spin the prophecy into raw possibility") and dramatized at closure when Mira re-turns the hourglass, choosing transformation of the prophecy over fulfillment. The motivation drives the final choice but is told rather than shown in the middle; no on-page friction between want and cost appears until the ending. Setup and payoff are met; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unearthed silence is signaled late ("in the unearthed silence of the amber warehouse") but the tone—quiet, lyric, patient—is consistent throughout and modulates slightly at closure when the echo emits its note and silence returns charged with understanding. The tone supports the accumulative lens and the final image's stillness. Strong payoff and coherence across turns, but late explicit mention reduces setup credit.</comment>
