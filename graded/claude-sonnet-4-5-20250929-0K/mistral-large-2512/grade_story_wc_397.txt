<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior state is established—"skin felt thinner, thoughts slower"—and the lace parasol tip functions as a concrete anchor. His shift from tourist to volunteer shows movement, though the transformation feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The dying man's moment is embodied and specific, but Elias's own emotional arc lacks sufficient internal friction; his acceptance of the helper role arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from tourist detachment to engaged witness through density build and the parasol's charged return. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias takes the clipboard, accepting the role with the final image reweighting prior material—salt, thawing ice, and the shift from tourist to participant. Cost is felt (he stays, forfeiting his original intent) though somewhat muted. One meaningful deepening is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vivid and particular: "skeletal thing, built on stilts," "groaning floes," sensory hierarchy filters through Elias's muted perception. The lace parasol tip (micro-setting as recurring object) charges the closure—tucked into coat lining, it marks his transition. The marina's sensory specifics (damp wool, antiseptic, salt, thawing ice) layer through action and constrain the final choice: he remains in this unstable, liminal space. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning the sound of endings, signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the parasol exchange and the man's death, but escalation is gentle rather than sharp; the tightening comes in Elias's acceptance of the clipboard, which narrows options (he stays rather than leaves). The resolution is more renunciation than decision, fitting the lens, though the cost could be more visceral. One meaningful deepening is present; no explicit antagonist is required here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—mortality as service, the shift from spectator to participant—emerges through image and action: the parasol as inheritance, the breath "like pebbles dragged across a frozen shore," the final windborne solace. The lace tip's double use (heirloom and gift) reweights its meaning without stating a moral. "Windborne solace" in the final lines charges the ending without summary. The piece resists tidy closure while offering a resonant answer to Elias's search, rooted in the particulars of breath, ice, and the clipboard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "gripped reality loosely," "time itself had folded into a pocket of patience." Elias's way of noticing (thin skin, slowed thought, the parasol's warmth) is selective and consistent. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: "You're one of them, aren't you?" lands without explanation. The woman's sparse lines feel natural. Diction remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is intentional and serves the muted emotional register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in key beats: the man's breath as "wet rattle…pebbles dragged across a frozen shore" does double duty (sound and image). Minor scaffold: "He realized then that he had come here to learn…but what he had found instead" is slightly expository where the image could carry alone. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph integrates salt, ice, and the clipboard without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination—euthanasia tourism, disaster relief, and the heirloom parasol—feels specific rather than template-driven. The emotional core (spectator to participant) is familiar but executed with grounded detail: the marina's groaning ice, the frostbitten volunteer, the parasol's charged double use. The turn is quiet and earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its muted register without hedging, and the synthesis of death tourism and relief work offers a non-obvious moral angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (euthanasia tourist) is present throughout and his perspective anchors the piece. His key choice—taking the clipboard and staying—occurs at closure. However, his "tourist" identity functions more as setup/context than as a trait that constrains middle choices; he observes the man's death but does not wrestle with competing wants tied specifically to being a tourist. Early signal is strong; closure linkage is present; middle development (a choice specifically shaped by tourist status) is weak. Two gates met; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lace parasol tip appears in three distinct beats: Elias carries it and runs his thumb over it (beat 1, opening third); he places it in the dying man's hand and the man recognizes it (beat 2, midpoint turn); it is "tucked into his coat lining" at closure (beat 3, final image). Early signal, middle causal involvement (enables connection with the dying man), and charged reprise at closure. The object's inherited nature and dual use (comfort for Elias, gift to the man) make it specific and hard to replace. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named in the opening paragraph ("time itself had folded into a pocket of patience he could carry like a coin") and colors the piece's mood—Elias's slowed perception, his willingness to sit and listen. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or create a visible tradeoff. It functions as thematic coloring rather than a stake-shaping force. Setup present; middle and closure participation weak. Swappable with "patience" or "acceptance" without major structural change. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is named early ("Elias gripped reality loosely now, as if the world might slip through his fingers if he held too tight") and informs his muted, detached perception throughout. It enables his capacity to sit with the dying man without panic. However, it does not visibly constrain a choice or create an on-page cost; no moment shows a tradeoff where loose grip helps or harms. Setup strong; middle cost-linkage weak; closure participation indirect. Functional perceptual filter but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Trawl" (through disaster relief aftermath) is named and executed: Elias signed up, walks to the tents, engages with victims. The action frames his encounter with the dying man and leads to the clipboard offer at closure. It shapes two beats (arrival at tents, final offer to stay) and provides the setting for the key turn. However, "volunteer" or "help sort wreckage" could substitute with minor edits; the specificity of "trawl" (marine salvage connotation) is not leveraged. Two gates met; causal but somewhat swappable. Mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Disaster relief volunteering" is signaled early (second paragraph: "signed up to trawl through the aftermath"), frames the middle encounter (tents, victims, the woman's guidance), and delivers the closure choice (clipboard, "if you're going to stay…you might as well help"). The method matters: it places Elias among the dying and creates the infrastructure for his shift. All three gates met. However, "aid work" or "relief effort" could replace it with minimal loss. Functional and present across beats but not uniquely irreplaceable. Solid integration, mid-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is introduced in the opening line, detailed throughout (stilts, groaning planks, thawing floes, tents, dock), and present in the final image (dock, scent of salt and thawing ice). It constrains movement (Elias walks to tents, sits on the dock) and charges the ending: the unstable, liminal setting mirrors his shift from tourist to participant. Sensory specifics (damp wool, antiseptic, wind) layer pressure. The marina is not easily swappable; its instability and cold are integral to tone and stakes. All three gates met with strong causal and atmospheric contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" is named in the opening line and frames Elias's altered state (thin skin, slow thoughts, loose grip). The timeframe is retrospective—change has already occurred—so it shapes perception rather than creating urgency or a live clock. It does not tighten a decision or escalate pressure mid-scene; no deadline or time-bound choice. Setup strong; middle pressure weak; closure participation indirect (the change enables his final acceptance but does not impose a cost). Functional framing but not a dynamic constraint. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated early (paragraph two: "he needed to hear the sound of endings approaching") and drives the middle beat: Elias goes to the tents specifically to listen, and the dying man's breath is rendered in vivid detail ("wet rattle…pebbles dragged across a frozen shore"). The motivation shifts at closure—he realizes "he had come here to learn the sound of his own ending, but what he had found instead was the sound of others'"—reweighting the initial want with a conceptual cost (his search redirected, his isolation broken). All three gates met; strong causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("there was a kind of windborne solace") and is prepared by recurring wind imagery (breath curling, wind carrying salt and thawing ice). The tone is muted, patient, and elegiac throughout, modulating subtly as Elias moves from detachment to engagement. The final image (clipboard, scent of salt and ice, no longer a tourist) charges the tone without naming it again. Setup and closure strong; middle modulation is present but gentle. The tone is coherent and integral, though not indispensable—"quiet solace" could substitute. Upper-mid band.</comment>
