<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to uncover truth is clear and she shows methodical persistence when working the rope. However, interiority remains largely declarative ("She had always dismissed them as myths") rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The final archival decision feels like a thematic statement rather than a choice with visible personal cost—we don't see what she forecloses by making the truth public.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late (~180 words to establish she's an archivist in the mechanism room). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she will archive the truth), but the cost remains abstract—"some absences were meant to be filled" tells rather than showing what path she forecloses. The causal lens mostly holds, but the vision sequence operates more as exposition than a dramatized turn that narrows her options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room supplies atmospheric texture (oil, parchment, gears humming), and the rope becomes a tactile anchor across multiple beats. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the room doesn't constrain her choices—she can work uninterrupted, and the door's vanishing at the end is convenient rather than a pressure that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is clear but the environment doesn't charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (translate confusion into clarity about House Vaelis) is signaled early. Liora encounters one meaningful reversal when she discovers obliteration instead of exile, but this arrives via vision rather than on-page agency that narrows options. The final choice to archive lacks visible cost—no tradeoff between secrecy and exposure is dramatized, and the door's vanishing removes consequence rather than imposing it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of archival truth versus institutional erasure emerges from the Vaelis material, and "fables of absence" recurs with shifting weight. However, the final insight—"some absences were meant to be filled"—is stated rather than earned through image or contradiction. The diplomat's seal and rope function more as plot devices than as particulars that build non-literal resonance at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a formal, measured voice ("warmly methodical care," "pulsed with quiet certainty") that suits an archivist. Psychic distance is consistent, and perceptual filters reflect her professional lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("translate confusion into clarity") and the voice doesn't modulate under the peak discovery—stress should compress syntax but rhythm stays steady throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence structures. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the rope resisted…but she persisted" restates effort without new detail; "the rope's braids tightened, then loosened, forming new patterns" cycles through synonyms. Template cadence runs in the vision sequence ("They were being erased…This wasn't exile. It was obliteration") use parallel negation without propulsion. Figurative language ("fables of absence," "echoes," "pulsed with light") recurs but remains abstract rather than image-specific. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The magical-object-in-hidden-room premise is familiar from discovery fantasies, and the core turn (institutional cover-up revealed via artifact) follows a well-worn template. "Fables of absence" and the braided rope offer some texture, but the emotional arc (archivist finds truth, decides to publish) lacks a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The door appearing and vanishing reads as narrative convenience rather than a fresh synthesis with causal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora appears early and makes the final archival decision, satisfying setup and payoff gates. She works the rope in the middle section (development gate met). However, her choices are reactive—she follows the brightest braid, watches the vision—rather than creating key turns through adaptable problem-solving. The final decision is declared ("She would archive the truth") without on-page cost or tactical adaptation. Causal pressure is moderate; swappable with a detective or scholar without major edits. Apply −0.5 for swappability and −0.4 for limited beat involvement beyond receptive observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seal is introduced early (setup gate met), glows when she works the rope (middle involvement, development gate met), and appears cold at closure (payoff gate met). It is handled in at least two beats. However, its function is largely atmospheric—it signals Vaelis lineage and glows to mark progress, but doesn't constrain her method or enable a choice under pressure. Swappable with any sigil or crest. Apply −0.5 for ornamental glow effect and −0.4 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Fables of absence" is named early (setup), Liora dismisses them as myths then sees proof in the vision (middle reweighting, development), and the concept underwrites her final stance (payoff). It shapes her interpretation but doesn't constrain tactics—she would still work the rope and archive findings with a different framing concept. The phrase recurs with thematic resonance but no mechanical cost. Apply −0.5 for lack of tactical constraint and −0.3 for theme-label use without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly methodical" appears once in exposition ("her fingers tracing the edges of history with warmly methodical care") and her deliberate rope-work echoes the trait. Setup gate barely met (late descriptor); development gate weak (implied in her patience); no payoff at closure. The trait is told rather than shown through a visible tradeoff—methodical care doesn't cost her speed or force an error. Apply −0.6 for label-only mention, −0.5 for no demonstrated cost, and cap at 3.8 for missing clear development and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Merge" is signaled early ("merge the past with the present"), enacted in the middle when she reconfigures the braids, and the merged map leads to the vision and final stance (all three gates met). The action drives the key vision beat and enables the archival decision. However, swappability is moderate—"untangle," "reweave," or "decode" would serve similar narrative function with minor edits. Apply −0.4 for swappability; raise +0.7 for causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope and braid-reconfiguring method are introduced early (setup), Liora works the braids for multiple beats ("untangling," "tracing patterns," "tightened, then loosened"), and the final pattern settles "with quiet certainty" at closure (all gates met). The mechanics matter—each strand represents an era, and the reconfiguration produces the vision-map. It is specific and not easily swappable; removing the rope would break the mechanism. Apply +0.9 for two-beat involvement, +0.7 for causal pressure, +0.5 for specificity, reaching upper-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mechanism room is named in the opening paragraph (setup), provides the rope and seal as resources (middle involvement), and the gears hum in response to her work before the door vanishes at closure (payoff). All three gates met. However, the setting is postcard-descriptive—"oil and old parchment," "gears above her shifting"—and doesn't constrain her actions; she works uninterrupted. The door's vanishing at the end removes consequence rather than imposing cost. Apply −0.5 for lack of tactical constraint; raise +0.4 for presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The door "shouldn't exist" frames the inciting condition (setup gate met) and vanishes at the end "as if it had never been" (payoff gate weak—cameo rather than active). No middle development: the impossibility doesn't tighten her decisions or create a ticking clock. Time is vague throughout (midnight chimes at the end but elapsed duration is unclear). The temporal anomaly is ornamental flavor rather than a pressure that alters tactics. Apply −0.7 for missing development gate, −0.5 for ornamental use, capping near 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Translate confusion into clarity" is stated early ("she was translating confusion into clarity, one thread at a time") and her archival choice enacts it at closure (setup and payoff met). Middle development is implied in her persistent rope-work. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no friction between truth-seeking and self-protection, institutional loyalty, or personal risk. The desire is coherent but lacks visible cost or competing impulse. Apply −0.5 for told-only motivation and −0.3 for lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" is sustained: measured voice ("warmly methodical," "pulsed with quiet certainty") handles layered history (House Vaelis, rope as archive, obliteration vs. exile) without confusion. Tone modulates slightly when the voice echoes from shadows, but emotional peaks (discovery of obliteration) don't compress syntax or rhythm. The final image ("some doors only appeared when you were ready") shifts into aphorism, a minor tonal pivot. Apply +0.5 for coherence across beats and +0.3 for closure modulation; minor −0.2 for static rhythm under stress.</comment>
