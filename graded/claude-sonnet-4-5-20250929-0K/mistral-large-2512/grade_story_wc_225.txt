<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's fidgeting is rendered concretely (ring-twisting, coat-plucking) and his internal guilt over Liora's death is embodied through the tapestry investigation. The final shift to stillness is motivated by the mirror-memory confrontation and Liora's voice granting permission to forgive. However, the pivotal choice—deciding to forgive himself—feels somewhat asserted rather than a micro-decision sequence with visible tradeoffs; the moment he "exhaled" closes the arc but the internal contradiction prior to that beat is underplayed. Backstory is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (tapestry threads) and primes the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (thread-decoding accumulates toward the mirror-memory confrontation; the final exhale is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis variant—where Elias forgives himself and ceases fidgeting, a visible cost of letting go). The orientation anchors (Elias, Harkensleep, seven years post-exile) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the black thread unravels the tapestry and opens the platinum mirror, narrowing options to confrontation. The closure's cost is felt (the labyrinth cools, fidgeting stops) and the lens holds. Minor slip: the mirror-memory sequence is slightly expository rather than fully dramatized choice-by-choice, but the reweighting at "You only get to forgive yourself" is on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Harkensleep is vividly rendered (cobblestones, frost, woven hush, silent villagers) and the platinum labyrinth is a tactile, recurring object that heats and cools in response to Elias's actions. The tapestry's frayed threads and the polished platinum mirror are micro-setting elements that constrain the protagonist's investigative path. Distant thunder functions as atmospheric pressure rather than a direct spatial constraint, but the setting's stillness charges the final exhale. Scope is appropriate for the length; no occupational detail is required and none is forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to forgive himself—is signaled early and braided with the platinum labyrinth investigation. One meaningful tightening: the black thread's discovery and the mirror-door confrontation force Elias into the memory where he must face his mistake. The resolution is earned by Liora's line ("You only get to forgive yourself") and Elias's resulting exhale/stillness, a renunciation of the endless guilt loop with on-page cost (labyrinth cools, fidgeting stops). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the mirror sequence leans passive—Elias observes more than he chooses—slightly reducing agency at the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—self-forgiveness and the impossibility of rewriting the past—emerges through the tapestry investigation, the platinum labyrinth's symbolic weight, and Liora's climactic line. The final image (Elias exhaling, the village exhaling with him, the thunder stilling) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: forgiveness is internal permission, not revision. The woven hush accumulates meaning from atmospheric detail to thematic metaphor for suppressed guilt. Minor slip: "You only get to forgive yourself" is a touch on-the-nose, close to a thematic echo, but it's dramatized through the mirror-memory rather than pure assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with controlled psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature (fidgeting, chess-tutor precision repurposed to thread-decoding, metaphor-rich observation) is distinct and voice-motivated. The prose modulates effectively: dense, figurative description in calm beats ("distant thunder rumbled, not a storm's fury but the lull of some celestial engine") compresses to direct action in the mirror sequence. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("he saw," "he reached out") appear but remain voice-consistent. One small slip: "the woven hush of the memory was thicker than the village's" is slightly over-written for peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, figurative language is mostly controlled, and sentence openings shift purposefully. However, several overwriting slips: "distant thunder rumbled, not a storm's fury but the lull of some celestial engine grinding beyond the horizon, a sound that made the air hum like a plucked harp string" stacks three metaphors in one opener; "the woven hush" recurs four times as a set phrase, bordering on loop; "the platinum labyrinth in his pocket" appears verbatim three times without variation. The closure beat is clean, but the density and minor paraphrase loops ("the tapestry whole, the threads reknitted") across the narrative trigger cumulative line-level debt. Apply −0.6 for pattern density and −0.3 for phrase loops = −0.9 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chess-tutor-in-exile premise is familiar, and the guilt-driven pilgrimage to a symbolic object/place is well-worn. The story transforms the template through specific details (platinum labyrinth, tapestry thread-decoding, the mirror-memory) and the "woven hush" metaphor, but the arc (investigate artifact → confront past → epiphany grants forgiveness) follows a recognizable structure. The ending's image (exhale, village exhales, thunder stills) is evocative but not entirely surprising. Freshness is mid-range: competent synthesis with moments of vivid particularity, yet the emotional and plot beats trend toward the expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (exiled chess tutor) is present throughout, his choices drive the thread investigation, the mirror entry, and the final acceptance of Liora's wisdom. His occupation (chess tutor) is invoked for thematic resonance (queen's sacrifice metaphor) but does not constrain on-page tactics. Setup early, involved in multiple beats (tapestry, mirror, closure), and his decision to stop fidgeting is the closure action. Swappability is moderate—another guilt-ridden professional could replace him with edits—but the chess metaphor ties to the mistake's specifics. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.6, moderate cost tie +0.4 = baseline 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, round to 6.2 for closure strength.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears in paragraph two (early signal +0.5), is handled/observed in three beats (theft mention, heats when touching tapestry, burns then cools in mirror sequence = three beats +1.4), its temperature shifts alter Elias's perception and charge the final image (closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9). Specificity: platinum material and pocket-sized scale matter to the intimacy metaphor (+0.5). Cost: the labyrinth "remembers his mistakes" and its cooling signals resolution (+0.4). No major swappability or late-arrival penalties. Baseline 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, minor ornamental first mention (theft context) −0.1 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is introduced early (paragraph three) as atmospheric description, recurs four times, and charges the final line ("the woven hush of Harkensleep exhaled with him"). Setup +0.5, closure linkage (reweighted in last line) +1.0, lyric reprise +0.5. However, mid-story it functions mainly as mood rather than constraining tactics or altering choices—no beat where the hush prevents or enables action. Swappability moderate (could be "silence" or "stillness" with minor tonal loss) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, but the closure reprise is strong and reweights the stake, lifting to 5.8 under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is embodied in paragraph two (ring-twisting, coat-plucking) and its cessation is the closure action ("for the first time in seven years, Elias Veyne did not fidget"). Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure (fidgeting as symptom, stillness as resolution) +1.0, specificity (ring/coat details) +0.4, cost connection (stopping = forgiving) +0.5. However, mid-story the fidgeting is described but does not enable or constrain a tactical choice; it is a character tag more than a lever. Baseline 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, swappability (could be another nervous habit) −0.5, label-only in middle beats −0.3 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears once in paragraph five ("He winnowed his memories like chaff from grain") as a metaphor for Elias's investigative process. It frames the thread-decoding (setup +0.4, one beat +0.4) and thematically connects to the resolution, but the action itself is not repeated or causally linked to a later turn. The metaphor is vivid but easily swappable with "sift," "sort," or "filter" without structural loss (−0.7). No direct closure linkage or middle beats where "winnowing" alters tactics. Baseline 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, thematic coherence +0.3, still replaceable, cap at 3.8 per swappability rule, but lyric contribution lifts slightly to 6.4 under generous reading—re-score: baseline 3.0 + 0.8 thematic = 3.8, swappability cap overrides, final 3.8. Correcting: one beat +0.4, thematic frame +0.5, swappability −0.7, no closure beat participation beyond metaphor. Final: 3.0 + 0.9 −0.7 = 3.2, round 3.2. Re-examining: the winnowing metaphor seeds the thread investigation (causal setup +0.6) and pays off when threads are decoded; two-gate model (setup + development implication) allows ~6.0 band, specificity of metaphor +0.4 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border—is introduced in paragraph five, executed across paragraphs six-eight (tracing threads to name/date/move, then the black thread), and its completion (unraveling the tapestry) opens the platinum mirror. Setup +0.6, three beats (introduce, decode, pull black thread) +1.4, causal pressure (method narrows path to mirror) +1.1, closure linkage (pulling the thread is the action that triggers the mirror-door) +1.3, specificity (frayed threads, border location, color coding) +0.6. No major swappability (the method is unique to this story) or late arrival. Baseline 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, minor summary of decoding rather than full dramatization −0.4 = 7.6, adjust for strong closure participation to 7.3 (conservative within band).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The time-frozen village (Harkensleep) is introduced in paragraph three, its traits (cobblestones, frost, silent villagers, no wind/dogs/children) are vividly detailed, and its "woven hush" mirrors Elias's internal state. Setup +0.7, atmosphere across multiple beats +0.9, closure linkage (village exhales with Elias in final line) +1.0, setting as metaphor constrains Elias's investigation (villagers "knew what he was doing" as passive pressure) +0.6. However, the village does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters tactics mid-story; it is primarily atmospheric. Swappability moderate (another quiet, symbolic village) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, strong closure reprise +0.5 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"during the lull of distant thunder"—is invoked in paragraph three and recurs twice ("the distant thunder swelled," "the distant thunder stilled"). It provides atmospheric continuity and its cessation in the final paragraph signals resolution. Setup +0.4, closure linkage (thunder stills as Elias forgives himself) +0.8, lyric reprise +0.4. However, the thunder does not create urgency, tighten decisions, or function as a live clock; it is symbolic weather rather than a tactical constraint. Swappability high (could be wind, storm, or other ambient sound) −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, round to 4.8 for closure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to forgive oneself for past mistakes—is introduced in paragraph five (Elias "winnowed his memories... sifting for the moment he might forgive himself") and dramatized through the thread investigation, the mirror-memory confrontation, and Liora's line. Setup +0.7, three beats (thread decoding, mirror entry, Liora's permission) +1.4, causal pressure (guilt drives every action) +1.3, closure linkage (forgiveness achieved via exhale/stillness) +1.5, cost (letting go of the guilt loop, labyrinth cools) +0.5. Friction: the forgiveness moment is slightly told ("You only get to forgive yourself") rather than a conflicted micro-choice sequence −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 5.4 −0.4 = 8.0, conservative adjustment for slight exposition at peak = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is not explicitly named but the tone—contemplative, figurative, compressed, yet charged with guilt and release—is coherent throughout. The prose's rhythm (long, layered sentences in reflection; shorter bursts in the mirror sequence) modulates with pressure. The final image (exhale, stillness) embodies repose; the mirror confrontation and Liora's voice supply fierceness. Setup (tone established early) +0.6, modulation across beats +0.8, closure charge (stillness after seven years) +1.2, coherence +0.7. However, "fierce" is understated—the confrontation leans passive observation more than active struggle. Baseline 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3.</comment>
