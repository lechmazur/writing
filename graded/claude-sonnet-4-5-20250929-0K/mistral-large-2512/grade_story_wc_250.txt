<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maris's interiority is anchored in embodied silence and purposeful action—she traces wood as braille, angles the mirror, places the stone—with a consistent perceptual signature. The child's entrance introduces relationship pressure that tests Maris's teaching stance, and the stone gift plus the mirror gesture carry micro-choices that alter the encounter's trajectory. The closure line "she would keep weaving, one silent pattern at a time" affirms endurance but lacks a visible cost on the page that forecloses a path; the renunciation or price remains implied rather than dramatized. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and the girl's responses feel age-appropriate, but the final beat's lack of felt consequence caps the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory layering (rain, light patterns, darkness swallowing the dock) and the encounter with the child deepens the demonstration of Maris's method. Orientation is clean (cobalt dock, dusk, Maris cross-legged) by the second paragraph. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maris reaffirms her practice after the girl leaves, but the cost is conceptual rather than legible on the page—no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered, no price paid in the final image. The causality is consistent and the lens holds, but the ending's lack of a sharp, on-page cost or reweighting caps the score at 7.2 per the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slicked planks, bruised sky, and canal lapping establish vivid sensory grounding anchored early. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-setting tools that constrain Maris's demonstration choices—she angles the mirror to show the girl's gap-toothed reflection, manipulates shutter-slats to fracture light—altering the encounter's tactics. The mica-flecked pebble charges the final exchange when its glow persists after darkness falls, and the canal's metronome sound subtly mirrors Maris's weaving rhythm. Sensory selection is filtered through Maris's silent, patient attention, and the environment evolves causally as daylight dims.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maris's ongoing commitment to teach through silence, tested by the child's challenge ("Mama says you're a witch"). The encounter tightens when the girl questions Maris's silence and her tools, forcing Maris to demonstrate rather than explain—she uses the mirror to show the gap, the shutters to reveal the dark, the pebble to embody starlight. The girl's shift from suspicion ("You're a witch") to understanding ("You're not a witch") marks a meaningful deepening that changes the child's knowledge and stance. However, the cost to Maris remains abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off imposed—so escalation reads as solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The line "to teach darkness the value of stars" emerges from the concrete particulars of mirror, shutters, and pebble without becoming a thesis statement. The gap-toothed reflection, the swallowing shadows, and the mica's faint glow in darkness enact the theme through image rather than assertion. The final image—Maris angling the mirror toward faint stars—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, recharging the teaching motif without overt moralizing. The piece embraces quiet ambiguity (the girl runs away with the pebble; Maris stays alone) and resists tidy resolution, though the thematic arc could benefit from sharper internal friction or a more oblique final gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is tightly controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: Maris's attention to textures (damp wood, smooth stone), her silent gestures, and her visual choreography (angling mirror, tilting shutters) create a coherent voice. The girl's dialogue feels natural and age-specific ("Mama says you're a witch," the tangled hair, the sodden doll), and the narration avoids filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Psychic distance is stable, and the prose reflects Maris's patient, observational stance through selective sensory detail and purposeful compression. The final paragraph's rhythm—metronome canal, the mirror angled skyward—charges the ending without over-explaining, and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short declaratives ("Maris didn't turn") alternate with longer descriptive constructions—and information density is high (most lines do double work: setting plus interiority, action plus theme). The opening "cobalt dock glistened under the weight of recent rain" and the closing "The world was full of things that needed teaching" bookend cleanly without loops. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "The girl frowned" followed by "The girl's frown deepened" is a paraphrase loop; "Maris didn't answer. Instead, she reached..." is a soft template stem. Two small loops and one minor filter cluster ("watching as the patterns shifted") trigger −0.4 cumulative, but clarity and propulsion remain strong through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The silent teacher archetype is personalized through the dental mirror, shutters, and pebble—ordinary tools made specific to Maris's canal-side practice. The phrase "to teach darkness the value of stars" risks abstraction but is grounded by the concrete demonstration (light patterns, mica glow). The story avoids template turns and the girl's encounter feels particularized rather than generic. However, the premise (mystical outsider teaches skeptical child through symbolic objects) leans on familiar craft-fiction templates without a fully non-obvious synthesis; the emotional arc is earned but the structural choices play it safe. The specificity of the canal setting and the silence-as-craft angle lift originality into the solid 7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening ("silent canal guardian... sat cross-legged"). Development: Maris's choices drive the middle encounter—she holds out the mirror, taps it, gestures to the shutters, closes the girl's fingers around the pebble—altering the child's understanding. Closure: "she would keep weaving" reaffirms her role, and the final act of angling the mirror skyward is a micro-decision to continue teaching. The character constrains the entire design (silence as method, gestures as instruction), participates in three beats (initial setup, middle demonstration, closing resolve), and her specific trait (refusal to speak) creates the encounter's pressure. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("her tools were simple: a dental mirror"). Development: used twice—first to show the girl her gap-toothed reflection, then again in Maris's lap after the girl leaves. Closure: "Maris picked up the mirror again, angling it toward the sky" with the stars visible in the glass reweights the object from diagnostic tool to teaching instrument. The mirror's curve distorts the girl's reflection, its worn handle signals years of use, and its final skyward angle charges the ending image. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (the reflection prompts the girl's reaction), and closure linkage push the score into the low 7s. Swappability is low—no generic object could serve the same diagnostic-then-cosmic function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: framed early via "Silence was her craft" and "weave the world into something softer." Development: shapes Maris's tactics throughout—she responds to the girl's challenge with gesture rather than words, using the mirror and pebble to demonstrate understanding without speech. Closure: the final paragraph restates "weaving, one silent pattern at a time," and the skyward mirror angle embodies the concept. Silent empathy governs the entire encounter's method and alters the girl's stance from suspicion to acceptance. However, the concept is told more than tested by internal friction or cost, and the empathy itself never faces a complicating pressure (e.g., the girl's continued resistance or a price for the teaching). Functional across three beats but not irreplaceable—vocal empathy could achieve similar story beats with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "spiralingly calm arcs" appears once, describing the light-and-shadow effect on the dock. Development and Closure: absent. The phrase is ornamental—a descriptor of the visual effect Maris creates, not a trait that constrains or enables her choices. The story's calm tone persists throughout, but "spiralingly calm" as a specific attribute does not recur, shape tactics, or charge the ending. Static description without causal pressure or cost. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates; decorative mention and label-only use apply −0.6 within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "weaving silence into understanding" and "she wove the world" appear early. Development: Maris's actions throughout the encounter—tracing the wood, creating patterns with shutters, placing the stone—read as enacted weaving, and the girl's shift from suspicion to acceptance results from this method. Closure: "she would keep weaving, one silent pattern at a time" and the mirror angled skyward reaffirm the action. The verb "weave" is both literal (patterns with light/shadow) and metaphorical (stitching understanding), and major turns trace to this method. However, swappability is moderate—"teach," "guide," or "craft" could replace "weave" with minor adjustments. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, but lacks full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup: "creating patterns with shutters" is named in paragraph three. Development: Maris "had spent the last hour" angling slats to fracture daylight into ribbons, and she gestures the girl toward the shutters to watch the shadows stretch. Closure: absent—the shutters do not reappear or reweight the final image. The method is signaled and its mechanics (angling slats, fracturing light) matter to the middle demonstration, but it is one tool among several (mirror, pebble) and does not uniquely drive the ending. Two gates (setup, middle) but no closure participation caps at ~6.0; the method shapes one beat but is easily swappable with another light-manipulation device. Lyric reprise is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "cobalt dock glistened under the weight of recent rain" anchors the opening. Development: the dock's slick planks, the edge where Maris sits with feet dangling, and the abandoned boathouse behind her provide spatial resources Maris uses (shutters on the boathouse, the dock as stage for the encounter). Closure: "The cobalt of the dock fading into black" marks the temporal shift, and Maris remains seated as the canal laps—the setting's constancy underscores her endurance. The rain-slicked surface and the canal's proximity do not alter tactics under pressure, but the dock's isolation ("No one came here") and the boathouse shutters enable Maris's demonstration. Three beats, causal pressure in the middle, closure presence, and moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears in paragraph five as the girl's voice "cut through the stillwater tension." Development and Closure: the phrase does not recur, and the timeframe itself remains vague—"since dusk," "the last hour," "tonight"—without a live clock that tightens decisions. The story unfolds in a single continuous encounter, but no deadline or time pressure shapes tactics. The "half-spoken secret" metaphor gestures at tone but does not function as a time constraint. Ornamental use, missing middle and closure gates, and high swappability (could be omitted without structural change) cap at 4.6; decorative mention applies −0.5, and late first appearance applies −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "to teach darkness the value of stars" is stated in paragraph ten. Development: Maris's entire method enacts this desire—she uses the mirror to show the gap (a darkness), the shutters to reveal encroaching shadow, and the pebble's mica to embody starlight. The girl's final whisper ("You're not a witch") confirms the teaching's success. Closure: the mirror angled skyward toward faint stars reaffirms the motivation. The desire is dramatized through concrete choices and shapes three beats. However, the motivation is told rather than internally conflicted—no friction between Maris's want and a cost, no competing desire that complicates the teaching. Setup arrives late (40% mark), applying the −0.5 late penalty and 4.6 cap, but strong causal pressure and closure linkage push the score to the cap's edge. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "stillwater tension" appears in paragraph five. Development: the tone is sustained through the quiet exchange—Maris's silence, the girl's cautious approach, the gradual dimming of light—without breaking into melodrama or rushing the encounter. Closure: "The canal lapped gently... a metronome to her thoughts" and the night deepening into black maintain the stillwater quality, and the final image (faint stars, Maris smiling) charges the tone with quiet resolve. Coherent through turns, modulates subtly as pressure shifts (the girl's challenge, the pebble exchange, the departure), and the final calm reconfigures the opening tension into earned patience. Three beats, closure linkage, and high specificity (other tones—urgency, dread—would break the piece's logic).</comment>
