<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority shows embodied contradiction—grief aching while her heart soars—but the "quietly charismatic" trait remains label-only without constraining choices. Elias functions primarily as observational echo rather than pressure source; his "whispering advisor" role doesn't force meaningful decisions. The mother's death backstory anchors present emotion effectively, but the final shift from "forgotten" to "seen" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized cost. Micro-choices (lifting camera, signing) texture the scene but don't foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (moonlight, silence, sign language) culminating in a cadence shift at "Keep going." Orientation anchors cleanly (harbor, dock, Lena+Elias, night). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final "she felt seen" crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (the price of being forgotten now reweighted by witness). The RR reconfigures the dominant stake (translating silence into music) but the cost remains largely told rather than shown in a concrete forfeit or friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harbor's luminous moonlight and salt-wind texture the atmosphere purposefully, but setting functions mostly as backdrop rather than constraint. The vintage camera is handled in multiple beats (traced, lifted, pointed) and the no-film detail sharpens meaning—capture vs. feeling. Spatial choreography (dock edge, horizon) tracks cleanly. The harbor's role as refuge during grief primes the closure but doesn't alter present tactics; it charges the final image without forcing a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence into music) is signaled early and threads through gestures, camera framing, invisible orchestra. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena's hands weave patterns that "seemed to hum," narrowing from concept to near-realization. Elias's "Keep going" acts as encouragement rather than reversal; no on-page trade-off or tightening forecloses options. The escalation reads as accumulative intensity rather than causal pressure, and the cost at closure (feeling seen vs. forgotten) is declared but not paid in visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (translating silence, joyful sorrow, grief-as-refuge) emerges through concrete particulars: sign language as non-breaking speech, camera without film, harbor as witness. "Joyful sorrow" is named by Elias but earned through the ache/soar contradiction in Lena's interior. The final image—moonlight as benediction, forgotten→seen—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor thematic echo in Elias's whispered observation trends instructive but doesn't collapse into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during gesture, wider during harbor description). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices light-dance and silence-hum, not tourist catalog. Elias's sparse dialogue ("You're mapping silence again") carries distinct idiom and subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Minor filter-verb stack in early paragraphs ("She had always been," "He had been") dulls immediacy slightly but doesn't obscure voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language (light as scattered silver, words curling like smoke, moonlight as benediction) is vivid but dense—nearly every paragraph carries a metaphor, edging toward overwriting without hard violation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The phrase "the way the" recurs structurally ("the way the light danced, the way the silence hummed") but reads voice-motivated rather than artifact. One scaffold moment: "It was the way the water held…the way the air carried" in adjacent lines trends slight redundancy. Information density is high; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sign language as silence-translation offers a fresh angle on grief and communication, avoiding obvious execution. The camera-without-film detail is specific and functional. Emotional particulars (grief without performance, quiet charisma, whispering advisor) resist templates. However, the premise—artistic protagonist processing loss through symbolic creative act at evocative setting—follows a familiar literary-fiction template. Transformation is present but incremental; the harbor-as-refuge frame and moonlit-witness closure feel earned yet not fully inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias appears in first third, observes throughout, and signs "Keep going" at closure—three-gate presence. But his role remains observational and encouraging; he does not create turns or force Lena's choices. His whispered commentary colors tone without constraining her tactics. Closure linkage is present but passive. Swappable with another supportive witness without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vintage camera with no film appears early (Lena traces it, ~para 2), is lifted/lowered in middle beats (framing emptiness, pointing at horizon), and returns implicitly in final paragraph as "reminder—tool for something greater." Three-gate fulfilled. The no-film detail constrains use (she doesn't photograph, she frames/feels) and charges meaning at closure. However, the camera could be replaced by another symbolic object (journal, instrument) with edits; irreplaceability is moderate. Cost connection: the tool reweights capture→feeling but doesn't foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sign language is seeded early (para 10), used in middle beats (Lena signs "You don't have to stay," then weaves patterns faster), and appears in closure (Elias signs "Keep going"). Three gates met. The concept shapes stakes (translate silence) and tactics (signing instead of speaking to avoid breaking silence). Causal pressure: her gestures "seemed to hum," pulling sound from night—this alters her tactic from mere framing to active composition. Specificity is high; the mechanics matter. One cost: she must work within silence's constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is labeled in para 7 ("her presence a soft pull rather than a force") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Setup gate met (first third), but no middle development or closure payoff. The trait is told, not shown through choices that test or trade on charisma. Swappable with "introspective" or "reserved" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears twice: Elias says "You're disrupting the stillness" (middle), and the piece's premise is Lena disrupting silence to translate it into music. Setup and development gates met; closure implicit (her gestures pull sound, disrupting emptiness). The action is conceptually central but enacted through gesture rather than decisive physical turn. Swappability: "transform" or "shape" could replace "disrupt" with minor tonal shift. Causal role present but moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named by Elias early (para 5), shown in middle (Lena frames emptiness, conducts invisible orchestra), and enacted at closure (her gestures weave patterns that hum). Three gates met. The method shapes her attempts: she doesn't speak, photograph, or play an instrument—she uses sign and gesture to map/compose. Mechanics are signaled and matter tactically. Specificity is high but the method could be replaced by another silent compositional mode (e.g., drawing, dance) with edits; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Luminous harbor by moonlight is anchored early (para 1–2), textured throughout (shimmering water, salt wind, horizon), and returns in closure ("harbor glowed brighter, moonlight spilling"). Three gates met. Setting charges atmosphere and serves as refuge-marker for Lena's grief, but does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics. Postcard-vivid description; micro-setting (dock edge, camera around neck) adds texture but doesn't pressure decisions. Lyric reprise reweights the space (refuge→witness) with moderate resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "when no one remembers you" is seeded in backstory (para 13, "those quiet, hollow weeks after her mother's death") and resolved at closure ("she didn't feel forgotten. She felt seen"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent—no on-page scene where being unremembered tightens a present choice. The timeframe contextualizes grief but operates as backstory rather than live pressure. Swappable with "after loss" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate silence into music" is seeded early (para 13, "where she worked to translate silence into music"), pursued in middle beats (conducting invisible orchestra, weaving patterns that hum), and advanced at closure (Elias: "Keep going"). Three gates met. Desire is dramatized through gestures and camera use, not merely told. Friction between silence (constraint) and music (goal) creates productive tension. One visible cost: the effort to compose without breaking silence. Causal pressure is moderate; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is named mid-story (para 14, Elias whispers it) and woven through Lena's interior ("the way her heart ached even as it soared"). Tone modulates with pressure: early stillness, middle intensification (faster gestures), closure benediction. Setup and closure gates met; middle development present in embodied contradiction. The tone charges the final image (forgotten→seen carries both ache and lift). However, explicit naming by a character trends instructive; the tone is felt but also explained, reducing subtlety.</comment>
