<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority shows some embodied contradiction—she seeks continuity while carrying her father's violence-lessons—but the arc feels predetermined rather than emergent from moment-to-moment pressure. The final gesture (handing him the rose) reads more symbolic than causally earned by micro-choices that alter stance. The father remains a silhouette; his "something other than calculation" flicker lacks specificity or cost. Backstory volume is high (~25%) but anchored adequately; the present-tense micro-choices (kneeling, holding out the sandbag, pressing the rose) tilt stance enough to avoid routing a BRR penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by paragraph two (who/where/when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the father stands with the wilting rose, the bounty unclaimed, and Liora returns to the soil—options reconfigured with felt cost (he leaves empty-handed, she accepts isolation). However, the cost is asserted more than shown; we do not see him walk away or her face a consequence. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (desert roses as recurring motif, cadence shift at the end), but the final image is diluted by the explanatory paragraph ("The bounty would remain unclaimed...") rather than trusting the rose-wilting image alone. Cost proof is present but muffled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and twin suns anchor early; sensory detail (warm soil, velvety petals, humid warmth) is vivid and filtered through Liora's perceptive bias. The dome itself constrains the final beat—sealing them in, wind outside versus stillness inside—charging the closure image with spatial pressure. The sandbag scrap and irrigation line ground micro-setting. Minor slip: "tranquil blazes" in the opener feels ornamental rather than perception-driven. Spatial choreography (father at entrance, Liora kneeling, door hissing shut) is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Liora's refusal to become her father's target/her assertion of continuity over chaos) is signaled early and held. The father's arrival tightens pressure, but the turn—her handing him the rose and his hesitation—feels more thematic echo than a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The "bounty would remain unclaimed" is told, not shown; we never see him choose or refuse. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and rose image provide some deepening, but agency at closure is passive (he stands, she kneels again) rather than a foreclosing act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (continuity woven through chaos, violence spun into life) emerges from concrete particulars—the roses, the sandbag, the knife gesture—without overt thesis. The final image (rose wilting in his grip, her hands in soil) offers a resonant non-literal answer: persistence versus decay. Minor drag: "engraved quiet of the past and the tranquil blaze of the present" names the theme rather than trusting the image. The prompt concept "engraved quiet" is forced into the final paragraph as an abstraction, lowering organicity slightly. Overall, subtext operates cleanly in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature (noticing leaf curl, scent of rain) is distinct and consistent. Voice has texture ("the desert had a way of leaving its mark," "thorns sharp, blooms unyielding") but lapses into elevated register at peaks ("engraved quiet," "wove the only continuity") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Dialogue (two brief exchanges) is functional and carries subtext (the rose as silent argument). No head-hopping. Distance is consistent; filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm, but several artifacts cluster: "engraved quiet" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs as a stock phrase; "tranquil blaze/blazes" recurs without reweighting; the final paragraph stacks three synonymous closure gestures ("world outside could burn, but here, life persisted. And that was enough") creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high in the opening without pattern-teaching ("fracturing the light into a thousand tranquil blazes"). Information density is good in action beats (knife gesture, sandbag handoff) but the penultimate paragraph over-explains theme. No simultaneity errors; grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise (pacifist daughter grows roses under threat from bounty-hunter father) is familiar but executed with specificity: the glass dome, twin suns, airship-sandbag relic. The rose-as-refusal gesture and the wilting-in-his-grip image feel fresh in synthesis. However, the moral calculus is predictable (violence redeemed by patience), and the emotional arc follows a well-trodden daughter-reforming-father template. The "tower falls" backstory and "inculcating plants with values" remain ornamental quirks rather than transformative angles. Risk-taking is modest; the ending opts for quiet affirmation without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora (bounty hunter's daughter, pacifist by inference) is present throughout and her stance (weaving continuity, refusing violence) shapes the final beat. However, her choices are reactive and gestural (holding out the sandbag, pressing the rose) rather than decisions that create turns. The father's arrival is the sole pressure point; her response is pre-determined refusal without visible cost or tactical shift. She appears early (setup ✓), acts in the middle (sandbag handoff ✓), and shapes the ending (rose gesture ✓), but swappability is moderate—any pacifist child could perform similar moves. Causal pressure is low; the arc is thematic assertion more than choice-driven transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in paragraph five (late first third), is handled (picked up, initials noted), handed to the father mid-scene, and he takes it at closure. Two distinct beats (discovery, handoff) with specificity (initials "J.V."). However, it does not constrain choice or enable tactics; it is a symbolic token that prompts his momentary recognition but does not alter his decision or Liora's. Closure participation is cameo-level (he holds it alongside the rose, no reweighting). Swappable with any relic from his past. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears twice as a phrase (sandbag initials described as "engraved quiet," then "engraved quiet of the past" in the final paragraph) but never shapes stakes or alters options on the page. It is a thematic label for the father's legacy and the contrast with "tranquil blaze," not a lived concept that pressures choice. Mentioned (setup weak, no middle use, closure echo only as abstraction). Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is named in paragraph six and illustrated (noticing leaf curl, scent of rain before it falls). However, the trait does not constrain or enable a key action with cost; it characterizes Liora's worldview but does not alter her tactics or the father's response. No visible tradeoff (e.g., hyper-perception causing her to miss a threat or exhaust her attention). Label-only with descriptive support but no causal work. Present by first third, no middle or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sheathe action occurs mid-scene: "reached for the knife at her belt—not to draw it, but to sheathe it properly, the way he'd taught her." The gesture is deliberate and signals her refusal to escalate; it is a micro-turn that acknowledges his teaching while bending it. However, the knife is already at her belt (presumably sheathed), so the "sheathe it properly" reads as correction or ritual rather than a high-stakes choice. The beat is charged but not indispensable—removing it would soften the moment but not break the closure. One key beat (middle), shapes tone, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Inculcating the desert roses with values she wished the world would hold: patience, resilience, the quiet strength of a thing that thrives where nothing else can" is stated in paragraph six but never shown as a method or mechanic. We see her tending roses (kneeling, brushing petals) but not the act of inculcating or its effects. The concept is thematic claim, not dramatized process. It does not shape her attempts or constrain her choices. Mentioned once, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is anchored in the opening line, pressures the midpoint (father enters, door seals them in "the humid warmth"), and charges the final image (wind howls outside, air inside is still—spatial contrast underscores her isolation and persistence). The dome as enclosure shapes the father's approach and their confrontation; removing it would diffuse the pressure. Three beats (setup, entry/seal, closure contrast), causal role (sealing them in), closure linkage strong. Environment constrains and charges.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the tower fell, when the sky was still choked with dust" anchors the timeframe early (paragraph three) and provides context (father's fleet grounded, Liora's exile or retreat). However, the "after" is vague—no live clock, no tightening deadline. The timeframe is backdrop, not pressure; it does not alter tactics or decisions in the present scene. Setup ✓, no middle or closure use. Functional context but replaceable with any post-catastrophe marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is articulated in paragraph four ("she sought to weave continuity through it") and demonstrated through her rose cultivation and the final image (hands in soil, "wove the only continuity that mattered"). The desire is dramatized in her refusal to draw the knife and her gesture with the rose, creating friction between her father's chaos-is-constant worldview and her patient persistence. However, the cost is implied rather than visible—she accepts isolation but no on-page loss is shown (e.g., she does not forfeit safety, resources, or a chance to flee). Two beats (middle stance, closure image), moderate friction, cost is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears in the opening ("fracturing the light into a thousand tranquil blazes") and is echoed in the final paragraph ("tranquil blaze of the present"). The tone—calm intensity, fire contained—modulates with the father's arrival (tension rises) and the still ending (pressure crystallizes into quiet defiance). However, the phrase itself is ornamental in both appearances; the tone is carried more by image (dome shimmer, wind versus stillness) than by the concept. Coherent, purposeful reprise, but the exact phrase is not indispensable. Two-beat lyric frame, moderate charge.</comment>
