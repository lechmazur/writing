<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aldric's interior life shows some contradiction—years of withdrawal versus an unnamed pull—but his passivity dominates. The final choice to "not resist" reads more like surrender than agency, and the motivation for letting the strings take him lacks concrete embodiment of what he's trading away. The woman is a cipher who applies pressure but remains a stock facilitator. Embodied emotion is present in hitched breath and trembling sword, but the peak moment lacks a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, Aldric, post-war). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens with layered imagery (orchard, program, marionettes, strings), but closure relies on Aldric's passive acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The program dissolves into embers and the marionettes surge—events happen *to* him. Cost is asserted ("he did not resist") but the before/after in his agency or stance is not legible on the page; the final line offers theme statement rather than felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with pulsing fruits, silver-leafed vines, and fogged glass. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, flagstones, trees, glass panes). The setting pressures Aldric by its reality-thinning properties and charges the final image with marionettes visible through the glass. This elevates the category into the 7s, though the orchard's mechanics (how it thins reality) remain decorative rather than constraining a specific tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the shape of possibility—is signaled early but remains abstract. Aldric's action (unsnapping the sword belt) is a renunciation, yet it feels like capitulation rather than a tightening choice with visible tradeoff. The woman's appearance and the marionettes' surge happen *to* him; escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist decision. One meaningful pressure point (the program warming, the woman's offer) deepens the texture, but cost at closure is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of control, fate, strings, and possibility emerges through concrete images (marionettes, program, oath line). The final program line offers resonance but edges toward a stated moral. Subtext operates in the woman's smile and hollow eyes. The piece resists easy answers and maintains ambiguity (weave or unravel), but Aldric's internal arc—withdrawal to submission—does not interrogate the thematic question through his choices; the theme is more imposed than earned through his agency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focus on Aldric's perceptions. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("leaves skittering over graves," "shivering bliss"). The woman's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is selective (sword trembling, breath hitching). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Some filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose sustains a distinct texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences propel. Information density is high in beats like the program's discovery and the woman's entrance. Figurative language is concentrated ("reality thinned," "ink in water," "candle flames in a draft") but remains coherent. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph ("Or unravel it entirely" as a one-sentence afterthought) and some scaffold phrasing ("He had come...seeking something he could not name, only feel") slightly lower momentum. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. Grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The marionette-and-strings conceit layered with alchemical unreality offers a fresh synthesis, and the "shivering bliss" phrasing is memorable. However, the knight-in-withdrawal and the mysterious woman guide are recognizable templates. The ending—protagonist lifted by strings into transformation—is a close echo of willing-sacrifice-into-transcendence beats common to dark fantasy. Emotional specificity in Aldric's arc (withdrawal without concrete grievance, capitulation without visible cost) remains generic. Transformation test: swap names and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aldric is present throughout and his withdrawal is seeded early. He kneels for the program (beat 1), trembles when the woman speaks (beat 2), and unsnaps his sword belt at closure (beat 3). The final choice—letting the strings lift him—alters the ending's stakes. However, his interiority is more reactive than decisive; he does not create key turns so much as submit to them. Present across beats and at closure, but agency is muted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The program appears early, is handled (Aldric lifts it, it grows warm), dissolves into embers that the woman uses, and its final line glows on the stones at closure. Three beats with evolving use. The oath theme charges the ending. However, its causal role is symbolic rather than tactical—it does not constrain a choice so much as underscore theme. Strong integration, shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Murmured allegiance is present in the program's subtitle and final line, and the woman speaks of threads and oaths. It shapes thematic resonance but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. The concept is told and echoed rather than dramatized as a stake that changes Aldric's options. Functional for atmosphere, replaceable in structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as a descriptor for the fruits' light. The phrasing is memorable but the trait does not enable or constrain action; the fruits glow and hum, but Aldric does not interact with them or face a cost tied to their mystical property. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unsnapping the sword belt is the decisive renunciation at closure. The act is seeded (sword "hung at his side like a relic"), performed on-page with sound ("clattered against the stones"), and the woman responds ("Good"). The image charges the ending and signals Aldric's transformation. Removing "unsnap" would require rewriting the closure beat; the exactness of the action (not dropping, not drawing, but unsnapping) matters. Essential to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Forgotten patterns appear twice: the woman traces them in the air, and "shivering bliss" is described as a moment when "all things hung in perfect, terrible balance." The method flavors the supernatural mechanics but does not shape Aldric's attempts or constrain his tactics. It is present at closure (marionettes moving in patterns) but more as texture than causal method. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard is anchored early and present throughout. Its properties (reality thinning, branches twisting into impossible geometries, fogged glass) pressure Aldric and supply the visual for the marionettes. The setting charges the final image and the alchemists' "crucible" framing primes the transformation. Spatial details (bench, flagstones, trees, glass) constrain choreography. The orchard is essential to tone and the ending's visual logic. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reality shifting is seeded ("war: battles fought and refought in the same instant") and present at closure ("world stuttered"). The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock; Aldric's decisions are not tightened by temporal pressure. The "endless night" is static description. Time flavors the surreal tone but does not alter tactics. One causal role (the program dissolves "once, twice") but minimal pressure. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Capturing the shape of possibility is named early and the woman echoes it ("You want to capture..."). Aldric's pull to the orchard and final surrender dramatize the motivation. However, internal conflict between wanting to capture versus fearing transformation is told rather than shown through competing micro-choices. The motivation drives him to the orchard and into the strings, but friction between desire and cost is asserted, not embodied in contradictory actions. Present and purposeful, shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" is named once and the tone—dread mixed with wonder—pervades the piece (fogged glass, pulsing light, hollow eyes, trembling sword). Tone modulates when the woman smiles and the marionettes surge, charging the final image. Coherent and purposeful. However, the tone does not shift decisively under pressure; it remains a static atmosphere rather than a modulating force tied to escalation. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>
