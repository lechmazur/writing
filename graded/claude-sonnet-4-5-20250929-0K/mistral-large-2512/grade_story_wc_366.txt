<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shows genuine contradiction—carrying a talisman against the dark while actively climbing into haunted spaces—and his micro-choices (placing the sea glass, building the stone reply) carry visible cost tied to grief. The embodied emotion is strong: "luminescent ache," "chest tight." However, the final realization feels more stated than earned through dramatized pressure, and the shift from isolation to connection lacks a visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: stones accumulate, notes layer, the lamp is relit, and the final note reweights prior material. However, the closure—"didn't feel alone in the dark"—reads as emotional summary rather than a concrete image that makes cost undeniable. The reversal (stones rearranged, final note) happens off-page, undermining agency and felt consequence at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: "bruised twilight," "soot-streaked glass," "iron stairs," the lantern room's cold and hum. The sea glass and stones function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (skiff, dock, stairs, lantern room, sill) tracks cleanly. The setting does not merely decorate; it enables the stone-stacking action and supplies the lamp that Elias relights, altering the scene's charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the feeling of safety, or responding to the anonymous call—is present but diffuse. Elias's agency manifests in the stone reply and relighting the lamp, which narrows options (he commits to the exchange). However, the stones rearranging themselves removes his final choice from the page, and the cost of connection is told ("didn't feel alone") rather than shown through a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful tightening occurs (the spiral grows, the final note arrives), but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—light as communal act, safety as passed lantern—emerges from concrete particulars: sea glass, stones, the lamp. The closing image of objects left behind offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward statement: "fragments of the same story, passed like a lantern from hand to hand" nearly declares the thesis. The sea glass and stone spiral accumulate meaning well, but the last two paragraphs summarize theme rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct maritime texture: "rhythm of ropes," "weathered dock," "salt and tide." Perceptual signature is strong—Elias notices soot, cold, the hum of ghost light. The prose modulates from terse action to reflective rhythm without register clash. The final turn to summary ("he understood then") slightly weakens distance control, but the voice remains coherent and the elision (who rearranged the stones) feels purposeful rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance image, character, or pressure. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop: "the dark" appears four times in peak beats without reweighting; "luminescent ache" and "ghost of light" overlap; "protect" recurs without escalation. The phrase "like a lantern from hand to hand" in the penultimate paragraph feels like explanatory scaffold. No major clarity issues, but these micro-loops dull propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous letter chain via stone-stacking in a haunted lighthouse—offers a fresh synthesis. The emotional truth (grief, isolation, communal safety) anchors the concept. However, the ghost-keeper setup is introduced but not transformed; the stones rearranging themselves risks mystical convenience. The final insight ("lighthouse wasn't haunted by the dead, but by the living") is earnest but leans on explanation rather than letting the image stand alone. The piece takes risks with the accumulative structure but retreats slightly into summary at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in every beat, makes two key choices (placing the sea glass, building the stone reply, relighting the lamp), and drives the accumulative structure. However, "reticent" manifests only as backstory ("hands that knew the rhythm of ropes better than words") and does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with felt cost. The character functions well, but the reticence trait itself remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sea glass is introduced early (pocket, daughter, talisman), placed at the lamp's base (middle beat), and left in the final image ("the sea glass stayed"). It appears in three beats and charges the closure by remaining as beacon within beacon. However, its meaning does not shift under pressure; it functions as a stable token rather than an object whose use evolves or whose cost escalates. Strong integration, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is introduced in backstory, but the notes shape on-page stakes: Elias reads one ("dark is only dangerous if you forget how to listen"), responds with stones, and receives a final note that reweights his stance. The concept drives the middle turn (stone reply) and participates in closure (final note, understanding). It is not easily swappable; removing it collapses the story's communicative structure and the earned shift from isolation to recognition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is told once ("the room was warmly observant") but does not constrain or enable Elias's choices. The trait applies to the room, not the character, and remains a descriptive label without dramatized cost or tactical consequence. It adds atmospheric texture but is easily replaceable with any synonym for attentive ambience.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Protect" is named in backstory ("spent years protecting the lighthouses") and invoked at closure ("thank you for keeping the light"), but the on-page action centers on responding and connecting rather than active protection. Elias relights the lamp, which can be read as a protective act, but the verb itself does not drive a key reversal or redefine options. The concept frames the theme but is not causally indispensable to plot turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced early (stones in spiral on sill), explained as "a way of stacking stones as messages," and used twice: Elias builds his reply ("three stones for 'I hear you'"), and the stones are rearranged by an unseen hand. The method shapes the middle beat (his reply) and participates in closure (rearranged pattern, final note beneath). The mechanics matter: the spiral teaches the language, and his response commits him to the exchange. Removing this method would break the story's communicative logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lantern room is introduced early, provides the spatial anchor for all key beats (stones on sill, lamp, sea glass placement), and supplies the cold and hum that pressure Elias's choices. "Haunted" is mentioned in backstory and invoked at closure ("wasn't haunted by the dead, but by the living"), reweighting the premise. The setting does not merely decorate; it enables the stone exchange and the lamp-relighting. However, the "haunted" aspect functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the lamp flickers out" is mentioned in the opening ("beam long since extinguished") but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Time remains vague: "by dawn" marks a transition, "that evening" another, but no clock pressure shapes Elias's moves. The timeframe sets initial condition (the lamp is dark) and allows Elias to relight it, but elapsed time does not narrow options or escalate cost. Functional but replaceable with any post-abandonment window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is stated explicitly in reflection ("never considered what it meant to protect the feeling of safety itself"). The desire is thematically present and drives Elias's choices (placing the sea glass, building stones, relighting the lamp), but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks on-page cost or competing pull that would charge the choices with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears in the opening ("air hummed with the ghost of light, a luminescent ache") and recurs in reflection ("the same luminescent ache"), charging both the setup and the thematic close. The tone modulates from cold observation to chest-tight emotion to quiet resolution, coherent across beats. The phrase itself reweights at closure: what was ghostly pressure becomes shared legacy. The tone charges the final image and is difficult to replace without collapsing the story's atmospheric through-line.</comment>
