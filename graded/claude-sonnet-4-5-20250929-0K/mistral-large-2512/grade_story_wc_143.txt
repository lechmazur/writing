<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias has clear interiority and a consistent perceptual filter (the geologist's grain, the way he notices micro-impacts). His agency is muted: he performs his assigned task without meaningful internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final acceptance ("some things were never meant to last") reads more as philosophical summary than embodied transformation driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: Elias on Mons Huygens, photographing the last undisturbed crater. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—details accrue (sand grain, cobalt strip, camera click) and the final image reweights the opening stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that the moment won't last), but the cost is told rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift makes the acceptance palpable beyond the philosophical gloss in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lunar setting is vivid and purposeful: regolith texture, Earthrise glare, micro-impacts on the crater rim. The camera (film canisters "thick with weight") and the cobalt strip function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice and charge the final beats. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail reflects Elias's priorities without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: photograph the crater before it's destroyed. Pressure is diffuse—Elias carries out his task without meaningful obstacle or a choice that narrows options. The "three lunar nights outlasting" is summarized rather than dramatized. The final turn (pocketing the vial, accepting impermanence) lacks on-page cost; the bulldozers remain abstract, and no live tactical friction tests his commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and witness emerges organically from the crater, the sand grain, and the timed chemical message. The final image (photograph remains, so does he) offers quiet resonance without overt moralizing. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic echo: "some things were never meant to last" articulates the premise rather than trusting the image to carry it, and the symmetry of "the photograph would remain / so would he" feels slightly arranged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: lyric diction ("blue light bleeding over the lunar horizon like a slow-dying ember") and reflective cadence suit Elias's contemplative stance. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor filter-verb clustering ("watching his breath fog," "watching the readout flicker") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats, but voice remains coherent and controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong image specificity ("jagged crown of basalt," "ghosts" from creeping light). Two minor issues: the phrase "dawning hush" recurs without evolving meaning, and a paraphrase loop appears in the opening ("came to the moon not to conquer it, but to witness its quiet surrender" → "last undisturbed crater... soon to be swallowed"). No major line-level artifacts touch closure, and information density is generally high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lunar-preservationist premise is fresh within space-age fiction, and the sand-grain talisman and cobalt message are specific touches. However, the emotional arc—man learns to accept impermanence—is familiar, and the final realization arrives without prior resistance or mistake to make it feel earned in hindsight. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but does not risk a surprising turn or oblique moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias narrates and executes his assigned task (scan, photograph, leave message) but does not face a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present across all beats but functionally passive; observation dominates over decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sand grain appears in three beats: gift from the geologist, rolling between fingers when silence presses, and the final pocketing after understanding its purpose. It shifts meaning (reminder → acceptance token) but does not constrain a choice or alter the outcome; the reprise is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is seeded early, recurs as a love-object, and charges the tone throughout. It shapes Elias's reflective stance but does not narrow options or create tactical friction. The concept is more atmospheric than causal, landing in the mid-band via lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is declared in paragraph nine and demonstrated through scanner use and micro-impact observation. The trait enables his method (feel over data) but does not produce a visible tradeoff or constrain a choice under pressure; it reads as characterization rather than plot lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Outlast" is mentioned (three lunar nights of cold and isolation) but summarized rather than dramatized. It provides context for Elias's endurance but does not drive a key turn or redefine options on the page; easily swappable with similar summary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cobalt-chloride message appears in one beat (dripped onto filter paper, changing color) and is framed as a "trick he'd learned." It is executed but does not shape prior attempts or resolve a problem; it arrives as a set-piece flourish rather than a method under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mons Huygens summit is established early, supplies resources (regolith, crater rim, Earthrise backdrop) that frame every beat, and the moonlit glare directly affects Elias's visor adjustment and camera framing. The setting pressures perception and charges the final image without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Space age" anchors era (film camera, Apollo zone, Houston mission logs) and lends verisimilitude. Time does not tighten decisions—no countdown or clock-driven urgency; the bulldozers remain offstage future. Functional context but not a live tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire to photograph the last undisturbed crater is declared early and pursued throughout. It drives his presence and task but lacks on-page friction: no competing want, no obstacle that forces a tradeoff. The motivation is consistent but not conflicted, capping the score below high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is coherent across all beats: lyric diction, reflective pacing, and quiet acceptance. Tone modulates subtly (glare and silence early, breath and acceptance at the end) and charges the final image. It does not shift dramatically under pressure but maintains consistent emotional texture that supports closure.</comment>
