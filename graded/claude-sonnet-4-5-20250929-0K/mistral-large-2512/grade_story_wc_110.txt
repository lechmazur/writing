<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied ("pulse quickened," the weight of confession settling over her), and her final micro-choice—setting down the lens as a promise—flows from accumulated pressure. Elias's admission ("I needed to know who I could trust") lands with visible cost, and both characters show contradictory impulses: Mira has hoarded secrets while judging his quietness as indifference. Minor slip: the phrase "fear, his need to thaw the mistrust" edges toward label-only emotion in one beat, though the surrounding action (his shaky breath, the spread tickets) provides sufficient embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~60 words (Mira, night registrar, cinema entrance). The lens is Causal: Elias's eavesdropping confession causes Mira's realization, which narrows options and leads to the mutual offer to "start over" with visible cost (abandoning pretense, exposing vulnerability). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lens placed back into the projector crystallizes their new stance, and the final line reweights the silence from barrier to beginning. Cost is felt in the admission of years spent "pretending," though a more concrete forfeiture on the page would push this higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cinema lobby, projector, and concession stand anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The lens (picked up, turned over, set down between them, slotted back into the projector) functions as micro-setting: it constrains the confession beat and charges the final image when Elias replaces it. The crystal forecourt returns at closure ("whispers softer now") to reweight the rain-washed atmosphere, linking opening to ending with purpose. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (scent of celluloid and rain, projector hum).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is trust between Mira and Elias, signaled early ("ambiguously clear," "You're lying"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias spreads the ticket stubs and admits eavesdropping, narrowing Mira's options—she can dismiss him or engage. The final choice (placing the lens down, agreeing to "start over") is protagonist-driven with visible cost: abandoning the guarded stance each has held for years. Agency is clear, and coincidence does not resolve; the pressure coheres under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (trust through transparency versus guarded secrecy) emerges from specific events: the ticket stubs, the lens removal, the parallel hoarding (Mira of archives, Elias of overheard conversations). The final image—"the silence between them didn't feel like a barrier. It felt like a beginning"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, reweighting prior material. Minor slip: "freed by honesty" is slightly over-articulated in "the weight of something freed by honesty," though the scene work earns the thematic gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mira as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct ("glistened," "ambiguously clear," "words were simple, but they carried the weight") with purposeful syntax. Dialogue advances plot and carries subtext ("You're not supposed to." / "I was going to put it back." / "You're lying."), and the exchange feels goal-driven. Minor issue: Elias and Mira's internal idiom converge slightly at the ending ("tired of pretending") without strong voice distinction, though the compression is brief and acceptable under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high (the ticket stub beat introduces doodles, faded seat number, and Mira's pocket gesture in three lines). Clarity is strong, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. One figurative slip: "as if the world had slipped into a state where words had become unnecessary" in the opening is elevated diction that borders on abstraction without clear POV grounding, though it does not recur. Propulsion is consistent; no scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dual-hoarding irony (Mira guards archives, Elias collects overheard secrets) offers a fresh angle on workplace trust dynamics. The cryptic doodles forming a map and the lens as a bargaining object are specific choices that avoid stock symbolic convenience. However, the core arc—two guarded coworkers confess and agree to start over—follows a familiar template, and the rain-washed forecourt at closure leans into atmospheric convention without sharp transformation. No proximity echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira (night registrar) anchors the story, makes the key turn when she sets the lens down between them, and her realization ("we're both tired of pretending") alters the ending stance. She is present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure). Her occupation as registrar is mentioned but does not constrain a beat; her role as observer-turned-participant drives the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in beat one (Elias left it out), beat two (Mira studies it, Elias picks it up), and the closure (he slots it back into the projector as a promise). It is handled on the page three times, narrows the confrontation, and charges the final image. Strong integration; removing it would weaken the closure's symbolic weight and the tactical exchange.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" is explicitly named ("the weight of something freed by honesty") and shapes the final beat: Mira's confession and Elias's admission alter their stance. However, the concept is also thematized in dialogue ("Would you have told me the truth?"), which reduces its implication work. It constrains the ending choice but is slightly over-articulated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is applied to Elias in one descriptor ("his words precise, but his intentions veiled in quiet gestures"). It does not constrain an on-page action or return with reweighted meaning; it remains a label. Functional but replaceable with "enigmatic" or "opaque" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is the inciting action: Elias admits "I've been eavesdropping" and spreads the ticket stubs to prove it. This confession causes Mira's pulse to quicken and shifts her stance from suspicion to understanding. The action redefines their options and is integral to the closure's trust negotiation. Removing it would break the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cryptic doodles on ticket stubs are shown twice (Mira finds one in beat one, Elias spreads many in beat two) and form "a map of sorts—lines connecting names, dates, whispered conversations." The method enables Elias's eavesdropping tactic and provides the evidence that shifts Mira's view. It is specific and integral; a generic journal or recording would not carry the same tactile map logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain opens and closes the story. At closure, "the crystals in the forecourt seemed to hum, their whispers softer now, as if the rain had washed away the last of the lies." It is present in setup and closure but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource; it remains atmospheric. The reprise reweights tone but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears once in the opening ("as if the world had slipped into a state where words had become unnecessary") and does not return or tighten decisions. The timeframe is mentioned but does not constrain the dialogue-heavy confession that follows. Ornamental and contradicted by the narrative's reliance on spoken exchange.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to thaw mistrust is dramatized: she hesitates before speaking, confronts Elias ("You're lying"), and ultimately sets down the lens as an offer of transparency. The friction between her guarded habit (hoarding archives) and her present choice (agreeing to "start over") creates visible cost. The motivation drives the closure choice and is earned across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone is established early (pale streetlamps, misting breath, "silence felt heavier") and modulates with pressure: the confrontation tightens diction ("sharp and unyielding"), and the ending softens ("whispers softer now," "silence... didn't feel like a barrier"). The resonant hush coheres through turns and charges the final image ("projector whirred to life, casting its light into the dark"). It supports the closure effect without static repetition.</comment>
