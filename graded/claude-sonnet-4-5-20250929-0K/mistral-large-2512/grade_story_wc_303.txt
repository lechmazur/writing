<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is vivid and embodied—her hands shaking, breath fogging—and the dream-versus-empire tension drives her choices on the page. The plants' telepathic urgency pushes her toward the climactic act, and her final smile shows credible alteration. However, the father's abrupt vanishing and the plants' sudden shift from screaming to quiet deflate the cost; we don't see her register the loss or the moral weight of what she's done, weakening the closure's felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt: observatory, Elara, ice violin, midsummer twilight all land in the first paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Causal-Hybrid—violin triggers telepathy, plants urge action, father arrives to stop her, she plays and he vanishes—but the father's disappearance lacks on-page mechanism (did the plants kill him? transport him? was it metaphor?), creating a causality gap at the closure beat. The cost is stated (he's gone, future unwritten) but not shown, so the Decisive Change loses legibility. Applying −0.6 for closure-beat causality opacity and capping at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet-draped dome, cold gloves, transparent violin, and overlapping coffee stains are vivid and purposeful. The plants lean toward Elara and later surge forward to bind her father—micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice. Spatial choreography is clean (door, table, corner plants, windows shattering), and sensory detail (breath fogging, cracking-ice note) anchors each beat. Reaches low-7 band on environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—dream versus empire—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The violin's first note triggers telepathy (complication), the father's arrival tightens the dilemma, and Elara's decision to play forces the rupture. However, the father's vanishing happens *to* him without visible resistance or negotiation, so the protagonist's agency in that beat is partial. The cost is declared (he's gone, future unwritten) but not dramatized—no mourning, no tactical consequence, no price paid afterward—so the escalation's final turn feels asserted rather than earned. Mid-6 band for one meaningful tightening with incomplete cost proof.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: perforated destiny as lattice, coffee-stain prophecy, the unraveling forced by choice. The ending image—woman walking away, violin in arms, future unwritten—reweights the premise without moralizing. "The dream had weighed more" is close to a thesis statement but lands as closure rather than sermon. Subtext in the plants' urgency and the father's cold eyes enriches the conflict. Reaches low-7 on thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is distinct—"velvet observatory," "frozen spider silk," "coffee stains … shape of what was to come"—and vocabulary fits her scholar-mystic lens. The father's dialogue ("You always did have a flair for the dramatic") carries subtext. However, "propagate the unraveling" and "fracture" in the plants' telepathy edge toward prompt-echo rather than Elara's idiom, and the final line's tidy summary ("The dream had weighed more") flattens the voice slightly. Low-7 for consistent control with minor register drift at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is sharp ("sound like cracking ice," "dark rings overlapping in chaotic patterns"). No paraphrase loops or scaffolding. However, several beats lean on figurative density without clear payoff—"drank the midsummer twilight," "possibilities blooming like cracks in ice"—and the plants' voices shift from "screams" to "hisses" to "quiet" without embodied transition, creating mild coherence friction. The closure image is vivid but the prior paragraph's summary ("threads snapping, possibilities blooming") diffuses momentum. Mid-6 for strong craft with figurative overreach in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin and coffee-stain divination are fresh particulars, and the dream-versus-empire frame avoids cliché through Elara's scholar lens. The perforated-destiny metaphor is conceptually interesting. However, the climactic confrontation—father arrives, protagonist plays violin, he vanishes—follows a recognizable "magical artifact defeats antagonist" template without transformation. The plants' sudden agency (vines tangling his ankles) and the father's abrupt exit feel like convenience moves. Mid-6 for specific synthesis with derivative escalation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's provenance-researcher identity frames her approach (tracing the violin's history, reading coffee stains), but no on-page beat turns on research skills—she doesn't decode an inscription, consult a ledger, or apply field knowledge to solve a problem. Her climactic choice is to play the violin, not to investigate. Present across beats but swappable with "mystic scholar" or "curator." Two-gate participation (setup, closure presence) caps eligibility near 6.0; lack of middle causal pressure and swappability lower to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ice violin is signaled in paragraph two, handled in the first-note beat, and wielded in the climax (three distinct beats). Its properties—transparent, frozen spider silk strings, plays "the music of what could have been"—are irreplaceable and drive the closure: the note that "was not a sound but a force" shatters windows and banishes the father. The final image shows Elara walking away with the violin, reweighting it as the chosen dream. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity lift to mid-7s. Not 8.5+ because the violin's mechanics (why does it repel the father? what cost does playing exact on Elara?) remain opaque, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is named early and thematically present—"fate … not a solid line but a lattice of possibilities, each thread frayed by choice"—but it functions as metaphor rather than on-page mechanic. No beat shows Elara navigating multiple timelines, choosing between visible branches, or paying a price to alter a thread. The coffee stains hint at future-reading but don't dramatize perforation. Closure reprise ("threads snapping, possibilities blooming") is thematic echo, not causal driver. Functional metaphor but swappable with "forked path" or "branching fate." Mid-4 for thematic presence without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is signaled early ("accidentally telepathic … a quirk she'd hidden since childhood"), dramatized in the violin beat (plants scream "You are the fracture"), and enables the climax (vines tangle the father's ankles, holding him). Three-gate participation and visible causal role. However, the trait could be replaced with "controls vines" or "summons nature spirits" with minor edits—specificity (telepathy vs. control) doesn't alter tactics. The cost (plants sagging, voices quiet) is present but mild. Mid-6 for causal involvement with moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Propagate" appears in the plants' urging ("Propagate … before the promise loses its glow") and is echoed in "propagate the unraveling," but the climactic action Elara takes is *playing the violin*, not propagating seeds, ideas, or destinies in a visible way. If the story had shown her spreading the unraveling (teaching others, distributing shards of the violin, planting something), the verb would be indispensable. As written, the verb could be swapped for "unleash," "catalyze," or "trigger" without structural change. Present and thematically resonant but functionally replaceable. Mid-5 for one-beat thematic use without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Coffee-stain divination is signaled early ("habit … picked up from her grandmother"), used in the middle beat (stains form a map of ruins, woman with empty hands), and revisited at closure (stains now show woman walking away, future unwritten). Three-gate participation and the method's output shapes Elara's decision—she sees the cost of inaction (ruins, empty hands) and the reward of action (unwritten future). However, the mechanics are passive observation, not active struggle; she doesn't brew coffee, interpret ambiguous patterns under pressure, or risk misreading. The method could be replaced with tarot, mirror-scrying, or prophetic dreams with minor edits. Low-6 for three-beat presence with moderate causal weight and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is vividly described (purple fabric, midsummer twilight, domed roof) and anchors all action. Plants in the corner and the table with coffee stains supply tactical resources (plants bind father, stains guide choice). However, the setting itself—why an observatory? does the dome's astronomy function matter?—is largely atmospheric. It could be "velvet library" or "velvet conservatory" with equal effect. Mid-4 for vivid anchoring and plant-resource use, but core location swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" appears once, in the plants' urgency, but no clock is tracked. Midsummer twilight suggests a window, but we don't see light fading, Elara racing the dark, or a deadline forcing her hand. The father's arrival creates urgency, not the timeframe. The phrase is atmospheric but does not tighten tactics or alter the closure beat. Swappable with "before the chance is lost" or omittable. Low-3 for thematic mention without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dream-versus-empire motivation is dramatized on the page: Elara explicitly weighs ("She had come here to decide"), the empire is embodied in her father (warm voice, cold eyes, "The empire could not afford a fracture"), and the dream is her research into perforated destiny. Her choice to play the violin, knowing it will rupture the legacy, shows visible cost (father vanishes, future unwritten). The final line ("The dream had weighed more") confirms the friction and resolution. Strong causal role across setup, middle friction (father's arrival), and closure. Not 8.5+ because the empire's stakes remain abstract—no on-page consequence for the trade network or her material life, so the sacrifice feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" as a tone descriptor is evocative—muted sorrow, bruised beauty—and the prose sustains it: velvet twilight, frozen violin, "sound like cracking ice," "the promise loses its glow." Tone deepens at the climax (windows shatter, vines surge, father vanishes) and the quiet ending (plants sagging, woman walking away, slight smile) recaptures the ache. However, "mulberry" itself never appears on the page, and the ache could be equally well described as "dusky regret" or "twilight melancholy." Coherent and modulated tone, but the specific color metaphor is replaceable. Mid-6 for consistent atmospheric control without indispensable specificity.</comment>
