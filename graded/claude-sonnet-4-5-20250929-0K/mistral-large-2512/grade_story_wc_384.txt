<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lian's motivation is clear—preserving family honor through forgery—but her interior life relies heavily on symbolic objects (thorn, key) rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to "forgive the unfinished" arrives as a declared epiphany without prior dramatized ambivalence between revenge and release. Vey's presence forces a choice, but Lian's shift from revenge-adjacent anger to transcendent forgiveness lacks the messy, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation reads earned by setup but not by on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (calligraphy forger, marble sanctuary, aurora). The causal lens holds: Lian's years of preparation → Vey's arrival → key mechanism → scroll reveal → her choice to walk away. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she steps into light, freeing herself rather than destroying him, and the cost—forfeiting direct vengeance—is felt. One meaningful tightening when Vey confronts her narrows her options to revelation or continued hiding, and she chooses disclosure with restraint. The "door was never meant to be opened—only passed through" moment supplies conceptual repricing, though the metaphor leans abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites establish vivid atmosphere and appear in the closure image ("aurora pulsed," "stalactites dripped," "stepped into the light"). The rose thorn and key are handled tactilely. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (workbench, altar compartment), though Vey's approach and final positioning relative to Lian remain slightly vague. The setting charges the ending by framing her exit into light, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but some professional detail (how forgery tools work, ink mechanics) is gestural rather than specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the truth and freeing herself from the past—is signaled early and coheres. Vey's arrival narrows options (hide or reveal), and the key mechanism provides one meaningful reversal that changes tactics. The final choice—revelation without destruction—carries visible opportunity cost (she foregoes vengeance). However, Vey's non-reaction after the scroll reveal deflates expected escalation; his passivity ("he did not move") undercuts the promised confrontation. Agency is clear but the antagonist's collapse softens the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as the true crime, the key's paradox, the rose thorn's dual burden. "Treason was never the crime. Silence was" crystallizes without over-explaining. The ending image—stepping into light, leaving the past—offers a resonant answer to whether truth or personal freedom matters more. The "forgive the unfinished" phrase teeters on abstraction but is anchored by prior concrete struggle. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph; the stalactites' rhythm and aurora's pulse provide non-literal charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout. Diction is mostly controlled, though "poisoned honey," "cracking ice," and "shifting hues of violet and silver" approach stock lyricism. Vey's dialogue ("Truth is what I say it is") and Lian's replies carry distinct goals (evasion vs. assertion) with subtext. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice. The prose texture is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond Lian's exhausted, debt-worn interior (e.g., "calibrated, a necessary betrayal" reads more essayistic than immediate perception under pressure).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the opening/closing images anchor effectively. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "It was the only thing her father had left her" / "Proof that her family had once been loyal, that their treason had been calibrated" restate rather than advance; "unlinking herself from the past, from the girl who had believed" is near-synonym churn. "The key had no lock because the door was never meant to be opened—only passed through" is metaphorically muddy (a door one passes through is opened). Stock metaphor strings ("smooth as poisoned honey," "sound like cracking ice") and filter-verb stacks in reflective passages dull immediacy. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The calligraphy-forger premise and the key-with-no-lock mechanism offer fresh angles, and the moral calculus (truth vs. silence rather than simple revenge) avoids binary resolution. However, the "wronged artisan with a hidden compartment and a symbolic object" frame is a widely used template. The rose-thorn-into-key twist is clever but arrives late without prior mechanical hints, reducing inevitability. Emotional truth—choosing freedom over vengeance—feels authentic, yet the piece does not fully transform its template into irreplaceable specificity. Risk-taking is moderate; the quiet ending is apt but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lian's occupation (calligraphy forger) is established early and frames her skill set. Her final choice—revealing the scroll rather than using her forgeries to rewrite history further—constitutes one key turn. However, we do not see her forge on the page during the confrontation; the identity shapes setup and thematic resonance but does not constrain tactics in the climax. Present across beats, causally relevant at closure, but the mechanics of forgery itself do not alter the ending's options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rose thorn appears in three beats: beside the inkstone (description), in Lian's hand as she considers its purpose, and pressed into the key's shaft to unlock the mechanism. Its function evolves from memento to tool, and its return with reweighted meaning (enabling the key rather than drawing blood) charges the closure sequence. Meets setup, development, and payoff gates. The thorn's unique properties (size, brittleness, heritage) matter for the lock mechanism, elevating irreplaceability. However, the key's hollow shaft is introduced only when needed, reducing the thorn's earlier constraint pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named explicitly ("their treason had been calibrated, a necessary betrayal") and frames the backstory stakes. It informs Lian's motive (proving her family's loyalty despite betrayal) but does not generate on-page tactical friction or a choice between competing treasons. The concept resonates thematically but remains declarative rather than dramatized in a present dilemma. Present by first third, echoed at closure in "treason was never the crime," but does not constrain a live choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" is mentioned once in the phrase "wisely enduring the uncertainty" regarding the key. The adverb labels patience but does not show a visible cost of that endurance (missed opportunities, mounting frustration) or enable a tactical advantage in the confrontation. The trait is told rather than demonstrated through multiple pressured moments. Present as a theme marker but does not constrain an on-page action with felt tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unlink" appears in "unlinking herself from the past, from the girl who had believed." The metaphor describes her internal arc and frames the closure image (stepping into light, leaving the past). However, the action is abstract; no on-page moment shows her severing a literal or metaphorical chain. The concept shapes theme and resonates in the ending, but could be replaced with "release," "sever," or "abandon" without structural loss. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The key is introduced early ("A key with no apparent lock rested in her palm"), carried for years, and its mechanics drive the climax when the rose thorn unlocks the hidden compartment. The mystery ("you'll know") shapes Lian's waiting and the key's resolution provides the decisive turn that enables the scroll's revelation. The method is signaled, its properties (hollow shaft, worn teeth) matter, and it participates directly in closure. Meets all three gates and demonstrates high causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and altar with hidden compartment are anchored early and recur in the closure image. The altar's mechanism (revealed by the key) is essential to the plot turn. The setting's atmospheric qualities (cold air, dripping rhythm, shifting light) modulate tone and charge the final image. However, the space does not constrain Lian's choices (she could have confronted Vey elsewhere) beyond providing the altar; it enriches rather than pressures. Strong payoff and closure linkage; moderate causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" is repeated in the opening and closing lines, establishing slow, rhythmic time. The dripping recurs ("stalactites dripped their slow, steady rhythm") to frame the ending. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; there is no clock pressure during the confrontation, and elapsed time remains vague. The element functions as tonal motif and lyric bracket but does not alter tactics or force tempo. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance; minimal escalation constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is declared explicitly in dialogue ("I'm here to forgive the unfinished") and frames the closure choice. The desire is dramatized in her decision to reveal the scroll without destroying Vey, demonstrating restraint and prioritizing her own freedom. However, the phrase arrives late (final third) without prior on-page friction between forgiveness and revenge; the internal conflict is summarized rather than shown in contradictory micro-choices. Present at closure with felt cost, but late signal and limited earlier development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" appears in the opening line and the aurora's "violet and silver" hues recur at closure. The tone—lyric, restrained, luminous—remains coherent and modulates subtly (coldness and tension during confrontation, pulsing light at release). The twilight palette charges the final image ("stepped into the light"). However, "pearl" itself does not reappear and the tone occasionally conflicts with the high-stakes confrontation, trending decorative in the middle. Strong setup and payoff; moderate pressure modulation.</comment>
