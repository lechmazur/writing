<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never tested against competing desires or meaningful cost. Her interior reads as exposition-heavy rather than embodied contradiction; phrases like "obliging sky mechanic" and "delusions of grandeur" feel like labels rather than lived experience. The final choice to pull the lever lacks prior friction—no visible trade-off between scientific curiosity and station safety materializes on the page. The laugh at the end gestures toward emotional complexity but arrives without the groundwork of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Elara pulling the lever and glimpsing sideways moments—qualifies as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost remains abstract: alarms blare and the AI "demands an explanation," yet no concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing appears on the page. The nexus collapse and xenos stirring gesture toward consequence without dramatizing a price that alters Elara's options. The lens holds through because/therefore linkage (adjustment → nexus pulse → lever → vision → collapse) but the final cost is told rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent algae, thermal regulator, and observation deck glass provide concrete spatial grounding. "Mechanically warm" air—a paradox of cold metal and organic heat—constrains Elara's sensory experience and charges the atmosphere. The holographic interface and its shifting light patterns return at the closure beat, reweighting the nexus interaction. However, the station's corridors and containment chambers receive generic treatment; no spatial constraint forces a tactical choice, and the xenos' wings function more as thematic decoration than setting-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and drives the nexus interaction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lever appears and Elara reaches through the hologram, narrowing her options to act or retreat. Yet the escalation lacks a visible price: the station shudders, alarms sound, but no on-page consequence forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. The xenos' synchronized response and collapsing nexus complicate without landing a felt cost. Agency is present (Elara overrides safety protocols, pulls the lever) but the resolution reads as spectacle rather than a choice with legible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—time's lateral motion, the xenos as timekeepers—emerges from imagery (wings, nexus, sideways glimpses) rather than stated thesis. The final image of Elara as the mechanic who "set it all in motion" offers a resonant answer to her obsession, reweighting her role from tinkerer to catalyst. However, the vision of the abandoned station and overgrown vines arrives without prior particular grounding; the thematic payoff leans on abstraction ("clock no human had ever understood") rather than concrete embodied cost. The laugh—"half wonder, half despair"—gestures toward complexity but lacks the friction of prior micro-choices that would charge it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature—mechanic's precision, focus on thermal regulators and frequency syncing—establishes a distinct filter. Phrases like "shimmering distortion in the air, like heat haze given form" and "hush so profound it felt like the universe itself was holding its breath" show purposeful compression and lyric reach. However, diction slips into elevated register ("delusions of grandeur," "lateral logic") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The prose maintains single-POV focus with no head-hopping, and the final laugh lands as an embodied micro-choice, but the lexicon doesn't fully cohere under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the quiet unfolding of something vast and unseen," "ripples on water," "the pendulums of a clock no human had ever understood" stack figurative language without teaching a pattern or landing causal precision. Paraphrase loops appear ("pressed her palm against the control panel, initiating the holographic interface. The projection flickered to life") and template cadence runs flatten momentum ("She reached... She had seen... She adjusted"). The nexus collapse sequence—alarms, AI demands, Elara's trembling hands—narrates reaction without information density. No sentence-level artifact obscures the closure beat itself, but density sags across the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The sideways-time premise and holographic lever offer a fresh angle on temporal SF, but execution leans on familiar beats: lone scientist overrides safety protocols, glimpses forbidden knowledge, triggers consequences. The xenos-as-timekeepers twist arrives late and remains underdeveloped; their wings emit a hum, but no prior particular grounds the reveal. Elara's laugh and the vision of the abandoned station gesture toward synthesis, yet the core arc—curiosity → transgression → revelation—reads as template rather than inevitable transformation. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material beyond competent genre execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (obliging sky mechanic) frames the story and makes the lever-pull choice, but "obliging" never constrains or complicates a beat on the page—she overrides protocols without friction. Her mechanic role supplies the thermal regulator and holographic interface, functional but swappable with "scientist" or "engineer." The closure hinges on her action, earning mid-band presence, but the character trait itself does not drive a key turn or create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight appears early (setup), is manipulated via holographic interface in the middle (development), and collapses at closure (payoff). It enables the lever's appearance and the sideways vision, making it essential to two beats. However, its mechanics remain abstract—"electromagnetic field aligned with the station's own"—and it could be swapped for another technobabble anomaly without altering character stakes. The nexus shapes outcome but lacks irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" titles the closure beat—the station shudders, xenos stir, vision unfolds—but the concept functions as post-hoc theme rather than a constraint that narrows options. The xenos' awakening is described ("wings twitching in unison") without forcing a tactical choice or visible cost. Present at closure and thematically resonant, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" air appears twice: observation deck atmosphere and the nexus environment. It colors sensory texture and charges the setting, but does not constrain an action or enable a choice with cost. The attribute enriches tone without altering tactics, landing in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lever is introduced in the middle third, dramatized at closure (Elara reaches through hologram, brushes its edge), and triggers the vision and nexus collapse. Removing it breaks the closure's physical anchor. However, it appears late (~60% mark) and resolves a problem (proving time moves sideways) it did not help create earlier. Strong causal role and closure linkage, but late entry and no prior seeding cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" is signaled early (holographic interface, projection) and used to manipulate the nexus without direct touch. It enables Elara's interaction and returns at closure when the projection fails. The method matters to one key beat and appears in setup/payoff, but its mechanics are generic SF handwaving—frequency syncing and light patterns could be replaced with any remote interface. Functional across two gates, but swappable specificity limits elevation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station frames all action (setup), supplies the xenos and containment chambers (middle), and its systems drain the nexus energy at closure (payoff). The station constrains Elara's access (observation deck strongest nexus point) and provides the organic/mechanical atmosphere, but no spatial layout forces a tactical choice. Present across all three gates and causally linked to closure, but lacks the micro-setting pressure that would drive higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" appears as atmospheric texture (xenos' low-frequency hum, "universe holding its breath") but never tightens a decision. The timeframe is vague—"tonight," "when the gas giant's electromagnetic field aligned"—with no live clock that alters moves. The wings stir at closure, but the temporal window does not constrain Elara's actions. Ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to prove that time moves sideways" is declared early, drives her nexus interaction, and lands at closure when she glimpses sideways moments and laughs at the weight of truth. The desire shapes two beats (interface adjustment, lever pull) and connects to the ending's thematic charge. However, the motivation faces no on-page friction—no competing desire or cost dramatized before the lever pull—so it remains told rather than tested. Strong presence and closure linkage, but lack of embodied conflict caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is legible in "mechanically warm" air (cold metal + organic heat), the nexus's shimmering distortion, and Elara's fog on glass. The tone modulates from quiet efficiency to subdued awe ("shuddered, not with violence, but with quiet unfolding") and charges the final laugh ("half wonder, half despair"). However, "icy" is less present than warm/organic textures, and the paradox does not tighten under peak pressure—the alarm sequence drops the tonal control. Functional across setup and ending with partial payoff, but inconsistent execution in middle beats.</comment>
