<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is coherent and embodied through concrete detail (the vial, rebreather checks, oxygen gauge). Interior contradiction appears when she kneels beside the diver—torn between salvage instinct and the temple's pull—but the final choice to uncork the vial feels slightly undercooked; we see her gaze flick to it without a dramatized moment of competing impulses. The diver's fragmentary speech and the temple's memory-touching create pressure, though the diver remains more atmospheric than a full secondary character. Emotional progression from isolation to offering is legible but could carry sharper cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Lira, submersible, temple approach). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the gathered hush deepens through sensory layers (silence, incense taste, memory fragments) and the vial's uncorking provides a decisive tightening that reweights the premise. Closure lands on the page—the diver dissolves, the hush shifts from oppressive to vast, Lira turns to leave—with felt cost (the vial emptied, connection to her mother spent). The causal link between offering the perfume and sating the hush is economically earned, though the mechanics of "unsnarl… with instinct" remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: coral-encrusted spires, mosaic floor, statues with outstretched hands, and the ceiling lost in darkness. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lira's urgency (oxygen gauge, rebreather seal, the taste of incense). The perfume vial functions as micro-setting/object-as-setting, constraining her final choice and charging the closure image when its scent spills out. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the temple's architecture guides movement from threshold to corridor to final chamber. The setting pressures choice directly: the abyss and oxygen limit create a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survive and answer the distress signal—is signaled early and tightens through the oxygen gauge, the diver's fragmented instruction, and the temple's resistance. One meaningful turn occurs when Lira shifts from attempting to "harness" the hush to offering something true (the vial). Agency is clear: her decision to uncork the vial forecloses her mother's gift and resolves the conflict. Cost is legible (the empty vial, the diver's dissolution) but the trade-off could feel sharper if we saw Lira hesitate longer or weigh competing uses for the perfume. No antagonist required; the temple's gathered hush provides coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the ephemeral cannot be harnessed by force, only met with authentic offering. The vial's scent—"familiar, aching, alive"—and its role in sating the hush avoid overt moralizing. The final image (statues bowing, the sea releasing her) offers a resonant answer without a stated thesis. However, the diver's instruction "not with force—with instinct" edges toward thematic echo, and the line "The ephemeral was no longer a thing to be harnessed, but a force to be met, understood" risks summarizing the theme rather than letting the image carry it alone. The abyss and memories motif accumulates pressure but doesn't fully transform meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Lira's urgency and isolation. Perceptual signature is character-specific: technical details (rebreather, life support hum, oxygen gauge) anchor her salvage-diver lens. Psychic distance tightens effectively in the final chamber. The prose carries a distinct texture—"salt-laced dark," "honeyed poison," "motes of light"—that modulates with pressure. Free indirect style is clean in the diver's telepathic speech; the italicized lines read as the temple "filling in the gaps" without head-hopping. Minor slips: "loneliness gnawed at her ribs like a starving thing" leans slightly ornamental, and the final paragraph's "The abyss would remember her" edges toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly strong: rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high. The opening line ("distress signal pulsed through the abyss like a dying heartbeat") anchors voice and stakes. However, several figurative clusters risk overwriting: "jagged spires… slicing through the gloom," "honeyed poison," "threads from a tapestry," and "moth to flame" appear in quick succession without pattern-teaching. The phrase "starving thing" (twice: "gnawed… like a starving thing," "distress signal… dying heartbeat") and "liquid starlight" edge toward stock metaphor. Paraphrase loop: "The gathered hush was no myth. She felt it the moment she crossed the threshold" restates without added pressure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but density dips slightly in the middle paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The underwater-temple premise and memory-touching hush are familiar genre elements, but the vial-as-offering twist provides a fresh inflection. The transformation test is borderline: swapping the vial for another heirloom (locket, letter) would require minor edits but might work structurally. Emotional specificity (the mother's gift, Lira's isolation) grounds the arc. The diver's role as instructor and the temple's sentience echo established tropes without strong subversion. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric register and sensory density elevate the material, but the core turn—offering something precious to sate a hungry force—is well-trodden. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The distress signal sender (the diver) is present in setup (signal pulsed for three days), development (transmitter blinking, instruction given), and payoff (body dissolves after Lira acts). The diver enables Lira's final choice by providing the instruction "not with force—with instinct," which shifts her approach. However, the diver's agency is limited; they do not make a choice that creates a turn, only deliver exposition. The dissolution reads as atmospheric consequence rather than causal pressure tied to the sender's prior decisions. Two gates met (setup, payoff), middle instruction is functional but passive. Swappability: the diver could be replaced with a recorded message or temple echo with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in setup (thigh-weight, mother's gift, liquid starlight, never opened), development (Lira's gaze flicks to it when the diver instructs her), and payoff (she uncorks it; scent spills; the hush recoils and surges; the vial is emptied). It constrains her final choice—offering the vial forecloses her connection to home—and charges the closure image when the scent acts as the key. Specificity is high: "liquid starlight," "scent of home across any distance," and the physical detail (cold against her thigh) make it irreplaceable. Cost is visible: she closes her fingers around the empty vial. Three beats: initial mention, mid-scene consideration, climactic use. Causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gathered hush is present in setup (temple's reputation, "where the sea itself seemed to hold its breath"), development (silence muffles life support, air tastes of incense, the hush as "a current… of what could have been"), and payoff (the hush recoils then surges toward the perfume, shifts from oppressive to vast). It shapes stakes by threatening to swallow Lira and constrains tactics—she must "unsnarl" it rather than overpower it. However, the mechanics of how it operates remain slightly abstract; the diver's explanation feels more told than dramatized. The hush participates in closure (recoiling, sighing) but its exact transformation is conveyed through summary ("no longer oppressive but vast") rather than a concrete image. Two strong gates (setup, payoff), middle beat is expository.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute "touches memories" appears in setup (temple "pulling [memories] from the depths of the past like threads"), development (Lira perceives fragments—laughter, child's steps, lover's promise—while moving through the corridor), and payoff (the perfume's scent as memory enables the hush to be sated). It constrains Lira's understanding and primes her final choice—realizing the temple feeds on memories leads her to offer the vial. However, the memory-touching is mostly perceptual; Lira does not make a mid-scene choice based on it until the very end. The cost is conceptual (understanding shifts her tactic) rather than a visible trade-off. Three gates met, but middle beat is observational rather than action-forcing. Swappability: "touches emotions" or "feeds on loss" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "unsnarl" is signaled in development (the diver instructs, "You have to unsnarl it. Not with force—with instinct") and executed in payoff (Lira uncorks the vial, the scent causes the hush to recoil and surge, the temple sighs). It redefines Lira's approach from "harness" to "meet," driving the major turn. However, the action's mechanics are vague—"unsnarl" is used once as instruction and once as summary ("not by overpowering the hush, but by offering something true"), without a clear on-page dramatization of the unsnarling process. The perfume-uncorking is concrete, but whether that act constitutes "unsnarling" or simply offering/sating is ambiguous. Two gates (development instruction, payoff attempt), setup absent. Cost is visible (vial emptied) but tied more to the offering than to the unsnarling itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The method "by overriding instinct" is signaled obliquely in the diver's instruction: "Not with force—with instinct. Let it guide you." This phrasing suggests following instinct rather than overriding it, creating a contradiction. If the intent was that Lira must override her salvage-instinct (to analyze, control) and instead trust intuition, that internal conflict is not dramatized; we do not see her wrestle with competing impulses on the page. The vial choice feels guided by realization rather than an override of ingrained habit. The method's mechanics do not shape attempts or tactics in the middle; it appears only in the diver's line and is summarized at closure without visible struggle. One gate (development mention), but the execution contradicts the stated method. Swappability high; "by trusting intuition" would fit the text better with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is present in setup (distress signal origin, reputation, depths), development (threshold, corridor with statues, mosaic floor, final chamber with pedestal), and payoff (statues bow, the sea releases Lira). It pressures choices directly: the abyss and depth create the oxygen constraint; the temple's layout guides movement; the pedestal centers the diver and vial action. Micro-setting specifics—coral-encrusted spires, the silence, the incense taste, the cracked helmet—charge the atmosphere and constrain Lira's options (she cannot linger; the environment is hostile). The temple's sentience (statues bowing, the hush as entity) is irreplaceable; no other setting would allow the memory-touching premise. Three gates met, strong causal pressure, high specificity, and closure linkage (statues' gratitude, the sea's release).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "as time runs short" is present in setup (three days following the signal), development (oxygen gauge flickers, red needle toward danger, "minutes, maybe less"), and payoff (the resolution occurs before Lira's air runs out; she turns to leave, implying survival). It tightens decisions—Lira cannot explore thoroughly or hesitate long—and the oxygen constraint is tracked across beats (rebreather seal, gauge check, ragged breath). However, the exact elapsed time within the temple is vague; we do not feel the clock ticking beat-by-beat. The final action (uncorking, hush recoiling, diver dissolving) compresses into a "heartbeat," and the aftermath ("As she turned to leave") suggests time remains, softening the urgency. Three gates met, but the live-clock pressure is stronger in setup than in payoff. Cost connection moderate: time spent underwater is irreversible, but Lira's survival mutes the price.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is present in setup (the diver's goal: "I tried to harness it, to pull the ephemeral into something solid. But it fought me") and reappears in payoff summary ("The ephemeral was no longer a thing to be harnessed, but a force to be met"). However, this motivation belongs to the prior diver, not Lira; Lira's dominant want is to answer the distress signal and survive. The theme of harnessing versus meeting is told rather than dramatized through Lira's choices—she does not attempt to harness the hush on the page, so the shift to "meeting" it lacks on-page friction. The desire is abstract and not conflicted in action; we do not see Lira wrestle with the impulse to control versus release. One gate (mentioned in development, summarized at payoff), but setup and middle struggle are absent. Swappability high: Lira's arc works without the harness/meet language.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone "lonesome splendor" is established in setup ("salt-laced dark," "loneliness gnawed at her ribs," the vial as "liquid starlight") and sustained through development ("gathered hush," "incense and forgotten vows," memories of sunlit courtyards and whispered promises). It modulates with pressure: the silence becomes "thick" and oppressive, then shifts to "vast, like the space between stars" at payoff. The final image—statues bowing, the abyss remembering, the sea releasing—charges the tone with gratitude and release, blending isolation with grandeur. However, a few phrases ("honeyed poison," "motes of light") edge toward decorative rather than tonal necessity, and the splendor occasionally overpowers the loneliness (the temple's beauty risks postcard effect). Three gates met, coherent modulation, and strong closure charge, but minor tonal drift in middle beats.</comment>
