<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tuner's infinitely patient stance is embodied through methodical pacing and ritualistic gestures (striking the fork, walking patterns), though his interiority remains largely opaque—we observe craft without contradiction or internal struggle. The character's emotional landscape is more gestural than visceral; phrases like "the tuner smiled" tell rather than embody affect. The final departure forecloses further engagement with visible cost (he leaves, the work is done), meeting the Earned Stasis threshold, but the choice feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page conflict. No secondary character pressure tests the protagonist's resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (cryptic tuner, Hollow's End, dusk arrival, archway) land within the first ~100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rhythmic intensification across seven days builds density and pressure until the final shimmer of light reconfigures the town's state with cost (the tuner's departure, the town "listening" rather than restored). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the tuner completes his ritual and leaves, foreclosing keeper status) with conceptual cost legible in "not restored, not truly." One meaningful deepening—day three's *click-click* breakthrough—tightens the pattern. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway functions as fulcrum and resonance gate, pressuring the tuner's movements and charging the final hum; the cobblestones track his ritual pacing and shimmer at closure, constraining method and elevating the ending image. Sensory detail is filtered through craft expertise (patina, tines, vibration, shimmer) and selective—dust motes, wind, stone texture—without catalog bloat. The "fault line…of time" and the town's spatial grid (three steps north, seven east) guide the tuner's choices on the page. Micro-setting (ebony fork, cobblestones, archway) shapes both tactic and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore resonance to enable the town's echo-memory—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Pressure accumulates via density and cadence (day one silence, day three *click-click*, day five full murmur, day seven shimmer), consistent with the Accumulative lens, though the tuner faces no opposition or forced trade-off. The final act (seventh strike, light shimmer, departure) narrows options by foreclosing keeper status with visible cost: the town listens but is "not restored, not truly." Agency reads as endurance and calibration rather than decisive pivot. One meaningful deepening (day-three breakthrough) tightens the pattern; no explicit antagonist or reversal is required under this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—balance as rhythm, restoration as listening rather than rebuilding—emerges through the tuner's patient calibration and the final non-literal shimmer of footsteps without bodies. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration: the town is "listening" with a steady heartbeat, reweighting "restoration" from material to sonic memory without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the gap between what is rebuilt (nothing physical) and what is restored (rhythmic presence). The repeated motif of striking the fork and walking patterns charges the closure image; the tuner's departure ("some balances…needed no keeper") denies tidy resolution with conceptual cost. No sermonizing or prompt-echo intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited distance remains stable; the narrator tracks the tuner's perception and craft without head-hopping. Diction is controlled and ornate ("cloak the color of old bruises," "wild hush," "shimmer that traced the paths") with consistent elevation fitting a fable register, though some constructions ("he believed," "he knew") lean toward filter verbs without voice-specific justification. Perceptual signature is consistent—craft-focused, attuned to vibration and rhythm—though the tuner's internal texture remains somewhat generic. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression (seven-day montage, ellipsis of meals/sleep) serves the Accumulative lens and remains legible. Minor register consistency slips (e.g., "infinitely patient" as narrator assertion rather than dramatized trait) do not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the archway, longer reflection on past towns, clipped action on day seven), and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in ritual beats ("three steps north, turn, seven steps east") but some scaffolding persists: "The tuner was infinitely patient" tells rather than shows through pacing; "a faint, rhythmic *click-click*" and "the murmur of voices, the clatter of carts" list rather than compress. Figurative language ("cloak the color of old bruises," "silence deepened, as if the town were holding its breath") is purposeful but occasionally stacks without added pressure. No paraphrase loops or major template cadence runs. One minor artifact: "he believed" / "he knew" / "he understood" filter-verb cluster in paragraph four adds slight drag but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—ghost town revival via sonic tuning of footsteps—transforms familiar restoration tropes through specificity of method (ebony fork, rhythmic pacing, temporal fault line) and a non-obvious moral calculus (restoration as listening, not rebuilding). The ending's shimmer and departure feel earned in hindsight by the seven-day accumulation and the tuner's stated ethos. Fresh inflections: "echoes could be coaxed back into song," "wild hush," and the final reconfiguration (town "listening" rather than inhabited). Some phrasing risks fable-template smoothness ("the last bell tuner," "the tuner smiled," "his work here was done"), and the tuner's cryptic backstory ("he had come before the collapse") gestures toward depth without full dramatization. The synthesis is specific and coherent, though not radically unconventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character present from first line; drives all key beats (arrival, archway touch, day-three pacing match, final strike, departure). Choices include walking the market pattern, matching phantom stride, and leaving once balance is restored—each alters tactics and stakes. Cryptic stance is maintained through sparse dialogue and opaque motive depth, fitting the role. Closure hinges on his decision to leave, foreclosing keeper status with cost. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability high (no generic restorer could replace the bell-tuner specificity).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ebony fork introduced early (paragraph two), used in multiple beats (struck twice at archway, again in square, final strike on day seven), and charges the closure image by producing the shimmer. Its worn tines signal history; its note triggers the cobblestones' response. The fork's mechanics matter: striking, holding the note, packing it away. All three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure participation direct. Swappability low—another tool would lack the sonic/bell-tuning resonance. Slight deduction: mid-scene use is more repetitive than evolving.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival frames the dominant stake from the first paragraph and shapes all tactics (listening for echoes, matching phantom strides, producing shimmer of invisible feet). The concept is not merely thematic but causal: without the ghost-echo premise, the tuner's methods would be unmotivated. All three gates met; causal pressure high; closure participation direct (town "listening," not restored materially). Specificity high—revival via rhythm distinguishes this from generic restoration. Cost legible: the town remains unpeopled, and the tuner leaves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Infinitely patient is stated once ("The tuner was infinitely patient") and demonstrated through pacing (seven days, "didn't rush," "let the echoes come"). The trait enables the gradualist method and constrains any rapid-fix tactic, though it is more a stance than a source of on-page friction or cost. Setup present; development via montage pacing; closure linkage indirect (patience allows completion). Swappability moderate—"methodical" or "unhurried" could substitute with minor edits. Label-only assertion in paragraph five lowers the score; embodied patience in action partially recovers it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rebuild (via rhythm, not walls) is signaled in paragraph two, pursued across all beats (walking patterns, matching strides, final strike), and culminates in the shimmer and departure. The action is not physical reconstruction but sonic calibration, which is thematically central and causally necessary. All three gates met; causal pressure high; closure participation direct. Swappability low—another verb (restore, repair) would alter meaning. Slight deduction: the action is distributed across montage rather than concentrated in a single decisive beat, reducing felt intensity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Footsteps-on-cobblestones method is seeded early ("footsteps of the past might return"), demonstrated in the market-pattern walk (paragraph four), matched to phantom *click-click* on day three, and produces the golden shimmer of "invisible feet" at closure. The method shapes attempts (precise pacing, scuffing stones) and is irreplaceable—no other means would invoke the ghostly pedestrian memory. All three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure participation direct and specific. High irreplaceability and cost connection (shimmer depends on this exact method).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ancient archway introduced in paragraph one, identified as "fulcrum" of the temporal fault line in paragraph three, and hums when the tuner passes beneath it (paragraph five); it frames his departure at closure. The archway supplies the resonance gate and pressures the tuner's initial palm-press and final walk-through. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate to strong; closure participation direct. Swappability low—another structure would lack the fulcrum/portal specificity. Slight deduction: mid-scene use is more atmospheric than tactically binding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "before the collapse" is stated in paragraph two as backstory context (the tuner visited before the mines ran dry). It does not tighten on-page decisions or create a deadline; the seven-day montage operates at the tuner's chosen pace without urgency. Setup present (paragraph two); no middle development that constrains choice; no closure participation. Swappability high—"after the collapse" or "decades later" would alter theme but not the on-page mechanics. The temporal frame is ornamental to the present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Restore shared balance is stated early ("the balance that had once made Hollow's End a place of laughter and trade") and pursued through all beats (tuning stones, matching rhythms, final shimmer). The motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between competing wants or costs until the departure, when the tuner leaves rather than stays as keeper. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear (balance achieved, tuner departs). Swappability moderate—"revive" or "awaken" could substitute with minor thematic shift. Friction is low; the tuner never wavers or doubts.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wild hush is named in paragraph four ("A wild hush settled over Hollow's End"), modulates through silence deepening (day one), phantom sounds emerging (day three–five), and the final shimmer and whisper at closure. The tone charges the ending by sustaining paradox: quiet that is alive, emptiness that listens. Coherence is strong; modulation is purposeful (stillness → faint echo → full murmur → shimmer). Closure participation direct: the stones "whispered," and the tuner does not look back. Specificity high—"wild hush" is less generic than "eerie quiet." Minor deduction: the phrase appears once as label; the effect is sustained more through description than recurring anchor.</comment>
