<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity and risk-taking are shown through concrete choices (borrowing goggles, deciphering the diary, entering the captain's quarters). The final decision to leave the goggles and diary behind is earned, though her shift from "seeking answers" to acceptance feels slightly quick given her prior intensity. The captain's grief is handled with specificity through the sketches and cracked goggles. Interior moments occasionally lean toward explanation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira renounces further intrusion with visible cost ("some secrets were not hers to unfold"). Orientation is clear by line 3. The piece follows a situational lens—pressure accumulates through discovery rather than because/therefore chains—and the final image of the captain tracing sketches charges the ending. However, the cipher's resolution ("held the diary up to the window") arrives conveniently without prior setup of the method, weakening causal earning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira realizes the diary is a love letter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire, frosted windows, and ice-slicked floor create atmospheric constraint and charge the captain's isolation. The goggles' "scent of engine oil and salt" and the model airship provide texture. The elevator's mechanical presence brackets the story effectively. However, the tenth floor and the captain's quarters function more as backdrop than active constraint on Lira's choices—she moves freely through the space without spatial pressure limiting her agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to unfold the captain's secret—is clear and tightens when Lira realizes the diary's true nature. The captain's interruption creates one pressure point that tests Lira's commitment. The resolution through renunciation is legible with felt cost (leaving the goggles, walking away). However, escalation is mild: the captain's "You always were too curious" doesn't substantially raise the cost beyond what Lira already felt internally, and no persistent constraint shapes her final choice beyond moral intuition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of boundaries around grief and the cost of curiosity emerges through concrete beats: the locked diary, the scattered light revelation, the goggles as relics. The final image of the captain tracing sketches with tenderness answers the central question through action rather than statement. "Some things aren't meant to be unfolded" risks thematic echo but is delivered by the captain in dialogue, not narrator summary. The story resists tidy resolution while maintaining emotional clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable throughout; Lira's perceptual filter (noticing the cook's shaking hands, the captain's false laughter) establishes her warmly inquisitive nature. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—the captain's lines carry subtext and avoid exposition. However, several phrases drift into elevated register inconsistent with a servant's interior voice: "shrine to flight," "jagged patterns," "sacred," "indifferent to the weight of these revelations." The prose occasionally explains rather than trusts dramatization ("This diary, though, felt different. It wasn't just another puzzle; it was a promise.").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, with good sentence variety and momentum through most beats. However, line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She had come here seeking answers, but now she wondered if she was intruding on something sacred" after the prior beat already established this); template cadence in the opening elevator sequence; and stock phrasing ("heart ache," "breath caught," "eyes flickered"). The phrase "joy beneath anguish" repeats without variation across three uses. The climactic beat where Lira deciphers the diary is clean and propulsive, limiting closure damage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire and steampunk-inflected setting offer atmospheric detail, but the core premise—a servant discovers her superior's tragic secret and must decide whether to intrude—follows familiar contours without significant transformation. The scattered-light cipher resolution and the airship-crash backstory are serviceable genre moves. Freshness emerges in the restrained ending that resists sentimental reconciliation, and the goggles' dual function (relic and evidence) shows specificity. The emotional truth of respecting grief's boundaries elevates execution above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's servant status frames her initial hesitation and the power dynamic with the captain, and her "ascending for years" establishes both literal and social mobility as context. However, her specific position as "personal aide" does little causal work—the story would function identically if she were any curious subordinate. Her final choice to leave is driven by empathy, not by role-based constraint or cost tied to her servant status.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The goggles appear in the opening (around Lira's collarbone), are handled when she removes them at the end, and their "cracked lenses" link causally to the captain's crash and lost daughter. The oil-and-salt scent provides sensory specificity. The goggles anchor two beats and participate in closure when Lira unclasps them, making them a charged offering. However, they remain more symbolic marker than active tool—Lira never uses them functionally, and their removal doesn't alter the captain's response on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The diary drives the central action: its appearance prompts Lira's intrusion, its cipher creates the puzzle, and its revelation (sketches of the daughter) delivers the emotional core. The diary is present in setup, middle discovery, and closure when Lira places it on the desk and the captain picks it up. However, "encrypted" oversells the mechanism—the cipher resolves through a single sunlight angle without prior failed attempts or tactical shifts, reducing the stakes of "discovery" to one convenient move.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is demonstrated through Lira noticing the cook's trembling hands and the captain's false laughter, and it motivates her entry into the quarters and her impulse to decipher the diary. The trait enables her core choices. However, it never constrains her or imposes visible cost—her curiosity leads to discovery without misstep or trade-off. The final renunciation arises from empathy, not from her inquisitiveness being tested or checked by consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears three times: Lira's intention "to unfold its meaning," the captain's warning "some things aren't meant to be unfolded," and the final reflection "some things were meant to remain folded." The action structures the thematic question and provides verbal through-line. However, the literal unfolding act (holding the diary to light) is brief and singular, not iterative or escalating. The metaphorical weight does more work than the physical action, and other verbs (reveal, decipher, intrude) could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is realized when Lira angles the diary to the window and sun refracts through ice, resolving the cipher into sketches. The method is specific and visually rendered. However, it appears only once, late (past midpoint), without prior setup or failed attempts. No earlier beat signals that light or windows might be key, so the method feels provided rather than earned. The mechanics don't shape Lira's tactics or constrain her approach—it succeeds on first try.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire provides atmospheric isolation and the ten-floor elevator climb creates temporal progression. The frosted windows enable the scattered-light revelation, giving the setting one functional beat. The cold and ice-slicked floor add texture. However, the setting mostly frames rather than pressures—Lira's choices aren't constrained by altitude, cold, or access. The spire's verticality and the "world kept moving" metaphor provide thematic resonance but don't alter tactics or outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The elevator's ten-floor ascent is named early, and the story returns to elevator imagery at the captain's arrival and Lira's departure, bracketing the action. However, the timeframe isn't tracked or felt as constraint—no sense of urgency or dwindling time pressures Lira's choices. The floors themselves vanish after the opening; we never know at which floor events occur or how long remains. The frame is more structural marker than live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" motivates Lira's question to the captain ("what if joy is hiding beneath the pain?") and structures her interpretive lens on the diary. The motivation is stated early in exposition and returns at the climax in dialogue. However, it's more announced than dramatized through conflicting impulses—Lira doesn't face a scene-level cost or trade-off between seeking joy and respecting boundaries. Her empathy resolves the tension cleanly rather than through friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is present in the narrator's observational distance (Lira's noticing, the measured description of the captain's grief) combined with warmth toward both characters. The tone holds through turns without sentimentality or coldness. However, it remains relatively static—there's no modulation under pressure or tonal shift that charges the final image distinctly. The ending's restraint fits the tone but doesn't deepen or crack it, making tone a consistent backdrop rather than an active force.</comment>
