<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand his father's cryptic legacy drives his investigation, but his interior remains thin—we get fact-retrieval more than embodied contradiction. The final choice ("Then let's play it") arrives without visible internal conflict or cost; he agrees too smoothly. The woman's arrival feels like a plot service rather than a crucible that forces Elias to weigh competing loyalties. Linus is vivid in backstory but remains a sketch; Elias never dramatizes what transposing his own life would cost him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal (Elias finds clue → decodes microdot → woman arrives with demand). Orientation anchors arrive late: lighthouse job motive unclear until the fortune cookie, and the 1987 storm reference feels like a convenient clue rather than earned causality. The closure unit—Elias agreeing to "play" the new key—reads as Charged Poise, but the cost is asserted ("orchestrated this") rather than shown; we don't see what Elias forfeits or risks by handing over the specs. The "originals" twist arrives unearned (no prior signal that multiples exist), weakening causal linkage at the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse beam refraction and Fresnel lens directly enable the discovery (loose stone where light bends), satisfying the micro-setting constraint. Blackthorn Isle's fog, rocks, and solitary pub anchor mood and guide Elias's isolation. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, keeper's quarters, shore). The island itself remains postcard-level—rocky, fogged—without pressure beyond access; the beam's optics do the causal work, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the hidden specs and understand Linus's design. The discovery of the microdot (loose stone) narrows options, but Elias faces no visible trade-off—he simply accepts the woman's framing. The woman's arrival introduces external pressure, yet Elias's compliance feels frictionless; no dramatized choice between protecting the secret and fulfilling his father's plan. One meaningful tightening (microdot → photo → woman) is present, but the final turn lacks visible cost or agency under stress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of "transposing life into a new key" and "open secrets" emerges through Linus's fortune-cookie espionage and the lighthouse's refracting light. The metaphor is overt (Linus's "favorite word," final dialogue echo) rather than earned through image alone. The microdot and beam refraction offer concrete particulars, but the ending's "let's play it" line states theme rather than imaging it. The story resists moralizing yet leans on music-as-life allegory more than subtext would allow at the highest bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV Elias with stable third-limited distance and a clean perceptual signature (salt on rocks, beam as metronome). Dialogue between Elias and the woman carries goal-driven subtext and distinct rhythms. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The woman's voice feels slightly generic ("Because the song's changing") compared to Elias's texture, and peak-moment diction ("orchestrated this") edges toward exposition. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent; the piece demonstrates controlled focalization under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short crisis beats, longer reflective blocks on Linus). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. "The beam above him swept the horizon, but his mind was on the microdot specs" balances image and interiority cleanly. Minor scaffold: "like seeds carried by the wind" and "like a metronome counting time no one else could hear" feel decorative rather than load-bearing. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or deepen backstory. No figurative muddle in peak beats; clarity and propulsion hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse-keeper solitude with Cold War dead-drop intrigue (fortune cookies as microdot carriers) offers a fresh synthesis. The "transpose" motif and refracted-light hiding place feel specific and non-obvious. The woman's arrival and "originals" twist echo spy-thriller templates without full transformation; the final handoff risks convenience. Emotional specificity in Elias's discovery (shaking hands, stomach drop) grounds the premise. The piece commits to its conceit but stops short of bold structural risk or a turn that reweights genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Linus Voss shapes the premise (fortune-cookie espionage) and his "transpose" philosophy seeds Elias's motive. He appears in backstory, the microdot photo, and Elias's final thematic echo. However, Linus makes no on-page choices; his cryptic work is recounted, not dramatized. His legacy drives Elias's investigation and the woman's arrival, but he remains offstage. Present in setup and closure (thematic reprise), functional in middle development (microdot photo), earning mid-band credit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The microdot appears in three distinct beats: the fortune-cookie grease smudge hint, the discovery beneath the stone, and the heated reveal of Linus's photo. Its properties (grain-of-sand size, glass-slide heating) are specific and irreplaceable. It directly enables the plot turn (woman's demand for "the originals") and charges the closure. Early signal (grease smudge), middle use (discovery), closure linkage (woman's demand), and causal pressure (narrows Elias's options) all present, justifying high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Open secrets" operates on the page: fortune cookies hide intelligence in plain sight at the Golden Dragon, and the lighthouse beam refracts to reveal the hidden envelope. Linus's philosophy ("The best kind") frames the premise, and the final exchange ("let's play it") echoes the concept. It shapes tactics (Elias searches where light bends) and informs theme, but the woman's arrival makes the concept explicit rather than letting it remain embedded. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal but not irreplaceable—the story could pivot to "hidden messages" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "accidentally prophetic" fortune cookies drive the premise (Linus's messages find the right hands "like seeds carried by the wind"). The slip "The note you seek is hidden where the light bends" pulls Elias to the lighthouse and proves accurate. However, the trait is told and demonstrated once rather than constraining on-page choices with visible cost. It informs backstory and setup but does not return with reweighted meaning or create a middle turn. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with "intentionally cryptic" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linus's orchestration (directing fortune cookies, hiding the microdot, ensuring "the right people found the right secrets at the right time") structures the entire plot. Elias's realization ("his father had orchestrated this") reframes prior beats and motivates the final handoff. The woman's arrival and the "originals" twist both trace to Linus's design. Present in setup (backstory), middle (microdot photo), and closure (woman's claim). The action is irreplaceable—remove it and the story loses its central mechanism. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Directing flow" describes Linus's method (fortune cookies reaching spies/diplomats, microdots placed where light bends) and is invoked at closure ("directing the flow of information like a conductor"). The mechanics appear in the Golden Dragon backstory (dead-drop system) and the lighthouse discovery (refraction guides placement). However, the method is mostly recounted; Elias does not adapt or employ "directing flow" himself on the page. Present in setup and closure, functional in middle (microdot placement logic), but the means could be labeled differently without altering beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse on Blackthorn Isle isolates Elias (three months alone), provides the refracting beam that enables the clue, and supplies the Fresnel lens hiding place. The rocky shore and approach-by-boat setting stage the woman's arrival. The spiral stairs and keeper's quarters anchor spatial choreography. The setting constrains access (island, boat), supplies the discovery mechanism (refracted light), and recurs in the final image (beam as metaphor). Early signal, middle causal use (loose stone discovery), and closure participation (beam's metaphorical charge) all present, with specific mechanics that matter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After last orders" marks Elias's row back to the lighthouse (pub closes → evening discovery sequence). The timeframe is mentioned once and does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elias's investigation unfolds at his own pace. No countdown or clock pressure. The phrase anchors one transition but is swappable with "that evening" or "at dusk" without structural change. Present in setup (transition beat), absent from middle development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To transpose life into a new key" is Linus's stated philosophy and Elias's inherited motive. The desire frames Elias's search (understanding his father's cryptic legacy) and the final exchange ("the song's changing… your father's the only one who knew the new key"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; Elias never faces a visible choice between old and new keys with on-page cost. Present in setup (Linus's philosophy), echoed at closure (dialogue), but the friction between want and cost remains abstract. Thematically coherent but not irreplaceable—"to decode his father's message" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" captures the tone: Elias knows his father's cryptic methods (familiar) yet uncovers new layers (enigma). The lighthouse beam "cutting through the fog like a metronome" and the fortune-cookie espionage setup establish mood. Tone modulates with discovery beats (stomach drop, hands shaking) and holds through the woman's arrival (tense exchange). The final image ("let's play it") maintains enigma without resolving all questions. Coherent across turns and present in the closure moment, though the ending dialogue edges toward overt statement rather than tonal charge alone.</comment>
