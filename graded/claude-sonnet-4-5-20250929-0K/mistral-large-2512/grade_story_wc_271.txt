<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is specific and embodied through physical markers—memorizing stem pressure, breath hitching when roots take hold. Her endurance arc is earned through micro-choices (burying the photograph, watering the cutting) that show contradictory impulses: rejecting healing while staying to learn propagation. The final stance—belief in "something harder, something real"—is motivated by accumulated somatic anchors rather than epiphany. Minor: Mira remains somewhat instrumental, her motivation stated more than dramatized through choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Lena turns from the photograph to the cutting, foreclosing grief-as-event in favor of tending-as-endurance. Orientation anchors quickly (arboretum, Lena, post-strike). Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the orchid's recurrence, the photograph's burial-then-sprouting, and somatic markers layer to reweight "hope" into "endurance." One meaningful deepening occurs when the drone sound passes and she exhales, crystallizing her shift from paralysis to rooted attention. Cost is legible: she buries the sister's image and commits to a fragile, unglamorous persistence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arboretum's clifftop perch and glass terrarium constrain choices—wind, salt fog, vibrations from drones press on the orchid and Lena's attention. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: chlorophyll-stained hands, bone meal sack, sea crash. The orchid in the terrarium functions as micro-setting, charging the climax when its sway anchors Lena's pulse. Spatial choreography remains clear across potting shed, terrarium, and bench. One small slip: the ledger's "new entry" risks spatial vagueness (who wrote it?) but does not break the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—endurance versus collapse—is signaled early and tightens when drone engines trigger her freeze. The orchid-watching beat is a decisive tightening: external threat meets internal paralysis, resolved by attention that slows her pulse. Agency is renunciation and attention, foreclosing flight with on-page cost (she stays, buries the photo, tends the cutting). One meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length. The final watering is a crystallization of stance with felt cost: she chooses fragile routine over miraculous consolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—endurance as realism, not hope—emerges through particulars: roots, somatic markers, the orchid's bloom during drone passes. The buried photograph sprouting is a non-literal answer to "can anything grow from loss?" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (twitch of wrist, hitch of breath) and the orchid's swaying. The final line reweights prior material: watering becomes proof of persistence, not miracle. Minor: "pearl of stillness" verges on prompt echo, but the orchid's defiance dramatizes it with pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; Lena's perceptual signature filters through trauma (drone pitch, veil catching light). Diction remains controlled—"knife twist," "funeral pyre"—and embodied interiority (frozen body, shallow breath) replaces filter stacks. Mira's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One small slip: "quietly talented in the way of those who've spent decades…" momentarily shifts into narrator commentary rather than Lena's lens, but recovers quickly and does not recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Minor scaffold appears in exposition: "her sister's, the one she'd missed because…" could compress to free momentum. The orchid-watching beat is propulsive and clear. One figurative cluster ("knife twist," "funeral pyre," "pearl of stillness") in early paragraphs risks slight overwriting but does not obscure causality. Final line is concrete and grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of arboretum, drone-strike survivor, somatic markers, and post-lighthouse-keeper ledger reads specific and earned. The orchid-as-anchor during drone pass is a fresh inflection on PTSD triggers. Emotional specificity (burying the photograph as seed) avoids generic resilience templates. However, the "fragile hope on a cliff" premise echoes familiar post-trauma-in-nature arcs; transformation occurs through the somatic-marker method and the orchid's role, but the core frame is recognizable. Risks are modest—no bold structural gambit—but execution is solid.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena (drone strike wedding survivor) drives two key beats: freezing at drone sound, burying the photograph. Her survival status frames the dominant stake. She appears early, constrains middle choice (staying versus fleeing), and her final watering closes the arc. Cost is visible: she foreclosed grief-as-event. Swappability is low—removing "wedding survivor" would erase the photograph's weight and the drone trigger. Minor: the strike itself remains backstory; more on-page confrontation with the memory could push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crumpled photograph appears in three beats: discovery (potting shed), tracing the veil, burial in soil. Its state evolves—crumpled, then smoothed by time—and meaning reweights from guilt-object to seed. It enables the burial choice and charges the sprouting moment. Causal pressure: burying it is a micro-renunciation with cost. Closure linkage: Lena touches it in her pocket in the final section, anchoring her shift. Irreplaceability is high; a generic keepsake would lack the wedding/veil specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" is named twice (Mira's terrarium line, the orchid-sway beat) and shapes the freeze-exhale turn by offering an anchoring image. It constrains one key choice: Lena looks at the orchid instead of fleeing. However, it reads more as thematic label than a mechanic with cost. Removing "pearl" would not break the orchid's function; "stillness" is the operative idea. Mid-band: present in closure participation, but specificity is partial.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" describes Mira's teaching method (somatic markers, coaxing life from soil). It enables one on-page action: teaching Lena wrist-twitch and breath-hitch cues. The trait is demonstrated through chlorophyll-stained hands and patient instruction. However, no visible tradeoff or cost attaches to the talent itself; it functions as enabling attribute without friction. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect (Lena's learned markers persist). Swappability is moderate—"experienced gardener" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Freeze" is the pivotal action: Lena locks when drone engines hum, body and breath shallow. This beat is the story's central pressure point; Mira's redirection to the orchid and Lena's exhale depend on the freeze. Removing it would collapse the climax into summary. It appears in setup (early fear), peak development (drone pass), and charges the ending (she no longer freezes, just waters). Cost is visible: paralysis versus endurance. Irreplaceability is very high; no other action carries this exact weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled early (wrist twitch, breath hitch) and its mechanics matter: Lena learns by body cues, not verbal instruction. It enables the freeze-exhale beat—her body knows to look at the orchid. However, the method remains brief; only two markers are shown in action. Development gate met, closure participation indirect (her steady hands at the end reflect learned embodiment). Swappability is moderate; "hands-on teaching" would approximate the effect. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arboretum on the seaside cliff supplies wind, salt, vibrations, and the terrarium—all pressure choices or resources. The cliff's exposure makes the orchid's bloom "defiant," and the terrarium's glass vibrates during the drone pass, anchoring Lena's attention. It frames the opening, enables the freeze-exhale turn, and charges the final image (fragile glass holding against the sea). Setup, development, and closure gates met. Irreplaceability is high; a generic greenhouse would lack the cliff's precarity and the sea's indifference motif.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" anchors backstory (the ledger with ferns and coordinates) and supplies the mysterious final entry about the orchid. However, the keeper is absent on-page; no live clock or tactical pressure derives from "after." The timeframe is atmospheric rather than structural. Setup gate met (ledger introduced early), but development and closure participation are ornamental—the keeper could be replaced with "former curator" without loss. Cap at mid-band for lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to anchor optimism in realism" is stated once and demonstrated through her teaching (somatic markers, the orchid as non-miraculous example). It shapes one key beat: her refusal to flee when drones pass, modeling grounded endurance. Lena's arc mirrors this—she rejects "miracles" but believes in roots. Friction is present: optimism versus Lena's grief. However, Mira's desire remains more shown than conflicted in her own choices. Setup and development gates met; closure linkage is thematic rather than decisional. Cost is indirect.</comment>
