<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows embodied interiority—"Death had been his first name" grounds the piece—and his analytic approach is visible in parsing equations. The ghost encounter strains motivation: his acceptance of Liora's appearance lacks visceral surprise or embodied terror, flattening a pivotal beat. The final choice to shatter the globe reads as prompted by the ghost's directive rather than internal contradiction, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives on-page: shattering the globe releases the Marigold and Elias surfaces with a renunciation ("Some threads aren't meant to be held"). The cost is legible—he abandons salvage, lets go of retrieval—but the ghost's directive shapes the turn more than Elias's prior agency. One meaningful deepening occurs when he understands the snow globe's function, narrowing his options. Orientation is swift (diver, wreck, library). A micro causality slip: Liora's voice arrives via "crackle of an old radio" underwater without established mechanism, creating a brief logic gap that does not collapse closure but introduces friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: fractured skylight, silt like ash, the desk bolted to the floor all anchor action. The snow globe—water clear, biplane frozen—recurs with reweighted meaning and constrains Elias's final choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects dive priorities (beam, pressure, current). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting charges the closure image: the hull groans in release, the Pacific stretches endlessly. Minor gap: verdigris on a 1930s copper helmet after seventy years underwater reads plausible but the clarity of Liora's face inside strains physics without acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understand Liora's experiment and the Marigold's fate. Pressure tightens when Elias deciphers the ledger, realizes the globe is a key, and encounters the ghost. The climactic choice—shattering the globe—is triggered by Liora's whisper ("Let go") rather than Elias's internal conflict or prior tactical failure, reducing agency. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost (releasing the transmission, surfacing without salvage) is legible. Coincidence (finding the globe intact, the ghost's appearance) complicates but does not resolve, holding within situational allowance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—physics of letting go, threads untangled from the loom—emerges through Liora's notes, the snow globe's function, and Elias's final gesture. The ending image (words floating away, "Some threads aren't meant to be held") reweights prior material without overt moral. Subtext operates in the biplane's spiral, the hull's groan of release. Minor slip: "Death was still his first name, but tonight, it felt like an invitation" edges toward abstraction; the metaphor is reiterated rather than evolved through new particulars. No forced epiphany; the insight grows from scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable. Voice carries a melancholic, lightly lyrical texture ("silt like ash from a forgotten fire," "edges dissolving like ink in water") that fits Elias's scholarly remove. Perceptual signature is selective: he parses equations, recognizes Howland Island without checking. Diction is controlled and purposeful. Minor convergence: the ghost's voice ("crackle of an old radio") and Elias's narration both lean toward poetic register in the encounter, briefly blurring distance. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high—every line advances. Figurative language ("bone dust," "ink in water") is vivid and coherent. No loops or scaffold detected. Grammar and sequencing are clean. Minor cluster: "The biplane inside was no longer frozen; it spiraled upward, the snow swirling in a vortex. Liora's voice, when it came, was the crackle of an old radio" stacks three short beats in quick succession without causal linkage, creating a slight stutter at a peak moment. Overall propulsion is strong and clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—physicist testing disappearance aboard a doomed ship, artifact as temporal key—synthesizes familiar ghost-story and physics-mystery elements with specific grounding (Howland Island replica, Project Icarus, ledger equations). The snow globe as transmission device is a fresh inflection. Emotional truth (Elias's quiet reckoning with letting go) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (underwater ghost encounter, abstract physics of vanishing) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Proximity check: no close echoes detected. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications to closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias ("first name basis with death") is the POV throughout. His analytic approach drives investigation (parsing equations, recognizing Howland Island). The final choice to shatter the globe is a key turn, though prompted by the ghost's directive rather than internal conflict. Present in closure: he surfaces and writes, letting words float away. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is weaker because the trait does not constrain a mid-story choice with visible cost. Causal pressure and closure linkage raise the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The snow globe appears in three distinct beats: discovery on the shelf (he turns it over, snow settles), examination in the mesh bag (plane spirals, Liora's voice emerges), and the climactic shattering on the desk. It reweights meaning across beats: souvenir → key → release mechanism. The globe's specific properties (Howland Island replica, clear water, frozen plane) are irreplaceable. It shapes the final turn and charges closure. All three gates met; strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Early signal, beat involvement (three touches), and cost connection justify high placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Last transmission" is seeded in Liora's voice ("You're holding the last transmission. Not of sound, but of time") and frames the snow globe's function. The concept shapes Elias's understanding and motivates the shattering. It appears in the closure image (words floating away as transmission). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is indirect (the ledger hints at untangling, not transmission). The concept reweights the globe's meaning and alters Elias's final action, justifying mid-band placement. Swappability is low; the temporal-transmission frame is specific to this physics premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is demonstrated once on-page: "his quietly analytic mind parsing the equations like a second language." The trait enables him to decipher Liora's ledger, which is a functional middle beat. No visible cost or constraint tied to the trait; the analytical approach does not narrow options or create friction. Setup gate met (mentioned and shown in the ledger scene); payoff is absent from closure. The trait could be swapped for general competence. Functional but replaceable, capping at mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The action is "note" (implied: taking notes, writing). Elias references the ledger and dives for notes, but on-page he does not write until the very end: "He unclipped his dive slate and began to write, the words floating away." The final beat involves writing, but it does not drive prior turns—the major reversal (shattering the globe) traces to the ghost's directive, not notation. Late appearance (final paragraph), minimal causal pressure, and no middle development. Ornamental presence at closure without shaping prior tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is seeded in Liora's ledger: "If time is a thread, then disappearance is merely the act of untangling it from the loom." The metaphor frames her experiment and explains the Marigold's fate. Elias's final act (shattering the globe, releasing the silver plume) enacts the untangling, and his closing realization ("Some threads aren't meant to be held") reprises it. Setup and payoff gates met; middle beat is indirect (he reads about it but does not attempt it). The method shapes his understanding and the closure gesture. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, justifying entry into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken ship library is present throughout: fractured skylight entry, shelves with the snow globe, captain's quarters with the ledger, the groaning hull at closure. The setting supplies resources (globe, ledger) and pressures choices (current carving a path, crushing depth). Spatial choreography is clean and the environment's state (seventy years submerged) charges the final image (hull groans in release). All three gates met; the setting drives two beats (discovery, shattering) and is indispensable to closure. High specificity and causal pressure justify high placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After finding Amelia Earhart's plane" is implied via the Howland Island snow globe and the year '37, but no plane-finding event occurs on-page. The timeframe is a backstory anchor (Earhart vanished in '37; the Marigold sank then; Elias dives seventy years later) rather than a live constraint. The temporal layers enrich theme but do not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Setup is indirect; middle and closure gates are absent. The element is present as context, not causal driver. Ornamental, scoring low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is Liora's stated project (ledger entry) and becomes Elias's implicit stake as he deciphers her work. The motivation is dramatized in his choice to shatter the globe and surface with a renunciation ("Some threads aren't meant to be held"). Setup (Liora's notes) and payoff (final gesture) gates met; middle friction is mild—he pursues the notes without internal conflict over whether to let go until the ghost prompts him. The desire shapes the ending but lacks sustained dramatized struggle. Causal role in one major beat and closure linkage justify mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone is consistently sophisticated melancholy: "silt like ash from a forgotten fire," "the silence between the creaking hull and the distant whale song," "edges dissolving like ink in water." The tone modulates with pressure (urgency at the ledger discovery, stillness at the ghost encounter) and charges the final image (moonlight, Pacific stretching endlessly, words floating away). Coherent across beats and integral to closure resonance. Diction and rhythm sustain the mood without slipping into sentimentality. The tone is indispensable to the piece's effect, justifying high placement.</comment>
