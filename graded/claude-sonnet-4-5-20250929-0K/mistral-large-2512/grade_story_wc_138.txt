<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation ("discover what happens after goodbye") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choice to channel dimensional awareness into the fragment reads as reactive instinct rather than earned from prior internal conflict. Kael appears as a functional antagonist but remains a stock "reckless ally turned rival" without distinct voice or embodied particularity. The interiority relies on label-level emotion ("achingly profound," "tensed") and lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when by the second paragraph; no orientation penalty applies. The closure unit—Veyra alone with the cold fragment, realizing "after goodbye, there was only silence"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance/Earned Stasis), but the cost remains asserted rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. Kael's vanishing and the storm's sudden quieting feel coincidental rather than motivated by Veyra's palm-slam action, weakening causal linkage at the climax. The lens reads Causal with Situational pressure (dimensional storm as crucible), but the final beat does not demonstrably narrow options or show what path she foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vivid and visually specific ("light fractured into a thousand hues"), but it functions primarily as backdrop; the crystalline structure amplifies the storm, yet this environmental detail does not constrain Veyra's tactical choices on the page. The amulet fragment returns at closure ("cold and inert") with reweighted meaning, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (table, walls, Kael's approach), and the magnetic fields are mentioned but not integrated into action in a way that alters her moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the amulet to learn what follows goodbye—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael lunges and Veyra reacts, channeling her awareness into the fragment, but this turn reads as reactive rather than a protagonist-driven choice that forecloses a path. The cost (Kael vanishes, fragment goes inert) is stated in summary rather than shown through visible loss or trade-off that alters her later tactics. No persistent constraint (injury, tool depletion, time pressure) shapes the final image, keeping the escalation functional but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of aftermath and unknowability emerges from the premise, and the final line ("only silence…not afraid of it") attempts resonance, but the insight is told rather than earned through concrete particulars that reweight prior material. The amulet fragment as motif returns with altered meaning (hot curse → cold inertness), yet the conceptual price—what she gave up to reach this acceptance—remains abstract. The piece avoids overt moralizing but does not invite reflection beyond the stated thesis; "after goodbye, there was only silence" reads as a thematic echo rather than a non-literal answer grown from specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature (dimensional awareness, prismatic light) is character-specific. Dialogue between Veyra and Kael is functional and goal-driven but lacks subtext or distinct idiom; both speak in equally articulate, declarative sentences ("You shouldn't have taken that," "What do you want?"). The prose carries a heightened register ("achingly profound," "hushed thunder") that occasionally drifts into generic fantasy diction without voice-motivated texture. Free indirect style is clean, and the final paragraph modulates toward acceptance without losing focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Information density is adequate; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "The intrigue began…A figure materialized" restates Kael's arrival without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the opening paragraphs ("She sat…She was…She had stolen…She had outlived") with repetitive "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("like tides," "like a mirage," "like a chorus of the damned") appear in multiple beats without fresh specificity. The climax beat ("trembled," "shimmering," "flickering") relies on elevated diction that blurs concrete action, and the final image ("cold and inert in her palm") is clear but unremarkable. No severe artifacts touch the closure sentence itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The immortal-seeking-meaning premise and the "cursed artifact unlocked by celestial event" setup are widely used templates; the story does not transform them through specific lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The spatial mutiny concept is mentioned but not dramatized in a way that redefines the familiar framework. Veyra's realization ("only silence") and her acceptance feel predictable rather than inevitable in hindsight. The prismatic escondite and dimensional awareness offer atmospheric color but do not synthesize into a fresh angle on the material; the emotional truth remains generic rather than particular to this voice and world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Veyra is present throughout and makes the key choice to channel awareness into the fragment, but her decision reads as reactive instinct rather than a choice that alters tactics with visible cost. Her "bored immortal" status is told in the opening but does not constrain on-page action; she is more "seeking immortal" than "bored." She is introduced early (setup gate met), involved in the climax (development and payoff gates met), but the causal pressure and cost linkage are weak. Mid-band: functional across beats but replaceable motivation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amulet fragment is handled in two distinct beats: resting on the table (traced with fingers), then gripped during the climax. It returns at closure with reweighted meaning (burning curse → cold inertness), charging the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The fragment enables the climax action and its transformation is legible, but the specific properties (violet light, jagged edges) do not constrain Veyra's tactical choices in a way that makes it indispensable; a generic artifact could serve with minor edits. Solid integration, not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" is mentioned twice (warlock's whisper, Kael's line) but never dramatized on the page as a rebellion of realms or a constraint that shapes stakes or alters options. It functions as thematic flavor rather than a concept that changes tactics or costs. Setup and development gates are absent; it appears in dialogue but not in action. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Veyra's dimensional awareness is established early ("a rare trait") and invoked at the climax when she channels it into the fragment, but the mechanics remain abstract; the reader cannot discern what this trait enables that another skill would not. It is told as a label without visible trade-off or constraint. Setup gate met, development and payoff gates weakly met (climax mention), but no specific cost tied to the attribute. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is declared when Kael appears and the magnetic fields shift, and it drives the confrontation beat. Setup (shadow moves, "The intrigue began"), development (Kael's demand and lunge), and payoff (Veyra's reaction to his intrigue) gates are met. The action is present across beats but "intrigue" as enacted reads as standard confrontation; swapping it for "conflict" or "confrontation" would require only minor edits. One key turn shaped, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are signaled early (solar storm amplifying fields, air tasting metallic) and invoked at the climax ("magnetic fields surged, pulling at the fabric of reality"). Setup and payoff gates are met; development is weak (fields warp around Kael but do not alter his or Veyra's tactics). The method matters at the ending but its mechanics remain abstract; the fields enable the vortex but are not irreplaceable—another energy source could serve. Solid thematic presence, modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is established early with vivid detail and houses the entire scene. It is described as "impenetrable" yet Kael breaches it, creating a setup tension. The walls tremble during the climax, reacting to the conflict. Setup, development (Kael's breach), and payoff (trembling walls) gates are met. The setting does not constrain Veyra's tactical choices in a specific way; it provides atmosphere and a reaction beat but could be replaced by another hidden chamber. Essential location, not indispensable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The solar storm is present from the opening ("raged outside") and explicitly tightens the window: Kael states the storm weakens dimensional barriers, making "now" the perfect time. It drives the climax (storm reaches peak, then quiets). Setup, development (Kael's timing argument), and payoff (peak and quiet) gates are met. The timeframe creates urgency and is causally active, but the storm's end feels coincidental rather than earned by Veyra's action. Strong presence, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation—"discover what happens after goodbye"—is stated early and reiterated at closure ("She had her answer"). Setup and payoff gates are met; development is weak (the motivation does not create a mid-scene choice or friction). The desire is told as abstract longing rather than dramatized through conflicting wants and costs in action. The ending asserts she found her answer, but the reader does not see what path she foreclosed to reach it. Present across the arc, friction absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears once in Kael's voice description ("low rumble, like hushed thunder") and is evoked in the storm imagery ("solar winds howled"). The tone of quiet intensity is coherent through most beats, modulating with pressure (tense confrontation, sudden quiet at the end). Setup gate met, development present in atmosphere, payoff reflected in the final stillness. The tone charges the final image but is not indispensable; the story's pressure does not depend on this exact tonal register. Solid coherence, modest necessity.</comment>
