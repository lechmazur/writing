<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority relies on abstract concepts ("fragile tapestry of belief," "memories dissolving") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The final choice to plant the seed lacks visible internal conflict or friction; she simply does it after the dream, and the revelation follows without her wrestling with cost. Nani appears as a dispenser of wisdom rather than applying direct pressure. The ending gesture—"she would tell them. Not all of it"—reads as convenient calibration rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (Liora, ridge, reality checker role, monsoon deadline). The closure unit—Liora learning the monsoon's true nature and deciding to tell the village—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "some truths needed time to grow" hedges the decision without visible consequence. The causal lens holds through dream → seed planting → revelation, yet the final stance ("for the first time, she wasn't afraid") tells rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening (the dream revealing the bargain) is present, but the aftermath deflates rather than charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ridge, bioluminescent blossoms, and twin moons establish vivid setting detail early. The seed's physical properties (glyphs, warmth, sprouting pages) anchor micro-setting, and the ridge functions as a "living archive" at closure. However, the village below remains generic, and spatial choreography during the planting lacks tactile specificity—no sense of soil texture, root resistance, or bodily effort. The blossoms light her path at the end but do not constrain a choice; they remain postcard ambiance. Strong sensory detail without decisive constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled early. The seed planting provides one on-page reversal (revelation of the bargain), narrowing Liora's understanding. Yet escalation lacks agency-driven pressure: Nani hands her the seed, the dream arrives passively, and the sprout unfolds on its own. The final decision to "tell them… enough to prepare" avoids concrete cost; no live option is foreclosed, no relationship strained, no resource spent. Pressure coheres under a causal lens but does not tighten into a trade-off with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as both lifeline and burden—emerges through the seed's revelation rather than explicit statement. The image of the monsoon as "keeper, thief, silent partner" offers resonance, and the final "some truths needed time to grow" nods toward complexity. However, the ending stops short of a non-literal answer: Liora's choice is rational and tidy, lacking the ambiguity or contradictory pull that would deepen thematic weight. The pact with the storm is intriguing but resolved through summary rather than lived tension. Solid thematic grounding without the final image reweighting prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable throughout; Liora's perceptual signature (glyphs, shifting seed, dream imagery) is consistent. The prose carries a faintly elevated register ("rustle in the undergrowth," "wind through dry reeds") that fits the fantastical setting. However, internal voice lacks sentence-level distinction—many lines could belong to any thoughtful protagonist. Nani's dialogue reads generic ("You've been avoiding the dreams"). The dream woman's line "Memory is a garden" feels like thematic shorthand rather than character-specific idiom. No head-hopping, but voice does not crystallize under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "fragile tapestry of belief" rephrases the "collective memory" concept without adding pressure; "a presence, like an echo waiting to be answered" stacks metaphors without advancing clarity. Template cadence in the dream sequence: "A woman—her face familiar… held a fruit… 'Memory is a garden.'" Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("The blossoms' glow seeped into her skin as she closed her eyes"). Stock metaphors ("thief," "keeper," "garden") cluster without fresh synthesis. The final paragraph's "unaware of the storm's true nature" / "But she would tell them" loop restates intent. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, filter stacks −0.5, template cadence −0.3, total reduction ~−1.2 from a mid-6 anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—reality checker on a fantasy island with living memory—combines familiar elements (chosen-one guardian, magical seed, deadline) without transformation. The monsoon-as-bargain twist arrives late and resolves through summary rather than earned discovery. Emotional arc follows a predictable path: doubt → passive revelation → newfound confidence. The seed's mechanics (sprouting pages with text) read as convenient rather than arising from prior world logic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece occupies the safety middle of its genre without a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her role frames the premise, but her agency is passive: she receives the seed from Nani, the dream arrives unbidden, the sprout unfolds on its own. She plants the seed, but the act does not create a turn—it merely triggers exposition. Her final decision to tell the village "not all of it" is stated rather than dramatized with cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but does not drive key turns through choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seed appears early (satchel, glyphs), is handled in the dream and planting beats, and generates the revelation. It returns at the end as a vine bracelet, reweighting her bond to the archive. However, the seed's function is largely passive: it sprouts and presents information rather than constraining choice or forcing a trade-off. Strong presence across beats and closure linkage, but not indispensable—another magical object could serve the same role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Collective memory is the stated stake and frames Liora's duty. The revelation that the islanders bargained stories for survival makes the concept tangible. Yet on-page action does not hinge on memory mechanics—no scene where a memory dissolves, no choice where Liora must decide which story to preserve or sacrifice. The concept shapes theme more than tactics. Present in setup and payoff, but minimal middle development where it alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is labeled in one sentence ("her dreams had been erratic, empirically whimsical: a talking turtle reciting forgotten laws, a bridge of light that led nowhere") but never constrains or enables action. The dreams mentioned do not recur, and the trait does not force a visible tradeoff. Ornamental descriptor without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Waken" appears as a verb in one line ("a way to waken the past before it slipped into myth") and the dream sequence could be read as wakening. The seed planting might also qualify. However, no single "waken" action drives a major turn—the revelation arrives via the seed's autonomous sprouting rather than Liora's active effort to waken something. Present but diffuse; no beat where "waken" redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Interpreted dreams are mentioned early as "the island's other safeguard" and Liora's dream provides the key insight ("Memory is a garden," the village vision). The dream mechanism is signaled and used in the middle beat. However, the interpretation is straightforward summary rather than a puzzle that shapes tactics. The method does not constrain how she acts afterward—she simply plants the seed. Functional presence in setup and middle, minimal closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ancient ridge in bloom is established early with vivid sensory detail (bioluminescent blossoms, twin moons) and reappears at the end as a "living archive" with blossoms lighting her path. The ridge hosts the planting and frames the entire sequence. Yet it does not pressure choices—Liora could have planted the seed anywhere. Strong atmospheric presence and closure reprise, but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The monsoon deadline is stated ("three days") and mentioned again in Nani's line ("The monsoon doesn't just wash away dirt"). The revelation ties the monsoon's nature to the stakes. However, the three-day clock does not visibly tighten decisions—Liora plants the seed "that night" without racing against time, and the ending's walk down the slope ignores the countdown. Present in setup and thematic payoff, but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Protecting cultural memory is Liora's explicit motivation, restated multiple times ("the island's lifeline," "her duty"). The final decision to tell the village dramatizes this motive. However, no scene where her desire conflicts with another want (personal safety, relationships, doubt)—she simply hesitates, then acts. The motivation is told and affirmed rather than tested through friction. Present across beats and shapes the ending, but lacks visible cost or competing impulse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Luminous imagery (bioluminescent blossoms, glowing sap, twin moons) pervades the piece. Doubt is present in Liora's hesitation ("What if the memories… were too heavy?") and her "trembling" voice. The tone modulates from uncertainty to revelation to quiet resolve. Yet "luminous doubt" as a unified tone is more adjacency than integration—the luminous details often serve as decoration rather than charging the doubt. Coherent atmosphere, but the tone does not crystallize uniquely at the final image.</comment>
