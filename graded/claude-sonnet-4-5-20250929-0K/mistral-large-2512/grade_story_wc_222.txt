<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation is clear and her choices drive the plot, but interiority remains somewhat generic ("her pulse quickening," "her stomach dropped"). The guardian encounter shows tactical thinking through the chess-piece gambit, and the final realization demonstrates growth. However, the transformation feels more told than embodied—"she realized" rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when) within the first paragraph. The plot advances through motivated beats: climb → encounter → trade → departure, with the guardian's reversal ("not clever enough") creating a micro-turn. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the sundial lid becomes a question rather than an answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (the unknown now embraces her). The cost is primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, which prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire, wrong sky, and frost-slicked steps ground the reader effectively. The carved chess pieces function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice (she must trade secrets to proceed). The "wrong sky" recurs and charges the final image when it "pulsed like a living thing," directly shaping Lirien's realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the climb and encounter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the sundial lid) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The guardian's challenge creates one meaningful tightening when Lirien "miscalculated," forcing adaptation. However, the resolution lacks visible cost—she gets exactly what she came for, and the reframing (object→question) feels more like a philosophical upgrade than a trade-off. The stakes shift from external (retrieve relic) to internal (embrace wonder) without forfeiting the original goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete details: the mentor's teaching, the chess-piece system, the guardian's riddle. The final image offers a non-literal answer—wonder as process rather than possession—without moralizing. However, "embrace the unknown with open arms" appears as near-prompt language in both opening reflection and closing thought, creating a mild thematic echo. The wrong sky as recurring motif charges the ending effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Lirien's perceptual signature shows in tactical observations ("she had miscalculated") and the wry amendment of her mentor's advice ("but do it while running"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in the trade negotiation. The guardian's voice ("its voice the sound of cracking ice") reads distinct. Diction remains consistent to the fantasy register without significant slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure. Some stock phrasing appears: "her pulse quickening," "her stomach dropped," "her breath shallow." The opening metaphor "a mouth of black ice and whispering winds" works well. Figurative language density stays controlled. A mild paraphrase loop occurs with "embrace the unknown" variations across opening and closing. Information density is solid; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire and wrong sky offer atmospheric specificity, and the chess-pieces-as-secret-vessels system shows ingenuity. However, the core beats follow familiar fantasy-quest structure: hero seeks artifact, bargains with guardian, gains wisdom over object. The "chivalrous thief" and "what you seek is not what you need" resolution feel archetypal without sufficient transformation. The final reframing (time→question) lands as thoughtful but not structurally surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien as chivalrous thief appears throughout and her choices (climbing the spire, offering chess pieces, taking the lid) create key turns. The "leaving noblemen lighter in coin but heavier in pride" detail establishes character but doesn't constrain the present action. She drives the plot forward, though the guardian ultimately gifts her the lid rather than forcing a harder choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid is established as the goal in paragraph two, appears in the guardian's hand during negotiation, and Lirien takes it at closure. It grows warm in her palm and triggers her realization. However, it functions more as MacGuffin than active constraint—its properties don't shape her tactics during the encounter, and the "last true measure of time" setup isn't paid off mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "Apprentice of Wonder" appears as Lirien's mentor in backstory and the phrase "embrace the unknown" echoes across the text. However, it shapes character more as thematic label than on-page constraint. The apprenticeship doesn't visibly alter Lirien's tactics during the guardian encounter; it provides philosophical framing without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" appears once as atmospheric descriptor ("the air hummed with a sacredly playful energy") but doesn't constrain or enable action with cost. It colors tone but remains ornamental—no beat depends on this specific quality, and removing it wouldn't break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amend" connects to Lirien's slight revision of her mentor's teaching ("she amended them slightly: embrace the unknown, but do it while running"). It appears early but this amendment doesn't drive major turns—the distinction between "embrace" and "embrace while running" doesn't shape her actual encounter tactics or the closure. Swappable with other forms of revision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside are established early, recur during the guardian trade (two pieces offered), and the swapping system is referenced in backstory. The method directly enables the negotiation beat and demonstrates Lirien's preparation. The hollow pieces are specific and irreplaceable to this story's logic, though the guardian overrides the system by gifting the lid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire provides the quest destination, frost-slicked steps create physical obstacle in the climb, and "above the clouds" establishes isolation. The entrance ("a mouth of black ice") and interior coldness affect Lirien's breath and movement. The setting pressures choices through environmental difficulty and charges the final image when "the wind howled" but "sounded like an invitation."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is established vividly in the opening and recurs at closure when "the wrong sky outside pulsed like a living thing." It provides atmospheric pressure and thematic charge. However, it doesn't create temporal urgency or tighten decisions—Lirien's timeline isn't constrained by the wrongness, and the condition seems permanent rather than dynamic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To embrace the unknown with open arms" appears as the mentor's teaching, Lirien internalizes it with amendment, and the closing lines dramatize her embracing "the next secret, the next wonder, the next wrong sky." The motivation drives her presence at the spire and colors the resolution. However, it's more stated than tested—no on-page moment forces her to choose wonder over safety with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" operates through Lirien's tactical preparation (chess pieces, careful approach) combined with her thrill-seeking ("she had come for wonder"). The tone modulates from tense climb through negotiation to grinning exit. The oxymoron quality charges the final image when risk sounds "like an invitation." Present and coherent, though not indispensable to the story's architecture.</comment>
