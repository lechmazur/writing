<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation is established ("to find where lost time accumulates") and her actions are consistent, but interiority leans heavily on abstract poetic declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The reflection on her mother's hands and the past handprint does anchor present action (tracing with ink), but the piece relies on atmospheric assertion ("willingly perplexed," "confusion itself were a kind of devotion") more than dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final choice to let her hands rest feels more like Earned Stasis than a decision forged through visible internal conflict, and the cost—while present—is told through lyric summary rather than a visceral forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (midnight glade above clouds, cartomancer, post-birth timeframe), and the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cartomancer spreads the cloth, traces the crack, aligns her palm with her younger self, and in the final image lets her hands rest where ink meets cloth and crack meets sky—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights "lost time" as "what endures." Cost is legible in the image of the crack pulsing "warm as a heartbeat" and her not flinching, though the pressure is felt more than causally narrowed. The piece does not escalate through because/therefore linkage but through density increase and cadence shift, which fits the inferred lens. However, the middle section loops through multiple restatements of the same thematic territory (the nature of names, the debt of promises, the cruelty and mercy of unseen things) without a clear turn or deepening until the final alignment, resulting in a closure that lands but arrives via summary more than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade above the clouds is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (silvered grass, cumulus-rooted trees, ozone and crushed violets), and the dolls' tea set saucer crack becomes a tactile anchor that the cartomancer traces as a map. The body (her trembling fingers, the heel of her palm smoothing creases) and the recurring object (saucer, cloth, ink) all constrain and charge the final image: "her hands rest where the ink met the cloth, where the crack met the sky." The setting is lyric and atmospheric rather than a space that forces concrete tactical choices, but the micro-setting (cloth, saucer, ink) does function as the crucible for the ritual act. The clouds parting "as if yielding to her sorrow" borders on pathetic fallacy but remains within the story's lyric register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and the cartomancer's agency is visible in the ritual of spreading the cloth and tracing the crack. However, escalation is minimal: she arrives, reflects, traces, and rests her hands; no option is foreclosed or narrowed mid-scene, and no external or internal pressure forces a difficult trade-off. The cost is legible in the image of her not flinching and in the "quiet, choking beauty of what endures," but it accrues through lyric accumulation rather than a turn that tests commitment or alters tactics. The Accumulative lens allows for this design, yet even within that mode the piece would benefit from a more visible shift in her stance or a concrete realization that changes her next move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—loss, repentance, the debt of memory, what endures through breaking—emerges organically from the saucer crack, the family custom, and the final alignment of past and present handprints. The mother's line *"Every handprint is a promise, and every promise is a debt"* is purposeful and grounded in the ritual rather than moralizing. The final image (hands resting where ink meets cloth, crack meets sky) offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis. However, the middle third loops through near-synonymous reflections on names, stories, and the nature of repentance, and the phrase "choking beauty" in the penultimate paragraph risks sounding like a thematic summary rather than an earned perception. The piece avoids overt moralizing but borders on over-articulating its own symbolic furniture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyric and elevated, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "her heart a compass spinning toward some unseen north where lost time pooled like mercury"). POV remains stable third-person limited, and the diction matches the cartomancer's ritualistic, poetic focus. However, the prose occasionally drifts into over-wrought metaphor clusters that feel writerly rather than character-filtered ("the quiet, choking beauty of what endures"), and the psychic distance remains fixed at a middle remove throughout, never tightening under pressure or widening for strategic effect. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, but the voice does not modulate with emotional intensity—every sentence carries the same stately, metaphor-laden cadence, which flattens the urgency even as the piece claims profound emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and often striking ("her heart a compass spinning toward some unseen north where lost time pooled like mercury"), but overwriting accumulates across the piece: nearly every sentence in the middle section carries figurative language or abstract poeticism, creating density without momentum. Paraphrase loops appear (e.g., multiple sentences restating that some things are felt not seen, that names are layers, that breaking makes room for the new) and the piece relies on stock lyric constructions ("not to mend what was broken, but to understand how the breaking made room for something new" echoes self-help idiom). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew," "she had not understood") stack in the reflective passages, and the final third contains template cadence ("This was not prediction; this was memory in reverse") and synonym churn ("the cruelty and the mercy," "the quiet, choking beauty"). The Patterned-artifact penalty pack applies: baseline −0.8 for loops, register drift, and template stems; an additional −0.5 because artifacts appear in the closure beat ("the quiet, choking beauty of what endures" in the penultimate paragraph). This triggers the disallow-9+ global cap and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—cloudbound cartomancy as ritual repentance tied to lost time and a cracked saucer—offers a fresh synthesis of image and concept, and the family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is specific and memorable. However, the core emotional arc (returning to a ritual to honor the past and accept what endures) is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or tactical specificity; the cartomancer's journey is largely internal and lyric, with no surprising turn or complication. The ending rests on lyric affirmation rather than a risky structural or emotional choice, and the voice, while consistent, does not take bold perspectival risks that heighten stakes. The piece is competently executed within its lyric mode but does not push beyond the safety middle of poetic meditation on loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer is present throughout and her choices—unfastening the satchel, spreading the cloth, tracing the crack, aligning her palm—create the story's beats. Setup by the opening line, developed through the ritual, and present in the final image where her hands rest. However, her decisions do not narrow options or face resistance; she arrives with a plan and executes it without complication or internal turn. The character is essential to the piece but her choices are more performative than causally decisive, placing her in the functional-but-replaceable band with a lyric-resonance lift for the early-final arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dolls' tea set saucer crack is introduced in the opening line, traced as a map in the middle, and present in the final image ("where the crack met the sky"). It appears in three beats and its fracture is treated as revelation, shaping the cartomancer's understanding. Setup, development (tracing), and payoff are all present. However, the crack is more symbolic anchor than active constraint; it does not alter tactics or foreclose an option, and its properties are generic (a clean split) rather than uniquely irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement elevate it to the essential-across-beats band, but lack of causal pressure or cost connection caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance appears in one explicit phrase ("the nature of cloudbound repentance") as thematic claim rather than dramatized choice. The setting is above the clouds and the cartomancer seeks to address loss, but the concept does not shape tactics, narrow options, or generate conflict on the page. It functions as atmospheric label rather than stake-driver. Present in setup (glade above clouds) and echoed in theme, but missing meaningful development and causal participation at closure, capping it at functional-but-replaceable at best.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is declared in the second sentence but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The cartomancer's confusion is asserted ("as if confusion itself were a kind of devotion") but does not complicate a choice, slow a move, or create friction; she proceeds methodically through her ritual without hesitation or misstep. The trait is ornamental, a label that colors voice but does not alter story logic. Setup only, no development or payoff, capping it in the present-but-ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears in the fourth paragraph when she unfastens the clasp of her satchel to withdraw the linen cloth. This action initiates the ritual sequence and is necessary to access the key object. Setup in the first quarter, it enables the middle beats (spreading, tracing) and indirectly shapes the closure. However, unfastening is a simple instrumental act—easily swappable with "opened" or "removed"—and does not carry unique cost or specificity. It shapes one key turn (accessing the cloth) but is mechanically replaceable, placing it in the mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is introduced in the fifth paragraph, developed through the memory of her mother guiding her fingers and the line "Every handprint is a promise, and every promise is a debt," and paid off in the climactic beat where the cartomancer aligns her present fingers with her younger self's handprint, letting ink bind past and present. Setup, development (memory), and payoff (alignment) are all present, and the method directly enables the closure action. The custom is specific and irreplaceable—removing it would break the story's emotional and causal logic. Cost is tied to the act (binding past and present with ink, not flinching at the pulsing crack). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity place it solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade above the clouds is established in the opening line and sustained throughout with vivid detail (silvered grass, cumulus-rooted trees, ozone scent). It frames the ritual and charges the final image ("the trees bending as if to witness"). Setup and closure participation are present. However, the glade does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics; it is atmospheric stage rather than active constraint. The clouds parting "as if yielding to her sorrow" is reactive description, not causal pressure. The micro-setting (cloth, saucer, ink) does more work than the glade itself. Strong setup and closure participation but no middle development or causal role, placing it in the shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the birth" is mentioned once ("The child, born just hours ago") but the timeframe does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics. The cartomancer's ritual proceeds at her own pace with no clock pressure. The newborn child exists as backstory motivation, not as a live temporal constraint. Setup only (one mention in the middle third), no development or payoff, and vague rather than tracked. Present but ornamental, scoring in the low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find where lost time accumulates" is stated explicitly in the eighth paragraph and drives the cartomancer's presence in the glade and her ritual actions. Setup in the first third, developed through the tracing and memory, and implicit in the final resting of her hands. However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized through conflicted choice; she arrives with this aim and pursues it without friction between desire and cost until the very end. The motivation shapes the arc but is not tested or complicated mid-scene. Strong setup and closure linkage, but missing visible friction or trade-off during development, placing it in the essential-across-beats band with a deduction for lack of on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("the quiet, choking beauty of what endures") and the tone is sustained throughout with lyric intensity, oxymoronic juxtapositions (cruelty and mercy, sorrow yielding clouds), and sensory richness (ozone, crushed violets, pulsing warmth). The tone is coherent across beats and charges the final image. However, it remains relatively static—the same stately, metaphor-laden register from opening to close—without modulation under pressure. The phrase "choking beauty" risks becoming a thematic label rather than an earned tonal effect. Setup, sustained development, and closure participation are all present, and the tone is specific and consistent, placing it in the essential-across-beats band, though the lack of dynamic modulation and the late explicit articulation prevent higher scoring.</comment>
