<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is consistently characterized as "resiliently positive" and ardent, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("believed in the light that slipped through the cracks") rather than embodied contradiction. The hourglass functions as a talisman but never constrains a choice with visible cost; his final act of speaking to the commuters feels more like narration than a decision that forecloses options. Captain Veyra is present but applies no pressure that alters Elias's stance. The ending resets the ferry without dramatizing what Elias renounced or gained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (ferry, grotto, stars). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—spectral imagery and time-dilation motifs build atmosphere—but the closure is a soft reset: commuters vanish, the ferry is "still," and no on-page cost or reconfiguration is legible. The radio transmission and Elias's hourglass gesture open possibilities but do not narrow options or impose felt consequences. The "permanent transient" framing promises tension between states, yet the ending restores stasis without demonstrating what was risked or lost. Closure form is a weak RR; the cost is implied off-page rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, stars forming "interconnected patterns," and the ferry's salt-worn deck anchor the setting vividly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ozone, old paper, frigid air). The grotto's "bones" and the lantern's "trembling gold circle" charge the atmosphere without overwhelming momentum. The stars and grotto do not constrain a tactical choice, but they consistently frame pressure and the final image of stillness. Micro-setting (the hourglass, the wheelhouse) is present but underutilized as a constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the ferry from vanishing—is signaled early via the radio. Pressure accumulates through the appearance of the commuter echoes and the thickening air, but Elias's intervention (speaking to them) is declarative rather than a forced choice with visible cost. The resolution feels coincidental: the commuters "find their way home" off-page, and the ferry stabilizes without Elias renouncing anything or altering his stance. One tightening occurs (the commuters stir and step forward), but agency is diffuse and the cost of success is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the "permanent transient" framing and the tension between vanishing and continuity. The hourglass without sand and the "clocks running sideways" echo time's fluidity, but the final image—"resiliently positive, a permanent transient between the tides of time"—states the theme rather than resonating through action. The commuters' departure gestures toward merging timelines, yet the mechanism and its cost remain abstract. The piece invites reflection on liminality but closes with a summary rather than a charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("threads in a loom," "tide, pulling in all directions"), though some phrases lean toward generic lyricism ("the light that slipped through the cracks"). Veyra's single line of dialogue reads natural and goal-driven. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("resiliently positive, a permanent transient") shifts into authorial voice rather than staying within Elias's embodied experience. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied; sentence openings shift and information density is generally high. Minor loops appear: "the ferry was vanishing" and "the *Maris* was a permanent transient" restate concepts with small variation. The phrase "the world's seams split open and let the impossible through" edges toward abstraction without grounding in concrete action. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("resiliently positive, a permanent transient between the tides of time") reduces momentum with redundancy. Overall, propulsion is steady until the closing reset.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry and time-sideways premise offer a speculative hook, but the resolution—commuters fade and the ferry stabilizes—feels familiar rather than transformed. The "permanent transient" concept is declared more than dramatized through specific choices. The hourglass and interconnected star patterns are evocative but not causally unique; similar motifs appear in many liminal-space fantasies. Emotional particularity is present in Elias's ardent attention, yet the ending's soft reset avoids the bold risk that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and anchors POV. He secures the mooring line, climbs to the wheelhouse, pulls out the hourglass, and speaks to the commuters. However, none of these actions force a choice with visible cost or create a key turn; the commuters' departure happens in response to his declaration rather than a causal decision. His role is observational and declarative. Present in closure but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in three beats: found years ago (backstory), pulled from pocket in the wheelhouse ("hummed faintly"), and tucked back at the end. Its empty state is noted but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The humming suggests potential but is not acted upon. The final reprise reweights the object as a "talisman," yet its specific properties (empty, humming) do not shape the closure. Setup and reprise present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry is the dominant stake, signaled by the radio transmission and Elias's recognition. The concept shapes the entire premise: commuters as echoes, the ferry caught "between moments," and the stars forming "a bridge." The resolution (commuters vanish, ferry stabilizes) is consistent with the concept but feels off-page; the mechanism of "merging" is abstract. The concept drives the narrative frame and is present in the ending, but its mechanics do not visibly constrain Elias's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is labeled twice (early and in the final line) but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Elias's belief "in the light that slipped through the cracks" is asserted rather than tested by a choice that trades optimism for another value. The trait colors his narration but does not force a tradeoff. Label-only use; no visible friction or price tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The radio transmission ("The clocks are running sideways again") incites recognition and sets the stakes. Veyra later notes "Radio's been quiet since the last transmission," and Elias suggests they "listen to the patterns" instead, implying a shift in approach. However, the radio does not reappear at closure, and its absence does not visibly alter the resolution. Setup and one middle beat present; closure participation weak. Swappable with another signal device.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" appear in the stars' light "weaving through the spectral grotto's jagged arches" and again when the stars "pulsed brighter, their light forming a bridge." Elias says "Maybe we just need to listen to the patterns," signaling method. The patterns are visually present and frame the ending, but their mechanics (how they enable merging) remain abstract. Setup and closure presence; middle causal work minimal. The method is signaled but not operationalized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is vividly rendered (jagged arches, stars pulsing through, black water) and frames every beat. The setting's liminality supports the vanishing-ferry concept and charges the final image of stillness. However, the grotto does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. It functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. Present across all beats and in the ending, but micro-setting role is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is the inciting condition, signaled by the radio and tied to the ferry's vanishing. Time's fluidity is evoked through the hourglass's "sand long since spilled" and the commuters from "other timelines, other lives." However, no on-page clock or deadline tightens Elias's decisions; the resolution occurs at an indeterminate moment without urgency. The timeframe concept is thematically present but does not impose tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elias recognizes that "the threads of time were unraveling" and tells the commuters they are "waiting for the right moment to merge." The motivation to merge parallel timelines is implied as the solution to the ferry's vanishing, but it is not dramatized as Elias's personal desire with cost. He acts to facilitate merging (speaking to the commuters) rather than pursuing it for himself. The motivation is functional and told rather than conflicted or shown through friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" appears as a descriptor of the ferry ("a permanent transient, a vessel caught between ports, between moments") and recurs in the final line ("resiliently positive, a permanent transient between the tides of time"). The tone of liminality and stillness-in-motion is coherent throughout and charges the ending image. However, the phrase is stated rather than embodied through tonal modulation under pressure. Setup and closure reprise are strong; middle coherence is steady but not intensified.</comment>
