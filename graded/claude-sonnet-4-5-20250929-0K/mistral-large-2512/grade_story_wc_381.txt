<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The summoner remains more archetype than individual; interiority consists largely of abstract observations ("terrestrially cosmic hum") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The decision to release the prophecy arrives pre-formed rather than emerging through dramatized conflict—no competing impulse acts simultaneously in scene. Emotional states are asserted via stock constructions ("his heart as quiet as the night") without the specificity or irrational layering that would demonstrate genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the summoner moves from needing to hush the prophecy to choosing silence for himself), but the cost remains abstract—no concrete path is visibly foreclosed, no tactical option lost. The story unfolds as a sequence of poetic tableaux rather than causal pressure: kneeling, unfolding, releasing, walking away. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when clarify only gradually), and the Drive Lens wavers between Accumulative and Causal without teaching a pattern or landing decisively at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting anchors spatially and the origami wing functions as a concrete object across beats. However, environment never constrains a choice—the summoner could perform this ritual anywhere quiet. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") rather than particular or filtered through POV priorities, reading more like atmospheric wallpaper than lived-in space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or complication. The summoner faces no opposition, internal friction, or visible price; he simply enacts his plan in a straight line. The story substitutes atmospheric intensity ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic hum") for escalation, offering no moment where options narrow or cost becomes palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—release over control, silence as answer—emerges through the crane-wing dissolution and the summoner's departure. Yet the final image leans on direct statement ("he had learned to listen to the silence instead") rather than letting the brook's carried wing and his departure speak without gloss. The origami wing recurs with shifted meaning, but thematic resonance is diluted by summary paragraphs that explain rather than embody.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds, but perceptual signature is generic—"the world held its breath" and "smoothed hush" could belong to any focalizer. Diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "cartographer of the unseen") that reads authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable but lacks the rhythmic modulation or concrete sensory filter that would anchor voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or abstraction ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic hum," "darkest light"). Paraphrase loops pervade—paragraphs 2 and 3 restate the prophecy's wound without advancing pressure; final paragraphs cycle "he had come to hush" and variants. Template cadence: "The summoner [verb]" opens multiple successive paragraphs. Register drifts into poetic abstraction inconsistent with a focalizer under stress, and figurative density in peak beats ("tranquil blaze burned… not the kind that consumed, but the kind that illuminated without heat") obscures rather than sharpens. Multiple artifacts touch the closure section, triggering the global 9+ disallow and high-band caps per Q7 patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—ritualized release of a prophecy via origami dissolution—offers a fresh image, but the execution follows a template arc: arrive troubled, perform symbolic act, leave at peace. The prophecy remains abstract (never shown creating specific cost or dilemma), and the summoner's transformation occurs off-stage between beats. No bold structural risk or synthesis elevates the material beyond its lyric surface.</comment>
