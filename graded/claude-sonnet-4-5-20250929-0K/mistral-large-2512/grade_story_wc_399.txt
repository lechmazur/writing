<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The line walker's "strangely honest" trait is stated but never tested under pressure—no moment where truth-telling costs him something on the page. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("weight of unspoken knowledge," "echo of wisdom") rather than embodied perception. The prophet interaction bypasses dramatized resistance; the protagonist nods through confusion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No visible cost forecloses a path at closure; the thread-touch moment reads as receptive observation rather than a choice with stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pavilion murmurs → clearing → thread). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the line walker grasps his role as conduit and the thread remains, reweighting "consecrate" from mystery to transmission. Cost is conceptual but legible—he must let wisdom pass through rather than hoard it. The piece teaches its pattern early (murmurs, peripheral awareness, kinetic parapet) and the final image charges prior motifs. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception; he realizes rather than decides, and no live option is foreclosed on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (confusion → understanding via the thread), meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the lack of a visible price or tactic shift keeps this below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pavilion's "wooden slats groaning," "skeletal hand" structure, and grain-preserved whispers establish vivid sensory anchors. The kinetic parapet beneath adds geological texture. Spatial choreography is clear (dunes, pavilion floor, clearing radius). The mask grows warm at the climax, a micro-setting detail that charges the final beat. However, setting does not constrain a choice—the line walker kneels, waits, and touches the thread without environmental resistance. The conjured clearing thickens air and silences wind but serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure, capping this in mid-6s despite strong descriptive work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the echo of wisdom (signaled early). Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs via the clearing's bloom and the thread's appearance, which deepens understanding. Yet the line walker's agency is minimal—he waits, watches peripherally, and accepts instruction. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the prophet's arrival is convenient rather than hard-won. The "decide what to preserve" framing promises a choice, but the protagonist never selects between competing echoes or pays a price to keep the thread alive. Pressure accumulates via imagery but does not force a trade-off, leaving escalation legible but stakes untested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth as transmission, not possession—emerges organically from the thread image and the mask's duality (concealment/truth). The final realization ("let it pass through him, unbroken and unfiltered") grows from particulars (mask warmth, thread hum, pavilion sighs) without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the prophet's lipless speech and the peripheral-awareness method. However, the epiphany arrives without prior friction; the line walker's doubt is mentioned but not dramatized in a choice that tests it. The ending offers a resonant answer (conduit > hoarder) but the protagonist's honesty trait, set up as thematically central, never complicates the arc. Strong thematic coherence with moderate integration of character struggle keeps this in upper-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "murmuring pavilion," "kinetic parapet pulsed," sensory anchors filtered through the line walker's awareness. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("dusk-gray as the dunes," "thread of golden light, thin as a spider's silk"). The prophet's dialogue bypasses lips and "settled into the line walker's bones"—purposeful deviation that supports the piece's metaphysical texture. However, interior voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("peripheral awareness," "unspoken knowledge") that reads more like concept-labeling than embodied thought under pressure. Dialogue mechanics are clean when present; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. Strong execution with minor register slips in reflective beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("skeletal hand," "spider's silk," "thread hummed"). Information density is moderate—many lines do double work (mask symbolism + warmth cue). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "whispers preserved in the grain" / "murmurs of the pavilion" / "echo of wisdom" recur without added pressure. "Weight of unspoken knowledge" and "thick with the weight" within two paragraphs. The phrase "Through peripheral awareness, he caught it" frontloads method when the beat could integrate it into action. Two paraphrase moments (e.g., "conjured clearings appeared, pockets of stillness" restates without advancing). Minor scaffold and synonym churn; no severe artifacts touch closure, but pervasive texture padding prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—line walker as conduit, peripheral perception, consecration as release—feels purposeful and specific to this world. The half-mask (concealment/truth duality) and the kinetic parapet (earth speaking) offer fresh sensory anchors. However, the core arc (confused initiate receives wisdom from a prophet and realizes his role) follows a familiar mentorship template without transformation through lived friction. The line walker's honesty, set up as distinctive, never complicates his path. Emotional specificity is present in the mask's warmth and the thread's hum, but the protagonist's passivity and the convenient prophet arrival reduce ingenuity. Mid-band: functional synthesis with some fresh inflection but reliant on stock wisdom-quest structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Half-masked line walker is present throughout and focalizes all action. He kneels, presses his palm, waits, and touches the thread—three distinct beats. However, none of these are decisions that narrow options or create visible cost. He is reactive: the prophet arrives, instructs, and the line walker nods and accepts. His mask warms (a sign, not a choice) and he smiles at the end. The character drives observation but not key turns. Functional presence across beats but replaceable agency caps this below 5.0. Setup (first paragraph), development (middle beats), but payoff is receptive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet appears in two beats: the line walker feels its vibrations through the floor (beat one) and it groans during the prophet's speech (beat two). Both uses are sensory description; the parapet does not enable or constrain a choice. No causal pressure, no evolving use, no charged reprise at closure. Present and consistent with the world's logic but swappable with any ambient earth-mechanism. Setup present, middle beat counted, but no closure participation. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conjured clearings shape the piece structurally: the line walker saw one years ago (backstory seed), one blooms around him at the climax (middle beat), and the closing line notes "the clearing would fade soon" (closure participation). The clearing enables the thread's visibility by thickening air and silencing the pavilion. It does not narrow options—no choice depends on its presence—but it shifts the sensory frame and marks the climax. Setup, development (bloom triggers thread appearance), payoff (acknowledged at closure). Causal linkage is moderate; the clearing facilitates revelation but does not force a trade-off. Lyric reprise with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Strangely honest is stated in one paragraph ("a trait that had both saved and doomed him") and the narration claims it's why he was chosen. No on-page moment where his honesty constrains or enables an action. No visible cost tied to truth-telling. Label-only; ornamental backstory mention. Introduced mid-story (~40% mark), no middle choice shaped by it, absent from closure. Missing all gates except brief mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consecrate is the inciting task (first paragraph: "come to consecrate the space"), drives the prophet dialogue ("You've come to consecrate the clearing"), and is redefined at closure ("to preserve the echo…was not to hoard it, but to let it pass through him"). Three beats, with the final realization pivoting the protagonist's understanding. The action redefines options conceptually (hoard vs. transmit) but does not force a visible trade-off or tactical shift on the page. Setup, development (dialogue explores it), payoff (redefined). Strong thematic integration; moderate causal pressure due to lack of visible cost. Swappable with "sanctify" or "honor" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through peripheral awareness is seeded early (paragraph 4: "listen…through peripheral awareness"), used at the prophet's arrival (paragraph 10: "Through peripheral awareness, he caught it"), and again when the line walker sees the thread (paragraph 17: "Through peripheral awareness, the line walker saw it"). Three beats. The method shapes how the line walker perceives but does not constrain a choice—he uses it automatically without cost or friction. Setup, development (two active uses), payoff (thread perception). Functional but the mechanics are assertion rather than dramatized struggle; no moment where peripheral awareness fails or forces a trade-off. Moderate integration; could be replaced with "instinct" or "intuition" with small edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Murmuring pavilion is the primary setting: introduced in the opening line, its wooden floor vibrates under the line walker's palm (beat two), its murmurs fill silence between prophet and walker (beat four), and it sighs/settles at closure (final paragraph). Four beats with evolving sensory detail (groaning → humming → murmurs → sigh). The pavilion does not constrain a choice but provides the charged stage for all action and its final "settling into a deeper stillness" charges the closure image. Setup, development (multiple sensory touches), payoff (active in final lines). Strong atmospheric integration; micro-setting that modulates with pressure. No tactical constraint limits top band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After the prophet arrives is stated in paragraph 4 as the time when line walkers were instructed. The prophet then arrives mid-story (paragraph 11). The timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency tied to the prophet's arrival or departure. The before/after framing exists but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure on the page. Setup (early mention), development (prophet arrives), but no payoff leverage at closure. Present and consistent but swappable with "during the ritual" or "when summoned." Functional background framing without causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To preserve the echo of wisdom is the stated goal (paragraph 5), drives the consecration task, is questioned mid-story ("But what does that mean?"), and is redefined at closure ("not to hoard it, but to let it pass through"). Four beats with thematic reprise. The motivation is told and then explored conceptually; no on-page moment where the desire to preserve conflicts with another want (e.g., safety, pride). The line walker's doubt is mentioned but not dramatized in a choice with visible cost. Setup, development (dialogue interrogates it), payoff (redefined image). Strong thematic arc; moderate friction due to lack of competing pressures. Could be swapped with "safeguard the truth" or "protect the teaching" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Whisperfield calm: the piece sustains a hushed, reverent register throughout ("murmuring pavilion," "faintly," "whispers," "silence," "stillness," "sighed"). Tone modulates subtly—breath fogs, mask warms, thread hums—without breaking the meditative frame. At closure, "The pavilion sighed…settling into a deeper stillness" and the line walker "smiled beneath his mask" complete the tonal arc with quiet satisfaction. Tone is coherent across all beats and charges the final image. No sharp tonal breaks; pressure rises via sensory accumulation rather than volume. Strong execution of a single sustained mood with purposeful modulation. Setup (established early), development (maintained under pressure), payoff (final stillness + smile).</comment>
