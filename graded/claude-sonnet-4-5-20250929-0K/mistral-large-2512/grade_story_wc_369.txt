<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias displays concrete interiority through embodied sensations (numbness returning to life, warmth spreading) and micro-choices (leaving offerings, pressing the sextant into moonlight). His motivation to teach the tower to remember is established, though the path from maintenance worker to dream-mapper feels more asserted than earned through on-page contradiction or struggle. The final choice to return tomorrow reads as continuation rather than foreclosure with visible cost; the tower shifts from prison to vessel through passive realization rather than a decision that sacrifices an option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors slowly (tower, storm, labyrinth worker) but the "who" crystallizes adequately by the sextant discovery. The piece accumulates imagery (offerings, whispers, moonlight healing, trees as witnesses) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tower becomes "keeper of dreams" and sorrow "made whole." Cost remains abstract—the healing and acceptance don't foreclose a live path on the page; the pin's click recurs but doesn't tighten options. The ending reweights the premise but the conceptual cost (what Elias gives up to remain) is implied rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, moonlight pooling "like mercury," and gnarled oaks create vivid atmosphere. The sextant's broken limbs and the spiral stairs supply spatial grounding. Moonlight constrains the healing moment and charges the balcony scene, pushing this into the 7-band. The labyrinth's shifting walls and damp stone recur with purpose, though the lower chamber's sawdust and the pin's origin remain vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the tower's hunger and his role as memory-keeper. The sextant discovery and moonlight healing provide one meaningful deepening that changes Elias's relationship to the tower. However, escalation is textural rather than choice-driven; the sextant "clicks" on its own, the realignment happens without Elias's agency, and the trees' script appears as revelation rather than a price paid. The storm "still howls" but no longer feels like a prison—acceptance without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—sorrow as measurable, memory as healing—emerges through the sextant's transformation, offerings in crevices, and the trees' message "We remember so you don't have to." The final image of the tower as vessel reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The concept of "quantified sorrow" resonates through the broken instrument and the idea of mapping grief in rings and cracks, though the trees' script borders on direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Diction ("like brittle twigs," "roots unfurling," "spider's legs") is purposeful and sensory. Perceptual signature shows Elias noticing structural details (chalk, crevices, gear brightness) appropriate to his role. Psychic distance tightens during the moonlight healing and balcony scene. Some phrasing tilts ornamental ("the slow accumulation of sorrow…silence between heartbeats") but voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences do multiple jobs ("Not in words—never in words—but in the way they leaned"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent except "moonlight…pooling…like mercury" followed by "warmth…not the heat of the sun, but something older"—mixed sensory metaphors. Minor loops: "the tower no longer felt like a prison. It was a vessel" restates without added pressure. "Click" of the pin recurs without clear payoff. No major artifacts touch closure, but density occasionally tips toward ornamentation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—mapping a sentient labyrinth by leaving offerings and discovering a sextant that measures sorrow—offers a lyric, non-obvious synthesis. The trees as witnesses and roots-as-script provide fresh imagery. However, the emotional arc (isolation → acceptance, teaching the tower to remember) follows a familiar contemplative template. The sextant's self-repair and the trees' message feel convenient rather than earned through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity elevates, but the closure reweights without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias chooses to press the sextant into moonlight and to climb the tower, but the major turn—the sextant's realignment and the trees' message—happens to him. His decision to return tomorrow is stated intent, not a key reversal. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but observation and passive reception dominate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sextant appears in the opening (half-buried, broken, humming), is pressed into moonlight (healing beat), and clicks into a new map at the climax. Three beats, early signal, closure linkage. Its broken state and transformation drive the ending's thematic charge. Specificity (brass limbs, gears, alignment into roots-as-script) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is named explicitly ("That was what the sextant had been built to track") and frames the thematic question. It shapes the protagonist's understanding and the sextant's purpose, but does not constrain an on-page choice or tactic. The concept echoes in "rings, cracks, silence between heartbeats" and the final acceptance, offering a purposeful reprise without mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moonlight heals Elias's numb hand (sensation prickles back, old wounds stitch together) in one sustained beat. The healing enables his climb and charges the balcony scene. Cost is oblique—what he trades for this healing is unstated. Early signal (moonlight pooling), one causal beat, closure presence (moonlight frames the trees' message). Specificity is moderate; the attribute could be swapped for another restorative force without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" is stated as Elias's life work ("spent his life deconstructing the labyrinth…by mapping these scattered fragments"). The action is summary-only; we see him leaving offerings and mapping with chalk, but no on-page beat shows him taking the labyrinth apart. The concept frames his role but does not drive a key turn. Late thematic echo ("teaching it to remember") inverts deconstruction without demonstrating the shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" is named late ("mapping these scattered fragments…A child's lost mitten. A lover's unspoken promise") and frames the tower's purpose. The method informs the thematic layer but does not constrain a choice or tactic. The sextant's final map of roots might be the method realized, but this connection is asserted rather than dramatized. Setup is delayed; middle development is absent; closure linkage is conceptual only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit tower by moonlight anchors every beat: storm howls for three nights, moonlight pools and heals, the balcony frames the climax. The tower's damp, spiral stairs, and high windows supply micro-setting that alters Elias's movement and perception. Moonlight enables healing and the sextant's transformation. Storm and tower constrain and charge throughout, essential to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The pin's click is heard once in the opening ("at that moment, he heard it") and recurs in the final line ("the *click* of the pin still falling somewhere in the dark"). The timeframe "at the moment" is invoked but does not tighten decisions; the pin is atmospheric rather than a clock that alters tactics. Setup and closure participation present; middle development absent. Ornamental reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The desire to discover what trees witness is stated explicitly ("What did they witness?") and frames the thematic question. The trees' answer ("We remember…so you don't have to") provides closure resonance. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost. Elias does not struggle with competing desires; he seeks and receives. Setup, thematic closure linkage, no middle choice constraint.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone braids the mundane (maintenance worker, chalk, sawdust, thimble of salt) with the miraculous (humming sextant, walls that whisper, moonlight healing, self-aligning gears). The balance is coherent through turns and charges the final image where ordinary objects (pin, trees) carry numinous weight. Modulation is present: storm-dread shifts to wonder at the balcony, then settles into quiet listening. The tone shapes atmosphere and ending but does not directly constrain a choice.</comment>
