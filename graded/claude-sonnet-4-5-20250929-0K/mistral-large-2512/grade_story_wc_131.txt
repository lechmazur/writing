<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's seven-year existence in the library crawlspaces provides clear motivation, and the "kindly methodical" trait shapes his cataloging behavior. However, the final beat ("He could step forward now... Elias closed his eyes") offers observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—he neither reveals himself nor commits to permanent hiding. The sense memory of his mother is embodied and acute, but interior contradiction remains muted; his warring impulses (reveal vs. hide) are stated rather than enacted simultaneously in the closure moment. The cache-building and Voss investigation show goal-pursuit, but the ending suspends agency rather than crystallizing it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure mounts through the outage window and Elias's discovery work, with closure attempting Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece tracks causally through discovery → hiding the tape → Mara's arrival, but the final beat stops at suspended options rather than reconfiguring them with felt cost on the page. The story teaches us Elias *could* step forward, but he closes his eyes—a micro-turn of refusal without visible consequence or a reweighted image that charges prior material. Cost remains potential rather than undeniable in the closure lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid and purposeful: emergency lights, ventilation shafts, loose floorboards, and the rare manuscripts room all constrain Elias's movements and enable his cache. The body-as-micro-setting works (sneakers on carpet, butter knife prying the board). The scent of lemon oil triggers the mother memory, anchoring reflection in present stimulus. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the setting does not charge the final image—Mara's flashlight sweeps the room, but the physical space does not alter Elias's suspended choice in a way that makes the closure inescapable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to validate Voss's work and perhaps emerge from hiding—is signaled early and sustained. The outage provides urgency, and Mara's arrival narrows his window. One meaningful tightening occurs (creaking floorboard → door opening → beam of light approaching). However, escalation under the Situational lens requires stance crystallization with cost; here the protagonist freezes in observation ("He could step forward... Elias closed his eyes") rather than making a choice that forecloses an option. The constraint (Mara's presence) complicates but does not force a decisive reconfiguration on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisibility vs. visibility, archival obsession as refuge, and the longing for connection emerges through particulars (the cache, the seven-year habitation, the label "Do not erase"). The tape fragment and Voss's vanishing function as motifs that accumulate meaning. The sense memory of his mother deepens the emotional stakes without sermonizing. However, the ending does not offer a resonant answer—it suspends the thematic question ("what if she didn't believe him?") without reweighting prior material through image or action. The final line is a held breath, not a reprice or crystallization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "dust motes swirling," the scent of lemon oil, emergency lights casting "long shadows like fingers." His interior voice is specific ("That was the problem with sense memories—they made you ache"). Diction remains consistent under pressure. Mara's brief dialogue ("Hello?") and her tag ("soft but clear") fit naturalism. Purposeful elision (we infer his years of watching) does not obscure present stakes. The only slip: "He'd found it weeks ago" shifts briefly into summary when the tape's initial discovery could anchor more tightly in the present urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (the tape label, Voss's history, the cache location all serve both exposition and pressure). Clarity and momentum are strong through the outage sequence. However, several lines loop or scaffold: "The air smelled of old paper and lemon oil, the scent triggering a sense memory so sharp it nearly knocked him back" repeats the scent cue unnecessarily; "The creaking came again, closer this time" is a minor paraphrase of the prior beat. The phrase "frayed edges of his own frayed existence" is a decorative near-duplicate. These do not obscure causality but accumulate to dull line-level propulsion in non-closure paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—a library crawlspace dweller obsessed with a vanished archivist—offers a fresh angle on isolation and discovery. The ferromagnetic tape fragment and handwritten label provide specific, non-generic detail. The seven-year inhabitation and the "kindly methodical" trait personalize Elias beyond archetype. However, the Voss mystery and the hidden-researcher frame echo familiar genre templates (secret research, vanished mentor, hidden cache), and the story does not fully transform these through lived moral calculus or a non-obvious final turn. The ending's suspension of choice feels cautious rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias ("crawl space dweller") is present throughout, framing the entire narrative. His choices—hiding the tape, prying up the floorboard, ducking behind the shelf—drive middle beats. However, at closure he observes options ("He could step forward now") without making a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The element is essential to setup and development but does not decisively shape the ending's charge. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, closure (observation only). Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (middle) +0.6. Frictions: closure is observational rather than decisive −0.8, swappability moderate −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.2 = 3.8; round cautiously to reflect participation without final agency: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment appears in beat one (pocket, label "Do not erase"), is added to the cache in beat two, and motivates the urgency ("this was different... felt like a key"). It seeds Elias's investigation and shapes his goal. However, it does not return in or charge the closure image—Mara's arrival and Elias's frozen choice do not hinge on the tape's properties. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, closure absent. Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, specificity (handwritten label, Voss's name) +0.5. Frictions: missing closure participation −1.0, late problem-solving potential (could be used to prove his claim) but not enacted −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.3 = 3.7; lyric allowance for motivated goal-object pushes to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sense memory (core concept) appears vividly in one extended passage: the lemon oil scent triggers the mother's hands and picture book, with embodied cost ("made you ache for things you could never have again"). This beat deepens Elias's emotional isolation but does not constrain a choice or alter present tactics—he swallows hard and continues his task. The concept is thematically resonant but does not shape stakes on the page. Gates: setup ✓ (first third), development (affects mood, not decision), closure absent. Positives: early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, embodied specificity +0.3. Frictions: ornamental in terms of causal pressure −0.7, no closure linkage −0.8. Base 3.0 + 1.1 − 1.5 = 2.6; round generously for thematic depth to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" (attribute) is stated in paragraph five and demonstrated through cataloging forgotten books, mending, and the careful cache-building. It enables his seven-year survival and shapes his approach to the Voss investigation. However, the trait does not visibly constrain a choice with cost at closure—his decision to hide rather than reveal himself could stem from caution rather than methodical planning. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (drives cache behavior), closure (implicit but not charged). Positives: early signal +0.4, one beat (cache) +0.4, enables tactics +0.6. Frictions: label-only in opening −0.3, no visible tradeoff at closure −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.4 − 0.9 = 3.5; round up slightly for consistent demonstration: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cache (action) is central: Elias hides the tape fragment in the shoebox beneath the floorboard, a beat that demonstrates his seven-year accumulation and raises the question of what he will do with Voss's fragments. The cache motivates his presence in the rare manuscripts room and sets up the final choice (reveal the cache to Mara or remain hidden). However, the cache itself does not return in the closure image—the ending focuses on Elias's frozen observation rather than the shoebox's fate. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (defines his goal), closure (adjacent but not active). Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, cost connection (risk of discovery) +0.4. Frictions: closure is adjacent rather than decisive −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.6 = 5.3; elevate for strong causal role to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Uncovering in pipe chases" (method) is referenced in one line: "Elias had spent every spare moment since then uncovering in pipe chases, tracing the labyrinth of ducts and forgotten corridors." The method is told rather than shown, and its mechanics do not matter on the page—the current scene involves floorboards and the rare manuscripts room, not active pipe-chase exploration. The element seeds backstory but does not shape present attempts. Gates: setup (mentioned), development absent, closure absent. Positives: early mention +0.3. Frictions: summary-only −0.7, swappable with "searching hidden spaces" −0.6, late appearance (second paragraph, backstory mode) −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.6 = 1.7; round up for thematic color to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "shadowed library at dawn" setting is vivid: emergency lights, high arched windows, flickering city lights, and the east wing's excessive quiet all pressure Elias's movements. The outage provides cover, and the rare manuscripts room supplies the floorboard hiding place. However, "at dawn" is not anchored—emergency lights and flickering city lights suggest night or indeterminate time, and no dawn-specific cues (sunrise, changing light quality) appear. The setting shapes choices throughout but the "dawn" element itself is ornamental or absent. Gates: setup ✓ (library, shadows), development ✓ (constraints and resources), closure (spatial but not time-specific). Positives: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2. Frictions: "at dawn" element missing or contradicted −1.2. Base 3.0 + 3.3 − 1.2 = 5.1; elevate for strong spatial work to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The outage timeframe is established early ("power failed," "backup generators," "lights flickered") and provides urgency: Elias must move fast, the librarians are calling to one another, and Mara's arrival forces him to hide. The flickering lights create a live constraint (darkness/illumination alternation). However, the "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" phrasing suggests ongoing instability, and the story does not track a ticking clock or escalate time pressure at closure—Elias's frozen moment could last indefinitely. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (outage enables movement, raises stakes), closure (present but not tightening). Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (cover and complication) +0.8. Frictions: no escalating countdown at closure −0.7. Base 3.0 + 2.3 − 0.7 = 4.6; round up for coherent constraint work to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To become visible to those who need you" (motivation) is stated implicitly rather than explicitly: Elias has watched Mara for years, she leaves sandwiches, and "maybe—just maybe—he could change that" (his invisibility). The final beat dramatizes the friction: "He could step forward now... But what if she didn't believe him?" However, the motivation is more shown in reflection than in a choice with cost—he does not step forward or commit to permanent hiding. Gates: setup ✓ (seven years invisible), development ✓ (Voss investigation as path to visibility), closure (dramatized friction, no decision). Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, friction between want and fear +0.7. Frictions: told more than enacted at closure −0.9, no visible cost paid −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.1 − 1.4 = 3.7; elevate for clear dramatic conflict to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" tone suggests quiet, cool luminosity and muted tension. The emergency lights' "dim glow," the "too quiet" east wing, and dust motes in a beam of light evoke restrained atmosphere. The prose modulates: urgency rises ("He had to move fast," "his breath hitched") then stills at closure ("Elias closed his eyes"). However, "sapphire" as a color/texture cue is absent—no blue light, jewel-toned imagery, or gemstone metaphors appear. The hush is present, the sapphire specificity is not. Gates: setup ✓ (quiet tone), development ✓ (modulates with pressure), closure ✓ (final stillness). Positives: coherent modulation +0.9, charges final image +0.6. Frictions: "sapphire" element missing −1.0, partial swappability with "quiet tension" −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 − 1.4 = 3.1; elevate for tonal coherence to 5.4.</comment>
