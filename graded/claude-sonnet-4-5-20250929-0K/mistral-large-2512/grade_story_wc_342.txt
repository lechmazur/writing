<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is consistent and rooted in her prosopagnosia, shaping how she perceives the world through negative space and physical markers. Her decision not to take the sketch feels earned by her artistic philosophy established early. However, the choice lacks visible cost—no dramatized struggle, no forfeited path that we see collapse. The emotional progression is clean but the final renunciation reads more as philosophical affirmation than a choice that forecloses something she wanted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (negative space portraits, the coin map, the fractal sky sketch) toward a final reweighting where Liora refuses possession. Closure achieves Earned Stasis—she will not take the sketch—and the cost is conceptual (leaving perfection behind as the building falls). Orientation anchors quickly (tree trunk library, condemned building, dawn demolition). The tightening is modest: quest → discovery → renunciation, but the final image reweights her lifelong artistic pursuit with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vivid and purposeful: "cavernous hollow," "damp paper and time," "towering shelves and the weight of centuries." The coin's indentations guide navigation, making the setting a functional map. The sketch itself—"a thousand shades of blue… fractally precise"—charges the final image when Liora closes the safe. Dawn light through cracks signals the demolition timeframe and adds urgency. The body and safe (lock "so intricate it seemed to breathe") function as micro-setting that constrains action and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Liora seeks the fractally precise sky sketch to understand how to capture vastness. The quest tightens through coin → wax map → hidden safe → sketch discovery, then deepens when she realizes possession would violate reverence. The cost is legible in her choice to leave it: "some things were not meant to be possessed, only witnessed." However, the escalation is linear rather than pressured—no missteps, no competing pull to take it dramatized as temptation. The single meaningful choice suffices for this length but lacks visceral struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the tension between capturing and revering the ineffable, the limits of art versus the boundlessness of sky. The sketch itself—holding sky "like a vessel holds water"—answers Liora's lifelong question through image, not assertion. Her final choice not to possess it offers a resonant, non-literal resolution. The prosopagnosia motif (recognizing through negative space) charges her artistic practice and final stance. No overt moralizing; the ending reweights her pursuit with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent focalization through Liora's perceptual signature: "the tilt of their shoulders, the rhythm of their steps," negative space as portrait subject. Diction matches her artistic lens ("fleeting shadow of a smile," "fractally precise"). However, several lines drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "the hush before a storm, the pause before a breath" reads more writerly than felt. Free indirect style is mostly clean; no head-hopping. Elision of her journey to the library is efficient.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with purposeful rhythm, but template cadence appears in the opening third: "She had come for… She had come to…" and repeated "Liora had" stems. Several lines loop: the opening's "not in the way others did" echoes "negative air where a jawline met a throat, the fleeting shadow…" without added pressure. The sketch description ("not just blue… not just still") uses the not-just/but parallelism effectively but borders on pattern-stack. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe") appear but remain voice-motivated. Information density is high; no major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—face-blind artist painting negative space seeks a perfect sky sketch—synthesizes disability, artistic philosophy, and quest structure in a specific way. The coin-as-map and tree-trunk library offer fresh texture. However, the emotional arc (solitary artist discovers artifact, chooses not to possess it) follows a familiar renunciation template without bold transformation. The prosopagnosia shapes her art beautifully but doesn't constrain her quest choices on the page. The sketch's fractal precision is vivid but the decision feels pre-determined rather than earned through risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's face blindness shapes her artistic method (negative space portraits) and perception (tilt of shoulders, rhythm of steps), grounding her worldview. It appears early and informs the thematic frame. However, it does not constrain her quest choices—the coin map and safe retrieval would proceed identically for a sighted artist. The final decision to leave the sketch arises from her reverence philosophy, not her prosopagnosia. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic resonance at closure) but minimal causal pressure on middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The secret book safe is seeded early (Liora "had come for" it), drives the middle quest (coin map → hidden shelf → lock and key), and holds the climactic sketch. It appears in three beats: initial goal statement, discovery, and closure choice. The lock detail ("so intricate it seemed to breathe") adds texture. Removing it would collapse the structure. However, its function is container-only; the safe itself doesn't resist or enable in a way unique to its form—a hidden drawer would serve similarly. Strong three-gate presence with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" operates as thematic echo—Liora realizes the sky "defied containment"—but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. The quest proceeds as straightforward retrieval; no false attempts, no encounter with her own limits that alters her approach. The concept is told at closure ("some things were not meant to be possessed") rather than dramatized through failure or friction. Present in the ending reflection but absent from middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes the target sketch and Liora's artistic ideal ("each stroke building upon the last"). It appears early as her pursuit and charges the climactic image when she sees the sketch's layered blues. The trait enables recognition (she understands why the guild hid it) and shapes her final choice (reverence over possession). However, "fractally precise" remains descriptor more than constraint—it doesn't force a tradeoff or limit her access. Two-gate presence (setup, closure charge) with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Crafting portraits is Liora's profession and frames her pursuit of the sky sketch, but on-page she performs quest actions (coin pressing, following map, opening safe) rather than crafting. Her artistic practice is told in exposition ("painted portraits not of faces, but of the spaces between them") and informs her philosophy at closure, but the major turns trace to navigation and discovery, not craft itself. The sketch she finds was crafted by others. Setup present; middle and closure participation indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coin with "faint indentations" appears early, and Liora's method (pressing into wax to reveal a map) is specific and functional. It drives the middle beat: "traced the indentations with her thumb… pressed the coin into a patch of soft wax… the spiral of dots now a clear path." Removing it would require a different navigation mechanism. However, it's used once and discarded; no reprise or complication. Two gates (setup, middle enabler) with single-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is seeded immediately ("cavernous hollow in the heart of the Old Scholar's Guild") and provides the spatial frame for the entire quest. The condemned status adds urgency (demolition at dawn), the shelves and shadows guide navigation, and the safe is hidden within its structure. Dawn light through cracks marks the closure beat. The setting supplies the map logic (tree's veins) and the reverence atmosphere. Three-gate presence with modest causal pressure—mostly container, but the demolition timeframe and map-as-tree integration elevate function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "hush just before" demolition at dawn is signaled early ("slated for demolition at dawn") and the final paragraph confirms "the first faint glow of dawn crept through the cracks." The timeframe establishes why the library is abandoned and why Liora acts now. However, no on-page clock tightens her choices—she moves deliberately without time pressure altering tactics. The hush/stillness motif charges tone but the deadline itself is backdrop. Two gates (setup, closure timestamp) with minimal tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is Liora's lifelong artistic goal, stated explicitly ("spent her life trying to mirror the sky inside walls") and tested at closure when she finds a sketch that achieves it. The motivation frames her quest and her final renunciation (the sky defies containment). However, it's exposition-heavy and not dramatized through conflicting wants—no scene where she struggles between capturing and revering. The desire is clear but not shown under pressure until the very end. Two gates (setup, closure friction) with modest dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is coherent throughout: "drawn to stillness, to the moments just before something irrevocable happened," "silent except for the creak of settling wood," "pulse steady, movements deliberate." Tone modulates subtly—building anticipation through the quest, expanding at the sketch's revelation, then contracting to quiet resolve. The hush-before-demolition frame and Liora's contemplative interior sustain the effect without lapsing into action-mode syntax. The tone directly charges the final image of witnessing rather than possessing. Strong thematic and rhythmic integration across all beats.</comment>
