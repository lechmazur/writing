<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("the girl who waits for nothing," her seven years listening to sky whispers), and her hierarchy of values—favoring listening over noise—creates the central tension. The moment she lets the rope slip, then grabs it when the storm changes, shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with visible cost. Minor weaknesses: the priests and villagers remain abstractions, and some emotion is told rather than embodied ("her shoulders relaxing"). The final kneeling posture and bone-deep vibration ground the climax effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Veythari sanctuary, dawn, storm approaching) within the first ~100 words. The piece operates under a Causal lens: Liora's wire-swap decision creates the condition where only she can sound the alarm, her misjudgment (letting the rope slip) immediately produces consequence (the storm changing), and her recovery (pulling the rope) prevents disaster. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she returns to listening with visible cost ("she had been wrong") and the resolution earns Charged Poise: the storm will pass, and she will listen again, her stance crystallized by near-failure. The cost is felt in her acknowledgment and the trembling sanctuary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary, thin sharp air, cold flagstones, and bronze bell create a coherent spatial frame. The rope itself—frayed, copper-wired, pooling beside her—functions as micro-setting that constrains her choice: she mended it herself, it's her tool, and gripping it is the sole mechanism for the siren. The storm's sensory progression (wind howl, rain soft-then-hard, lightning crack) modulates with pressure and the final image charges the ending when she feels the bell's vibrations through the flagstones. Minor limits: the cathedral's interior remains somewhat abstract, and the villagers below are never visualized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to sound the alarm—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Liora judges the storm weeping, releases the rope, then the storm "changes its mind" and she must act. The escalation is causal (her misjudgment narrows her window) and the cost is legible on the page ("she had been wrong, but she had been listening"). The piece enters the 7-band because the tightening forecloses a path with felt consequence. It does not reach higher because the secondary pressures (priests' installation, villagers' safety) remain somewhat abstract and the wire-swap itself, while clever, doesn't constrain the climax as tightly as it might.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—listening versus premature noise, trust in expertise versus institutional reflex—emerges through concrete events: the wire swap, the rope released, the storm's reversal, and Liora's return to listening despite near-failure. The final image ("The storm would pass. And when it did, she would listen again") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Minor ceiling: the priests' "favored noise over listening" is told rather than fully dramatized, and the thematic payoff leans slightly declarative in "she had favored listening over noise, and it had nearly cost her everything."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is character-specific ("the way the air hummed, the way the birds fell silent"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with rhythm modulating under pressure (short beats at the crack, longer reflection afterward). No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Minor slips: "credibly curious" is a slightly external label, and the line "Not in the way of scholars…but in the way of someone who…" edges toward explaining rather than showing. Psychic distance is intentional and clear throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening ("windblown sanctuary…clouds coiled like sleeping serpents") and closing beats are propulsive and imagistic. Minor deductions: "The rope was frayed at the edges, its fibers stiff after the glue dried" and the backstory block on microclimate tracking slightly stall early momentum. A few near-loops appear ("She had been…she had been…") and the phrase "credibly curious" reads slightly academic for the voice. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so penalty remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—storm watcher who swaps wires to control the alarm—offers a specific angle on the "lone expert versus institutional reflex" template. The twist (storm changes after she judges it safe) is earned by prior setup and feels inevitable in hindsight. Freshness is moderate: the "listener who waits for nothing" nickname and the microclimate tracking add texture, but the core arc (misjudgment → correction → renewed commitment) follows a familiar shape. The final image and the rope-mending detail provide grounded particularity that lift the piece above generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora appears early (paragraph 1), drives the wire-swap decision (middle), and her choice to release then pull the rope creates the key reversal and closure. Her humility is embodied in "the girl who waits for nothing" and her self-taught mending. She is present across all three gates, and her final return to listening shapes the ending image. The causal pressure is strong: remove her agency and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rope appears in paragraph 1 (pooling beside her, frayed and copper-wired), is handled in the climax (gripped, released, then pulled), and its physical state (mended by her, poor substitute) constrains her relationship to the sanctuary. It returns with reweighted meaning in the final beat when she feels the bell's vibrations through her bones. Present in all three gates with evolving tactile and symbolic charge. High irreplaceability: the rope's specific repair and her intimate knowledge drive the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is explicitly named midway ("today was zero hour") and frames the culminating storm. It shapes stakes (the storm is finally upon them) and tightens Liora's decision window. Participation in closure: the moment she pulls the rope is the zero-hour test realized. Missing early setup (the phrase arrives late) and some late-arrival friction, but the concept does redefine options and charges the climax. Strong middle and closure presence lift the score despite delayed signal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is named in paragraph 4 and described (tracking microclimate variations, scribbled observations). It enables her expertise—her ability to judge the storm—but the trait itself doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost; rather, it backstops her misjudgment. The curiosity is more character color than causal lever. Present in setup and development, minimal closure participation. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "experienced" or "observant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wire swap is introduced in paragraph 6 ("she had swapped the wires"), frames the central stakes (only she can sound the siren), and is the condition that makes the climax possible. Without it, the priests' automated system would trigger regardless, and her listening versus noise conflict vanishes. Present in setup (explained), development (creates the condition), and closure (her pull is the sole mechanism). High causal necessity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tracking microclimate variations" is named in paragraph 4 and described (noting wind shifts, cloud patterns, years of observations). It provides backstory texture and justifies her expertise, but the actual mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized in the climax. She listens to "the silence beneath" and "the rhythm of the rain," but we don't see her apply a specific tracking method on the page. Functional setup, weak development, absent from closure. Swappable with generic "years of experience."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary is anchored early (spine of the world, thin sharp air, cold flagstones, bronze bell) and its windblown nature matters: the storm's physical assault (wind screaming, rain lashing, sanctuary trembling) pressures Liora's choice and reinforces the stakes. The height and isolation are integral to her role. The setting participates in all three gates and the final image (flagstones, vibrations) charges the closure. Modest deduction for some postcard-like description in the opening, but overall the environment constrains and shapes action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" appears in paragraph 2, referencing the rope repair. It signals a completed past action rather than tightening present decisions. The phrase does not create a live clock or alter tactics in the climax. The storm's arrival provides the real timeframe pressure, not the glue-drying. Present in setup (mentioned), absent from development and closure. Ornamental and easily removable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To favor listening over noise" is dramatized through the wire swap (a rebellion against the priests' alarm reflex), her decision to release the rope (judging the storm weeping), and the final cost when she admits error but returns to listening. The motivation creates friction between want (trust her judgment) and cost (nearly fails the villagers), and it shapes the ending image. Present across all three gates with visible trade-offs. High causal integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Solstice hush" as tone: the piece opens with quiet, contemplative pacing (clouds coiling, stone and silence) and maintains a reverent atmosphere even as the storm builds. The tone modulates under pressure—short, clipped beats at the crack—then returns to hushed reflection in the final paragraph. The hush charges the final image (kneeling, feeling vibrations, waiting again). Present in setup and closure, though the middle storm sequence strains against the hush slightly. Coherent and purposeful, but not indispensable; a different tonal choice could work with minor edits.</comment>
