<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to understand the shape of home") is poetic but remains abstract; his interior state is heavily told through mercury-glass metaphors rather than embodied contradiction. The visions and mercury pooling read as ornamental attributes without forcing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The feather-stone sequence offers action, but the final "understanding" arrives as assertion ("home wasn't a place to return to, but a shape to carve") rather than earned through on-page renunciation with visible cost. Interiority leans into label-speak ("the ache of a talent buried too deep") at key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mercury imagery, feather texture, and labyrinth motifs accumulate toward the stone encounter. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive promptly; the three-year span and dream-to-descent structure provide coherence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the feather dissolves, mountain rearranges, Elias "understands"), but cost remains conceptual and off-page—no foreclosed path is legible in the final image. The "thunder he'd always heard wasn't hidden—it was waiting to be named" offers thematic assertion rather than a felt price, weakening the closure under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore hybrid is vivid and purposeful: "shelves of books that spiraled upward in impossible geometry" anchors early, and the labyrinth's breathing walls create pressure. The feather's opalescent texture and the stone's hum are used across beats (journal, descent, stone touch), constraining Elias's path. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and root chamber. The setting charges the final image (walls shifting, labyrinth rearranging), meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure, though the mercury-veins metaphor occasionally drifts into ornamental register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand home / find the stone) is signaled early and coheres. The feather-journal map discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elias's path. The descent escalates sensory pressure ("mercury in his blood surging," stairs to tunnels to mouths), but coincidence—finding the stone exactly where the map leads—resolves the search without protagonist trade-off. The stone-touch revelation and feather dissolution occur, but no live option is foreclosed; Elias gains understanding without visible sacrifice, reducing cost legibility under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (buried talents, home as shape) emerges from the stone's language-flood and the labyrinth's rearrangement. The final assertion "home wasn't a place to return to, but a shape to carve" leans toward direct statement rather than image-driven resonance. Subtext operates in the feather's dissolving and the mountain's sigh, but the protagonist articulates the theme explicitly in the penultimate line, reducing earned complexity. The "thunder waiting to be named" offers atmospheric closure but remains metaphorically inert—its referent is unclear and does not reweight prior particulars with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric register ("mercury-glass seer," "teeth ache," "fingers like brittle twigs"), though elevated diction occasionally overreaches ("slithered into his skin," "raw material of memory"). Internal thought is clean, with controlled free indirect style. The bookstore owner's single line of dialogue ("You're seeding something") feels oracular and voice-distinct. Under peak stress (descent), compression is acceptable, but the final paragraph's thematic articulation ("home wasn't a place... but a shape") reads as authorial summary rather than Elias's embodied perception, pulling distance at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("The stone was there, nestled in the roots of the mountain like a second heart"). Figurative language is frequent: mercury veins, opalescent feather, breathing walls, tunnels-as-mouths cluster densely without always advancing pressure—apply −0.4 for density in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase-loop check: "understand the shape of home" / "home wasn't a place to return to, but a shape to carve" restates across paragraphs without added cost—apply −0.2. Mixed metaphor: "language flooded him, not in words but in sensation" mixes liquid (flooded) with abstract categories (sensation), reducing clarity. No severe template cadence or scaffold, but cumulative figurative density and one loop lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore premise and mercury-glass seer attribute offer fresh visual synthesis. However, the emotional arc (lost → questing → understanding) and the feather-as-key / stone-as-answer structure follow a familiar treasure-hunt template without transformation through character flaw or moral calculus. The "buried talents" concept and home-as-shape resolution lean abstract and thematically generic; removing Elias's specific traits and swapping in a different seeker would leave the arc largely intact. No bold risk charges the final image; the labyrinth rearranging itself offers spectacle but not earned inevitability from prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias (mercury-glass seer) is present throughout and frames the quest. He presses the feather to journal (one beat), descends clutching the feather (one beat), and touches the stone (closure beat)—three beats, but decisions are reactive rather than creating turns. The visions and mercury trait are told, not dramatized as choices that alter tactics. Setup is early, middle development is functional, closure participation is present but passive (understanding arrives, he does not choose between competing options). Causal pressure is weak; his agency does not narrow the outcome. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (passive) +0.4, swappability −0.6, ornamental trait use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone is seeded in dreams (setup), referenced in the journal sketch (middle beat), and touched at closure where it floods Elias with sensation and dissolves the feather. Three beats; setup early +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (enables final understanding) +0.8, cost connection (feather dissolves into it) +0.4. However, the stone's properties are static description at closure—"taste of rain on stone, sound of a door closing"—rather than enabling a choice under stress; the flood is passive reception. Swappability: any mystical artifact could deliver the revelation with minor edits −0.6. Cameo at ending without reweighting prior material −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Buried talents: journal phrase appears mid-story, the stone's language flood includes "the ache of a talent buried too deep to ever bloom," and the final line references "talents" collectively. Setup delayed to second third −0.3, two beats (journal, stone touch) +0.9, closure linkage (thematic statement in final image) +0.7. However, the concept functions as theme rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics—Elias does not confront a specific talent he buried or choose to unbury one with cost. Label-only at key beats −0.3, no causal pressure beyond thematic resonance −0.8, summary-only at closure −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Substitutes reality nightly: dreams claw at Elias, leaving "waking hours a patchwork of truths he could no longer trust," and deeper in the mountain "reality frayed at the edges, mercury surging." Setup early +0.5, two beats (dreams, descent) +0.9, but the attribute is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment where a substitution forces Elias to choose between competing perceptions with cost. It colors atmosphere but does not constrain a tactic. Causal pressure absent −1.0, label-only trait −0.3, ornamental use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Seed: the bookstore owner says "You're seeding something" when she finds Elias with the feather; the feather later dissolves "into threads of light that seeped into the stone," and the mountain rearranges. Setup by first third +0.5, two beats (owner's line, feather dissolution) +0.9, closure linkage (feather seeds the stone, enabling transformation) +1.0, causal pressure (the seeding triggers the labyrinth shift) +0.9. However, the action is passive at closure—Elias does not choose to seed; the feather dissolves in his grip. Swappability: the owner's declaration feels oracular convenience; "seeding" could be replaced with "awakening" or "binding" without major edits −0.6. Summary of key involvement (the transformation happens off-page or in summary) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Via the texture of a feather: the feather's barbs shimmer, Elias presses it to his wrist (tilt), to the journal spine (map reveal), clutches it during descent (guidance), and it dissolves at stone-touch. Setup early +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (texture guides like divining rod, enables map, charges descent) +1.0, closure linkage (dissolution into stone) +1.0, specificity (opalescent, barbs) +0.5. However, the mechanics remain vague—how does pressing the feather to the journal make ink rearrange? The method is asserted, not demonstrated with cost. No visible trade-off for using it −0.6, ornamental description in key beats (shimmer, barbs prick) without altering choice −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain: established in opening line, navigated for three years, houses rare manuscripts and hidden heart-chamber, descent through shifting geometry, roots hold the stone, walls rearrange at closure. Setup immediate +0.8, five beats (opening, owner's rare-manuscripts section, hidden journals, descent, stone chamber, final shift) easily exceeds +1.4, causal pressure (labyrinth structure constrains Elias's search, descent escalates) +1.2, closure linkage (walls shift, labyrinth rearranges) +1.4, irreplaceability (impossible geometry, breathing walls specific) +0.7. Spatial choreography clear; micro-setting (body in cot, feather to wrist, stone in roots) alters tactics and charges final image. Cost: three-year search, descent's reality-fray.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After remembering becomes painful: implied by "visions substituting reality nightly," the dreams that "clawed at his ribs," and "After remembering becomes painful, you don't stop—you dig deeper" (direct statement mid-story). Setup by second third +0.3, one beat (the assertion and dream pain) +0.4, thematic presence at closure (the stone's flood is painful: "teeth ache," "ache of a talent buried") +0.5. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no live clock, no escalating cost of continued remembering on-page. The phrase is a thematic label rather than a stake constraint. Label-only −0.3, no causal pressure on tactics −0.8, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To understand the shape of home: stated explicitly mid-story ("His motivation was simple... to understand the shape of home"), Elias traces the map thinking of home "not as a place, but as a shape," and the final realization repeats the phrase. Setup by first third (implicit in dreams, explicit by second third) −0.2 for delay, three beats (motivation statement, descent thought, closure assertion) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. However, the motivation is told and restated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—Elias never chooses between home and another desire. Told-only trends −0.8, no friction between wants −0.6, label-speak at closure −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hidden thunder: appears only in the final sentence ("the thunder he'd always heard wasn't hidden—it was waiting to be named"), with no prior cue. Setup absent (introduced in closure line only) −1.0, one beat (final assertion) +0.4, closure linkage (caps the ending) +0.7. Tone throughout is lyric-mysterious with accumulating dread (dreams claw, walls breathe, mercury surges), modulating with descent pressure—coherent but not charged by the "thunder" image, which arrives as a metaphor without referent. The thunder is asserted, not demonstrated through sound, rhythm, or prior sensory cue. Late element resolving a problem it did not create → cap 3.0, but closure participation lifts it. Ornamental −0.5, swappability (could be "music" or "voice") −0.5.</comment>
