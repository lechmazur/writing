<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal state is present but largely told through exposition about nerve regeneration and past trauma rather than contradictory impulses acting in the present scene. His motivation to understand "the cost of safety" remains abstract until the final beats. The signing exchanges with Madame Veyra offer some embodied choice, but the protagonist functions more as investigator than agent under pressure—he observes, follows clues, and finally turns away without a visible cost that forecloses a live option. Emotional progression relies on summary of past silence rather than present embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the discoloration thread, missing bolt, and practice-room reveal build density toward a thematic reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure attempts Charged Poise—Elias rejects Madame Veyra's offer and vows to pursue the unanswered question—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no visible price is paid in the final image, and the piece ends on declaration rather than a reweighted constraint or loss. The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where Elias forfeits access, safety, or standing by placing the sheet back and leaving.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, parchment-and-rust air, and dusty spiral staircase anchor place and tone effectively. The missing bolt and the sheet music function as micro-setting objects that constrain investigation. The practice room's transformation (piano replaced by chair and stand) charges the final confrontation. Snow muffles outside sound while fortress silence "presses against his ears," supporting both POV filter and thematic pressure. The staircase discoloration guides Elias's route and shapes his choices across multiple beats, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why the choir was silenced—is signaled early and pursued through investigation. The missing bolt functions as a tightening that narrows Elias's path to confrontation with Madame Veyra. However, escalation remains largely epistemic: Elias learns the fortress erases evidence, but no live option is foreclosed on the page. His final choice to leave without answering Madame Veyra's offer reads as refusal, yet no visible price or trade-off is dramatized—he simply walks away with resolve intact. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, but cost clarity at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as institutional control versus the need for truth—emerges organically from the investigation and Madame Veyra's "cost of safety" line. The sheet music, empty staff lines, and the last sung note before collapse recur with purpose. "Some silences are necessary" versus Elias's refusal sets up moral tension. However, the ending articulates theme through Madame Veyra's dialogue ("The cost of safety is forgetting") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material without statement. The final paragraph leans toward declaration—"the question remained"—rather than an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices discoloration, empty bolt holes, off-key humming. The signing exchanges with Madame Veyra are clean and advance goals. Diction suits the gothic-investigative frame—"seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope"—though a few phrases ("curated stillness," "unpardonable silence") edge toward elevated register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the confrontation. Elias's silence (inability to speak) motivates the use of sign language and filters perception through listening rather than vocal response, maintaining voice coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong images: "towers clawing at the twilight like frozen fingers," "silence was a living thing." However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The absence was deliberate—someone had removed it, and he knew who" immediately follows the empty-hole discovery without added pressure. "The cost of safety is forgetting" and "some silences are necessary" are near-synonyms within two paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He took the paper… He placed the sheet music… And he would not let it go unanswered." Filter verbs ("seemed," "recognized," "realized") cluster in expository passages. Figurative density in the opening—"choked," "clawing," "seraphically mundane," "living thing"—remains controlled, but mixed register ("curated stillness" beside "bellhop") creates minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The silent-choir accident, nerve regeneration during employment, and institutional coverup offer specific grounding. The missing bolt as investigation anchor and sign-language exchanges provide fresh texture. However, the core frame—lone investigator uncovers institutional silencing of past trauma, confronts authority figure who articulates the cost of safety, then vows to pursue truth—follows a familiar template without decisive transformation. Madame Veyra's dialogue makes theme explicit rather than letting image or choice embody it. The ending's vow to continue the quest is earnest but predictable; no bold risk or synthesis reweights the familiar elements into an inevitable, non-obvious whole.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (silent-choir bellhop) is POV throughout; his job during nerve regeneration is signaled early. He traces the discoloration, discovers the missing bolt, follows the trail to Madame Veyra, and ultimately rejects her offer by placing the sheet music back and leaving. Two functional beats: discovery and confrontation. However, his choices are investigative rather than under competing pressure; the final decision to leave is a vow rather than a trade-off with visible cost. The "bellhop" detail and nerve-regeneration frame appear but do not constrain tactics or charge the closure image beyond backstory. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal role in two beats; swappable with "custodian" or "attendant" with minor edits. Round down: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt is introduced early ("single bolt on the bench had loosened"), discovered missing in the inciting beat, and explicitly tied to Madame Veyra's erasure of imperfections. It functions as the clue that launches the confrontation and is framed as "a question" in the ending paragraph. Three beats: introduction, discovery, thematic reprise. However, the bolt itself is not handled after the discovery; Elias brushes "fingers over the empty hole" but the object is gone. The ending recalls it conceptually—"the bolt was gone, but the question remained"—charging the final image with reweighted meaning. Setup, development, closure participation all present; causal pressure in two beats; closure linkage earns credit. Swappability: minor; the "loose then missing" arc is specific. Round down: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" is named twice: once in paragraph 3 ("the boundary between curated stillness and the unpardonable silence beneath it") and again in paragraph 11 ("The unpardonable silence had begun there"). It frames theme but does not constrain on-page choices; Elias's investigation proceeds via the bolt and discoloration rather than the silence itself. The concept is told rather than dramatized as a lived pressure. Present in setup and middle as a thematic label; absent from the ending, which pivots to "the question remained." No middle development that alters tactics; no closure participation. Missing middle-choice gate caps at 3.4; lyric reprise across first and middle paragraphs lifts slightly. Round down: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" appears once in paragraph 2 to describe the fortress air ("old parchment and rust, a seraphically mundane blend"). It establishes atmospheric tone but does not constrain or enable any action. The phrase is ornamental descriptor; removing it changes no choice or cost. Present in setup only; missing middle development and closure gates. Ornamental use −0.7; no beat involvement; no causal pressure. Round down: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Remain" is the action Elias takes after the confrontation: "Elias remained motionless for a long moment, listening" (paragraph 9) and implicitly in the ending when he "placed the sheet music back on the stand and turned to leave"—choosing to remain uncommitted to Madame Veyra's terms and remain in pursuit of the question. The first instance shows embodied stillness under pressure; the second (implicit) defines his stance at closure. Two beats; causal pressure in that the act of remaining and then departing signals refusal without capitulation. However, swappability is moderate—"stood," "paused," or "waited" could substitute with minor tonal loss. Setup (paragraph 9), closure linkage (final act of placing and leaving), causal role in stance crystallization. Round down: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" is the method Elias uses to trace the truth. Introduced in paragraph 3 ("slight discoloration on the dusty spiral staircase… a rusted streak"), pursued for weeks, and followed up the staircase to the practice room in paragraph 10. The discoloration shapes his route and enables the confrontation. Two beats: introduction and the climb. Mechanics matter: the visual clue is specific and motivates movement. However, it functions as passive trail rather than active constraint; Elias never interacts with it beyond following. Present in setup and middle; absent from closure image. Causal enabler; moderate irreplaceability (any subtle mark could serve). Round down: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "cobalt fortress under snow" anchors setting from the opening line and recurs: snow muffles sound (paragraph 9), fortress interior smells of parchment and rust, halls guide Elias's route, and the practice room's transformation (piano removed) pressures the confrontation. The fortress as institution embodies the theme of curated silence. Snow and cold underscore isolation and the nerve-regeneration timeframe. The east wing, spiral staircase, and practice room constrain movement and frame the investigation. Setup, middle choreography, and closure scene all use the fortress. Micro-setting (practice room emptiness) charges the final image. Strong causal and atmospheric work; moderate irreplaceability (another institutional building could substitute). Round down: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"During nerve regeneration" is mentioned in paragraph 4 as the timeframe for Elias's employment and again obliquely when he reflects on "the period where every sensation was either absent or amplified into agony." It explains why he took the job and colors his embodied experience (cold, trembling suppressed). However, it does not tighten on-page decisions—no deadline, no worsening symptoms, no choice that hinges on nerve state. Present in setup as backstory; absent from middle tactics and closure. Provides motivation but not live pressure. Missing middle and closure gates; told rather than dramatized as constraint. Round down: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" is named in paragraph 4 and echoed in Madame Veyra's line, "The cost of safety is forgetting" (paragraph 13). It frames Elias's investigation and his final refusal. However, the desire is told in exposition rather than shown through conflicting wants—Elias pursues the truth without visible friction between safety and risk. The ending gesture (placing the sheet back and leaving) signals commitment, but no on-page cost is paid; he exits with resolve intact. Setup and closure linkage present; middle beats pursue the clue rather than testing the motivation under competing pressure. Functional but largely abstract. Round down: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears once in the final confrontation: "her eyes reflecting the frostbitten hope that still flickered in his chest" (paragraph 16). Tone is established through snow, cold, silence, and gothic diction (cobalt fortress, twilight, rust) and modulates subtly as Elias pursues the trail. The ending sustains the tone—resolve persists despite institutional erasure—but the single explicit tag feels late and told. Coherent across beats; the cold-silence atmosphere supports pressure. However, the phrase itself is not woven throughout, and the final image leans declarative rather than charged. Present in setup (implicit), middle (atmospheric), and tagged near closure. Moderate tonal integration; lyric return is weak. Round down: 6.1.</comment>
