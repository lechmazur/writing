<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Father Elias possesses concrete interiority through embodied ritual (violet on lips, loop pedal at feet), and his motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" shapes the arc. However, his internal contradiction remains abstract—"what assumptions had he buried?" is stated rather than enacted through conflicted micro-choices. The possession threat never materializes as a felt cost that forecloses options; by the end, he "wasn't frightened," defusing the stake without visible sacrifice. Emotional progression reads as steady revelation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "dimensional anchor" and "loop pedal priest" but not who/where/when clearly by ~120 words, though the disorientation doesn't serve closure and waives penalty given the pattern teaches a ritual frame. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (sound layering, violet spreading, stillness "revealed"), and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the revelation without a decisive physical act. Cost is implied ("the violet had spread") but remains conceptual rather than felt; pointing to "for the first time, he saw what it had been hiding" doesn't specify what was lost or foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs (the violet burn transitions to clarity), satisfying the length requirement, but the cost legibility is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is vivid ("walls hummed with the weight of unspoken truths," "nexus where realities brushed"), and the loop pedal, palette, and violet constrain ritual choices. Micro-setting qualifies: the palette's "single smear of color" and the pedal's physical presence anchor action. However, spatial choreography is vague—"chamber," "altar," "streets beyond" are named but never staged with distances or layout. The violet spreading across cheeks, throat, hands charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding possession/stillness before it completes—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the anchor groaned, its walls shifting," and the violet "burned now, not with pain, but with clarity." However, protagonist agency is passive: Father Elias layers sound and applies violet, but the revelation arrives ("he saw") without a decision that forecloses a path. Coincidence (the anchor's responsive trembling) complicates but does not resolve, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet the cost of his "risking the unraveling" never materializes as a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—stillness as mirror, silence as canvas—emerges through concrete ritual (loop layering, violet application) and avoids direct statement until "It was revealed." The final image offers a non-literal answer (the violet's spread equals the hidden truth made visible), but the central question "What if the possession wasn't something to fear?" resolves into acceptance without complexity or cost. The piece resists a tidy moral yet lacks counter-readings; the protagonist's arc (fear → clarity) is linear rather than contradictory. Heavy reliance on metaphor ("canvas," "mirror," "shroud") without grounding in a specific human struggle beyond ritual performance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "violet on his lips felt heavy," "the anchor groaned." Diction is voice-consistent (archaic register: "hollowed-out husk," "poorly stitched shroud") and purposeful compression ("Before the possession completes" as refrain). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats—"To illuminate hidden assumptions" and "muffled clarity of truth, half-heard, half-felt" read as thematic statement rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose reflects the ritual frame but occasionally sacrifices immediacy for lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats: "It was revealed" vs. longer layered sentences), and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the stillness had unraveled, fraying at the edges" is restated as "the canvas was cracking" without added pressure. Template cadence in the sound-layering sequence ("The first layer... Then came... Next, he added") stacks across three beats, triggering −0.4. Mixed metaphor: "shroud" (fabric) doesn't fray at "edges" in the same way "canvas" cracks. No filter-verb stacks or pronoun ambiguity. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (violet = ritual + visual motif), but scaffold phrases like "the question gnawed at him, sharp as a blade" add texture without advancing causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "loop pedal priest" and "dimensional anchor" premises are specific, but the emotional arc (fear of possession → acceptance) follows a familiar template: lone ritualist confronts abstract threshold and achieves clarity through layered symbolic action. The violet palette, sound looping, and spreading stain are fresh details, yet the transformation test fails—swap "loop pedal" for another ritual tool and "dimensional anchor" for another liminal space, and the plot holds unchanged. No bold risk; the piece hedges with abstract stakes ("possession," "stillness," "hidden assumptions") that never materialize as concrete consequences. The final revelation ("he saw what it had been hiding") withholds specificity, deflating originality into generic mysticism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Father Elias is present throughout and his ritual choices (applying violet, layering sound) drive beats. He appears early (setup ✓), his actions shape the middle escalation (development ✓), and he opens his eyes in the final image (payoff ✓). However, his decisions are procedural—executing a known ritual—rather than dilemma-driven. The key turn ("the words didn't frighten him") is internal acceptance, not a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (violet spreading) but not tied to a decision he makes. Present across beats but replaceable with another ritualist performing similar steps; agency is passive reception rather than active reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The palette with violet appears early (setup ✓), is handled twice (smearing lips, scraping with nail—development ✓), and its spread charges the final image (payoff ✓). The violet constrains his ritual (he uses only this color) and evolves (from "smear" to "burned" to "staining"). However, the palette itself is static; the violet does the work. Swappable with another ritual object bearing a single pigment. The nail-scrape adds a beat but doesn't alter his options. Specific detail (bruised violet, "scraped away") lifts it above ornamental, and the spreading violet reweights the ending, but the palette as object remains a vessel rather than a shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" is named early ("the stillness had unraveled") and reversed at closure ("The stillness wasn't unraveled. It was revealed."). This lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake. However, the concept is thematic gloss rather than a shaping constraint—"stillness" and "silence" are treated as interchangeable abstractions. It doesn't change tactics; Father Elias layers sound regardless. Present in setup and payoff (two-of-three gates), eligible for ~6.0, but the reversal is linguistic rather than consequential, and the on-page mechanics (sound layering) would work with any synonym for "quiet." Lyric resonance without causal pressure or specificity lowers it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" is told ("they said of him") but never shown constraining a choice. He layers sound, which is the opposite of decorating with silence. The attribute is ornamental backstory that doesn't enable or limit his on-page actions. Missing development and payoff gates; present only as thematic claim. Swappable with any synonym for "ritualist who uses sound." No cost tied to it. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Plumb" appears once: "a way to plumb the depths of his own hesitation." This motivates the ritual (he questions buried assumptions), shaping the middle turn where he asks "What do you fear?" (development ✓). It primes closure (the final revelation of hidden truth—payoff ✓), but is absent from setup (introduced mid-scene). The action is metaphorical—he doesn't literally plumb anything—so it's easily swappable with "explore" or "excavate." The lyric seed → final payoff (depths → hidden assumptions revealed) grants ~5.5–6.3 eligibility, but the vagueness and late signal cap it. One causal link (hesitation → layered questioning) lifts it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Through rhetorical devices" is stated once: "Through rhetorical devices, he shaped the silence." The named method is telling rather than shown—what rhetorical devices? The sound layering (repetition, looping, echo) could qualify, but the text doesn't signal them as rhetorical. Missing setup and development; appears only in one mid-scene sentence. The method doesn't constrain attempts or alter tactics; he layers sound before and after this mention. Ornamental claim without mechanics. Swappable with "through careful layering" or "through ritual." No cost or specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is named early (setup ✓) and described vividly ("nexus where realities brushed," "walls hummed," "groaned, its walls shifting"). It responds to his ritual (development ✓: "the anchor trembled"), but this is passive environmental reaction, not a constraint that alters his choices. It's present in the final image ("the anchor groaned") but doesn't charge or reweight the closure (payoff weak). Swappable with another liminal ritual space (temple, void, threshold) without changing tactics. The anchor's trembling adds atmosphere but doesn't pressure decisions or supply resources. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Before the possession completes" appears three times as a refrain (setup ✓, middle, and near-end), establishing urgency. However, the timeframe never tightens tactics—Father Elias proceeds at ritual pace, and by the end "the words didn't frighten him," deflating the clock. The possession never arrives or threatens; no visible countdown or narrowing window alters his moves. The timeframe is thematic framing rather than a live constraint. Missing development (no middle choice driven by time pressure) and payoff (the ending ignores the deadline). Ornamental urgency that doesn't track or escalate. Two gates at most (setup + weak thematic presence), capped below 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden assumptions" is stated early ("that was his motivation") and shapes the central question ("What assumptions had he buried?"). This desire drives the ritual layering (asking "What do you fear?") and primes the closure revelation ("he saw what it had been hiding"). Setup ✓, development ✓ (the questioning loop), payoff ✓ (final vision). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. No friction between this want and a competing cost—he pursues it steadily without sacrifice. The ending grants the desire without visible trade-off. Present across beats but lacks the specificity and felt cost needed for higher bands. Eligible for ~5.0–6.9 with all three gates, but told-only desire and absence of friction lower it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is named once late ("The muffled clarity of truth, half-heard, half-felt") and enacted throughout: the violet is "deep, bruised," the hum is "low and resonant," words become "distorted, layered." The tone is coherent (veiled revelation, filtered perception) and modulates from dread ("shiver through his spine") to calm certainty ("he wasn't frightened"). It charges the final image where the violet's spread equals the clarity breaking through. Setup is implicit (the opening's weighted silence teaches the tone), development ✓ (layered sound = muffled), payoff ✓ (clarity emerges muffled). However, "muffled clarity" as phrase arrives late (−0.2 to −0.5 for late signal), and the tone could be described as "veiled" or "obscured" without altering effect (swappability −0.4). Coherent modulation and closure linkage lift it into mid-6s.</comment>
