<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is anchored by seventeen years of silence and his perceptive witnessing of ghosts, but the interior remains largely observational rather than contradictory. The opening of the box is motivated by the ghost's insistence but the decision feels more compliant than torn. The woman ghost's recognition triggers weight in his ribs, a decent embodied moment, but the final act (scattering flower dust) reads passive. Backstory (seventeen-year silence, the traveler's gift) is economical and primes the present choice, staying within BRR allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph three (Elias, oasis, post-visibility era); the timeframe is inferred situational rather than causal-clock driven. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through gathering ghosts, the solid woman's arrival, and the box's opening, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he closes the box, releases the flower, accepts the lighter silence). The closure reweights "unspoken words" and "tangled covenant" with felt cost (the ghosts dissolve, his solitude shifts). One escalation point (woman ghost's insistence) narrows options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the line "lighter, as if the weight of the unspoken had been lifted" and the scattering gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is vivid and selective: cracked earth, skeletal trees, honeycomb husks, rusted frames anchor desolation and former life. The stained glass box on the warped table and the flower function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail (humming echo, bleeding sun, crumbling petals) is filtered through Elias's tranquil perception. The wasteland and oasis pressure his solitude choice and the box constrains the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving silence and the weight of unspoken words. The ghosts' gathering near the box and the woman's insistent gesture tighten pressure in one meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Elias's agency is quiet but present: he hesitates, lifts the lid, reads the message, closes the box, and releases the flower—choices that foreclose his prior covenant with visible cost (the ghosts dissolve, solitude shifts). The resolution is earned by his perception and the ghost's dramatized insistence. Cost is felt in the lighter silence and the acknowledged broken covenant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of silence, witnessing, and unspoken words made tangible through the bees/box/flower motif. The line "The bees remember what the living forget" reweights memory and preservation without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: some words are preserved by not being spoken, some covenants must break—earned through the ghost's witnessing and Elias's release gesture. Subtext operates in the woman's silent pointing and the flower's dust. The quiet closure reconfigures prior material (seventeen years, the traveler's gift) with resonance, avoiding thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's tranquil, perceptive stance. Diction is controlled: "tranquilly perceptive," "hollow eyes," "mute eloquence" fits the muted tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—he reads gestures, lips, contextual clues—and the prose rhythm modulates subtly (longer contemplative sentences early, shorter sentences at the box opening). No dialogue; the woman's gesture and flower communicate through action. No head-hopping, filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated ("He understood," "He recognized"). The final image ("lighter") recalibrates the interior texture without rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies without algorithmic runs; opening anchors voice ("a sea of cracked earth"), closing reweights covenant. Information density is high: each line advances setting, ghostly pressure, or Elias's stance. Minor phrase echoes ("the way their lips moved," "the way their fingers twitched") create intentional lyric pattern but edge toward template cadence in the middle third. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors; "bleeding into the horizon" is conventional but apt. The box-opening beat is clean and propulsive. Figurative language (candle-flame flicker, dying ember) is restrained and concrete. Overall clarity is strong with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The silent protagonist witnessing ghosts is a familiar frame, but the beekeeping oasis, stained glass box, and the covenant of unspoken words bring specificity. The ghost who tended bees returning with a flower and the message about bees remembering adds a fresh inflection. The "tranquilly perceptive" recluse avoiding speech for seventeen years is less common than the tormented mute. Transformation test: swap the setting and the resonance weakens, indicating some irreplaceability. The ending's quiet image (scattering petals, lighter silence) avoids bombast and feels earned rather than imposed, though the "tangled covenant" phrasing and final summary line edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (astonished recluse) is present throughout; his seventeen-year silence and choice to open the box after the woman's insistence shape two key beats (opening, scattering). Setup is immediate, development occurs when he hesitates and lifts the lid, payoff is the closure gesture. His observational tranquility is more dominant than astonishment, and the "astonished" label is not dramatized on the page. The recluse trait enables the plot (he chose the oasis for silence) but the final choice is more responsive than decisive transformation. Two gates solid, third is present but muted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in paragraph five (setup), ghosts gather near it (development beat one), Elias opens it (development beat two), and he closes it in the final paragraph (payoff). The box's bee-wing panels and the message inside reweight the bees/memory motif. It is handled on the page with "trembling hands" and "fingers lingering," and the closure gesture (closing the box after scattering petals) charges the final image. Three gates met, causal pressure present, closure linkage strong. Swappability is low; the bee imagery and "preserve" theme depend on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tangled covenant is named twice: "covenant between him and the world had always been tangled" and "some covenants...were meant to be broken." The concept shapes his seventeen-year silence and the ending acknowledges its breaking, but the "tangled" quality is asserted more than dramatized through competing obligations. Setup is present (silence for solitude for peace), but the middle does not show him wrestling with conflicting terms on the page. Payoff is thematic echo rather than a choice constrained by covenant mechanics. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive anchors Elias's stance in paragraph four and recurs in his gaze and understanding of the ghosts. Setup is clear. Development: his perception enables him to read the woman's gesture and "contextual clues" (the ghosts' twitching fingers, shaped words). Payoff: his calm acceptance of the lighter silence reflects the trait. The attribute enables plot progression (he reads intent without speech) but does not visibly cost him—tranquility could be a shield that delays action, yet that friction is not dramatized. Two gates met, third is present but weak on tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gaze is the dominant action: "Elias watched them tranquilly perceptive," "his gaze lingering," "Elias watched them through contextual clues," "her gaze meeting his." Setup and development are strong; gaze enables his witnessing and the recognition of the beekeeper woman. Payoff: implied in "his fingers lingering on the glass" but the final closure beat shifts to scattering and listening rather than gaze. The action is character-specific (silent recluse must read visually) and shapes two beats, but the ending's agency is kinetic (lifting, scattering) rather than perceptive. Strong middle, softer closure link.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Through contextual clues appears once as a phrase in paragraph six: "Elias watched them through contextual clues—the way their fingers twitched...the way their mouths shaped words." The method is named and demonstrated (reading gesture and silence), enabling his understanding of the ghosts' intent. Setup and development are present, but the mechanics do not recur at closure—the box's message is read directly, not inferred. The method enables one key beat (interpreting the gathering) but is not indispensable at the ending. Two gates, functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland is established in paragraph one and sustained through honeycomb husks, rusted frames, skeletal trees, and the hut. Setup is vivid. Development: the oasis is chosen for silence, and the bees/box motif grows from this setting. Payoff: the wind scattering flower dust and the lighter oasis silence charge the final image. The setting is irreplaceable (bee imagery, preservation theme) and pressures his solitude choice. Three gates met, causal and closure linkage strong, specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>After ghosts become visible is anchored in paragraph four: "Not since the night the ghosts became visible...They drifted now." The timeframe sets the premise (seventeen years post-event) and is sustained (ghosts gather, woman appears). Development: the ghost's solidity and insistence occur within this era. Payoff: her dissolution and the others following mark a shift within the post-visibility world. The timeframe enables the plot but does not create ticking-clock urgency; it is a situational given rather than a tactical constraint. Two gates met, closure participation present but the time itself does not tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To preserve the weight of unspoken words is dramatized in his seventeen-year silence, the traveler's gift phrase, and the ending lines. Setup is clear (silence for preservation). Development: the woman's gesture and the message test his commitment; he hesitates, feeling "the weight of his own unspoken words pressing against his ribs." Payoff: he closes the box and releases the flower, accepting that "some words were never meant to be spoken, only preserved." Friction between wants (preserve silence) and cost (ghosts dissolve, covenant breaks) is legible. Three gates met, causal pressure solid, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mute eloquence is sustained through the silent protagonist, ghosts with moving lips and no sound, the stained glass box's visual language, the woman's wordless gesture, and the flower. Setup is immediate and pervasive. Development: tone modulates from still observation to the heavier "weight...pressing against his ribs" to the lighter ending. Payoff: "the silence was different now—lighter" and the final image of scattering dust without speech charge the closure. Tone is coherent through pressure and the final reweighting. Three gates met, specificity high, closure charge strong.</comment>
