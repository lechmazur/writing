<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand Veyra's legacy is clear and her discovery of Mira's identity creates a credible turn. However, her interior life remains somewhat thin—her emotional response to learning Mira is Veyra's daughter is understated ("her pulse quickened") when the moment warrants deeper contradiction or cost. The final choice to "listen" feels more like thematic alignment than a decision that forecloses a visible path. Mira's long deception and her reason for maintaining it ("some truths are too heavy to carry alone") arrive as exposition rather than embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (rooftop, Elara, post-Veyra's death, weekly ritual). The causal lens holds: Elara finds the seal → Mira recognizes it → revelation of shared legacy → agreement to act. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the two agree to listen under the meteor shower, crystallizing their shared purpose. However, the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than visibly paid on the page; the "weight of the past finally lifting" tells rather than shows a trade-off or sacrifice in the present moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower create a vivid, purposeful frame that anchors the ritual and charges the ending image. Sensory details are selective—silver trails, embroidered constellations, ceramic bowl—and filtered through Elara's attention. The seal's brass texture and worn edges recur meaningfully. The city's towers and spires become an active element when the two decide to "listen" to the buildings, tying setting to stakes. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Veyra's hidden legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reveals her identity and the "agreed-upon lie." However, the escalation is primarily revelatory rather than a narrowing of options under pressure. Elara's agency at closure is agreement rather than a choice with visible cost; no tactic is visibly altered or path foreclosed on the page. The phrase "some truths are too heavy to carry alone" gestures at cost but does not dramatize what Elara or Mira must give up to pursue this new path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of hidden legacy and "agreed-upon lies" emerges organically from the seal, the tutor relationship, and Mira's long deception. The meteor shower and the language of buildings create resonant images that avoid overt moralizing. However, the ending leans toward thematic statement—"let's listen" and "the weight of the past finally lifting"—rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material through image alone. The concept of buildings speaking is intriguing but remains abstract; it is asserted rather than demonstrated through a specific architectural detail that constrains or reveals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—tracing embroidered constellations, noting Mira's "interrogation" style—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, especially Mira's gentle persistence and the recognition scene. The phrase "patiently nimble" applied to Mira's voice is a minor register bump but serves thematic purpose. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening at the seal reveal and softening at the reflective close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, world, or stakes. Minor issues: "the whisper of falling stars" is slightly generic, and "her voice patiently nimble" mixes metaphor oddly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The line "the weight of the past finally lifting into something new" borders on abstraction but does not obscure causality. Overall, line-level craft supports momentum without significant drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—two students of a dead language tutor discover their shared secret legacy—offers a fresh angle on mentor-legacy narratives. The detail of the language of architecture is specific and intriguing. However, the weekly tea ritual as a cover for connection, the hidden seal, and the meteor-shower reveal follow familiar beats. The "agreed-upon lie" is conceptually interesting but remains under-explored; the story does not fully transform the trope through unique lived detail or an unexpected moral calculus. The ending crystallizes intent but stops short of an earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Master Veyra is dead before the story begins and appears only in reflection. His teachings frame Elara's motivation and his hidden seal triggers the plot, but he makes no on-page choices. His presence seeds the stakes but does not constrain or enable a turn through dramatized agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The desk seal is found early, held and examined by Elara, recognized by Mira, and matched with Mira's identical seal. It appears in at least three beats and drives the revelation. However, its symbolic weight—etched with building symbols—does not constrain a specific tactical choice or visibly alter the ending image beyond its presence. It enables recognition but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "agreed-upon lie" is named explicitly by Mira and frames the shared deception about Veyra's work. It shapes the backstory and motivates Mira's long silence. However, it remains thematic rather than a live constraint that narrows options on the page. The two characters agree to move beyond the lie, but the cost of maintaining or breaking it is not dramatized in a specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is applied to Mira's voice in one line and reinforces her careful persistence. It does not constrain an action, create a trade-off, or return with reweighted meaning. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a specific micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mira's gentle, persistent questions are described as "interrogation," and the text notes her way of asking "felt like an interrogation." The action is present and characterizes Mira's approach, but no single interrogative beat drives a key turn. Elara's realization comes from Mira's recognition of the seal, not from a specific question that alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The borrowed sugar ritual is signaled early and recurs across "months" and "every Wednesday," establishing the cover relationship. It shapes Mira's access to Elara and provides the frame for the rooftop meeting. The method enables the revelation but does not impose a cost or complicate the final choice. Its mechanics are clear and causally functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower frame the entire scene, anchor the weekly ritual, and charge the ending image when the two sit under the falling stars. The setting reflects Elara's grief and provides a space for the reveal. However, it does not constrain a choice—the conversation could occur elsewhere with minor edits. The garden's herbs and the city's towers gesture at thematic resonance but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to learn the language of buildings is present from the opening—she speaks to Veyra "in the only way she knew how—through the old tongue." It motivates her grief ritual and her interest in the seal. However, the friction between this want and any competing cost or fear is not dramatized. The final agreement to "listen" fulfills the motivation without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tone blends ritual familiarity (weekly visits, tea sessions) with mystery (the hidden seal, Mira's true identity). The opening's lyrical frame and the gradual reveal maintain coherence. The tone modulates appropriately as recognition builds, tightening at the seal moment and softening into the reflective close. The final image—sitting under the meteor shower—charges the mysterious familiarity without breaking the established register.</comment>
