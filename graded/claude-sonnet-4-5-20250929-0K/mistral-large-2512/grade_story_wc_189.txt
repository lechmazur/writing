<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and specific—"trying to discover the texture of time" shows a particular perceptual signature. Her decision to return to the surface reads as motivated, though the interior contradiction between avoidance and engagement could be sharper. The brother's off-stage presence functions as pressure but his status as secondary character is never dramatized on the page. The final choice to climb back feels earned but the visible cost remains oblique—what path is foreclosed is more conceptual than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (grotto, tidal pool, Liora). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the cicada's handling, the dream-memory, and the sinking moment, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cicada as key, the door in the silence she left behind). The closure reweights prior material with conceptual cost—she must return to the unfinished conversation—but the felt price is muted. One meaningful deepening (the cicada sinking, the face beneath) suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "damp walls glistening like the skin of a sleeping beast," "lacework of salt crystals." The tidal pool constrains Liora's action—she places the cicada back into it, watches it sink—and the setting charges the final image: she climbs back "toward the surface." Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The stars function as witnesses in the opening and closing lines, a purposeful reprise that reweights the frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Liora's avoidance of the brother's question—is signaled early and pressure tightens when the cicada vanishes and she realizes "the door it opened wasn't in the grotto, but in the silence she had left behind." Her agency is renunciation of continued avoidance, an Earned Stasis that forecloses further escape. The cost is legible: she must face the pause. One meaningful tightening (the cicada sinking, the realization) suffices under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the grotto as "a place of transition periods," the cicada as key, the texture of time. The final image offers a non-literal answer—"the door it opened wasn't in the grotto, but in the silence she had left behind"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. The cicada's transformation (warm after the dream, sinking through the silt) accumulates pressure. Subtext operates in the brother's "forced casualness" and the "taut thread" of the pause. Minor slip: "So was time" in the final line edges toward thematic echo without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices "the way a hermit crab hesitated before choosing a new shell" and approaches mysteries "through tangential paths, circling them like a crab sidling toward a shadow." Diction remains character-particular and purposeful throughout. Psychic distance modulates intentionally—close during the dream-memory, pulling back slightly at the realization. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythmic control is strong; the prose breathes with the scene's needs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Minor loop detected: "She didn't understand it, but she didn't need to—not yet" slightly recycles earlier interiority about approaching mysteries tangentially. "The stars were still watching. So was time" reads as elevated diction that edges toward thematic convenience but remains voice-plausible. No template cadence, no paraphrase runs. Clarity and propulsion are strong throughout; the prose earns its figurative density without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler as protagonist offers a fresh angle, and the jade cicada as portal-key transforms a familiar magical-object trope through specific handling (veins that "seemed to pulse," sinking "through" the silt rather than into it). The tangential-approach method is character-specific. Risk distinction: the quiet, lyric closure where realization replaces confrontation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Mild derivative pressure: the ancient-object-as-bridge premise is widely used, though the grounding in naturalist observation and the off-stage conversation provide some transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora appears throughout and her choices drive beats: she places the cicada in the pool, watches it sink, and decides to return to the surface. However, her role as "tidal-pool chronicler" is more identity than action-driver—her observation shapes perception but the key turn hinges on the cicada's behavior and her realization, not on chronicling itself. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but the occupational detail does not constrain the climactic choice. Mid-band: functional across beats but the specific title could be swapped for "naturalist" or "observer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jade cicada is handled in multiple beats: found weeks ago, studied for days, held and felt warm after the dream, placed into the pool, and watched as it sinks and vanishes. It drives the middle turn (the sinking, the face beneath) and shapes the closure realization ("the cicada hadn't been a message for her. It had been a key"). Early signal, beat involvement (three distinct touches), and closure linkage all present. The object's unique properties (veins that pulse, warmth, sinking *through* silt) matter causally. Strong integration, though removing it would require rewriting the realization beat rather than collapsing the entire story.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transition periods" is explicitly named ("The grotto was a place of transition periods—between tides, between breaths, between the things people said and the things they meant") and shapes the story's stakes: Liora is in the pause between her brother's question and her answer. The concept pressures her avoidance and the closure hinges on recognizing the pause as the true door. Present in setup (the definition), middle (the texture-of-time observation), and closure (the silence she left behind). However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than as a constraint that alters tactics on the page. Solid lyric reprise with conceptual cost, but the mechanics remain oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is illustrated through concrete examples: noticing the hermit crab's hesitation, the salt-crystal lacework, the way light catches the cicada's edges. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost—Liora's observations enrich texture but the climactic decision to return is driven by the cicada's revelation, not by her observational warmth. Present in setup and development (her study of the cicada) but absent from closure participation. The attribute could be replaced with "patient" or "meticulous" without structural change. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears only in the dream-memory ("she had seen the grotto as it was centuries ago") and does not shape the ending. The dream informs Liora's understanding but the action itself—foreseeing—is passive reception rather than a tactical choice. The major turn (the cicada sinking, the realization) does not trace to foreseeing; Liora's decision to return is motivated by the cicada's behavior and her sudden understanding, not by prophecy or vision. Summary-only use with no causal pressure at closure. Late first appearance (second third) and ornamental role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through tangential approach" is explicitly signaled: "Liora had always approached mysteries through tangential paths, circling them like a crab sidling toward a shadow." The method is dramatized in her decision to observe the cicada's effects rather than grasping its purpose directly, and she places it back into the pool to watch what happens. Present in setup and middle development. However, the method does not decisively shape the closure—her realization arrives through the cicada's action, not through her continued tangential circling. The mechanics matter in one beat but do not recur at the ending. Functional in shaping one key attempt but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto appears in all three gates: opening anchor, middle action (the pool where she places the cicada), and closure (she climbs back toward the surface). The setting supplies the resource (the tidal pool) that enables the key turn (the cicada sinking) and the spatial constraint (below versus above) charges the final choice to return. The stars witness the opening and closing lines, a purposeful reprise. Micro-setting (the pool itself) alters tactics: Liora's decision to place the cicada there directly enables the revelation. Strong integration with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across the pause in a difficult conversation"—is named and shapes the story's emotional stakes. The pause is mentioned in setup ("the pause between his question and her answer had stretched like a taut thread") and returns at closure ("the pause still hanging between them," "the door it opened wasn't in the grotto, but in the silence she had left behind"). The temporal constraint creates pressure: Liora's avoidance cannot last indefinitely. However, the clock is not tracked or tightened beat by beat; the pause functions more as metaphor than as a live timer that alters tactics. Lyric reprise with thematic cost but mechanics remain oblique.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated explicitly ("trying to discover the texture of time. Not its passage…but its weight, its grain") and Liora's study of the cicada serves this desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page friction between this want and competing costs. The ending shifts focus to the unfinished conversation; the texture-of-time desire does not directly drive the closure choice. Present in setup and thematically linked to middle beats (the dream, the sinking) but absent from closure participation. Functional but replaceable with "to understand the cicada" or "to escape the conversation" without structural loss.</comment>
