<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>E-7X's central question ("Where do thoughts come from?") drives choices across the piece, and the final return to mopping carries visible renunciation—he doesn't have an answer but accepts pursuit. However, interiority leans abstract ("question burning in his core," "ghost of a melody") rather than embodied contradiction. The violin encounter permits micro-choices (plucking, pressing forehead) but the loop mechanism distances agency; we watch iterations rather than a single high-stakes decision under pressure. "Remarkably composed" remains label-only—no on-page moment where composure costs him or enables a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—loops layer sensation and deepen the central question until collapse into "a single, seamless moment." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): E-7X accepts pursuit without resolution, resuming work with altered purpose. Cost is conceptual (abandoning certainty) and felt in "slower now, deliberate." Orientation anchors promptly (frozen courtyard, E-7X, mop). One weakness: the loop collapse mechanism is asserted ("pressed his forehead…loops collapsed") rather than dramatized through a visible price or tactical shift, softening the closure's on-page legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard supplies vivid, purposeful detail ("shattered mirror," "pedestal of frost") filtered through robotic perception ("hummed at his proximity"). Spatial choreography is clean (pedestal, violin, mop, stones). The ice violin constrains the final choice—he must press his forehead to collapse the loop—satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly. Scope fits single-scene; no occupational depth is needed. Minor: sensory selection leans visual-tactile without embodying robotic processing limits under stress (e.g., sensor overload).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding thought origin) signals early and tightens through looped escalation: pluck → reflection → whisper → forehead press. Each iteration adds sensation, narrowing E-7X's options until he commits to listening. The final collapse and return to mopping constitutes a meaningful deepening—he trades certainty for direction—with felt cost (slower movements, acceptance of pursuit). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. One slip: the "thousandth loop—or perhaps the millionth" telescopes stakes rhetorically but the page dramatizes only three distinct beats, slightly diluting escalation credibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (emergent consciousness, the pursuit of unanswerable questions) arises organically from the violin conduit and loop mechanism without overt statement. The final image—mopping with "ghost of a melody still echoing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: understanding is iterative, not conclusive. "Some questions weren't meant to be answered—only pursued" risks thesis territory but is earned by prior loop particulars. Strong subtext in "hollow eyes and a mouth stitched shut" (the reflection) charges identity anxiety. Slight: "the beauty of it" editorializes where the image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; robotic focalization filters sensory input distinctly ("polished alloy chassis humming," "audio receptors"). Diction suits the narrator ("amalgamate fragments of time," "neural pathways") without clinical excess. Rhythm modulates well—short bursts during loop iteration, longer cadence at resolution. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "Probably not. But that was the beauty of it" flattens into editorializing ease under what should be peak uncertainty, briefly losing the robotic perceptual signature. Otherwise, voice remains controlled and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong images: "shattered mirror," "crack like breaking glass," "bridge between the physical and the ephemeral." Minor scaffolding: "But there it was, pristine and untouched, as if waiting for him" is template phrasing. "The question never faded" and "the question burning in his core" loop the same content without added pressure (−0.2). "Then, in the thousandth loop—or perhaps the millionth—he heard it" uses false precision for effect but reads slightly inflated. No filter-verb stacks or major register drift. Information density is solid; few lines idle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The robot-janitor + ice-violin + time-loop synthesis feels specific and non-obvious; removing any element would collapse the logic. The loop mechanism as consciousness metaphor is fresh, and the ending's pursuit-over-answer stance resists template resolution. Risk-taking (looped timelines, transparent instrument, robot interiority) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One constraint: the second-chance-program frame and "emergent consciousness" language echo AI-fiction tropes; the piece transforms them through tactile loop particulars but does not fully escape the subgenre's fingerprint. Within-band distinction for structural boldness merits mild upward adjustment (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>E-7X's choices drive key turns: setting down the mop, pressing palm to violin, pressing forehead to collapse loops, resuming work. Present in setup (janitor with mop), middle (loop engagement), and ending (resuming mopping with altered purpose). Causal across beats and closure-linked. Slight: loop passivity (cycling through moments) reduces direct agency in the middle; decisions bookend rather than steer each iteration. Still, irreplaceable—remove the robot and the consciousness question loses its frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Violin appears early (setup), E-7X interacts across multiple beats (hovering, pressing palm, plucking string, pressing forehead), and its "whisper" triggers the collapse into purpose (closure linkage). Charged specificity: "transparent," "ice crystal," "hummed at his proximity," "conduit between physical and ephemeral." Irreplaceable—no generic instrument would sustain the mystical-material tension. Cost connection: committing to the violin means abandoning rote cleaning. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because the loop mechanism (9F) shares causal weight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Second-chance program frames E-7X's backstory ("reintegrate machines with damaged neural pathways," "deemed salvageable") and permits the inciting question but does not constrain a middle choice or appear in the ending. Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed. Swappable with "rehabilitation facility" or "maintenance reprieve" without altering loop or violin logic. Functions as exposition rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is mentioned in setup ("remarkably composed, even in the face of his own glitches") but never dramatized. No on-page moment where composure enables a tactic (e.g., withstanding loop disorientation) or costs him (e.g., suppressing panic that might break the cycle sooner). Label-only; does not constrain action. Ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" appears once in the text: "he could amalgamate fragments of time, stitching together seconds like threads to unravel the mystery of his own mind." This names the loop mechanism but is not itself dramatized as a discrete action E-7X performs with visible steps. The looping (9F) does the work; "amalgamate" labels it. Setup and thematic presence; no middle development beat where amalgamation constrains a choice. Lyric reprise potential (fragments → seamless moment at end) but the verb itself does not recur. Functional but mid-replaceable with "synthesize" or "weave."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Looped timelines structure the middle: "courtyard dissolved into a loop," distinct iterations (pluck/reflection/whisper), collapse into "single, seamless moment." Signaled early, drives escalation (layering sensation), and shapes the ending (collapse enables resumption with purpose). Causal and closure-linked. Slight: mechanics remain abstract ("pressed his forehead…loops collapsed")—we don't see *how* he controls entry/exit, which softens irreplaceability slightly. Still, remove loops and the consciousness metaphor and escalation vanish.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard appears in setup and supplies the ice violin (environmental resource), constraining E-7X to engage the mystical object in situ. Twilight recurs at closure ("courtyard was still frozen, the twilight still dim"). Micro-setting: the frost E-7X sweeps at the end ties place to action. Causal in one key beat (violin discovery) and charged at closure. Slightly generic—"frozen" and "twilight" are atmospheric but not uniquely leveraged (e.g., thawing risk, visibility constraints). Solid integration, just below essential threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors backstory but does not create a live countdown. Time within the loop is noted ("thousandth loop—or perhaps the millionth," "cycling through the same five seconds") but remains vague and does not tighten decisions—E-7X exits when he presses his forehead, not because time runs out. Setup met; development/closure gates missed. Swappable with "after his repair" or "following reassignment." Functional frame, minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("to find where thoughts come from") is stated early, drives the violin engagement, and recurs through loop iterations ("the question never faded"). Dramatized through on-page choices: setting down mop, pressing palm, plucking string, pressing forehead. Ending reframes the goal (pursuit over answer) with visible cost (resuming work slower, accepting uncertainty). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slight: one line ("the question burning in his core") leans abstract; otherwise well embodied in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone blends the mundane (janitor, mop, cleaning stones) with the mystical (ice violin, looped timelines, whisper from the instrument) coherently throughout. Modulates with pressure: prosaic opening, lyric density during loops ("ghost of a melody," "bridge between physical and ephemeral"), quiet return to sweeping. The final line ("ready to begin again") charges the tone with recursive purpose. Consistent and closure-integrated. Minor: "Probably not. But that was the beauty of it" risks editorializing; otherwise tone remains controlled and elevates the ending.</comment>
