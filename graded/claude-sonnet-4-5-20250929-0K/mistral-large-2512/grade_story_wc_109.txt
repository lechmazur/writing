<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation to "draw a map" arrives cleanly and her obsession with pebbles is embodied early. However, her interior arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves smoothly from mystery to understanding without genuine friction. The final choice—letting the gold leaf go—reads more as ceremonial release than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("ambered hush," "marbled blue") rather than character-specific perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraphs, avoiding orientation debt. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and cadence build toward the final release. However, the closure—standing on the shore, letting the tide take the leaf—feels more like poetic tableau than a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost; we cannot point to an exact sentence where a path is foreclosed or options reweighted with felt price. The "map" revelation is told rather than dramatized through a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ridge fort, pebble shore, and tide are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the oracle's attention. The gold leaf's physical decay (flaking, crumbling) is embodied across beats. The recurring pebbles and the fort's groaning timbers constrain mood and charge the final image when she walks "sure on the stones." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor gap: the storm's return at the end ("softer, as if it, too, had been mapped") asserts change without showing how the map altered the weather.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the booklet and completing the map—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than escalating choices; the oracle kneels, climbs, sits, traces, then stands and releases. No meaningful tightening or trade-off narrows her options; the booklet's revelation ("not a story, but a map") arrives as internal epiphany without visible cost or a decision that forecloses another path. The final act (letting the leaf go) reads ceremonial rather than a choice under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of silence-as-map and "endless night" as promise rather than void emerges organically from imagery. The final image—standing without reaching—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, lines like "she did not feel the need to speak" and "let the silence be enough" tip toward thematic summary. The booklet's transformation into dust is evocative but the conceptual repricing lacks a sharp, undeniable cost that reweights prior material with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered consistently through the oracle's attention. Perceptual signature—"mildly obsessed," focus on texture and rhythm—is clear. Diction is controlled and distinctive ("marbled hush," "ambered hush"), though elevated register occasionally drifts from urgent immediacy ("ее motivation had always been to draw this map"). No dialogue to assess. Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts. Compression at peak beats ("by summarizing silence") maintains voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. Minor scaffold appears: "She realized then" and "she knew" are repeated filter constructions. Figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without always adding clarity ("ambered hush, a warmth"; "marbled blue, like the heart of a storm that had forgotten how to rage"). Paraphrase loop: the oracle's not-needing-to-speak is restated in adjacent sentences near the end. No major loops, but density without propulsion in the middle third slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The oracle-as-cartographer of silence is a fresh angle, and the gold-leaf booklet dissolving into dust is a striking image. However, the core arc—mysterious object leads to epiphany and release—follows a familiar template without a sharp twist. The map-as-silence conceit is developed through accretion of metaphor rather than a non-obvious turn. Specificity in setting and texture elevates the piece, but the emotional and causal trajectory remains predictable. Risk-taking in lyric compression is present but does not fundamentally transform the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The oracle is present throughout and her actions (kneeling, climbing, tracing, standing, releasing) frame the narrative. However, her choices are more ritualistic than decision-driven; she enacts a predetermined path rather than making turns that alter tactics. Setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is observational. The final act (letting the leaf go) is ceremonial rather than a choice under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The booklet appears in the opening third, is traced in the fort, and dissolves into dust by the ending. It constrains her attention across beats and its physical decay ("flaking," "brittle," "dust") tracks causally. However, the booklet does not drive a choice that alters tactics; it is observed and interpreted rather than used. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure is moderate. Closure linkage is present but the object does not transform options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" appears as a descriptor of the warmth the oracle feels when tracing symbols. It does not shape stakes, constrain tactics, or change options; it functions as atmospheric texture. Setup gate is met (present by the first third as "marbled hush" and later "ambered hush"), but development and payoff gates are missing. The concept is mentioned rather than dramatized through pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The oracle is described as "mildly obsessed with the way the sea polished" the pebbles in the opening. This trait motivates her presence on the shore and her attention to texture, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The obsession is mentioned, not tested under pressure. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates are weak. The trait is ornamental rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Retell" is signaled early ("She had come here not to seek answers, but to retell them") and the oracle's act of speaking/mapping is described in the fort scene. However, the retelling is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told she "began to speak" "by summarizing silence," but the mechanics and cost of this action remain abstract. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is present but not causally decisive. The action does not redefine options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" appears in the fort scene: "she began to speak… by summarizing silence. Each pause, each held breath, became a line on the map." The method is signaled and described, but its mechanics do not matter to the outcome; the map forms "in the space between her thoughts" regardless of the method. Setup and partial development gates are met; payoff is decorative. The method is told rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ridge fort and pebble shore anchor the piece spatially and sensorially. The fort's "great hall," "shattered roof," and groaning timbers create atmosphere, and the oracle's climb from shore to fort structures the narrative. The setting pressures mood and provides resources (the stone floor, the tide's rhythm), though it does not alter a key choice. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The setting charges the final image (walking "sure on the stones") but does not constrain tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when only one star remains") is established early and tracked: "The last star flickered," "The last star dimmed further," "the last star was gone," "the next star appeared." However, the passing of the star does not tighten a decision or alter tactics; it marks atmospheric progression rather than imposing a deadline. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is present but does not create urgency. The clock is tracked but does not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation to "draw a map of an endless night" is seeded early ("Her motivation had always been to draw this map") and pursued throughout. However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She seeks understanding and achieves it without friction or trade-off. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but the motivation does not generate visible conflict or a felt price. The map is realized in her mind without a choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" anchors the opening tone and recurs in the ending sky ("marbled blue"). Tone is coherent across beats: quiet, textured, lyric. The piece modulates with the oracle's shift from seeking to releasing, and the final image (standing in silence) charges the tone with earned weight. Setup and payoff gates are strong; development is steady. The tone does not shift sharply under pressure but maintains a consistent atmospheric density that supports the Accumulative lens.</comment>
