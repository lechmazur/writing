<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows clear motivation (discovering texture of connection) and embodied sensory work (hand pressed to lens, vibrations traveling up his arm). However, his agency remains largely observational until the final moment, where the realization "the texture of connection wasn't something to be discovered" arrives as assertion rather than through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; the character mostly contemplates rather than struggles between competing impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered imagery (laboratory, bells, lens, vibrations) building toward a conceptual repricing in the final line. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The closure attempt—"the texture of connection wasn't something to be discovered"—feels incomplete on the page; the sentence breaks mid-thought without landing a visible reweighting or felt cost, reading more like a setup for an off-page epiphany than an on-page reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening occurs (lens vibrating from walls, syncing with pulse), but the ending does not deliver a decisive image or action that makes the before/after legible with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory setting is richly textured (glass jars of sounds, prism-song bells, golden shadows, high windows) and the miner's carbide lamp lens returns with charged meaning at the climax, vibrating and glowing to signal connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's tactile, sound-focused perception. The lens and bells function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why connection was lost) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the artificial pilgrimage ritual and the discovery of the vibrating lens, which syncs with Elias's pulse—a meaningful tightening. However, the final moment lacks a clear trade-off or decision that forecloses a live option; Elias "understood" but the cost of that understanding is not dramatized on the page. The piece delivers one deepening but stops short of showing the price or altered tactics that would elevate escalation into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (connection as texture, not preservation of the past, waiting for the future) emerges from concrete imagery—the lens refracting light, bells overlapping, vibrations syncing with pulse. The pilgrimage ritual and "learning to listen to the cracks" avoid overt statement. Yet the final line's abrupt incompletion ("wasn't something to be discovered") reads as a thesis assertion rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material without stating a moral. The piece invites reflection but the thematic answer feels withheld rather than earned through the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: tactile, sound-focused, attuned to vibration and light. Diction ("prism-song bell ringer," "texture of connection," "golden shadows") is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext (Dr. Veyra's "You're hearing it too, aren't you?" operates as confirmation rather than exposition). Psychic distance is controlled. The prose modulates naturally between reflection and present sensation without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and sensory specificity is high ("his hand still pressed to the lens, his breath shallow"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. However, several figurative constructions blur clarity: "vibrations traveled up his arm... like the nudge of a memory" and "the way the hum seemed to sync with his pulse, the way it filled the spaces between his ribs like a second heartbeat" stack metaphors in close proximity during a peak beat, creating mild register drift. The incomplete final sentence disrupts propulsion at closure. Information density is strong overall but the closure beat's opacity lowers the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The laboratory-of-lost-sounds premise and prism-song bell ringer title offer fresh specificity, and the miner's carbide lamp lens as a thematic anchor is a non-obvious synthesis. The "artificial pilgrimage" concept and "texture of connection" phrasing show intentional design. However, the core emotional arc (solitary figure in atmospheric lab seeking understanding through ritual, arriving at abstract epiphany) follows a familiar template without a bold structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes. The incomplete ending reads as ambiguity for its own sake rather than a transformation that grows inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role (prism-song bell ringer) frames the artificial pilgrimage ritual. He makes one micro-choice (pressing his palm to the lens, responding to Dr. Veyra), but most beats are observational or reflective. The final realization is asserted rather than enacted through a decision that alters tactics. Setup and development are present; closure participation is minimal since the character does not act at the end. Two-of-three gates met; mid-band ceiling applies. Functional but largely passive; decision without consequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in three distinct beats: workbench reflection (early), vibrating discovery (middle turn), and glowing in hand at closure. Its refractive property (splitting light into rainbows) primes the theme of sound splitting into beauty. The vibration syncing with Elias's pulse creates causal pressure and the final image ("glowing faintly in his hand") charges the ending. All three gates met; specific properties (refraction, vibration) matter. However, the lens does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it is observed and held, not used to enable or foreclose an option. Strong lyric reprise with thematic weight but no enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage is introduced early, described as Elias's invention (walking the lab's circumference, ringing each bell in sequence). It shapes his understanding ("not about fixing what was broken; it was about learning to listen to the cracks") and the ritual's mechanics (overlapping vibrations) tie directly to the discovery of the lens vibrating. Setup and development gates met; the concept is causally active in the middle. However, at closure the pilgrimage is not performed or referenced—the final beat focuses on the lens and Dr. Veyra's exchange. Missing direct closure participation; the concept matters but does not shape the ending image or decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is used once on the page to describe "the way the sound built. Not forceful, not loud, but insistent in its quiet way, as if it were propelling him forward not by pushing, but by pulling." The phrase is embodied in sensory terms (insistent, pulling vs. pushing) and tied to the pilgrimage's effect. However, it describes a quality of sound rather than constraining or enabling an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute does not return at closure or shape a choice. Setup present; development and payoff missing. Label-level integration without causal pressure or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Propel" appears explicitly once in the quoted phrase about sound ("propelling him forward not by pushing, but by pulling"). The action concept (forward movement driven by accumulation) is thematically consistent with the pilgrimage and the final realization about connection. However, no major turn traces to this specific verb or action; Elias does not physically propel anything, nor is he propelled into a decision at closure. The word is present and apt but swappable with "draw," "pull," or "guide" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable; ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"By questioning assumptions" is named once on the page: "But by questioning assumptions, he had begun to see it differently." The method is shown indirectly through Elias's shift from seeking control (arranging sounds to recreate the past) to listening to the cracks. This reframing is causally linked to the middle turn and primes the closure realization. Setup and development gates met. However, the method is summarized rather than dramatized as a repeated tactic, and it does not appear in or shape the final image. One key turn, but the mechanics are abstract and the method is not wielded at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is established in the opening sentence, detailed throughout (shelves of glass jars, prism-song bells, high windows, golden shadows), and its walls produce the hum that triggers the climactic discovery. The setting applies direct causal pressure: the walls' vibration is the external force Elias and Dr. Veyra respond to. The space shapes the pilgrimage ritual and the final moment occurs within it ("golden shadows stretching long across the floor"). All three gates met; the setting drives a key turn and is present in the closure image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the power grid stabilizes" is mentioned once in backstory: "The power grid had stabilized years ago, but the world still felt unsteady." This frames the world's recovery context but does not create urgency or constrain tactics on the page. No clock or deadline; the evening unfolds without time pressure. The timeframe is present but ornamental—it establishes a post-crisis setting without tightening decisions. Setup barely met; development and payoff absent. Replaceable with any post-disaster marker without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to discover the texture of connection" is stated early and dramatized through his pilgrimage ritual, sensory focus (tracing the lens, listening to bells), and the climactic moment when vibrations sync with his pulse and he declares "It's connection." The desire drives his months-long practice and frames the final realization. Setup and development gates clearly met; the motivation is causally active. However, the ending truncates before showing the cost or friction of that discovery—no visible trade-off or forfeiture accompanies the understanding. The motivation shapes two beats and the ending's charge but stops short of full payoff with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears twice: opening paragraph ("golden shadows cast by flickering bulbs") and penultimate paragraph ("golden shadows stretching long across the floor"). The tone is consistent—warm, nostalgic, contemplative—and modulates subtly as daylight bleeds away and the space dims. The tone supports the theme of waiting and quiet revelation. Setup and payoff present via reprise; the final image is charged by the tone. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or constrain a choice; it remains static and atmospheric. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but no causal involvement in middle beats.</comment>
