<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—grounds her choices, and the coral fragment becomes a tangible anchor for her internal state. The boy mirrors her cast-notes, creating a shared wound language that feels purposeful. However, the anesthetic's role is mostly told ("the drugs softened the world's edges") rather than embodied in degraded perception or mistaken choices, and "shrewdly innocent" appears only as a retrospective label without constraining an on-page decision. The final smile feels earned by the coral-pulse synchrony, but the lack of a visible cost or foreclosed path keeps the change abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by ~100 words and uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: the coral fragments pulse in unison, the cast-notes align, and the final word "Home" reweights prior anxieties. The Orientation Test is met, and the ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the atrium becomes a bridge, fear unknots into connection). However, the cost remains conceptual—no tactical option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no social price paid on the page. The midpoint Dr. Voss coordinates emerge but never influence a choice, weakening causal linkage even under an accumulative design. The closure image is charged but the price is felt only as "lotus-hearted ache," not demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and spatially coherent: balustrade, courtyard below, cold marble, swirling wind. The brain coral fragment's porous surface and fractal patterns recur with sensory specificity (warm throb, heat seeping), and the cast's rough plaster anchors Lena's embodied experience. The setting allows the final alignment moment (Lena crouches, boy mirrors, their casts meet), directly enabling the closure image. The atrium functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat, meeting the 9+ test narrowly, though the disputed atoll and field hospitals remain postcard mentions without tactical weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lena's need to graft new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled early and braided with the boy's parallel fear. The coral fragments' synchronized pulse provides one meaningful tightening: connection replaces isolation. Under an Accumulative lens, the final word "Home" reweights prior anxieties. Yet no on-page choice narrows options or costs Lena a resource, relationship, or tactical path. The anesthetic numbs pain but doesn't degrade her decisions, and the Dr. Voss coordinates never force a trade-off. The ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a felt price that would push this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—fear unknotted, wounds whispering instead of screaming—emerges organically from the coral fragments and cast-notes cipher. The final word "Home" arises from aligned particulars (smudges, grooves, shared anxieties) rather than a stated moral, and the lotus-hearted ache avoids sentimentality. The piece resists tidy resolution: Lena doesn't know if it's real or hallucination, but "it didn't matter" lands as earned ambiguity. However, "shrewdly innocent" is invoked only as a retrospective label, and "language of the wounded" verges on thematic echo. The ending reweights prior material without preaching, reaching mid-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent (translator's eye for patterns, smudged notes as palimpsest) and vocabulary fits her professional register. Diction modulates appropriately: clinical precision ("radius," "mortar strike") gives way to lyric compression at the ending ("lotus-hearted ache"). The prose avoids filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" is narrator-voiced rather than Lena's self-perception, creating a brief distance flicker. Otherwise, voice control under pressure is strong, and the final image sustains the established rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (cast as palimpsest, coral as siren's song). Spatial choreography is clean: Lena leans over balustrade, boy below, casts align. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "The cast on her arm itched. She scratched at the smudged notes" repeats the cast-focus from prior paragraphs; "The anesthetic had kicked in... the anesthetic made her thoughts slippery... The anesthetic hummed in her veins" cycles without advancing pressure; and "shared anxieties" / "language of the wounded" / "fear could be unknotted" restates the same thematic claim. Template cadence in the Dr. Voss beat ("coordinates, a time, a name") is minor. Apply −0.6 for loops, no closure-beat contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coral-as-cipher and cast-notes alignment offer a fresh synthesis of war trauma, translation, and physical healing. The atrium-as-bridge image is specific and non-obvious. However, the anesthetic-as-frame (common in medical/liminal narratives) and the child-mirror motif (refugee-camp echoes) lean on familiar templates. The Dr. Voss coordinates emerge but never transform the arc, suggesting outline scaffolding left unintegrated. The "language of the wounded" risks abstraction. The ending's ambiguity (real or hallucination) avoids safety-middle hedging, but the overall design doesn't take bold structural or perspectival risks. Mid-6s for competent synthesis with template shadows.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena (pacific conflict-zone translator) appears early and her translation skills prime the cipher-reading of cast-notes. She makes two on-page decisions: pulling the coral from her pocket and crouching to align her cast with the boy's. The first decision enables the closure image; the second completes it. However, her translator identity is asserted more than dramatized—no on-page decryption struggle, no mistranslation or linguistic friction shapes tactics. The role seeds expectation but doesn't constrain a choice with cost. Two beats + closure linkage + early signal → 5.8, capped by lack of causal pressure tied specifically to translation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment is present by paragraph three, handled in at least four beats (pulled from pocket, traced with thumbnail, held up to boy, pulses in unison), and central to the closure (synchronized pulse, heat seeping into cast). Its porous surface and fractal patterns mirror Lena's wrist scars, charging its specificity. The fisherman's warning ("It remembers the shape of fear") primes its final function as a key. The coral enables the connection but doesn't narrow options or impose a visible cost—Lena doesn't trade safety or resources to use it. Three beats + closure linkage + early signal + specificity → 7.1, short of 8.5 due to lack of felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (core concept) seeds early via the boy's cast-notes mirroring Lena's ("Help. I'm scared. Where is Mama?"). It shapes the middle beat (Lena recognizes the words from refugee camps) and the closure (coral fragments pulse in unison, notes align, "Home" emerges). However, the concept is more thematic claim than tactical constraint—Lena doesn't choose between competing anxieties or pay a price to bridge them. The final image reweights the concept lyrically but doesn't alter options on the page. Two beats + closure linkage + early signal → 5.4, capped by lack of causal pressure or felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears once as a retrospective label ("Lena had laughed then, shrewdly innocent") attached to a past dismissal of the fisherman's warning. It does not constrain or enable an on-page choice in the present scene. The trait is told, not shown, and easily removable. Ornamental mention, no causal work → 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears twice: "the moment... when the mind unspools like a tangled net" (mid-story) and "fear could be unknotted" (ending). The action is metaphorical and passive—Lena doesn't perform a physical unknotting; the coral and alignment "unknot" fear between her and the boy. The ending hinges on this conceptual shift, but the action is summary-level and swappable with "resolve," "untangle," or "decode." Closure participation is legible but the mechanics are abstract. Two mentions + closure linkage → 4.8, capped by swappability and lack of specific on-page enactment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast is signaled early (paragraph two: Lena's own cast is a palimpsest; paragraph four onward: the boy's cast carries messages). Lena scratches at her cast to reveal Dr. Voss coordinates (middle beat) and aligns her cast with the boy's to resolve the cipher (closure beat). The method shapes two key turns and the final image. However, the decryption is gestural—no linguistic friction, no mistranslation or partial success that alters tactics. The mechanics are asserted more than dramatized. Two beats + closure linkage + early signal → 6.3, short of 7.0 due to lack of on-page struggle or cost tied to the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is anchored early (paragraph one), provides spatial staging (balustrade, courtyard below, marble), and charges the closure: the mist swirls, the atrium becomes "a bridge between their two worlds," and the boy's notes glow in the twilight. The setting's liminality (mist, twilight) directly supports the tone and the ending's ambiguity (real or hallucination). The balustrade enables Lena's crouch-and-align choice. Three beats + closure charge + early signal + specificity → 7.9, nearing indispensability for the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthetic kicks in" is signaled early ("The anesthetic had kicked in an hour ago") and mentioned twice more ("the anesthetic made her thoughts slippery," "The anesthetic hummed in her veins"). However, the anesthetic never tightens a decision—Lena's perception is told as softened but her actions (reading coordinates, crouching, aligning casts) remain precise. No clock pressure, no degraded choice, no cost tied to the timeframe. Three mentions + early signal → 4.2, capped by lack of tactical impact or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" is signaled early (implicit in Lena's return despite evacuation, explicit when she traces the coral's grooves). It drives the middle beat (recognizing the boy's mirrored cast-notes) and the closure (the alignment grafts shared fear into "Home"). The desire faces friction—Lena's chest tightens, she forces herself to focus through the anesthetic—but no on-page cost is paid (no resource spent, no path foreclosed). The motivation is dramatized in choice but lacks a visible price. Two beats + closure linkage + early signal → 6.7, short of 7.0 due to absent cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears once, in the penultimate paragraph, and names the emotional texture that has accumulated through the piece: the mix of grief, hope, and connection. The tone is coherent across turns (Lena's chest tightens, her pulse quickens, she exhales) and modulates with pressure (clinical precision early, lyric compression at the end). The phrase charges the final image without labeling it mechanically. Late first appearance (−0.3) but strong closure linkage and coherence across beats → 7.3, nearing essentiality for the ending's emotional register.</comment>
