<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is present but relies on abstract metaphors ("visions bleeding into soil") and lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to take the woman's hand feels unmotivated by prior causality—no micro-choices or visible internal conflict earn the shift from solitary dreamer to partner. The woman from his visions materializes without resistance or surprise, flattening what should be a high-stakes confrontation. Label-only traits ("purposefully curious") don't constrain on-page action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where adequately, but the timeframe "after the future arrives early" remains metaphorical rather than dramatic. The closure dissolves the glade into a star-strewn plain and ends on "Together," a declaration without visible cost or stakes reconfiguration—RR/CR are absent because no option is foreclosed and no price is paid on the page. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the final image doesn't reweight prior material through pattern break or cadence shift, only through assertion. The cost proof test fails: no sentence demonstrates what Elias loses or risks in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is vividly rendered ("bruise deepening in the dusk") and the maze topiary's labyrinthine structure anchors the setting concretely. However, the setting doesn't constrain choice—Elias walks forward without spatial or social friction, and the glade's dissolution into the star-strewn plain feels decorative rather than causally motivated. Micro-setting elements (the clipping, the scar, the oldest tree) are present but don't alter tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The woman's arrival grants access without resistance, and the final "Together" dissolves tension rather than tightening it. No meaningful reversal or trade-off narrows options; coincidence (her appearance) resolves rather than complicates. Agency is absent: Elias doesn't decide, renounce, or endure with visible cost—he simply accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "eclipsed covenant" and intersection motif are coherent, and the piece avoids overt moralizing. However, the ending offers affirmation ("for the first time, Elias believed it was possible") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The maze clipping pulses in response to the woman but doesn't constrain choice or accumulate pressure—it's a symbolic token. Theme emerges from images but the closure tells rather than shows consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("anxious elation," "swirling tapestry of dreams half-remembered"). Perceptual signature is dreamlike but uniform rather than character-specific—similar metaphoric density throughout doesn't modulate with pressure. The single line of dialogue feels generic ("You've come" / "I had to") and doesn't carry subtext or advance plot through indirection. No head-hopping, but the voice leans decorative over urgent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence ("bruise deepening," "ink into parchment," "folds of a sleeping mind"), creating rhetorical weight that slows momentum without teaching a lyric pattern or paying off at closure (−0.5). Register is consistently elevated but edges toward purple prose in peak beats ("star-strewn plain," "swirling tapestry"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The future had arrived early" repeats conceptually across paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Some strong images ("scar ran along his wrist"), but overwriting dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "eclipsed covenant" and dream-intersection premise borrow familiar fantasy quest and visionary-chosen-one templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 derivative premise adjustment). The woman materializing from visions at the climax is a stock turn. Specific images (cobalt glade, maze topiary clipping) add texture, but the arc—solitary seeker meets guide, gains access to higher plane—follows well-worn structure. No bold risk or fresh synthesis evident.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his trait ("purposefully curious") is mentioned, but his choices don't create key turns. He plucks the clipping off-page (summarized), steps forward without opposition, and accepts the woman's hand without internal conflict. Observation and metaphoric interiority dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping appears in three beats: plucked from the labyrinth, held as he steps forward, and pulses in response to the woman. However, its use is passive—Elias holds it, but it doesn't constrain choice or enable action. The "pulse" in the final beat is a reaction, not a causal force. Specificity is high (delicate leaves, damp with dew, veins traced) but the object doesn't shape outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "eclipsed covenant" is introduced as backstory (broken when the world woke up) and restated at closure ("could finally be remade"). It frames theme but doesn't constrain on-page tactics—Elias doesn't negotiate terms, perform a ritual, or face a rule tied to the covenant. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with any "lost magic" or "broken pact" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is labeled once ("in a way that had always set him apart") but never dramatized. No scene shows Elias choosing curiosity over safety, nor does the trait constrain or enable action with cost. The observation "he was just a man who refused to look away" restates the label without embodying it in choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Heed" appears in "He had to heed the call" (middle) and is implied in the final acceptance ("I had to"). The action is functional—it moves Elias to the threshold—but easily swappable with "answer," "follow," or "pursue." No visible cost tied specifically to heeding; the verb doesn't redefine options or shape the mechanics of the choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is introduced in one paragraph: Elias has a scar from pressing his palm to the oldest tree, which opened visions, and now he "linked through scars, not just his own but those of the land." The method is summarized backstory, not dramatized. At closure the woman touches his scar and "the world tilted," but the mechanics are vague—no cost, no failed attempt, no shaping of tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is established early with vivid detail (twisted trees, dusk, labyrinthine hedge center). Elias moves through it in the opening and middle, and it dissolves into the star-strewn plain at closure, reweighting the spatial frame. However, the glade doesn't constrain choice or supply tactical resources—Elias walks forward unimpeded. The shift to the intersection is declared rather than earned through environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the future arrives early" appears twice as metaphor ("Tonight, the air hummed" / "The future had arrived early, yes, but it was not the future he had expected"). No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure tightens decisions. The timeframe is thematic decoration, not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The desire "to find the intersection of dreams" is stated and contextualized (the glade as the last place of old magic, Elias as the last who remembers). However, it's told rather than dramatized through friction—no competing want, no sacrifice required to pursue it. The woman grants access without a test, so the motivation never conflicts with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is named once in the opening and echoed at closure ("the fear, the hope, the anxious elation"). The tone is coherent—dreamlike, elevated—but static; it doesn't modulate with pressure or vary between beats. The final image restates the mood rather than charging it through rhythm or image shift.</comment>
