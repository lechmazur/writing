<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to give voice to the ghost is consistent and his action (playing the lute, pressing the bolt plate into the ghost's hand) drives the story. However, his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses complicate his choices, and the decision to stay and play feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle. The ghost's transition from shimmer to woman lacks embodied cost for Elias; he smiles and plays on, but we don't see what this encounter forecloses or what he sacrifices. The final choice reads more as gentle completion than a decision with weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal arc: Elias notices graffiti → perceives the ghost → plays music → offers the bolt plate → ghost solidifies and vanishes, leaving a changed word on the wall. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost's need is met, the graffiti shifts to "Enough"), and cost is legible in the ghost's departure and Elias's stinging eyes. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the bolt plate is a key and the storm becomes the catalyst for voice. The lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture (the mist, graffiti, and music accrue symbolic weight), holding cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above the clouds is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (mist at ankles, cobblestones, phosphorescent paint, the void at the wall's edge). The bolt plate and graffiti are concrete micro-setting elements that constrain and enable Elias's choices—he crouches to examine the plate, traces the letters, and uses the iron as a key. Spatial choreography is clear (courtyard edge, wall, void). The storm functions as atmosphere and timeframe pressure but does not materially alter Elias's tactics on the page. The setting charges the final image (mist swallowing the courtyard, Elias remaining to play), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object shape the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving the ghost a voice and helping her be remembered—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elias realizes the bolt plate is a key and the storm offers a window for action. However, the escalation is gentle: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. Elias succeeds without visible cost to his resources, time, or safety. The ghost's departure and the word "Enough" register as resolution, but the protagonist's agency feels more like facilitation than a choice under duress. One meaningful deepening occurs (the bolt plate melding with the ghost), but it lacks the friction or price that would elevate this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: the need to be remembered, the power of music and objects to preserve and honor the past, and the articulation of unspoken needs through art. The graffiti's transformation from plea ("I am still here") to closure ("Enough") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the ghost's silent mouth, the bolt plate's rusted bloom, and Elias's stinging eyes. The final image—Elias playing a "tinkersong of wonder" as the storm rolls in—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, "some needs could only be articulated in the space between lightning and thunder" comes close to a thematic summary, nudging this just below the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, anchored in Elias's perceptions (the mist's hum, the graffiti's glow, the ghost's shimmer). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the graffiti discovery, pulling back slightly for the storm's arrival. Diction is consistent and textured ("the silence here was different: it hummed"), and the prose reflects Elias's balladeer sensibility without overreach. The ghost's single line of dialogue ("Thank you") is brief and tonally fitting. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear—Elias notices sound, texture, and pattern—and the rhythm accelerates subtly as the ghost solidifies, then breathes at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the graffiti and bolt-plate beats. However, mild loops appear: "The ghost—if that's what it was—reached out" echoes prior descriptions without adding pressure, and "Elias understood then" + "He pressed it into the ghost's palm" form a small template run. The phrase "some ghosts, he knew, would always be listening" in the final paragraph edges toward abstraction rather than image. No major artifacts touch closure, but these slips prevent entry to the 8+ band. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, with figurative language (mist as living thing, notes golden and trembling) mostly purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost story, cloud-city setting, phosphorescent graffiti, and balladeer protagonist feels specific rather than stock. The bolt plate as physical key to a spectral presence is a fresh inflection. However, the core arc—artist helps spirit find peace through music and a symbolic object—follows a familiar template without transforming it through unexpected moral calculus or lived friction. The "between lightning and thunder" frame is poetic but not causally integrated (the storm arrives, the ghost vanishes, but the timing doesn't narrow Elias's options on the page). Emotional truth is present in the ghost's sorrow and Elias's quiet service, but the resolution feels gentle and expected rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (seldom-heard balladeer) is present from the opening and his choices (examining the bolt plate, playing the lute, offering the plate to the ghost) create the story's key turns. He is signaled early (strap of his lute, "No one had asked for a balladeer in years"), involved in multiple beats (discovery, playing, closure), and his profession shapes his method (weaving graffiti into melody). However, the "seldom-heard" quality is stated but not pressured—no one interrupts, doubts, or competes with him; his rarity doesn't constrain or enable tactics with visible cost. Swappable with "wandering musician" without structural loss, capping this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears early (courtyard's edge, "rusted in the shape of a forgotten bloom"), is examined by Elias mid-story ("the kind of thing a lover might use"), and returns with reweighted function at closure (pressed into the ghost's palm, melding with her shimmer as a key). Three distinct beats, early signal, and closure linkage. However, its specific properties (iron, flower-pressing) are not causally necessary—a coin, ring, or locket would serve the same narrative function with minor edits. The flower motif enriches texture but does not constrain choice or articulate a unique cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Ghost in code" (messages from hands no longer aboard, graffiti that shifts and pleads) shapes the premise, the middle discovery beat (Elias sees the figure and realizes "You're encoding your needs"), and the closure (graffiti rearranges to "To be remembered" then "Enough"). It is signaled early via sailor lore, constrains Elias's interpretation (he must decode the plea), and participates directly in the final image. The concept is irreplaceable—remove it and the story loses its core logic. Strong causal pressure, early setup, closure linkage, and visible cost (the ghost's departure) push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is applied to the ghost once ("a figure, driftingly alert, standing where the wall met the void") as atmospheric description. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action, and no cost or trade-off stems from this quality. The ghost's behavior (tilting head, reaching out, solidifying) could proceed identically without this modifier. Label-only, late-ish first appearance (second third), no development or payoff beyond a single image. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; score trends low within that ceiling due to ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Encode" appears in Elias's realization ("You're encoding your needs") and in the graffiti's shifting letters (the ghost encodes pleas as phosphorescent text). It is present in two beats (discovery, closure transformation) and causally linked to the ghost's method of communication. However, the action itself is passive (the ghost has already encoded; Elias observes and responds). The major turn—pressing the bolt plate into the ghost's hand—is not encoding but offering. Swappable with "inscribe" or "write" without loss. Functional across beats but not the story's hinge action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are signaled early (phosphorescent paint on the courtyard wall, resolving into "I am still here"), shape the middle beat (Elias traces the letters, understands the plea), and participate in closure (letters rearrange to "To be remembered" then "Éough"). The method is irreplaceable—without the graffiti, the ghost has no voice and Elias has no means to decode her need. The mechanics matter: the paint glows, the letters shift, and the transformation marks resolution. Early setup, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (the ghost's departure and the final word) place this solidly in the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above the clouds is present from the opening line, vividly rendered (mist at ankles, cobblestones, courtyard edge, void, low wall), and participates in the closure (mist thinning to reveal the ghost, then swallowing the courtyard at the storm's arrival). The setting provides the stage for discovery (bolt plate, graffiti) and charges the final image (Elias remains playing as clouds swallow the courtyard). However, it does not constrain a choice—Elias could leave but chooses to stay without environmental pressure forcing that decision. Strong atmospheric and closure presence, but lacks the tactical constraint that would push this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is introduced as a poetic frame ("the world held its breath") and reprised in the final paragraph ("some needs could only be articulated in the space between lightning and thunder"). The storm arrives on cue for the ghost's solidification (lightning splits the sky, thunder booms, she vanishes). However, the timeframe does not tighten Elias's decisions—he does not race the storm or choose under a live clock. The interval is more metaphor than constraint. Lyric reprise reweights the opening slightly, but the mechanics do not shape tactics. Mid-band for present-but-passive temporal frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To articulate unspoken needs" is the story's spine: the ghost's plea ("I am still here"), her silent mouth, Elias's question ("What do you need?"), and the graffiti's answers ("To be remembered" → "Enough"). The motivation is dramatized in Elias's playing (weaving words into melody) and offering the bolt plate, and it is conflicted in his stinging eyes and the cost of the ghost's departure. The desire shapes three beats (discovery, music, closure) and is irreplaceable—without this need the story has no conflict or resolution. Strong causal pressure, early signal, closure linkage, and visible emotional cost place this in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named explicitly in the final line ("playing a tinkersong of wonder") and evoked throughout via diction ("the silence here hummed," "notes hung in the air, golden and trembling," "distant bells"). The tone is cohesive across beats—curious, reverent, melancholy—and modulates subtly as pressure rises (Elias's breath catches, throat tightens). However, the explicit label in the final line risks over-articulation, and the tone does not shift decisively under peak pressure (the ghost's solidification and departure are gentle, not urgent). Present from start to finish with purposeful modulation, but the named recurrence and static gentleness prevent higher scoring.</comment>
