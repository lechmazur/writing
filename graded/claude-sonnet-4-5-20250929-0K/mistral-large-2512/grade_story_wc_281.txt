<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's initial skepticism ("Prove it") and her decision to map the pill's effects through paint show trait-driven choices. The final moment where she says "Prove it" again while believing demonstrates a shift, but the middle beats rely heavily on sensation description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Eli remains largely passive, serving as witness rather than applying pressure. The embodied work is strong (muscovite weight, sternum press), but internal conflict reads more as sequential description than live contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (studio, post-shock, Mara's POV). The closure—Mara painting pathways in air, taking Eli's hand, believing her own challenge—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she moves from skeptic to believer with the cost of living with the pill's effects rather than reversing them. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sensory density, paint motif, pathways deepen). One clear tightening occurs when she touches the thread and sees another's memory, forcing the realization that the pill revealed rather than rewired. Cost is felt but somewhat abstract; the "live with it" stance is asserted more than enacted with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The studio's blacklight, phosphorescent paint, and ozone scent create a vivid micro-setting that enables Mara's mapping action. The muscovite geode as recurring object constrains her interpretation (fractals = pathways). Spatial choreography is clean (wall, corner where Eli watches, air where she paints). The environment directly charges the final image: painting in air becomes possible only under blacklight in this specific space, and the glowing pathways "remained" as embodied proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understand and control (or accept) the pill's telepathic effects. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara touches the light-thread and accesses someone else's memory, forcing her to revise her hypothesis from "rewired" to "revealed." The final choice to "live with it" rather than reverse it is a renunciation that forecloses the original goal, but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral—no visible trade-off in the moment. Escalation under Accumulative lens is present (static shock → somatic markers → painting skin → painting air → touching memory), but agency at closure is more acceptance than decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden pathways waiting to be illuminated emerges through the muscovite fractures, paint traces, and light threads without direct statement. The final image—painting pathways in air, saying "Prove it" while believing—offers a resonant answer: proof comes from living the question, not solving it. The shift from "affectionate skeptic" to believer who still says "Prove it" reweights the opening motif with earned complexity. Minor slip: "willowglass hope" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward labeling the feeling rather than letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third around Mara; perceptual signature is strong (fractals, light, embodied sensation). The prose modulates well under pressure (short bursts when she gasps, longer when reflecting). Eli's single line of dialogue ("You're turning yourself into a canvas") and Mara's reply carry subtext about agency and self-experimentation. Minor distance slip: "the willowglass hope in her chest light as a feather" borrows a cliché simile that doesn't match the precise, technical voice elsewhere. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts with pressure. Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "She rubbed her shoulder, wincing, but her fingers lingered on the muscovite geode sliver in her pocket" = pain + fixation + object introduction). One paraphrase loop: "illuminate the hidden connections" / "illuminate hidden pathways" across paragraphs 4 and 9. The phrase "fractally precise" recurs three times, twice as pure descriptor without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or major template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill-recall frame is familiar sci-fi territory, but the story shifts focus to embodied mapping through light painting rather than telepathic drama, which is a fresh angle. The combination of somatic markers, blacklight studio, and fractals as conceptual metaphor feels organic. The turn—pill revealed rather than rewired—is earned but not wholly unexpected. Risk-taking is present (painting on air, lyric closure) but doesn't fully transform the template. The "affectionate skeptic" phrase is vivid and specific to this character.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara as "affectionate skeptic" is named early and her choices—joining the study, mapping effects, painting pathways—are consistent. Her final "Prove it, and this time, she believed" shows an earned shift. However, much of the middle is observation and sensation rather than decision under competing pressures. She drives two beats (painting skin, touching the thread) and the closure, which meets two-gate minimum and causal involvement, but the skepticism trait itself doesn't constrain a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Muscovite geode sliver appears in three beats: paragraph 2 (tactile anchor), paragraph 19 (pulled out to light, refracting pathways), and implied in the final mapping. Its fractal structure directly informs her insight ("Maybe it had only revealed what was already there. Hidden pathways"). The object enables her conceptual leap and charges the closure by modeling the solution. Setup + development + payoff gates met; causal role is present but the shard itself is handled more as symbol than tool with physical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Telepathy pill recall is established early and shapes the initial stake (fragments of thoughts flicker, study recall mentioned). The memory-touch beat (child in field) dramatizes telepathic leakage. The final choice to "live with it" rather than reverse the effect directly engages the concept. However, the recall itself (why it was recalled, what danger it posed) remains vague; the story focuses on aftermath rather than the recall's pressure. Setup + payoff present; middle development is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is applied to the geode edge, the paint lines on her skin, and the branching pathways. It establishes a visual/conceptual motif but does not constrain an action with cost—Mara can paint fractal lines or non-fractal lines with no visible tradeoff. The attribute is descriptive and thematic rather than functional. Setup gate met (early mention); development and payoff are ornamental recurrences without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Devise" is signaled early ("Mara had come to devise a way") and drives multiple beats: devising the skin-mapping, the air-painting, the final realization ("devising a way to live with it"). The action is repeated and essential to structure; the story is organized around her active experimentation. Removing "devise" and replacing with passive observation would require a full structural rewrite. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met with strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is named once by Eli in exposition, and Mara then paints her body to trace the shock's path. The method is present and used in one beat (painting skin as body memory map), but its mechanics are not tested or constrained—she doesn't face a choice between somatic mapping and another method, nor does it fail and require adjustment. Setup and development gates met; payoff is implicit (she succeeds) but the method itself doesn't shape the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Light painting studio is anchored early and supplies essential resources: blacklight makes the paint glow, enabling her to see pathways; phosphorescent paint on walls and then on her skin creates the map; the studio's controlled darkness lets the threads of light become visible. The setting directly enables the climactic beat (painting in air, threads forming a shape). Without this exact studio, the visual mapping and final revelation would fail. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the static shock" timeframe is anchored in the opening and structures causality: the shock is the inciting event, leaving her with questions and the sternum bruise she presses. The shock's aftermath (weeks of pill effects, then the shock itself) drives her urgency to map the effects now. Time is not a live ticking clock, but the post-shock window is coherent and shapes her present stance. Setup and development gates met; the shock residue is implied at closure but not actively present.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate hidden pathways" is named as motivation in paragraph 4 and recurs in the final lines ("She wasn't just devising a way to understand the pill. She was devising a way to live with it"). The desire drives her painting actions and the final choice to accept rather than reverse. Friction is present: she wants answers but gets a reframing instead. However, the motivation is stated more than tested—no scene shows her torn between illuminating and leaving the pathways hidden. Setup and payoff strong; middle friction is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is named once late (penultimate paragraph: "willowglass hope in her chest light as a feather") and colors the final image (smile, hand-holding, "this time, she believed"). The coinage is vivid but arrives too late to modulate through turns; earlier tone is more questioning and unsettled. The phrase itself is ornamental—removing it would not change the closure's emotional charge. Tone at ending is hopeful and the label fits, but it's applied rather than earned through tonal progression.</comment>
