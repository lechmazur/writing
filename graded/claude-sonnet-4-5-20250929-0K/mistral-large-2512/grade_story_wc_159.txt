<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to preserve names is established through discovery and sustained across the piece, but her emotional stakes remain largely abstract—the "foxglove regret" is named, not embodied in contradictory impulses. The breakthrough with the bamboo tube arrives without visible internal friction or cost; she simply tries again and succeeds. The thirty-seven-year tenure and the vanished librarian seed backstory, but Liora's present choices don't reveal competing desires or a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonance through layered imagery (orchids, names, sound) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora realizes she's "giving them a place to live again"—a conceptual repricing of her caretaking as active preservation. Cost is present but muted: the "foxglove regret" softens rather than being paid in a visible forfeiture. The closure reweights prior material cleanly, though the final emotional shift feels asserted more than earned through a decisive struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and bamboo tube supply vivid, purposeful detail. The museum of extinct feelings and the cracked tube constrain Liora's method and charge the ending when the orchid chimes in response. Spatial choreography remains clear; the atrium, stacks, and lowest level anchor movement. The setting's fantastical logic (floating library, glass flowers as sound vessels) is internally consistent and integral to the preservation premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the sound of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The piece deepens through discovery (the ledger, the song, the method) but lacks a live tightening that narrows Liora's options or forces a trade-off. The bamboo tube challenge is resolved by patient iteration rather than escalating pressure. The ending reweights her purpose, but the cost (softened regret) reads as relief rather than a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory, preservation, and the act of giving names a place to live—emerges organically from the glass orchids, the extinct feelings, and Liora's method. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sound as survival, not just archive. "Foxglove regret" anchors tone without becoming a thesis statement. The piece resists tidy morals; the vanished librarian and the deserted marvels invite reflection on loss and continuity without reducing them to a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Liora's perceptual filter (precision, patience, sensitivity to light and sound) colors the narration consistently. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("prismatic whispers," "petrified into something cold and beautiful") but remains within the voice of someone shaped by thirty-seven years among relics. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is controlled; the piece stays anchored in Liora's sensory and reflective world without head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, but several lines drift into decorative overwriting: "prismatic whispers that danced across the marble floors," "a melody without words... dissolving into the air like sugar in tea." Stock metaphors ("like a fossil in stone," "as if the library itself were a living thing") appear in non-peak beats. The final paragraph's "she realized she wasn't just saving names—she was giving them a place to live again" edges toward thesis-statement clarity rather than trusting the image to land the theme. Minor paraphrase loop: "preserve those vibrations" restated as "capturing the echo" within adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound preservation via glass orchids, the museum of extinct feelings, and the caretaker's isolation offers a fresh angle on memory and archive. The bamboo tube as both relic and instrument adds specificity. The fantastical premise commits fully to its logic. However, the emotional arc—lonely caretaker finds purpose through patient discovery—follows a familiar template, and the resolution (softened regret, affirmed purpose) trends toward comfort rather than risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's choices (tending orchids, collecting names, recreating the chime) anchor multiple beats and the ending. Her discovery of the ledger initiates the preservation method; her final act with the bamboo tube triggers the closure. However, her decisions feel iterative rather than forced by escalating pressure—she tries, refines, succeeds—without a visible cost that alters tactics. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but the causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube is seeded early (first thing she found, thirty-seven years of attempts), handled in the climactic beat (she blows through it), and its sound triggers the orchid response that charges the closure. The tube's jagged edge and its role as a lost melody anchor Liora's quest. Removing it would gut the preservation mechanism and the ending's resonance. Strong integration across beats and ending, though the tube's properties (why this note succeeds now) remain slightly underspecified.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" frames the setting (clock, mirror, chime, orchids) and Liora's task as caretaker of what others left behind. The concept shapes her gentle, systematic approach and the theme of preservation versus abandonment. However, it functions more as thematic backdrop than a tactical constraint—Liora's choices aren't visibly altered by the "desertedness" of objects. The concept charges the atmosphere and closure image but doesn't narrow options or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is demonstrated in Liora's orchid care and her hundred attempts with the bamboo tube, reflecting patience and precision. The trait informs her method but doesn't constrain a pivotal choice with visible cost—she could be impulsive or chaotic and still discover the preservation technique. The attribute is consistent and apt but swappable with "meticulous" or "patient" without structural loss. Present across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Light is woven throughout: glass petals refract it, the bamboo tube casts a shadow "like a mouth," and light slants through the tube to cue Liora's final attempt. The action of light cueing her discovery is present at the turn, but the element is shared among many moments (orchids, atrium, shadow) rather than concentrated in a single irreplaceable beat. Removing "light" would require edits but wouldn't collapse the plot; sound and touch could carry the discovery. Integral to tone and setting, but not solely causal at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "echo of a long-forgotten song" is seeded early (drifting through the stacks, leading her to the ledger) and becomes the discovery that defines her preservation method: names sing from the pages, orchids hum in response, the bamboo tube emits a mournful note. The method shapes her tactics (whispering into flowers, recreating the chime) and the ending when the orchid "chimed in response." Removing the song-echo mechanism would break the preservation logic and closure. Strong causal integration, though the mechanics of how sound embeds in glass remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds supplies vivid atmosphere and houses the museum of extinct feelings, the stacks, and the atrium. The lowest level and the east wing anchor spatial movement. However, the setting functions more as container than constraint—Liora's choices aren't pressured by the library's location or resources. The fantastical elements (floating, glass orchids) are integral to the premise but don't alter tactics at the closure beat. Strong thematic fit, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" names a location Liora visits often, and the museum's thematic weight (emotions no one can name) enriches the preservation stakes. However, "timeframe" as a live pressure is absent—no clock tightens her decisions, and the thirty-seven years function as backstory rather than urgency. The museum anchors one key reflective passage but doesn't constrain the plot's escalation or ending. Present and thematically resonant but not a tactical driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora's desire to preserve the sound of forgotten names drives the discovery (following the song to the ledger), her method (whispering into orchids), and the ending realization ("giving them a place to live again"). The motivation is dramatized through action—she collects, experiments, listens—and the closure reweights it from archival duty to active revival. The motivation shapes multiple beats and the final image. Cost is muted (softened regret rather than visible forfeiture), keeping it shy of indispensable, but strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named once, anchors Liora's emotional baseline (thirty-seven years of patient loss), and softens at closure—a tonal modulation that charges the ending without stating a moral. The tone is coherent and quiet throughout, matching the elegiac setting and Liora's reflective voice. However, "foxglove" as a specific image isn't developed beyond the single mention; the regret could be "moss-green" or "iron" without structural loss. The tone supports theme and closure but isn't irreplaceable in its exact formulation.</comment>
