<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to capture echoes is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—"texture given voice" is poetic yet lacks embodied contradiction or visceral cost during the peak moment. The humming-conducting sequence shows agency, but the triumph feels too smooth; no genuine struggle or blind spot complicates her success. The final smile and "quietly articulate" tag read as external performance rather than contradictory interior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Elara traps the echoes in the diamond, transforming curse into vessel—a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the language's death now takes new form). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of echoes, bird-flock analogy, and diamond's pulse cohere through density increase and cadence shift at the tunnel sequence. Orientation anchors early (canyon, bone towers, her name and mission by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when the echoes begin to answer and she conducts them. Cost is conceptual (the old language is gone, replaced by sensation) but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon, and tunnel are vivid and purposeful; the "walls seemed to breathe" and the grooves/ridges function as notes that Elara traces, directly constraining her method. The diamond's light refracting through bone cracks charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (edge → tunnel → out), and sensory detail (hum, pulse, warmth) is filtered through Elara's professional focus. The setting actively shapes the harnessing action and the final triumph.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture the texture of echoes) is signaled early and tightens when the diamond vibrates and the echoes answer. One meaningful escalation: Elara shifts from listening to conducting, a turn driven by her agency (humming, matching pitch). The cost is visible in the canyon's silence afterward and the transformation of the diamond from cursed to vessel. No explicit antagonist, but the echoes' resistance (chaos, overlapping fragments) provides coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (language death versus new forms of memory, texture as carrier of meaning) emerges from action and image rather than assertion. The final line—"the death of a language had not silenced the echoes—it had given them new form"—edges toward thematic summary but is anchored in the on-page harnessing. The diamond's shift from cursed to vessel and the canyon's silence offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the scholar's madness rumor and Elara's refusal of curses, though the "quietly articulate in her triumph" phrase leans slightly didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance is consistent and apt. Diction is controlled ("copper-veined storyteller," "texture given voice") and character-specific, though occasionally elevated ("quietly articulate," "mirrored the patterns of the birds") in ways that drift slightly from mid-crisis urgency. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("believed," "realized") are acceptable and voice-motivated. The perceptual signature (listening for rhythm, tracing ridges) is selective and distinct. No head-hopping or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct, though a few template stems appear ("She had spent," "She had heard," "She pulled"). Information density is high at the tunnel sequence; the canyon-opening and backstory paragraphs carry some scaffold ("not to mourn... but to listen" reads slightly explanatory). One paraphrase loop: "echoes were not just sound, but texture" is restated as "rough as sandstone, smooth as river stone" without new pressure. The closure image is clean, but "quietly articulate in her triumph" is a stock phrase that dulls the final beat. No major figurative muddle, but the bird-flock analogy is stated rather than shown in action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (capturing echoes via flawed diamond, informed by bird-flock patterns) is specific and less common than generic "lost language" tales. Execution is competent but leans on familiar beats: solo scholar, cursed object redeemed, triumph through insight. The bird-starling analogy is told rather than demonstrated in tactical adjustments. Elara's success feels predetermined; no surprising friction or counter-pattern challenges her method. The combination is fresh enough to avoid cliché but does not transform its elements through bold risk or non-obvious calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (copper-veined storyteller) is present throughout and her choices drive all major beats: entering the tunnel, humming to match pitch, conducting the echoes. Setup in paragraph one, development (tracing walls, using the diamond) in the middle, payoff (harnessing the echoes) at the end. Her decision to hum and conduct is the causal hinge. The "copper-veined" descriptor is ornamental and does not constrain action, but the storyteller role fits her mission. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure; the element is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in paragraph seven (pocket pulse), is held and used in paragraphs twelve–fifteen (refraction, vibration, filling with light), and returns transformed in the closure. It constrains her method (trap light/sound via cracks) and charges the final image ("no longer cursed; it was a vessel"). Setup slightly late (second third), but development and payoff are strong. Two distinct beats (holding it up, harnessing echoes into it) plus closure participation. High causal pressure and irreplaceability; the cracks are specific and purposeful. Cost is tied to the element (transformation from curse to vessel).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes (core concept) frames the central action: Elara enters it in paragraph eleven, the echoes answer and she conducts them there, and the harnessing occurs within it. Setup in paragraph four (description of the bone towers amplifying whispers), development (the tunnel sequence, paragraphs eleven–sixteen), and payoff (echoes trapped, canyon silent afterward). The concept shapes stakes (capture the echoes) and tactics (matching pitch, conducting). Indispensable; the story's logic depends on the tunnel's acoustic properties.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears once, in the penultimate paragraph, as a label for Elara's triumph. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it describes her internal state after the harnessing is complete. No setup, no middle beat involvement. The trait could be swapped for "silent satisfaction" or "unspoken pride" without altering the plot. Late arrival (final third), ornamental use, high swappability, and no visible tradeoff cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Harness" is the action that defines the climax: Elara realizes she is conducting, guides the echoes into the diamond "like a shepherd herding a flock," and the gem fills with light. Setup via the flock-of-birds study (paragraph ten) primes the method. Development occurs in paragraphs fourteen–sixteen (humming, matching pitch, the echoes answering). Payoff is the harnessing itself, which produces the closure transformation. High causal pressure, strong closure linkage, and irreplaceability (no other action would serve). Three beats involved; the element is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The bird-flock patterns method is seeded early (paragraph ten: "months studying the patterns of starlings") and explicitly invoked at the climax ("The patterns of the echoes mirrored the patterns of the birds"). Setup present, payoff clear. However, the method is told rather than shown in tactical adjustments; Elara does not adapt or iterate based on flock-like behavior on the page. One beat (the conducting moment). Functional but somewhat abstract; removing the bird reference would require minor rewording but the harnessing action itself (humming, matching pitch, guiding) does not depend on ornithological specifics. Lyric reprise with reweighting qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes provide the story's spatial and acoustic logic. Setup in paragraphs one and four (towers amplify every sound), development (Elara enters the tunnel between towers, traces the bone walls' ridges as notes), and payoff (canyon is silent after the harnessing). The setting constrains her method (the tunnel's walls and hollows are the instrument) and charges the final image (the towers "stood unchanged" but have given what she sought). Indispensable; the story's stakes and tactics depend on the canyon's properties. High causal pressure and closure linkage across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the death of a language" is present as backstory (paragraph two: "the last speaker of the old tongue had died") and thematic frame (final paragraph: "The death of a language had not silenced the echoes"). It motivates Elara's mission but does not impose a live clock or tighten on-page decisions. Setup and payoff are clear, but no middle development; the language's death is a completed event, not an unfolding pressure. The element reweights meaning at closure (language death → new form) but does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise with thematic cost; functional but not indispensable to moment-by-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "translate texture into sound" (paragraph six: "trying to translate that texture into something tangible") drives Elara's goal and the entire harnessing sequence. Setup early, development in the tunnel (humming, conducting, the texture answering), and payoff (texture trapped in the diamond as "a language of sensation"). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slight friction: the motivation is stated more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; Elara's path is smooth, without visible doubt or competing desire. Two beats involved; the element is essential but could be more embodied.</comment>
