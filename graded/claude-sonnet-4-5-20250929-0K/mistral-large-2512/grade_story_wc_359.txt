<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eira's synesthetic blessing is established and her motivation to "certify wonder as essential" is stated, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract color-perception rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to ring the largest bell feels inevitable rather than earned through visible internal conflict—she "couldn't fail" is asserted, not dramatized as a trade-off. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, gritted teeth) but the stakes remain somewhat conceptual; no visceral cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page when she succeeds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when cleanly (ice cavern, Eira, bell ringer, tonight). Closure reads as a Decisive Change: the song is released and the sculptor's chisel falls silent. However, the causal chain is thin—the sculptor's disruption is external coincidence that complicates but does not force Eira's agency; her success feels willed rather than wrestled from prior constraint. The inferred lens is Causal-leaning Hybrid, but the because/therefore linkage from chisel strikes to bell choices is loose, and no visible cost accompanies the triumph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (veins of blue and silver, aurora ribbons, ice vibrating in sympathy) and the aurora's restless hues are filtered through Eira's synesthetic perception. The sculpted hush functions as micro-setting, thickening around her to muffle the world. Setting does not constrain a choice with consequence, but the final image is charged by the cavern's response to the released music, lifting the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing the amber sheet's melody before the sculptor's work disrupts the hush—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the three chisel strikes that shatter her notes, but Eira's responses are repetitions (ring next bell, focus harder) rather than escalating agency or trade-offs. The resolution arrives when she rings the largest bell "with a final, determined strike" and succeeds without visible cost; coincidence (the sculptor's silence) validates her effort rather than her choice forcing a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme—wonder as necessity rather than luxury—emerges from Eira's stated motivation and the story's central image of releasing trapped music. The final paragraph ("a reminder that wonder was not a luxury, but a necessity") borders on thematic statement but is anchored in the song's escape and the aurora's cradling light. The amber sheet and sculpted hush recur with reweighted meaning at closure, but the insight is told more than earned through specific struggle; no plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity is present.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Eira; her perceptual signature (sound as color) is consistent and character-specific. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("the ice cavern hummed with a quiet so deep it felt like a living thing"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she thought") are present but voice-motivated; psychic distance is steady. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("synesthetically blessed," "oscillating repose" as applied tone) but remains largely within an artisan-narrator's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; sentences advance image and action without scaffolding. Figurative density is high throughout ("indigo bloomed into the air, curling around her like smoke," "aurora flared, its colors merging into a single, brilliant beam") but remains coherent. Template stems appear in the chisel-strike sequence ("the chisel struck again, and the indigo shattered… the chisel struck a third time, and the pink note dissolved") and minor paraphrase loops recur ("the colors were muted" / "the aurora was restless"), triggering a cumulative −0.4 deduction in Q7 for pattern artifacts that do not obscure closure but dull peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell ringer in an ice cavern is a specific synthesis, but the emotional arc—artist must complete work before external disruption ruins it—is familiar. The sculpted hush and aurora-as-medium offer fresh inflection, yet the chisel as antagonist reads ornamental (it simply stops at the end without dramatized cause). The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost; the ending's inevitability in hindsight is weak because success feels granted rather than wrestled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Eira the prism-song bell ringer is present throughout; her choices to ring each bell in sequence create the story's progression. She appears in the opening, drives middle beats (rings smallest, larger, largest bell under pressure), and her final choice releases the music at closure. However, her decision-making is repetitive (ring next bell despite disruption) rather than altering tactics; no visible cost or trade-off accompanies her success. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but lacks causal pressure narrowing options −0.6, no felt cost −0.4: starts ~6.0, net adjustments bring score to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is introduced in the opening paragraph ("her fingers tracing the edges"), establishes the central goal ("to unfetter the music trapped within"), and is present in the climax when "the aurora… wrapped around the amber sheet" and "the music unfurled at last." It appears across three beats (opening, mid-story reference to releasing notes, final unfurling) and shapes Eira's tactics (she must create sculpted hush to release it). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, but the sheet itself is passive (a container) rather than constraining choices through its properties −0.5, and its mechanics are abstract −0.3: starts ~6.0, adjustments yield 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sculpted hush is named in paragraph 3 ("a sculpted hush that would cradle the notes") and reappears when "the sculpted hush thickening around her, muffling the world outside" in the middle passage and implied in the final moment when "even [the chisel] had been stilled." It shapes Eira's immediate tactic (she must achieve silence to release the song) and is present at closure. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.9, enables one tactic +0.7, but the concept is told more than demonstrated through on-page constraint −0.6, and its mechanics are vague (how does ringing bells create silence?) −0.4: starts ~5.0, net 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Synesthetically blessed is introduced in paragraph 2 ("every sound she heard bloomed into color") and governs Eira's perception throughout (indigo, yellow, pink notes; crimson flare from chisel; opal/sapphire hues at closure). It enables her method (listening with the part that sees sound as color, letting colors guide her hands) and charges the final image with "hues Eira had never seen before." Early signal +0.8, present across multiple beats +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, enables core tactic +1.0, but no visible cost or constraint tied to the trait (it aids without trade-off) −0.8, and it reads as label/flavor rather than a forced choice −0.3: starts ~5.5, adjustments yield 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unfetter is the verb that frames the central goal ("to unfetter the music trapped within the amber sheet") and recurs when "she unfettered the next note—a soft pink" and climaxes when "the music unfurled at last." The action defines Eira's task across all three bell-ringing beats and the resolution. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceable (the story is about releasing trapped music) +0.7, but the action is abstract (bell ringing could be described differently without structural loss) −0.4, and no on-page cost is tied to the unfettering itself −0.3: starts ~6.5, adjustments yield 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Through the colors of the aurora is signaled in paragraph 4 ("sound could be shaped through the colors of the aurora") and the aurora is present throughout (ribbons of green/violet, restless hues, colors shifting, flaring at climax). At closure "the aurora flared, its colors merging into a single, brilliant beam that wrapped around the amber sheet," directly enabling the music's release. Early signal +0.6, two beats (mid-story modulation, climax flare) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, enables the climax +1.0, but the mechanics are told not shown (how does the aurora interact with bell sound?) −0.7, and Eira does not adjust her method based on aurora behavior −0.4: starts ~5.0, net 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern is established in the opening sentence and described throughout (shimmering walls, veins pulsing, ice vibrating in sympathy, aurora bleeding through ceiling). It constrains the setting (Eira "stood at the center of the chamber") and responds to her bells ("the cavern responded, the ice walls vibrating"). At closure "the ice cavern sighed" and its sculpted hush frames the final image. Early signal +0.8, present across all beats +1.4, closure participation +0.8, setting responds to action +0.6, but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off −0.6, and spatial choreography is static (Eira does not move or use cavern features tactically) −0.4: starts ~6.0, adjustments yield 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>At the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble appears in paragraph 5 ("a sculptor's chisel struck marble somewhere beyond the cavern's entrance") and recurs twice more (second and third strikes). The timeframe is implied to be brief (three strikes during Eira's bell sequence) and the final line notes "the sculptor's chisel fell silent." Introduced late (paragraph 5, ~25% mark) −0.3, two additional beats +0.9, closure presence +0.5, but the timeframe does not tighten tactics (Eira rings bells in sequence regardless) −0.8, the sculptor is offstage and passive −0.5, and no clock pressure is legible (we don't know if she's racing a deadline) −0.6: starts ~3.0, net 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To certify wonder as essential is stated in paragraph 7 ("that was her motivation") and expanded ("the world was too loud, too chaotic, drowning out the quiet magic"). It recurs in paragraph 9 ("she thought of the people who would hear it, how it might make them pause") and at closure ("a reminder that wonder was not a luxury, but a necessity"). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants −0.8, no visible friction between this desire and a competing cost on the page −0.6, and the phrase "certify wonder as essential" is abstract prompt language without embodied stakes −0.4: starts ~4.5, adjustments yield 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Oscillating repose as tone is present in the opening's deep hum ("a quiet so deep it felt like a living thing") and the final image ("the sculpted hush… let the colors of the aurora cradle her like a lullaby"). The tone modulates with pressure: muted colors hold breath, crimson flares are violent, the final moment is soothing. Early signal +0.6, modulates under pressure +0.8, charges final image +0.9, but "oscillating repose" is a high-register conceptual label that does not fully capture the lyric-versus-urgent texture −0.4, and mid-story beats lean more lyric-static than oscillating −0.3: starts ~5.0, net 5.4.</comment>
