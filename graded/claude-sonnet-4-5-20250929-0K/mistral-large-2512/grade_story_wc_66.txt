<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "teach the dust to tell stories" drives the narrative but remains largely declarative rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The transformation moment (dust glowing, word forming) arrives without sufficient internal resistance or visible trade-off—he simply hums and succeeds. The interiority leans on stock phrasing ("breath caught," "smiled") and the final choice feels unmotivated by prior struggle; we see label-only determination rather than a character wrestling with cost. Backstory dominates without anchoring micro-choices that alter present options until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias gathers fragments (radio song, dust) until the final image where dust speaks. However, the closure unit—dust forming the word "Listen"—arrives without visible cost; Elias laughs and plans to continue, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The linkage from song lyrics to dust-weaving feels asserted rather than causally earned, and the "maybe the world would hear them" remains speculative rather than a felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("damp ash and old parchment," "fire's glow curled like a sleeping cat") and the mist frames the isolation effectively. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choices—Elias could conduct this experiment anywhere with a desk and radio. The jar of dust and the alcove's warmth support mood but do not alter tactics or charge the final image with spatial or material pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making stories return—is signaled early, but escalation is weak. Elias tunes the radio nightly, hears more lyrics, gathers dust, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or narrowing options. The "first word formed" moment involves no visible price; no resource is spent, no relationship strained, no alternative foreclosed. Coincidence (the radio's broadcast timing) enables rather than complicates, and the ending "next night, he would gather more" defers rather than crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—stories as material remnants, storytelling as resurrection—emerges clearly from the dust-as-story conceit and is developed through concrete images (jar, glow, the word "Listen"). However, the ending tilts toward direct statement: "He had a story to tell. And this time, the dust would be his voice" reads as thematic assertion rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The pirate-broadcast motif and "teach the dust" frame remain somewhat generic, lacking the particularity that would ground the universal in this character's specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with distinct perceptual filters ("scent that clung to things long after their purpose had faded"). Diction is consistent and lyric-textured, though some phrases lean toward elevated register ("liquid gold," "mirage") that slightly tensions the humble copyist's idiom. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The focalization is clean, and the voice has a distinct cadence, but under peak pressure (the dust glowing) the prose remains descriptive rather than compressing or intensifying rhythm to match urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("fire's glow curled like a sleeping cat," "melody so soft it might have been the wind, if the wind had ever sung," "dust swirled like a tiny storm"), and several metaphors in the final third ("shimmering like a mirage," "liquid gold") verge on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "The dust remembered. It remembered the stories..." and "this time, the dust would be his voice" echoes prior claims. Template cadence: multiple "The [noun] was [descriptor]" openers and "He [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work without advancing causality, and the closure beat remains description-heavy rather than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—post-apocalyptic silence, dust as story-remnant, pirate radio as guide—synthesizes familiar post-scarcity and archive-keeper tropes without a sharp fresh angle. The "teach dust to tell stories" conceit is poetic but remains abstract; the mechanics (hum the song, dust glows, word forms) lack the specificity or non-obvious causal logic that would make the turn feel inevitable. Emotional specificity is limited: Elias's loneliness and drive are declared more than dramatized through contradictory choices. The transformation test suggests the arc could function with different objects (sand, ash, paper fragments) and a different guide mechanism with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias, the orchestra copyist, is present throughout and his occupation is mentioned early. However, the copyist role does not constrain or enable key actions—his skills (transcription, notation) are not dramatized or used on the page. The decision to gather dust and hum the song does not trace causally to his copyist expertise; a librarian or archivist could execute identical actions. The character is functional but the occupation is largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shortwave radio appears early, is handled in multiple beats (found, tuned nightly, dial flares at climax), and its dial glow is the "secretly luminous" trait that Elias discovers. The glow signals the song's arrival and intensifies at the closure beat. However, the radio's role is primarily to deliver information (lyrics) rather than constrain tactics or create a trade-off; Elias does not sacrifice anything to use it, and the ending does not depend on the radio itself—only on the knowledge it provided earlier. Present across beats and linked to closure, but replaceable with any message-delivery device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast concept is mentioned and frames the mystery (who sends it, why), but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Elias listens passively; he does not choose between broadcasting himself or remaining silent, does not risk detection, and does not interact with the sender. The broadcast delivers lyrics that inform his method, but the "pirate" aspect—clandestine, illegal, subversive—plays no causal role. It functions as atmospheric flavor rather than a choice-altering premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "secretly luminous" trait applies to the radio's dial glow, discovered when Elias turns it on. The glow appears in two beats (initial discovery, final intensification) and signals the song's presence, enabling Elias to know when to listen. However, the luminosity does not constrain action or impose cost—it is purely beneficial. No trade-off (e.g., risk of detection, energy drain) is attached. The trait shapes one key turn (initial discovery) and is present at closure, but lacks the cost connection required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears twice: "pulled his cloak tighter" and "in the folds of his cloak." Both mentions are incidental gestures without causal weight. The cloak does not constrain movement, conceal an object, protect against the mist, or return with reweighted meaning. Easily swappable with "coat," "shawl," or removal with no structural impact. Ornamental presence only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "elusive song lyrics" method is signaled early (song in fragments, lyrics slip "like smoke") and used twice: first fragment guides the concept ("Tell the dust what the stars forget"), second fragment provides the instruction ("Gather the grains...spin them to gold"). Elias writes them down and later hums the song to activate the dust. The method shapes his approach and is present at closure (he hums under his breath). However, the mechanics remain vague—why humming works, what makes the lyrics "elusive" versus simply incomplete—so the method feels thematic rather than tactically specific. Two-gate presence with lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove is established early with vivid detail and is identified as "the perfect place" for the work—"hidden, quiet, a pocket of warmth in the endless mist." It houses the desk, radio, and dust jar, and the final paragraph notes "The ember alcove would no longer be a place of endings, but of beginnings." The setting provides warmth and isolation, but does not constrain choice (Elias does not navigate its layout, ration warmth, or defend its secrecy). The thematic reprise in the ending reweights the alcove's meaning without the setting altering tactics. Lyric-resonance pattern with modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "story famine" timeframe is established early ("after the story famine had swallowed every tale whole") and motivates Elias's project. However, time as a tactical constraint is absent: no urgency, no clock, no risk of the famine deepening. Elias works "years" and waits "every night," but these durations are summary rather than pressure. The ending defers action ("The next night, he would gather more") rather than crystallizing a deadline. Present at setup, absent in middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is stated early ("If stories were gone, then he would teach the dust to tell them") and drives the entire arc. Elias gathers dust, interprets lyrics, and hums to activate it—all in service of this goal. The motivation is dramatized in the final beat (dust forms a word, Elias laughs). However, internal conflict is minimal: Elias does not waver, doubt, or pay a visible cost for pursuing this desire. The want is consistent and enacted, but friction between want and cost is largely absent, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" as tone is coherent: the prose is lyric and measured, even during the climactic dust-glow moment ("his voice rough but steady," "the sound brittle but real"). The prickly, quiet texture persists throughout without tonal rupture. However, tone remains static—there is no modulation under pressure, no cadence shift that intensifies at closure. The final image ("Elias smiled") sustains the calm rather than charging it with new tension. Coherent but not dynamically linked to the ending's pressure.</comment>
