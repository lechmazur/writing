<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—finding Mira and understanding thresholds—reads clearly through embodied choices (tracing grain, picking up the prism). His final realization that "some thresholds were not meant to be crossed twice" feels earned by prior particulars. The reflection-heavy mode (approaching 40%) dilutes present pressure; multiple abstract blocks ("featherly determined," "necessary distances") remain static labels rather than contradictions acted in scene. Mira exists only in memory without on-page agency, so relationship pressure never materializes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring images (prism, grain, weather code) and the final moment—Elias setting the prism down and walking away—reconfigures his stance via Earned Stasis with felt cost (accepting her choice to vanish). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (terrace, Elias, sunset). However, causality remains thin: the weather code "47-19-3" and grain analysis generate no on-page discoveries or tactical shifts; Elias's walk-away is prompted by internal epiphany rather than scene pressure. Cost is conceptual (letting go) but not viscerally dramatized in a choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (fractured light, glass tilting underfoot, warm wood grain). The environment charges the final image when Elias sets the prism back and its grain "runs straight," a micro-setting shift that encodes his internal resolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a key choice during escalation—Elias traces and reflects but the terrace's instability never alters his options mid-scene—which holds the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding Mira's disappearance and threshold sacredness—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elias moves from searching for answers to accepting that she left because she had to. Yet the turn lacks agency-driven escalation; no on-page reversal or choice narrows his options. The weather code and grain analysis are invoked but generate no tactical friction or live test. Cost is legible at closure (he walks away, lets go) but remains a realization rather than a forfeiture shaped by prior pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—why some thresholds feel sacred, necessary distances between people—emerges organically from Mira's threshold-mapping and Elias's grain-tracing. The final image (prism grain running straight, terrace swaying, Elias turning away) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: thresholds become sacred where the world bends and distances become visible. The piece avoids moralizing. Reflection occasionally tilts toward abstraction ("necessary distances…became visible"), but particulars (torn sketchbook, pilot code, glass panel footprints) anchor the concept and the ending reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Elias's perceptual signature—grain-focused, memory-laden—remains consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("featherly determined," "fractured hush swallowing his footsteps") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, particularly under emotional pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during reflection. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm supports atmospheric tone, though the voice lacks strong idiosyncrasy; it reads competent and mood-appropriate but not indelibly distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "jagged rainbows…stretched like broken promises," "wood…whispering of storms and stillness," "prism's rainbow edges slicing through the air." In peak beats (Elias's final realization), metaphor accumulates without always clarifying pressure—"fractured hush swallowing his footsteps" ornaments rather than propels. Paraphrase appears: "the necessary distances she had put between them" is restated conceptually in later paragraphs. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports atmosphere. Information density is moderate; some lines (weather code description, butterfly effect aside) add texture but do not advance present stakes. Minor template cadence in reflection blocks. Deductions: figurative density in high-pressure beats −0.5, paraphrase loop −0.2, scaffold in backstory −0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise—father tracing daughter's disappearance via architectural details and weather codes—offers specificity (corn maze architect, pilot logbook, grain analysis). However, the core emotional arc (parent accepting child's departure) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious synthesis. The butterfly effect and "versions of itself" worldbuilding is introduced mid-story but never causally enacted on the page, reading as atmospheric window-dressing. The prism and grain motifs are purposeful but not transformed in hindsight. Emotional truth is present; originality rests on accumulation of particular objects rather than a fresh premise or bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira (corn maze architect's lost child) is present throughout as memory and catalyst but makes no on-page choices. Her past actions (mapping thresholds, leaving the code, vanishing at the terrace) frame Elias's quest yet she remains off-stage. Setup is early, she shapes Elias's motivation (middle), and her absence charges the ending image, satisfying two gates. However, without on-page agency—no decision that alters tactics—she trends functional but replaceable. Band: lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed, closure reprise), lifting score to low-mid 3s. Caps: missing middle development (cap 3.4) and no on-page decision. Deductions: summary-only use −0.3, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pilot logbook weather code "47-19-3" appears in two beats: discovered in Mira's sketchbook and carried in Elias's pocket at the end. Setup is early (first third), it motivates his search (middle), and is present at closure ("weight of the logbook in his pocket the only proof"). However, the code generates no tactical change or reweighted meaning—it remains a static clue that Elias never decodes or uses to alter his approach. Band: two-gate participation (setup, closure mention) allows up to ~6.0, but no causal pressure or cost connection. Caps: swappable (any symbolic clue could substitute) cap 3.8. Deductions: ornamental closure mention −0.5, no middle constraint −0.4. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named early, recurs in reflection, and is central to the thematic question and Elias's final realization ("necessary distances between people became visible"). It shapes stakes (understanding why Mira left) and the ending reconfigures it: Elias accepts that some distances are necessary. Setup, development (implicit in his searching), and payoff are present. However, the concept functions as theme more than on-page constraint—it does not narrow a tactical choice or force a tradeoff mid-scene. Band: three gates met, lyric reprise reweights the stake, allows 5.5–6.3. Deductions: primarily thematic rather than causal pressure −0.4, abstract label −0.3. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" is applied to Mira as a label ("Mira had always been featherly determined") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It appears once in backstory summary, functions as character description, and does not recur or shape a beat. Setup is present (first third), but no middle development or closure participation. Band: one-gate participation (setup only), ornamental. Caps: missing middle development cap 3.4, missing closure cap 2.8 (lowest wins). Deductions: label-only trait −0.3, no causal work −0.3. Final: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears in three beats: Elias tries to "intuit the path she had taken" (tracing grain), recalls Mira intuiting threshold sacredness, and reflects "intuition was a fragile thing" at closure. Setup is early, the action motivates his method (middle), and is present in the final paragraph. However, no major turn traces strictly to intuition—his realization arises from reflection rather than an intuitive leap that changes tactics. The action is thematically resonant but functionally replaceable with "understand" or "sense." Band: three gates, moderate causal involvement. Caps: swappable cap 3.8 applies. Deductions: primarily descriptive/thematic −0.4, no strong causal pressure −0.3. Positive: closure linkage +0.7. Final: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture" is signaled early ("Elias had analyzed the grain in every piece of furniture she'd ever touched") and enacted on the page (tracing terrace benches, observing spirals). Setup and middle development are present; at closure the grain "runs straight," a symbolic payoff. Two beats (initial tracing, final observation) and closure participation satisfy the gate model. However, the method generates no discovery or tactical shift—grain analysis remains atmospheric rather than causal. Band: two gates plus closure mention allows ~6.0. Caps: swappable (any symbolic investigation fits) cap 3.8. Deductions: ornamental use −0.5, no constraint −0.4. Positive: specificity +0.3, closure linkage +0.5. Final: 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" is established early with vivid detail (shimmering glass, fractured light, shifting panels) and dominates the scene. It supplies the final image (prism set down, terrace swaying, Elias walking away) and its instability mirrors Elias's emotional state. Setup, middle presence (he moves across it, picks up a fallen prism), and closure participation are all strong. However, the terrace does not constrain a key choice—Elias could conduct the same internal journey elsewhere with minor edits. Band: three gates, strong closure charge. Caps: none apply. Deductions: postcard description in early beats −0.3, no tactical constraint −0.5. Positive: closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" is mentioned once mid-story ("after the butterfly effect, after the world had splintered into versions of itself") as worldbuilding context but never tightens decisions or alters tactics on the page. Timeframe does not function as a live clock; the piece unfolds in a single continuous present without urgency. Setup is vague (second third), no middle development or closure participation. Band: one-gate participation (mentioned once). Caps: missing setup cap 4.6, missing middle development cap 3.4, missing closure cap 2.8 (lowest wins). Deductions: ornamental mention −0.3, no causal work −0.3. Final: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To discover why some thresholds feel sacred" is Elias's explicit motivation, named early and sustained throughout. It drives his grain-tracing, frames his reflection, and is answered at closure ("he understood…why some thresholds felt sacred"). Setup, middle pursuit (recalling Mira's questions, analyzing benches), and payoff are present. The desire is dramatized in choices (tracing, picking up the prism) and the ending forecloses the search by providing the answer. Band: three gates, causal involvement. Caps: none. Deductions: partly told rather than fully embodied in friction −0.4. Positive: causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (acceptance) +0.3. Final: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is present in diction and imagery throughout (fractured light, silence after the prism clatters, "fractured hush swallowing his footsteps" at closure). Setup is early, tone modulates with Elias's emotional arc (from searching to resignation), and the final image crystallizes it. The tone is coherent across beats and charges the ending. Band: three gates, strong tonal control. Caps: none. Deductions: static mood in middle beats (repetition without escalation) −0.3. Positive: closure linkage +1.0, cadence shift at end +0.5. Final: 6.7.</comment>
