<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to uncover the conspiracy is clear, and her disguise tactic shows agency under pressure. However, interiority remains largely observational rather than contradictory; we see her notice patterns but not wrestle with conflicting impulses in the moment. The final choice to spread the message feels inevitable rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Embodied emotion is minimal—trembling hands are mentioned early but not developed under escalating stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraphs and moves through a clear causal sequence: noticing discrepancies → tracing the hidden message → spreading fragments → coup challenged. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora watches the stars with the conspiracy unraveling, but the cost remains abstract—we don't see what she personally forfeited or how her stance was reconfigured with felt consequence. The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative elements; it holds but the ending image doesn't crystallize a sharp before/after with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is anchored early with specific details (domed roof, eternal candle, parchment smell) and the autumn leaves signal timeframe. The observatory's isolation is noted but never constrains a choice on the page—Liora leaves easily the next morning. The eternal candle appears in two beats (opening and final window scene) and gains slight thematic weight as a "silent witness," pushing it past ornamental. Spatial choreography inside the observatory and in the city streets remains coherent, though the tavern is generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup by spreading hidden truths—is signaled by mid-story and pursued consistently. Pressure tightens once: Liora discovers the date, realizes urgency, and acts. However, the escalation is smooth rather than forced by hard trade-offs; no doors close, no visible costs narrow her options before the ending. The scribe's curiosity and the crowd's arrival feel frictionless. Agency is present (she chooses to disguise herself and distribute fragments) but the final image of the coup being challenged happens off-page, diluting immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth hidden in plain sight, the power of listening and patience over force—emerges organically from Liora's embroidery work and the conspiracy's disguised errors. The eternal candle and the embroidered star fragments recur with slight reweighting at closure. The final paragraph edges toward overt statement ("the quiet power of a story well told"), which undercuts subtextual resonance. The piece resists a neat moral but the ending's assertion that "the city would remember" feels more declared than earned through on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("gnawing certainty," "echoed silence"), fitting an observatory embroiderer's interior world. However, perceptual signature is generic—Liora notices patterns but her way of seeing doesn't feel character-particular beyond her craft. The brief dialogue ("The stars do not lie") serves the plot but carries minimal subtext. Psychic distance stays steady; no filter-verb stacks or register drift, but also no rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean and fluent with no major loops, template cadence, or grammatical errors. Sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe appropriately. Information density is solid—most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere without redundancy. The opening and closing images (golden leaves / eternal candle / stars) are purposeful. Minor issues: "echoed silence" in the penultimate paragraph is abstract, and "thread by thread" in the final movement feels slightly stock. No artifacts touch the closure beat; figurative language is controlled and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—embroiderer uncovers star-chart conspiracy, prevents coup through distributed fragments—synthesizes several familiar elements (hidden knowledge, cartography as rebellion, disguised wisdom) but doesn't transform them through unexpected particulars. The "synchronization of errors" and "adjacent possibilities" methods are named but not rendered with fresh mechanical specificity. Liora's arc and the emotional stakes follow a predictable template: lone expert notices truth, spreads word, collective action follows. The eternal candle and embroidered stars are evocative but not irreplaceable; swapping them for another craft/symbol would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora is on-page throughout and her choices (comparing maps, disguising herself, distributing fragments) drive key turns. She is present in setup, middle action, and closure. However, many beats are observational (noticing discrepancies, watching the revolution) rather than decisive under pressure. The comparison of maps and the decision to act shape the middle turn, and she appears in the final image at the window, so causal pressure and closure linkage are moderate. Swappability is moderate—another scholar or archivist could perform similar functions with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The eternal candle is mentioned in the opening ("faint, sweet smoke of an eternal candle, its flame flickering without ever diminishing") and returns in the closure paragraph ("The eternal candle's flame burned steady beside her, a silent witness"). It appears in two beats with slight symbolic reweighting (flickering → steady), satisfying the lyric-resonance allowance. However, it is never handled, used, or causally involved in a choice; it remains purely atmospheric. Cost connection and causal pressure are absent. Cap at ~4.6 due to missing middle development; actual score reflects its lyric function without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept "unraveling conspiracies" directly shapes the dominant stake and Liora's tactics: she traces the conspiracy through star-chart errors and unravels it by distributing truth-fragments. It is present in setup (noticing discrepancies), development (tracing the hidden message, disguising herself), and closure (the conspiracy unravels "thread by thread"). Causal pressure is solid—the conspiracy's existence and her method of exposing it drive the plot. Specificity is moderate; the mechanics of how discrepancies encode a date are asserted rather than shown in granular detail, and the coup's challenge happens off-page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Liora "disguises her wisdom as foolishness" by dressing as "a foolish old woman...her wisdom hidden beneath a shawl of mismatched threads" and carrying embroidered stars into the city. This enables her to move unnoticed ("no one paid her any mind—just another eccentric artist") and reach the scribe. Present in setup (the story notes the conspiracy "disguised its wisdom as foolishness"), development (her disguise tactic), and thematically linked to closure. However, the cost or constraint of this disguise is minimal—she is not challenged or forced to choose between revelation and safety. The trait is functional but not deeply tested.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears as the key action: Liora synchronizes the truth with "the right ears" by spreading fragments, and the message spreads ("By nightfall, the message had spread"). It is present in setup (the story mentions "synchronization of errors"), development (her distribution campaign), and closure (others come to the observatory, understanding is synchronized). Causal role is moderate—the action enables the coalition that challenges the coup. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in granular beats, and "coordinate" or "distribute" could replace it with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through adjacent possibilities" is named once: "Through adjacent possibilities—the slight variations in each chart—she began to trace the truth." It is present in the middle development beat (tracing the message) and the method is thematically relevant (comparing variations). However, it is not signaled in setup, its mechanics are summarized in a single sentence rather than dramatized across attempts, and it does not constrain later choices or return at closure. Swappability is high—"by comparing discrepancies" would serve the same function. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup and closure participation; actual score reflects single-beat functionality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is anchored in the opening line and reappears throughout: the worktable, the walls lined with maps, the dome's "echoed silence," and the final window scene. It is present in setup, development (others come to the observatory to see the maps), and closure (Liora stands at the observatory's window). The observatory's isolation is noted but never constrains a choice—Liora leaves and returns without friction. The dome's acoustics ("echoed silence") charge the final coalition moment slightly. Environment shapes one middle beat (the gathering) and the closure image, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the coup" is signaled early ("the night the coup was rumored to begin") and made urgent when Liora discovers the date: "the night of the autumn equinox, three days hence." The three-day countdown tightens her decision to act immediately ("The next morning, she disguised herself"). Time is present in setup, development (the countdown drives her tactics), and closure (the coup begins as she watches). The clock is live and alters her moves, though we don't see hour-by-hour pressure or a race against obstacles. Causal role is strong; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation "to listen for unheard stories" is stated explicitly: "She had come to the observatory not just to chart the stars, but to listen for those unheard stories." It shapes her method (noticing what others dismiss as errors, distributing fragments to those who "dared to listen"). Present in setup, development (finding the scribe, gathering listeners), and closure (the silent listeners understand). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs—we don't see her struggle between safety and truth-seeking, and no personal price for listening is shown on the page. Functional but not deeply tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The tone "echoed silence" is invoked explicitly in the penultimate section ("in the echoed silence of the cobalt dome, they understood") and implicitly through the observatory's atmosphere and Liora's quiet methods. It is present in setup (the observatory's stillness, the eternal candle's "silent witness") and closure (watching from the window as revolution echoes outside). Coherence is maintained—no tonal breaks into high action or melodrama. However, the tone is somewhat static; it doesn't modulate significantly with pressure or charge the final image distinctly. The phrase itself is abstract ("echoed silence") and its mechanics—how silence echoes—remain metaphorical rather than sensory.</comment>
