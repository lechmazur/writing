<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—"idealistic map librarian" as "less like a weakness and more like a duty," the desire to return versus staying "one more cycle"—create genuine internal tension. Embodied emotion appears in thumb-polished nail, dampness climbing sleeves, holding the nail tighter. The final choice to stay and complete Seraphine's map earns its weight through the journals/nail causality chain, though the stakes of "reversible exile" remain somewhat abstract until Mirek's warning. Minor deduction for "nervously confident heart librarians cultivate" reading as diagnostic rather than dramatized contradiction in a pressure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through journal decoding → nail bridges sensor → coordinates reveal sky-river → samples found → forecast tightens → approval → staying choice. Closure is Charged Poise: pressing the nail into the table while dreaming "the world softening around our return" crystallizes the narrator's stance—honoring Seraphine now outweighs immediate return—with opportunity cost legible (one more cycle, name filing into forecast). Orientation anchors who/where/what by the experimental station paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mirek warns return is "reversible only as long as you remain useful," reweighting the exile stakes before the stay decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station's "plywood floors that never dry," intercom "coughing foreground static," and "wet animal" hum create coherent waterlogged atmosphere. The cliff face that "sweats," gulls "scissor[ing] the saturated air," and copper screws fitting the nail constrain the discovery beat and charge the samples revelation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (station → cliff → intake → back to station). The setting pressures choices: dampness threatens journals, the intake's location/seal demands the nail, the kite array becomes the delivery mechanism for Seraphine's route.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (earn passage home via proving Seraphine's dismissed story) is signaled early and tightens when journals arrive, nail bridges sensor, samples are found, and approval comes. The narrator's agency drives escalation: petitioning for journals, decoding stanzas, using the nail, retrieving samples. One meaningful reversal: approval to leave arrives, but the narrator stays—choosing ancestor's name over immediate return with visible opportunity cost (one more cycle). Mirek's warning that usefulness is the only guarantee raises the price of staying without fully dramatizing what happens if the Ministry withdraws approval.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (honoring overlooked courage vs. institutional erasure) emerges through the nail, journals, and pauper-box detail without overt statement. The final image—nail pressed into the table, dreaming the world softening—offers a resonant answer: memory work can reconfigure futures, though the system ("reversible only as long as you remain useful") retains its grip. "I hear her cadence like surf" avoids sermonizing; the forecasts "tighten until our tiny world almost clicks" physicalizes validation. Subtext operates in "tools and heroes come from coffins sometimes" and the narrator's refusal to say they hear Seraphine's voice aloud to Mirek.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "boots feel too loud," "paper keeps my pulse honest," "logic of salt, empire, and thrift meeting me here." Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("spongey dread," "filaments forward like spared mercy," "sea...answers only in the patient yawning of holes"). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable. Minor penalty for "plywood floors that never dry" and "intercom that coughs foreground static" reading slightly elevated in register for a narrator under waterlogged duress, and for the phrase "navigational poetics" arriving without prior POV grounding in that exact term.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer character, atmosphere, and plot. Figurative language ("gulls scissor the saturated air as if cutting a dress from skin," "tiny world almost clicks") is vivid but clusters heavily, risking overwriting in peak beats. Template-cadence runs appear: "I arrive... I call... I am... I carry... I question... I map" across multiple paragraphs, creating a drumbeat that flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "reversible exile" is named, then Mirek repeats "what we are under the gentle phrase reversible exile" two paragraphs later without added pressure. Minor syntax monotony in parallel "I [verb]" stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—map librarian decoding ancestor's navigational poetry via a coffin nail to prove climate science the Ministry dismissed—feels specific and non-obvious. The "reversible exile" frame and waterlogged weather station avoid generic settings. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Deduction for the ancestor-vindicates-descendant arc and the "overlooked woman scientist proves the establishment wrong" template being widely used; the story transforms it through the nail/journals/stanza mechanics and "reversible only as long as you remain useful" edge, but the emotional spine remains familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present throughout; choices (petition for journals, decode stanzas, use nail, retrieve samples, stay one more cycle) create key turns. The idealism is embodied in "too publicly" petitioning and staying beyond approval. "Idealistic map librarian" is stated early and the trait shapes the final stay decision with opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Appears in four distinct beats: introduced as thumb-polished talisman, bridges broken sensor, fits the intake screws, pressed into table at closure. Each use is causally different and the final reprise reweights it from relic to tool to anchor. Removing it would break the sensor fix, intake access, and the charged final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Named early, restated by Mirek with the warning "reversible only as long as you remain useful," and the final stay decision directly engages it. The concept shapes the dominant stake (earn deliverable knowledge to leave) and the closure choice (staying one more cycle risks that reversibility). Cost is somewhat abstract; the consequence of staying is not fully dramatized beyond "one more cycle."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Nervously confident heart librarians cultivate" is stated in paragraph two but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains label-only; no beat shows the nervousness and confidence acting simultaneously to force a trade-off or mistake.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrator questions the intercom, sea, and whether returning home is still home. The sea-questioning beat occurs at the cliff and frames the sample discovery. The "question whether returning home" line articulates internal conflict but does not itself turn the plot. Two beats involve questioning; swapping for another verb (e.g., "ask," "doubt") would not break structure, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Introduced early (journals "sing through coded stanzas"), mechanics matter (stanzas translate to drift angles/cloud heights, require "a certain angle"), and the method enables the coordinate mapping that drives the middle and validates Seraphine. Removing the coded-stanza method would break the discovery chain. Present in at least three beats: journal arrival, decoding under red bulb, sending coordinates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The station's wet floors, coughing intercom, kite array, and red bulb light create coherent atmosphere and the kite array is the delivery mechanism for coordinates. The cliff intake (part of the station's monitoring network) supplies the hidden samples. The setting constrains the narrator's tools and provides the infrastructure (sensors, algorithms, kite) that prove Seraphine's route.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stated in the opening line and repeated in paragraph 17 as framing backstory ("after the jet stream shifts, the old routes...crumble"). The shift creates the waterlogged world and the need for new wind maps, motivating the station's existence and Seraphine's relevance. Does not function as a live clock tightening decisions on the page; it is static past-tense context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("to honor an ancestor's overlooked bravery by finding the route she died trying to name") and dramatized through petitioning, decoding, cliff trip, and the final stay decision to file Seraphine's name into the forecast. Friction appears when approval to leave arrives but the narrator stays, trading immediate return for completing the ancestor's map—a visible cost that validates the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is named once via Mirek's eyes. Tone throughout is elegiac, lyric, waterlogged, with dread implicit in "reversible only as long as you remain useful" and the sea's "patient yawning of holes." The mood modulates from cautious arrival to discovery urgency to charged closure but "spongey" as a specific tonal quality is more asserted than texturally sustained across beats.</comment>
