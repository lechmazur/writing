<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is richly embodied through her plant-telepathy and insurgent stance, with micro-choices (altering the sigil's angle, choosing question over command) that reveal hierarchy of values. The council confrontation near the end carries clear status dynamics and her final refusal crystallizes a renunciation with visible cost. Minor weakness: the embryo's voice ("asking who sang, asking who would choose") leans slightly diagnostic but is quickly grounded in Mara's concrete response. The change is earned through prior causality and forecloses a path (display versus stewardship).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (valley, hot springs, reconstruction, Mara's satchel) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the kite decode, the ritual cycles, and the amber's unsealing until the final image reweights "implanted destiny" with visible cost (Mara's promise, the frond's glow, tradition rearticulated). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Conceptual Repricing): the embryo's translucent frond and Mara's refusal to kneel before growth constitute a decisive reweighting of the premise with conceptual cost legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (heat-cycle ritual to frond sprouting) is present; the cost is clear in her stance against the council and the seedlings' promised autonomy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the heat/cool ritual is spatially anchored (slate ledge, dripping mineral water, basalt snag), timed by broken watch and reed songs, and directly enables the unsealing. The springs' sigh of approval at the end charges the final image. Sensory detail (ghostly steam, pumice, wet stone smell) is selective and filtered through Mara's priorities; the reeds' "chords of mineral thirst" and the moss/fern feedback shape her ritual pacing. The environment is lived-in and causally integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolve tradition with intent versus obedient destiny) is signaled early and tightens through the kite decode, the unsealing ritual, and Mara's alteration of the sigil. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: decoding the script, timing the heat cycles under reed guidance, and swapping command for question. The council's arrival is coincidental timing but does not resolve—Mara's prior choice has already altered the embryo's trajectory. Visible cost: she defies council authority and accepts stewardship responsibility, foreclosing the altar/display path. One meaningful tightening (ritual failure if rushed, success when slowed) narrows options and the cost is legible in her final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (consent versus imposed destiny, tradition as living joint versus brittle cast) emerges from concrete particulars: the kite's cryptic script, the heat ritual, the altered sigil, the frond's translucent glow. The final image—frond remembering questions first, Mara's refusal of altars, tradition "rearticulated"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the reeds' warning, the council's clipboard arrival "late," and the embryo's agreement registered as pulse and warmth. One risk: "implanted destiny without consent is only sleepwalking" borders on thematic echo, but it's delivered in confrontation with visible cost (council authority rejected) and does not replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; diction ("insurgent grandmother," "sermon in vitrines," "middle music") is distinctly voice-driven and character-particular. Perceptual signature: Mara notices plant murmurs, mineral thirst, chlorophyll translation—details filtered through her accidental telepathy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during ritual, wider for reconstruction framing). Minor slips: "the botanists muttered while avoiding her eyes" is efficient setup but slightly tells; "as if the springs themselves moved to unseal" leans explanatory. Rhythm varies naturally and compression under ritual pressure (short breaths, heat/cool cycles) supports tension without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve multiple jobs (e.g., "ash in her braid and court fines in her pocket" establishes insurgent status and legal conflict). Rhythm varies and figurative language ("middle music," "roots explore stone") is purposeful. Minor loop: "implanted destiny" recurs frequently—acceptable as motif but borders on insistence. Template cadence check: several sentences open with "The" or "She" in the ritual sequence, creating slight monotony but not enough to obscure causality. No major clarity lapses; the Text Artifact Screen passes. Propulsion is strong through the unsealing sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of accidental plant telepathy, volcanic ritual mechanics, and consent-driven tradition evolution is specific and non-obvious; the kite decode as method feels fresh. The frond "remembering questions first" and Mara's sigil alteration (swapping command for question) transform the destiny trope through grounded choice. Risk-taking (lyric compression, dense world-building in 800 words, quiet confrontation with council) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The piece avoids template plots and the emotional truth (elder refusing kneeling before growth) feels earned. Transformation test: the arc depends on these exact elements and would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's choices create all key turns: decoding the kite, performing the ritual, altering the sigil, confronting the council. She is present in every beat and her decisions drive escalation and closure. Signaled early (second sentence), developed through middle choices (ritual pacing under reed guidance), and decisive at closure (promise to steward, refusal of altars). High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Cost is visible: she defies council, accepts stewardship burden, and rearticulates tradition.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The embryo appears early (fourth sentence), is handled across multiple beats (nestled on slate, warmed by springs, spoken to, cupped, touched to mineral water), and its unsealing and sprouting constitute the climax and final image. Meaning reweights from relic-as-proof to being-that-asks-questions. The frond's glow paints scaffolds with "newborn moonlight" and its translucent presence charges closure. Causal pressure: the ritual's success depends on the amber's response; the piece would fail without this exact object. Specificity and irreplaceability are maximal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" is the core conflict stake, named early and threaded through the kite script ("a phrase sewn into the glyphs"), the embryo's question ("who would choose its implanted destiny"), Mara's rejection ("loathed obedience when it masqueraded as fate"), and the council confrontation ("implanted destiny without consent is only sleepwalking"). It shapes all tactics: the ritual method, the sigil alteration, the final stewardship promise. The concept changes options (command versus question) and the closure reweights it into "invited" destiny. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plant telepathy enables key on-page actions with cost: Mara asks sedges to hum symbols' taste (chlorophyll translation), moss hisses when she rushes (forces pacing correction), ferns applaud when she slows (guides ritual timing), reeds advise minerals and songs (shapes unsealing tactics). Signaled early ("accidentally telepathic"), developed in middle beats (ritual feedback loop), and present at closure (sedges tell her the frond remembers questions first). Visible tradeoff: she depends on plant parliament for guidance, constraining her autonomy. One beat shy of indispensable (the ritual could hypothetically proceed without feedback, though less successfully).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The unsealing action is the story's spine: signaled early (council wants display, Mara wants to unseal), the kite decode reveals the method, the ritual enacts it across fifteen cycles, and the unsealing (amber softens, kernel blinks, frond sprouts) is the climax and final image. All major turns trace to this action; it redefines options (obedient destiny versus invited destiny) and forecloses the display path. Causal pressure maximal; closure linkage complete; irreplaceable. The piece would collapse if this action were removed or swapped.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The kite decode is signaled early (ninth sentence: "By decoding a cryptic script..."), its mechanics matter (sedges hum symbols, chlorophyll translates, code resolves into heat/cool intervals), and it shapes all unsealing attempts (the ritual's method). The kite tail reappears when Mara changes one sigil's angle, swapping command for question—this alteration is causally decisive. Introduced in first third, developed in middle (decoding beat, script mechanics), and reused at closure with reweighted meaning. High causal pressure and beat involvement; one step below indispensable (the method could theoretically be simpler, though it would lose specificity).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs supply the unsealing mechanism: heat pulses "like breathing" time the ritual, dripping mineral water provides cooling, the slate ledge anchors the amber, and the springs' sigh of approval validates closure. Environment constrains tactics (Mara must match the springs' rhythm or fail) and charges the final image (springs, scaffolds, newborn moonlight). Signaled early (first sentence), developed through ritual beats (heat for eight breaths, cool with dripping water), and present at closure. High micro-setting integration; the unsealing would fail without this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"During the reconstruction" frames the story (first sentence, repeated in penultimate paragraph) and supplies social context (council rebuilding temples, terraced seedbeds, scaffolded bathhouses). The timeframe shapes Mara's urgency (reconstruction as moment of choice: calcify or evolve tradition) and the council's motives (display the relic as destiny-proof). Present at setup and closure; middle beats focus on ritual rather than temporal pressure. One causal link: the reconstruction context justifies the council's arrival and Mara's insurgent stance. Could score higher with a live ticking clock or more explicit time constraint shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The motivation ("to evolve tradition with intent") is dramatized through conflicted choices: Mara wants to "renovate the vow" (not erase elders but teach seedlings to ask why), loathes obedience-as-fate, alters the sigil to swap command for question, and refuses altars that demand kneeling. Friction between want and cost: she defies council authority, accepts stewardship burden, and promises to refuse altars—each choice forecloses a safer path. Signaled early ("wanted something else"), developed through ritual and sigil alteration, and decisive at closure (promise to steward, tradition rearticulated). High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>
