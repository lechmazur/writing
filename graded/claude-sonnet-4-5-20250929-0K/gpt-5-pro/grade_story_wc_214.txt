<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is densely particular ("I had ribs once broken by a grief I could not lift"), and the progression from isolation to teaching care is embodied through micro-choices (holding the lantern glass, opening shutters, passing the glass to the foreman). Internal contradiction appears in the paradox of strength through vulnerability, lived out in concrete gestures. The final stance—"quietly, enduringly"—earns its cost through the season's reprieve and the embodied ritual of mopping and blessing. Minor slip: the crew's turn feels slightly rushed, though the foreman forgetting the deadline supplies a visible moment of shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator's patient care and the crew's conversion secure "a season," foreclosing the dismantling path with visible cost (the decommission notice deferred, the station's fragile survival). The accumulative/textural lens holds: chalk tracings, the lantern glass circulation, and the final breathing-with-the-sky image deepen without requiring causal reversal. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One tightening: the meteor drizzle becomes a rush, and tracing persuades the station into tune, shifting the crew's stance. Cost is legible in "granted the place a season"—a conditional reprieve, not a permanent victory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station's physicality—antennas as "vertebrae," the tin cup taped to a mast, ozone-and-chalk air—constrains and enables the climactic beat: opening shutters, tracing on paper, persuading receivers into tune. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, charging the closure when it circulates "hand to hand." Spatial choreography is clean (room with shutters, mast-mounted cup, the gate crack). The "overlooked era" and mountain-sky interface texture the narrator's solitude without becoming a postcard. Environment directly shapes the crew's reversal: the station "remembers how to sing," and that embodied memory alters their choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (station's survival vs. decommission) is signaled when the salvage crew arrives. The narrator's agency—showing the room, passing the lantern glass, opening shutters, tracing the surge—forecloses the dismantling path with visible cost: "granted the place a season" is conditional, not permanent. One meaningful deepening: the drizzle becomes a rush, and the crew shifts from clipboards to empathy. The escalation is driven by the narrator's micro-choices under the accumulative lens, and the cost (a reprieve, not a solution) is legible. The crew's turn hinges on witnessing the station's "flourishing stillness," not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chalk tracings, lantern glass, and the paradox of "flourishing stillness"—a loud quiet that feeds itself. The story resists moralizing: care is defined through concrete gestures (wiping rails, blessing bolts, passing warmth) rather than abstract declaration. The final image—breathing with the sky, "quietly, enduringly"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of strength through vulnerability, reweighting the narrator's broken ribs and the station's fragility without stating a thesis. The crew's empathy is earned by witnessing the wound that widens without tearing, not by assertion. Subtext operates in the foreman forgetting the deadline and thermoses appearing on off days.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "cosmic janitor," "apologize to the wind for all this metal," "a bruise that remembers healing." The narrator's way of noticing is spiritually inflected yet grounded in tactile ritual. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate interiority, then outward focus during the crew scene). The prose rhythm supports pressure: longer, meditative sentences in solitude compress slightly during the meteor surge without losing the contemplative texture. Filter verbs ("I see," "I said") fit the reflective mode. No head-hopping; the crew's interior shift is inferred through external cues (clipboards hung loose, foreman forgets deadline).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines layer image, action, and thematic charge ("the sky wasting itself in sparks, and every hiss teaches patience to my bruised ribs"). Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm breathes. Minor figurative density in mid-passage: "river that says, hush, go with the drag of gravity" and "muscle of quiet that flexes the sky" cluster without muddling sense, but the accumulation slightly slows momentum before the crew arrives. No loops or scaffolding. A few elevated constructions ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") repeat the core concept without variation, risking template echo, but the specificity of chalk-and-ozone anchors prevent full drift. Propulsion is steady, not urgent, fitting the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic-scale imagery with janitorial intimacy and the inversion of "strength in vulnerability" through tactile ritual (mopping, chalk tracing, lantern-glass sharing) feels specific and non-obvious. The story transforms the decommissioned-station trope by centering care-as-witness rather than heroic intervention. The crew's conversion via sensory empathy (watching the tracings, hearing the ping, experiencing the "flourishing stillness") avoids the explain-everything ending. The "yellow lantern glass as small sun" and the chalk maps as breath-shapes offer fresh particularity. Risk is present in the lyric-accumulative structure and the quiet closure, which land without gimmickry. Transformation test: swapping names/places would require new images; the station's "vertebrae" and the narrator's broken ribs are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor's choices drive key turns: taking the job to "learn how to lift only light," showing the crew the room, passing the lantern glass, opening shutters, tracing the surge. These decisions alter the crew's stance and secure the season reprieve. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (teaching empathy through tracing), and closure (breathing with the sky). The role constrains and enables: janitorial access grants intimate knowledge of the station's sensitivity, and the unchosen humility makes the teaching credible. Cost is visible when "I said I would teach them to care," foreclosing solitude.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears in at least three functional beats: found and pocketed (setup, "small sun"); held to the eye to see "the world glows like a bruise that remembers healing" (middle self-care); passed to the foreman before the meteor surge (climax choice); and circulated "hand to hand" in closure. Each use reweights meaning from personal talisman to communal ritual. Removing it would break the tactile proof of care and the crew's conversion catalyst. Specific cost: sharing the glass relinquishes private solace and initiates collective witness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named explicitly and demonstrated through the station's "loud quiet that fed itself" and the maps' "muscle of quiet that flexes the sky." It shapes the narrator's stake (preserving the station's capacity to listen) and the crew's conversion ("the foreman forgot the deadline"). Present in middle reflection and closure ("quietly, enduringly"). The concept constrains tactics: the narrator's patience and refusal to armor enable the teaching moment. Cost is implied in the conditional reprieve. Slight swappability: "living silence" or similar phrases could serve with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is signaled early ("by the ache that opens when I sweep dust and find the cosmos hiding in each glittering grit") and enables on-page actions: learning to empathize with stones and machines, tracing meteor paths, teaching the crew. The trait constrains the narrator's method—curiosity without doctrine sustains patience through isolation. It shapes the middle turn (showing the crew the room) and inflects the closure (breathing with the sky as a spiritual act). Cost: the curiosity binds the narrator to the station's fragility, risking grief when the season ends. Minor label-only echo in "spiritually curious" phrase itself, but the trait is embodied through gesture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Empathize" drives the major turn: the narrator empathizes with stones and machines (middle), then teaches the crew to empathize with "the world that burns and still offers light" (climax), which cancels the dismantling. The action is causally indispensable: without teaching empathy, the crew proceeds with decommission. Present in setup (empathizing with stones), development (showing the crew), and closure (the crew returns, keeping company). Specific mechanics: empathy is enacted through tracing the surge and speaking about broken ribs, not mere assertion. Cost is legible: the narrator's vulnerability becomes public, and the teaching role forecloses solitude.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By tracing the path of falling stars" is signaled in setup ("every storm I trace the path…chalk over paper"), demonstrated in the climactic beat ("I began to trace the lines as if calming a fevered child"), and powers the crew's conversion ("the page filling with silver charcoal"). The method's mechanics matter: tracing "persuade[s] the station into tune," and the maps curve into "the shape of a held bird," making the abstract stake visible. Removing this method would break the crew's witness and the station's reprieve. Cost: the labor is solitary and repetitive until shared, and the maps' "surrender" motif charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station supplies the receiver that catches the first ping, the shutters that open "like a throat," the old camera plates for chalk tracing, and the ozone-chalk air that the crew must enter to witness the surge. The station's decommissioned status is the dominant threat, and its "memory" (ability to sing) is the resource that shifts the crew. Present in setup, pressures all middle beats, and the closure image (station breathes with the narrator and crew). Spatial detail constrains choreography: the room, mast, gate, rails. Removing the station's specific function would collapse the stakes and method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" establishes a temporal frame of neglect (staff vanished, automation, decommission notice), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions beat by beat. The "first winter" and "one autumn" mark passage without creating urgency. The meteor forecast and the crew's arrival impose loose timing, but no live clock forces the tracing or teaching. The era's overlooked quality supports tone and theme (care for the dismissed), yet swapping "forgotten decade" or "abandoned years" would not alter tactics. Present in setup and thematic coloring, but not in escalation mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is dramatized early ("I took this job to learn how to lift only light, and let heaviness speak") and tested in the climactic beat: the narrator reveals broken ribs to the crew, embodying the "soft belly of attention." This vulnerability enables the teaching and the crew's empathy, canceling the dismantling. The desire conflicts with the cost of exposure (public grief) and the conditional reprieve (strength remains fragile). Present in setup, middle reflection, climax confession, and closure ("quietly, enduringly" accepts ongoing vulnerability). The motivation is irreplaceable: a different desire (e.g., to preserve history) would not generate the same embodied teaching or crew conversion.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is sustained through diction ("the night moves with primal elegance when the showers come," "vertebrae," "spine of air") and modulates with pressure: meditative in solitude, heightened during the surge ("the drizzle became a rush"), quieting at closure ("quietly, enduringly"). The tone charges the final image, making the breathing-with-the-sky moment resonate without sentimentality. Coherent through turns, though the phrase "primal elegance" itself appears only once explicitly and risks being a label rather than fully enacted texture. The elevated register fits the narrator's spiritual curiosity and remains stable under stress. Removing this tonal control would flatten the lyric accumulation and the crew's conversion.</comment>
