<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is lyric and specific ("my words knew the road and my heart did not"), with embodied emotion through gesture and spatial movement. The shift from passive keeper to active installation-builder shows earned agency with visible cost: the public exposure of private longing. Minor slip: the woman's dust-in-hair detail feels slightly convenient as a mirror, and her silent complicity lacks friction that would deepen the reconciliation stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the protagonist and the woman stand over the nest, tie their silence to the twine, and the final image ("the thread that connects all things had found us") reconfigures the opening premise with felt cost—public vulnerability replaces private ghostwriting. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Orientation anchors early (ghostwriter, temple, post-storm). One meaningful deepening: the spiral installation transforms passive secrecy into shared witness, narrowing future options with undeniable emotional exposure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lily pond, south colonnade, and thrush's nest supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain the installation's choreography. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("dragonflies stitch the edges," "ribbon vibrate in the fragrant air"). The nest functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Minor gap: the crowd's physical staging—how many, exact positions—blurs slightly during the spiral-building, though it does not break coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rejoin the lost woman through public art rather than private pleading. The tightening is clear: the protagonist moves from solitary letter-drying to public installation, inviting strangers and thereby exposing personal longing. The woman's arrival and their walk to the nest crystallize the cost—silence becomes shared witness, foreclosing the option to retreat into secrecy. One micro turn (the crowd's participation) deepens pressure without fragmenting the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—connection through public vulnerability rather than private control—emerges organically from the spiral installation and the contrast between ghostwritten letters and the protagonist's own silence. The nest, ribbon, and letters form a coherent pattern that reweights "keeper of secrets" into "believer in public light." The final image ("the thread that connects all things had found us") answers the opening question non-literally, with earned resonance. No overt moralizing; the ending invites reflection through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, tightly controlled, and perceptually distinct: "letters I carry swell with damp, their edges scalloped like lilies." POV distance is stable; the narrator's way of noticing (letters as living things, geometry as patience) remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, advancing plot and subtext ("let your own breath be the first permission you grant"). Minor slip: the boy's question and grandmother's action feel slightly convenient as validation beats, though they do not break voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, image, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "the ribbon" recurs frequently without always adding new pressure, and "secrets" echoes in similar phrasing across three beats. The final image is clean and propulsive. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one phrase ("pupil opening, asking me to look again") borders on mixed metaphor but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghostwriter-as-installation-artist synthesis is fresh, and the public spiral built from others' letters offers a non-obvious angle on reconciliation. The nest and ribbon as borrowed, found objects ground the premise in specificity. Minor derivative note: the "keeper of secrets learns to share" arc follows a recognizable template, though the lyric execution and tangible installation method elevate it. The transformation test passes: swapping names and places would lose the lily-pond temple and letter-scallop particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ghostwriter identity frames the opening, motivates the letter-collection, and shapes the final stance ("keeper of secrets who believes in public light"). The character's decision to build the installation is a key turn. However, the ghostwriting itself does not constrain a middle choice or complicate the spiral-building; it functions more as premise than active pressure. Present in closure via self-description, but causally passive there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nest appears early (found in reeds), is handled ("I cup it"), anchors the spiral's center, and charges the final image where the protagonist and woman "stood over the nest and read what strangers had made." The crimson ribbon inside it drives the visual motif and ties the wedding/reunion theme. Three beats: discovery, installation anchor, closure focus. Irreplaceable: the nest's geometry and borrowed ribbon are causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Keeper of secrets" is named early, recurs at midpoint ("I told him I was the keeper of secrets and their courier"), and inverts at closure ("keeper of secrets who believes in public light"). It shapes the protagonist's motive to shift from private ghostwriting to public installation. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than active constraint; no mid-scene choice hinges on secrecy versus disclosure mechanics. Lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inevitably whimsical" is used once as label-only descriptor ("my inevitably whimsical trade") without constraining an on-page action or enabling a tactic. The monks' acceptance of the trade does not test whimsy under pressure. No visible cost tied to the trait. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rejoin" drives the protagonist's goal from declaration ("I wanted to rejoin the one I lost") through the installation's design (a public path for the woman to walk) to the closure beat where the woman arrives and they walk the spiral together. The action redefines options: rejoin via public art, not pleading. Present across three beats: motive statement, installation construction, and the woman's entry. The reunion itself is dramatized, not merely recounted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The installation method is signaled early ("public art installation that anyone could enter"), its mechanics detailed (twine, letters, spiral path), and it shapes the middle beats: strangers binding letters, the crowd's participation, the protagonist's guidance. The installation enables the woman's approach and the shared reading at closure. The spiral's physical structure constrains the reunion choreography. Irreplaceable: swapping for a different method (letter, song, etc.) would require major structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond anchor the opening and supply the south colonnade space where the installation is built. The pond's reflective surface and dragonflies enrich atmosphere. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; the colonnade functions as stage rather than active constraint. The nest (pond-sourced) carries more causal weight. The setting charges tone and context but remains largely backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the cloud bursts" frames the opening and motivates the letter-drying errand that brings the protagonist to the temple. The storm's aftermath (wet letters, cleared air) sets the prismatic-quiet tone. However, no on-page clock tightens decisions; the timeframe is more atmospheric anchor than escalation device. The passage from storm to dusk is tracked but does not narrow options. Functional setup, minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find the thread that connects all things" is the protagonist's stated motive, echoed when describing the ghostwriting role and inverted at closure ("the thread...had found us"). The desire drives the installation concept (a visible spiral connecting strangers' words). However, the friction between wanting connection and fearing exposure is implied more than dramatized in a choice with visible cost. The motive shapes the arc but remains thematic layer rather than tested stake in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Prismatic quiet" is named in the opening line, recurs in the temple's atmosphere ("petaled hush"), and closes the piece ("the prismatic quiet joined our hands"). The tone modulates subtly: post-storm calm, crowd murmur, dusk stillness. It charges the final image by returning with the added weight of shared silence. Coherent throughout; the quiet intensifies rather than breaks under pressure. Strong reprise that reweights the opening frame.</comment>
