<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The repairman's trait of wilting near dishonesty drives two key choices (respecting the elders' candor, naming his tools for courage), but interiority relies heavily on metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. "He felt that theft as a bruise in the harmonics" abstracts emotion when physical reaction would sharpen it. The covenant of rust receives more dramatic weight than the protagonist's internal conflict, leaving his agency partly ornamental. No major micro-choices under simultaneous contradictory impulses; the path from motive to action reads linear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: the elders amend their oath, morning is released, and the compromise is "hammered thin like leaf" with visible social cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered metaphor and the final image reweights the rust-versus-light opposition. Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clear by ~150 words; "when" clarified only after "first morning without dawn"), causing brief disorientation, but the delay does not obscure the closure unit. One meaningful deepening occurs when the repairman crosses into midnight and the hinge choice prevents future betrayal, narrowing the constable's options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber functions as both literal workspace and metaphoric frame: "sound could be seen as drifting filaments" establishes sensory logic, and the final image ("morning loose inside the dome… like oil that smells of apples") charges the space with consequence. The chip and drum are handled across multiple beats, altering tactics (tether construction, scale played backward). Spatial choreography remains abstract—lamps, stakes, and the keyhole lack concrete positions—but the micro-objects (chip, drum, tweezers) constrain choices enough to reach mid-7s. No occupational depth for "resonance chamber" mechanics; the term floats as poetic rather than technical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim stolen dawn) is signaled early and tightens when the covenant forbids interference, forcing the repairman to act against institutional doctrine with relational cost. One clear reversal: loosening the lamps' fear stakes allows light migration, and the constable's attempt to close the window is thwarted by the hinge-mending method, foreclosing his control. The cost is legible on the page: the elders amend their oath, and the repairman bows without yielding, accepting partial compromise. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—metaphoric density increases until the final image crystallizes the truce. No secondary stake develops; midnight's townspeople remain scenery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (balance between preservation and renewal, honesty as structural necessity) emerges through the rust covenant and the protagonist's dishonesty-allergy rather than statement. The chip, drum, and hinge recur with reweighted meaning, and the final image ("bright meets brittle, an honest compromise hammered thin") offers a non-literal answer. However, "memory must not be scrubbed away" and "balance binds all" veer toward thesis language, and "tinkersong wonder blossomed" in the final phrase names the effect rather than earning it through image alone. Subtext operates in the elders' nod and the repairman's bow, but the conceptual machinery ("mending what isn't torn") is articulated rather than purely enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the repairman notices sound as filament, names tools for courage, and reads smiles as lies. Diction remains consistently elevated and metaphor-dense, voice-motivated by the protagonist's synesthetic craft. However, register stays uniform across pressure peaks—confronting the constable and unwinding the drum receive identical lyric treatment, flattening urgency gradients. No dialogue on the page to test differentiation. Free indirect style is clean, though participle openers ("He asked," "He lifted," "He wound") create template cadence in the middle third. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades without clear pattern-teaching: "bruise in the harmonics," "bell held shut by a thumb," "apology as a collar," "turning a page underwater" stack metaphors in adjacent lines, creating coherence strain under pressure. Paraphrase loop: "He would listen for the future crack… and stitch it closed" repeats the mending-what-isn't-torn concept already established. Template cadence: "He lifted… He built… He wound… He played…" across four consecutive beats in the drum sequence (−0.4). Information density is high—most lines advance image and action—but the lyric register obscures causal sequencing (how does the scale "become" a keyhole?). No severe clarity breaks at closure, capping deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic repair craft, temporal theft, and institutional rust-worship offers a non-obvious premise. "Mending what isn't torn" as preemptive method and the covenant's doctrine create fresh friction. Execution risk (dense metaphor, elided mechanics) heightens stakes without full obscurity, earning within-band lift. However, the moral calculus (honesty versus entropy-worship) resolves predictably: the repairman's transparency wins institutional amendment without personal forfeiture. Midnight-as-town and the constable's shadow-badge read conceptually vivid but lack the grounded detail that would make them irreplaceable; swap "constable" for "mayor" and the logic holds. Transformation test: the emotional arc (principled defiance, partial compromise) would survive different setting and objects.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early ("repairman opened his palms"), drives two choices (respecting elders' honesty, crossing into midnight), and appears in closure (bows, sets light on floor). His decisions narrow options: asking for truth steadies him, loosening lamp stakes enables light migration, mending the hinge forecloses the constable's control. Causal pressure across setup, middle, and ending. Irreplaceability high—craft identity shapes method and motive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("tiny red wedge… pinned above the bench"), used in two beats (set in drum heart, hums key to unlock sky-window), and charges closure (persuades window to stay open, enabling morning's return). Specific properties matter: makes light weigh more, warns when time cheats. Swap for generic magic token and the sensory logic weakens. Cost connection: using the chip commits the repairman's unrepeatable resource.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (first morning without dawn), shapes the central conflict (elders forbid interference, forcing the repairman's defiance), and participates in closure (elders amend their oath). The covenant's doctrine ("rust remembers rain… memory must not be scrubbed away") narrows options and creates relational cost. However, the rust itself remains abstract; no on-page rust object is handled or transformed. Could swap "covenant of rust" for "guild of preservation" without structural loss, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Signaled early ("wilts near dishonesty, the way a lily folds"), enables two on-page choices (blooms when elders' last evasion leaves; steadies by naming honest tools), and implicitly shapes the ending (bows to elders after they admit truth). Visible tradeoff: the trait constrains him from acting until honesty is established, delaying dawn's rescue. Specificity high—the lily simile and "candid metals" root the trait in craft vocabulary. Not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled mid-story ("built a tether out of braided violin hair and sailor knots"), used to draw light back through the keyhole, and participates in closure ("bright tether singing harmless knots"). Specific method matters: "light prefers to travel with a tune" ties it to the music-box craft. The tether redefines how stolen dawn can be reclaimed—physical binding rather than negotiation—creating a tactical turn. Could reduce to "retrieval" generically, but the violin-hair specificity and knot logic elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Introduced early ("mending what isn't torn"), demonstrated in mid-story ("sewing patience into the hinge so the future slammed door would refuse to exist"), and named again at closure context. The method is irreplaceable: preemptive repair of a non-existent break defines the protagonist's unique leverage against the constable. Two distinct beats (future-crack lullaby, hinge patience) plus closure linkage. High causal pressure and specificity; swap for generic "foresight" and the craft logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Established early ("worked in a resonance chamber beneath the broken observatory"), used to trap sound-as-filaments and brighten when the drum is wound, appears in closure ("let the morning loose inside the dome"). The chamber enables the synesthetic method and houses the final release. However, it functions mostly as backdrop; no choice hinges on chamber-specific constraint (e.g., acoustics forcing a particular action). Micro-objects (chip, drum) do more tactical work. Purposeful but partly replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Title phrase ("in the balance") and the elders' statement ("balance binds all") frame urgency, and the stolen dawn creates implicit deadline pressure. The timeframe shapes the repairman's decision to act immediately rather than wait. Appears in closure as the amended oath protects "soft balance where bright meets brittle." However, no visible countdown or ticking constraint narrows tactics beat-by-beat; the pressure reads conceptual rather than temporal. Mid-band: functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stated early ("reclaim the light stolen by midnight… simple and enormous"), dramatized in the crossing-into-midnight sequence (loosening lamps, opening window), and resolved in closure (morning released into the dome). Friction between motive and method: his dishonesty-allergy forces him to ask for truth first, delaying action. The desire conflicts with the elders' doctrine, creating relational cost. Two beats (confronting elders, acting in midnight) plus closure participation. Specificity high—"children wake to ash" stakes are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is lyric-dense and metaphor-rich throughout ("clocks hummed awake," "midnight had learned to steal," "apology as a collar"). Modulates slightly under pressure: the constable's smile and the repairman's knee-softening inject menace, and the final image ("oil that smells of apples") lightens after compromise. Coherence holds, but the register stays uniformly elevated across all beats, limiting dynamic range. The final phrase "tinkersong wonder blossomed" names the tone rather than enacting it through image alone, weakening the charge. Functional reprise, mid-6s.</comment>
