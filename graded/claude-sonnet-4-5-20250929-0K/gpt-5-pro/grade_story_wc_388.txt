<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's professional identity as a debunker is established early and shapes approach, but the character remains somewhat instrumental to the investigation rather than deeply contradicted by it. Internal conflict is present in the choice to write truth versus leave names out, but this arrives late and resolves quickly. Klay is well-drawn through gesture and speech ("spoke them the way a man clutches a heating stone"), applying meaningful pressure at the end. The final micro-choice—agreeing to omit names—feels slightly convenient rather than forced by visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: narrator arrives → investigates → assembles letters → learns the truth → confronts Klay → decides what to write. One meaningful tightening occurs when the diamond's true function is revealed, narrowing the narrator's options from "debunk a curse" to "expose an engineering cover-up or protect the caretaker." Closure is Charged Poise: Klay's question "if I could leave the names out" crystallizes the ethical stakes, and the narrator's agreement reconfigures the initial debunking mission with felt cost (complicity in the lie). The cost is legible in "dust began to build at the orchard edge," signaling the fragility of the arrangement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vivid and layered: "leaves like polished armor," "pool of still air where dust fell straight down as if on strings." The stillpoint functions as both atmosphere and constraint, literally altering the narrator's pulse and forcing thieves to lose their maps. The diamond mounted in the scarecrow's chest is tactile and strange, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the shack, the irrigation tanks, the scarecrow) supplies both discovery points and symbolic resonance. The radioactive dust storms remain somewhat backdrop, but the stillpoint itself decisively shapes the investigation and the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate truth from comfortable lies—is signaled in paragraph four and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the narrator steps into the stillpoint and feels the trees drink, then escalates with the letter assembly revealing corporate cover-up. The peak choice (write the truth but omit names) arrives with visible cost: the narrator must compromise the debunking mission to protect Klay. The escalation is causal (investigation → discovery → ethical dilemma) and the final trade-off forecloses the clean debunking path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond's crooked ring is understood as engineering, not curse, reweighting the entire premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus comfortable lies, and the cost of exposing versus protecting—emerges organically from the investigation and the final negotiation with Klay. The flawed diamond serves as a non-literal answer: its defect makes it functional, just as the narrator's decision to omit names may preserve the orchard's fragile truth. "Outside the stillness is noise... Inside, the song is one note, and the body believes it" reweights perception and deception without sermonizing. The ending offers resonance through image (dust building at the edge) rather than statement, and Klay's closed eyes embody the cost of the narrator's compromise. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable and confident throughout. Voice is distinct: "miracles make me itch," "sharply observant... a label pasted on me by editors who prefer personality to patience." Perceptual signature is consistent (professional skepticism filtering every detail). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Klay's evasive explanations and the narrator's direct questions create subtext around the cover-up. Brief register elevation in technical passages ("Stillwater Remediation," "microclimates around collapsed reactors") fits the narrator's investigative expertise. One small slip: "the body believes it" in the stillness explanation reads slightly abstract for the otherwise grounded voice, but it's a hairline deviation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with strong imagery: "auction flags were still tangled in the thorny rows," "a faint ticking like cooled glass." Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "I asked about the diamond, and Klay looked at the ground like it might answer for him. He said the stone was cursed because..." could be tighter; the transition leans explanatory. One paraphrase loop: "The orchard was not a miracle, but a net" is immediately followed by restating its function. Sentence openings vary well, and figurative language remains controlled except for one metaphor stack in the stillpoint description that slightly blurs momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—radioactive orchard stabilized by a flawed diamond in a wind harp—is highly specific and fresh, blending environmental horror with acoustic engineering. The debunker investigating a "cursed" object that proves to be functional-via-defect is a satisfying inversion. The stillpoint as both physical phenomenon and metaphor for truth feels inevitable in hindsight. The final ethical choice (truth with omissions) resists neat resolution. No close echoes of other works; the combination of post-apocalyptic reclamation, corporate cover-up, and the narrator's complicity reads original. Risk-taking in the technical detail (stress feather in diamond, frequency-based dust capture) heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The debunker role drives every beat: arrival, investigation, letter assembly, confrontation with Klay, and the final decision to write truth with omissions. The character's professional method (listen to myth, find seam, pull) shapes approach and the closure choice alters the debunking mission with visible cost. Two major beats (investigation, negotiation) and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The diamond appears in setup (paragraph nine), is described functionally in the letter assembly (stress feather, wind harp, crooked ring), is physically handled in the stillpoint scene, and directly shapes the narrator's understanding ("I held it... and understood why thieves lost their maps"). Its flaw is the key to the orchard's function. Three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stillpoint is signaled early (paragraph twelve), physically entered by the narrator, alters perception and pulse on the page, explains the diamond's function, and is invoked in the ending ("dust began to build at the orchard edge" implies its fragility). It shapes investigation tactics and charges the final image. Setup, development, and closure all met with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is labeled by the narrator in paragraph five but functions primarily as background trait rather than forcing on-page choices. The observation of the stillpoint and letter reassembly demonstrate the trait in action, but no visible trade-off or cost is tied to it. One beat involvement (stillpoint discovery) without closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Intuit" governs the letter-assembly beat: "By reassembling shredded letters, I could intuit what the orchard had been built to do." This action unlocks the corporate backstory and redefines the stakes from curse to cover-up. Two beats (assembly and the resulting confrontation with Klay) and the closure negotiation traces to this discovery. Causal pressure is strong, though the action itself could be partially swapped for "deduce" or "reconstruct."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("papers had been fed through a shredder"), executed on the page ("I carried the strips into the stillpoint... and began to read a letter in a hundred pieces"), and drives the discovery of Stillwater Remediation and the diamond's function. Setup and development met; closure depends on this discovery. Mechanics matter (narrator must work in the stillpoint to prevent blowing away), adding specificity and constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard is present from the opening line, supplies the investigation site, the stillpoint (key discovery space), the scarecrow holding the diamond, and the fragile equilibrium threatened in the closing image ("dust began to build at the orchard edge"). It constrains the narrator's movements, enables Klay's survival, and charges the ethical stakes. Setup, development, and closure all met with high causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" anchors the story in a post-collapse window and motivates Klay's shredding and the parent company's disappearance. The auction flags and Stillwater's dissolution provide context, but the timeframe does not tighten on-page tactics or create a live deadline. Setup present, development indirect, closure unlinked. One beat involvement with thematic resonance but no felt urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated in paragraph four and drives investigation, letter assembly, and the confrontation with Klay. Friction emerges in the final choice when the narrator must protect Klay by omitting names, compromising the pure debunking mission. Two beats (investigation, negotiation) and closure linkage present. The cost is legible but arrives late, preventing the highest band.</comment>
