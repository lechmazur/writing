<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I carried an emerald swatch card from a paint shop, edges frayed by pocket storms"), with embodied micro-choices threading the exploration. The discovery of the twin and the collaborative act of speaking names demonstrates earned internal progression. However, the motivation remains largely abstract—"chimera twin discoverer" and "recapture the lost" function more as thematic labels than dramatized wants with visible internal friction. The final choice to tell "the worst part together" arrives without prior micro-contradictions that would make the cost feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (carnival ship, fog, narrator alone) arrive early and hold. The piece accumulates pressure through spatial descent (gangplank → funhouse → ballroom → horticultural deck) and the gradual materialization of the twin, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "we told the worst part together, and the mirrors held instead of shattering." Cost is legible: speaking the suppressed trauma forecloses silence, and the garden "leaned closer, tipping seeds into our pockets" marks the reweighting. One substantive tightening—the barker's demand to "bring her, the twin you carry"—forces the protagonist to confront the split self. The ending sentence ("a map stitched inside") recharges the opening's "second history stitched inside," closing the pattern with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carnival ship is rendered through vivid, purposeful detail: "Paint peeled in ribbons, and rust sang a quiet metronome beneath the creak of rides." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the gangplank, funhouse, ballroom deck, and horticultural deck. The emerald swatch card constrains passage ("I pressed the emerald swatch card against it, and the hinge exhaled salt and sawdust"), and the garden's chalked-letter blossoms charge the final image by literalizing forgotten names as seedlings. Sensory selection reflects urgency and POV filter throughout. Minor slip: "porthole crusted with barnacles" introduces marine accretion mid-ship without prior cues, a small spatial inconsistency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to kindle solace by recovering the forgotten name and the garden. The barker's injunction—"gardens do not open to halves"—tightens the middle, forcing the protagonist to materialize the twin. The collaborative telling at the end ("we told the worst part together") narrows options and forecloses the path of silence, with visible cost in the act itself. The escalation reads clearly under the Accumulative lens: spatial descent, increasing proximity to the trauma, and the final act of speaking. However, the price paid—"seeds into our pockets"—remains somewhat abstract; a more concrete on-page consequence (e.g., what the seeds demand, what leaving costs) would sharpen the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—recovery of erased identity through witness and articulation—emerges organically from the carnival's architecture and the protagonist's dual nature. The recurring motif of the emerald swatch shifts meaning: first a literal key, then a link to the twin's eyes, finally a seed-color that charges the ending. "This is how solace kindles, she said, not from silence but from spoken return" risks explicitness but is dramatized immediately by the collaborative act. The final image—"our trapped freedom unmoored yet guided by names, a map stitched inside"—reconfigures the opening's "second history stitched inside" without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of how the split self becomes whole. Minor deduction: "unkindled solace" appears as a label without sufficient on-page friction to make its kindling feel costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and tightly controlled: "wrong the way survival is right," "a parliament of me," "tipping seeds into our pockets." POV remains stable; first-person singular expands to include the materialized twin without head-hopping, reading as internal plurality made external. Diction is character-particular and consistent under pressure. The perceptual signature—attention to thresholds, color, and names—threads throughout. The occasional elevated register ("parliament," "constellation," "horticultural") fits the narrator's archival, naming work. Minor filter-verb density in the funhouse sequence ("I spoke," "I told," "I needed") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the core action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "fog parting in ribs through which moonwater poured," "rides slept under nets like drowned stars." Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. However, several metaphors strain coherence: "pocket storms" (how do pockets generate weather?), "unmarked soil shivered awake" (soil shivering reads imprecise), and "blossoms carried chalked letters that dusted our wrists" (the physical mechanism is unclear). The phrase "trapped freedom" recurs without sufficient grounding to make the paradox concrete. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "I followed… I wound… I answered…" across adjacent beats. These accumulate to −0.9 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of carnival setting, chimera-twin metaphor, and horticultural memory garden offers a fresh synthesis. The emerald swatch as passage-key and the automaton barker as threshold guardian transform familiar tropes through specificity. The ending's "trapped freedom unmoored yet guided by names" feels earned in hindsight. However, the core premise—recovering a repressed self/name via a symbolic journey—echoes common therapeutic-quest templates. The piece elevates through voice and atmosphere but does not fully escape the shadow of the "find yourself" arc. Risk-taking in lyric density and metaphor is present, though some figurative choices obscure rather than heighten.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character present early (first line) and drives spatial choices: crossing gangplank, pressing swatch, speaking to reflections, materializing the twin, and speaking the suppressed trauma. The protagonist's decisions directly enable the garden to open and the names to grow. However, "chimera twin discoverer" functions more as background role than on-page constraint—the work of discovering others is mentioned but not dramatized. The character's choices are active, but the specific identity as discoverer does not alter tactics or cost in a way that another seeker's choices would not.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Object introduced early ("I carried an emerald swatch card"), used causally at the funhouse door ("I pressed the emerald swatch card against it, and the hinge exhaled"), and echoed in the twin's eyes ("Her eyes were the same green as the card"). The swatch constrains passage and is reweighted at closure as a color-link to the twin and the garden seeds. Three distinct beats; irreplaceable in the lock-and-key logic. Does not appear in the final image itself, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Concept appears once as a phrase ("the fire was unkindled solace") and is dramatized obliquely when the twin says "This is how solace kindles… from spoken return." The kindling occurs, but "unkindled solace" itself remains a label rather than a live stake that shapes on-page choices. Swappable with "unrealized comfort" or similar phrasing. Present in middle and ending but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Attribute appears once: "We were blissfully aberrant, my choir and I, wrong the way survival is right." The phrasing is vivid but functions as self-description rather than constraint. The plurality and wrongness enable the twin's materialization, but "blissfully aberrant" as an exact phrase does not drive a choice or impose cost. Swappable with "joyfully fragmented" or similar; label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Action threads throughout: protagonist recaptures the twin by speaking her history, recaptures the garden by tugging narrative threads, and recaptures the drowned name by telling "the worst part together." The recapture method structures the middle and ending. However, the mechanics blur—"tugging on beginnings until endings tumble obediently after" reads abstract. Present across beats and essential to closure, but the swappability with "recover" or "restore" and the lack of a visible on-page cost unique to recapture (vs. simple discovery) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Method introduced in first third ("I do it through narrative threads"), literalized mid-story ("narrative threads hung between trellises"), and used at closure ("When we tugged the right one, a sign flipped, and unmarked soil shivered awake"). Shapes one key turn and the ending. However, the method's mechanics remain vague—what makes a thread "right," how tugging differs from speaking—limiting irreplaceability. Swappable with "storytelling" or "spoken memory" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting introduced in opening line, grounds all action, and supplies causally essential spaces: the funhouse mirrors materialize the twin, the ballroom deck houses the barker who gates passage, the horticultural deck is the goal. The carnival's decay and fog create coherent atmospheric pressure. Spatial descent structures escalation. The drifting motion bookends the piece ("drifted… we left the ship drifting"). Essential across all beats and indispensable to closure; removing the carnival ship would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Timeframe appears in the title-like phrase ("as memories alter") and twice in narration: "As memories alter, so did the bay" and the garden blooming "only as memories alter." Functions thematically but does not constrain tactics—no live clock tightens decisions. The alteration is result rather than driver. Present but ornamental; swappable with "when truth is spoken" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation declared early ("I sought… the garden of forgotten names," "I came… to find the garden") and pursued through spatial descent, threshold negotiation, and the final collaborative speech act. The desire faces friction when the barker insists "gardens do not open to halves," forcing the materialization of the twin. The ending fulfills the goal with visible cost: speaking the suppressed trauma and accepting the "trapped freedom" of the split self. Essential across beats and shapes closure, though the want itself is told more than shown in contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone introduced explicitly ("trapped freedom that moved because we leaned") and embodied in the carnival's liminal decay, the mirrors that hum but are unlit, and the ending's paradox of being "unmoored yet guided." Coherent across turns and charges the final image. However, "trapped freedom" remains more asserted than dramatized through on-page constraints that bind while liberating. The tone modulates appropriately but does not impose a unique cost that another paradoxical tone (e.g., "constrained possibility") would not.</comment>
