<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied—"the feathered edges of other minds, rasping against mine"—and the microflinches and somatic markers ground the pill's effect. Mara functions as affectionate skeptic and anchor, applying immediate pressure through her consent-framed participation. The move from swallowing pills to "learning to listen with craft" is earned through the choreographed experiment and the grounding coil discovery. Minor slip: the recall notice lands as convenient setup rather than a live complication the protagonist must navigate under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (studio, static shock, Mara, the pill recall) arrive within the first ~100 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (muscovite, wristband, light paths) and the cadence shift at closure—grounding the room and keeping the shard—reweights the initial appetite for listening with visible cost (assuring the recall, promising to keep feet on floor). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist chooses craft over the pill, clipping the coil to soften voices to "neighborhood hum," foreclosing reckless immersion. One persistent constraint (static shock opened the door; grounding coil tames it) shapes the final image. Cost is legible: the protagonist gives up unmediated access and accepts Mara's mooring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio supplies the fiber wands, camera rail, and wristband rig—each used in choreography that translates thought into motion. The muscovite shard is handled twice (texture use before, key tonight) and its fractal splitting charges the final ladder image. Micro-setting (body, skin, breath) constrains choices: the wristband reads microflinches to trigger colors. The storage loft and grounding coil are discovered through the mapped light, altering tactics. Specificity is high ("willowglass hope made mineral," "river reeds path") and sensory detail modulates with attention—urgent during the dance, reflective when they climb laughing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to illuminate hidden pathways, not as metaphor, but as navigable lines." The tightening occurs when consent is invoked, Mara offers memories, and the wristband triggers wand colors—each step narrows the experiment's variables and raises intimacy cost. The ladder appears as earned discovery, leading to the grounding coil that softens the voices and foreclosses unmediated listening. Agency is decision and renunciation: the protagonist replies to the recall, keeps the shard, and accepts Mara's anchor. Cost is felt in the final promise ("keep my feet on the floor") and visible in the choice to ground rather than consume more pills.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the choreography of consent, craft, and neighbor-listening without direct thesis. The muscovite shard shifts from texture tool to key, the wristband from pulse monitor to somatic interpreter—each reprise reweights meaning. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the protagonist will keep moving through the city's thoughts "gently, precisely, with willowglass hope," choosing craft over consumption. Subtext operates in Mara's "skeptical still, affectionate always" and in the grounding coil as mercy-or-emergency. No moralizing; the final image ("keep my feet on the floor") resonates as both promise and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "feathered edges," "limp-clicking," "willowglass hope made mineral." Diction modulates under pressure—short clauses during the wristband dance, longer rhythm when reflecting on the recall. Mara's voice in dialogue is practical and mooring ("Hold," "tell me everything slowly"), distinct from the protagonist's lyric interiority. Filter use is voice-motivated ("felt like a key"). Purposeful compression ("the door was breathing") is taught early and paid off at closure when the door stays "careful, quivering open." No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the experiment and breathes in the loft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: "limp-clicking between my fingers like willowglass hope made mineral" does three jobs (texture, metaphor, character voice). Sentence rhythm varies—urgent fragments during the dance, longer accumulative syntax in reflection. Minor loop: "practical as ever" echoes "affectionate always" without added pressure. Figurative language is concentrated but coherent: "fractally precise," "braided strands," "laddered to the rafters." One template-cadence run in the wand-trigger sequence ("flared green… stuttered… sliced") but it serves the beat's staccato rhythm. No clarity loss at closure; the grounding coil and final promise land cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy pill, light painting, somatic wristband, and consent-based thought-mapping feels specific and non-obvious. The muscovite shard as fractal key and the grounding coil as discovered anchor avoid convenience. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative note: the "affectionate skeptic who keeps the protagonist grounded" is a familiar archetype, though Mara's practical touch and consent framing personalize it. The transformation test holds: swapping names or setting would lose the studio's tools, the shard's fractal logic, and the somatic choreography.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (affectionate skeptic) is present in setup, applies pressure mid-scene ("Consent," grounding breakers, standing behind the camera), and appears at closure ("promised to keep my feet on the floor"). Her choice to offer memories ("river reeds," "father laughing") enables the wand choreography. Two beats of active involvement; her stance shapes the experiment's intimacy and the protagonist's final decision to ground the room. Causal pressure is moderate: she permits rather than drives the key turn, but her consent frames the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Muscovite geode sliver is introduced early ("quarry trip with my father"), handled in setup ("thin as mica… limp-clicking"), used to split light into fractal veins, and returns at closure when the protagonist keeps it for "light and listening." Three beats: texture use before, key tonight, kept after recall. Its fractal property enables the ladder image that leads to the grounding coil. High irreplaceability: the story calls it a key and charges the final choice with its retention. Cost connection: keeping it means accepting the door's quivering openness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Telepathy pill recall is signaled in setup ("notice… immediate cessation"), frames the protagonist's choice ("I had none to return"), and resurfaces at closure ("sent a reply… the dose was gone"). It enables the turn from consuming pills to crafting listening. Two beats: the email triggers the confession to Mara, and replying to it closes the option to re-dose. Causal pressure: the recall forces the protagonist to devise the wristband choreography as substitute. Moderate irreplaceability: a different prohibition could serve similar stakes, but the pill-to-craft arc is specific to this concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is applied to the muscovite's light-splitting ("veins that were somehow fractally precise, branching and nested") and implicitly to the choreography ("each step a rule"). One beat: the fractal pattern enables the ladder discovery. Moderate causal work: the precise branching makes the hidden path legible. Moderate irreplaceability: "intricate" or "recursive" could substitute with minor edits. No visible cost tied uniquely to this attribute; the fractal property aids rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Devise" is the stated motivation ("to devise a choreography") and executed on the page: hacking the wristband, setting the consent frame, triggering wands via somatic markers, and discovering the loft path. Three beats: the rig assembly, the dance sequence, the ladder climb. High causal pressure: the choreography is not swappable; removing it collapses the experiment and the grounding-coil discovery. The final image (keeping the shard, clipping the coil) depends on having devised this specific system. Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled early ("wristband… listen… to my skin's microflinches, breath catches, eyelid tremors") and used in two beats: the rig reading triggers wand colors, and the protagonist moves where skin tightens and molars hum. The method constrains the experiment's logic and makes the light paths navigable. Moderate irreplaceability: another biometric could serve, but the specificity (microflinch, calf tremor, scalp lilt) is high. Closure participation: the method's output (the ladder) leads to the grounding coil, shaping the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Light painting studio supplies fiber wands, camera rail, breakers, and the storage loft with the grounding coil. Four beats: the ozone smell anchors the opening, breakers scanned mid-scene, wands and camera used in choreography, loft discovered via light paths. High causal pressure: the studio's tools enable the experiment and the loft's coil resolves the voices. Irreplaceability is high: no other setting offers this exact toolkit. Closure linkage: clipping the coil in the loft is the final stabilizing act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the timeframe in setup and the shock is credited with opening the door ("the shock had thrown it to a careful, quivering open"). Two beats: the shock as inciting event and its effect framing the need to ground. Moderate causal work: the shock enables the protagonist's new appetite, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions—the night's experiment unfolds without a live clock. Moderate irreplaceability: "after the pill wore off" could substitute. No visible cost uniquely tied to the shock's timing at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated early ("motivation sharpened… not as metaphor, but as navigable lines") and dramatized through the choreography: the wand dance maps thought into light, the paths ladder to the loft. Two beats: the consent-framed experiment and the loft discovery. Moderate friction: the motivation is told, then shown. Causal pressure: the desire to make pathways navigable drives the rig assembly and the final choice to keep the shard. Cost connection: the protagonist sacrifices unmediated listening to achieve gentle, precise navigation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" appears twice: "limp-clicking… like willowglass hope made mineral" (setup) and "with willowglass hope" (final line). Tone is fragile optimism threaded through the piece—"careful stars," "neighborhood hum," "laughing under careful stars." The tone modulates with pressure: urgent during the wand dance, reflective at closure. The final reprise reweights the shard and the choice to ground. Moderate irreplaceability: "fragile hope" could substitute. Lyric resonance is strong, but the tone does not constrain a choice; it colors the ending image.</comment>
