<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied ("my chest holds their breath," weighing words), with lived contradiction (last winter's mistake still pressuring present choices). The micro-choices under pressure—asking Neris to try again with Daro's name, untethering wrists—show value hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "uncommonly thoughtful" self-descriptor edges toward hedging rather than letting action prove it; some gestures (touching the drawer pull) recur without fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who, where, stakes). The closure unit—Earned Stasis as Charged Poise—lands on the page: the narrator commits to stewarding "between apology and forgiveness" after dramatizing partial exchange success and logging what failed. The dominant stake (neutral exchange under mutual distrust) tightens when Daro refuses to cross until named with the apology, then releases with visible cost (notes in the ledger, continued tension). Drive lens reads Accumulative with causal threading; the final image ("furrowed hush until those who cross can breathe without armor") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, moon-phase synchronization, and drawer pull all constrain choices and charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's occupation (weighing words, tracking tide/moon). Spatial choreography is clean across the exchange. The antique drawer pull functions as micro-setting: it recurs with purpose (grandmother's desk → oath chest → final bell-click), shaping the narrator's stance and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (neutral exchange) is signaled early and tightens when Daro refuses, forcing the narrator to hand Neris the ledger and ask for specificity—protagonist agency narrows options and changes tactics on the page. The resolution is earned by the narrator's renunciation of speed ("this parapet holds only neutral weight"), foreclosing a path with visible cost (the young guard's haste denied, future exchanges implicitly harder). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the accumulative lens holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (patience as mediator craft, recycling mistakes into wisdom) emerges from particulars: the grandmother's drawer pull teaching word-weight, the torn flag mistake still costing breath, the ledger noting snags. Subtext operates in silence ("eyes shimmer like coins lost and found by tide"), gesture (palms ungloved), and the gap between apology and forgiveness. The final image offers a resonant answer to the central question—how to steward neutral territory—without stating a moral, reweighting prior material with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices tides, breath, and word-weight. Voice modulates purposefully (calm enumeration → tightening when Daro refuses → quiet resolve at close). Dialogue is goal-driven and carries subtext (Neris naming Daro, Bram promising repairs). Minor deduction: some register edges upward ("choreography of mediator craft") in a way that feels slightly elevated for the voice's established idiom, though it remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines layer image, action, and stake). The opening and closing lines charge the frame. Deductions: the antique drawer pull is described identically three times ("antique drawer pull" verbatim), constituting a light paraphrase loop; "between apology and forgiveness" appears four times without fresh pressure in later uses; a few runs share stem structure ("I ask," "I tell," "I note"). Artifacts are non-closure and do not obscure causality, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for loops and stems, routed here only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis (neutral-territory exchange synchronized by moon phases, mistake-ledger as mediator tool, drawer pull as patience anchor) feels specific and inevitable. The piece transforms a familiar mediator trope through grounded detail (nets, orchards, ration notes) and a non-obvious moral calculus (the narrator's refusal to hurry versus the young guard's demand). Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric frame heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Within-band bonus for purposeful compression and pattern-taught repetition that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The negotiator's choices create key turns: asking Neris to name Daro specifically, untethering wrists, refusing haste. Setup early, middle choice with cost, closure participation via ledger and final vow. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drawer pull appears in three beats (watch niche introduction, oath-page reveal, final click). It is handled on the page each time, and the final click reweights the opening image. Strong closure linkage. Deduction: the reprise is purposeful but the middle use (oath page) is brief and the object's unique properties (cold as gull bone, grandmother's desk) do not constrain a middle choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Neutral territory shapes stakes and tactics on every page: the meeting place, the narrator's refusal to let trespass or haste dominate, the closing vow to "keep choosing neutral territory." Setup immediate, middle choices constrained by it (spatial choreography, dual delegation paths), closure driven by the narrator's commitment to steward that liminal space. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is dramatized as listening without flinching and weighing words, constraining the narrator's choice to slow the exchange and ask for plain speech. Setup early, middle causal role (handing the ledger), closure linkage via furrowed-hush stewardship. Deduction: the self-description edge toward label-only in the opening; trait is shown more than told overall, but the label itself does not enable a distinct cost-bearing action beyond what "careful negotiator" would.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Untether" appears twice with causal force: untethering the signal lantern initiates the exchange, untethering Daro's wrists completes his crossing after the apology is spoken correctly. Setup early, middle turn (Daro's refusal until named), closure participation (final crossings and the narrator's vow to remove armor). Major turns trace to this action; swapping it would break the exchange mechanics and the theme of release.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Moon-phase synchronization is signaled early ("clocks choose sides when tempers spike"), shapes middle tactics (the narrator watches the moon's smudge, aligns breath to tide), and recurs in the closing vow ("until the old anger forgets clocks"). Setup clear, middle causal role (timing the exchange), closure linkage. Deduction: the mechanics are thematic more than plot-bearing; the exchange would function with a different timing method, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The parapet is setup in the opening line and pressures choices throughout: mist breathes with the parties, the spiraled approaches separate delegations, the neutral edge steadies both sides, wind claws the tower at a peak moment. The setting constrains spatial choreography and charges the final image (careful steps off the parapet, gulls practicing forgiveness). Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is the timeframe, signaled early ("the hour between") and sustained as the dominant temporal stake. Middle beats dramatize the span (Neris and Bram apologize, pause follows, forgiveness is not yet granted), and the closing vow commits the narrator to stewarding that liminal duration. The timeframe is indispensable: removing it collapses the story's conceptual and emotional architecture. Setup, development, payoff all strong; cost tied directly to it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to recycle mistakes into wisdom is dramatized: the narrator carries the drawer pull as a promise after last winter's torn-flag mistake, logs snags in the book, and adjusts tactics (asking Neris to try again). Setup early, middle choices reflect it (ledger work, patience under pressure), closure vow reaffirms it. Friction between the motivation and external pressure (young guard's haste, Daro's refusal) is visible with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is setup in the opening, sustained through beats (silence, mist breathing, careful speech), modulates under pressure (Daro's refusal tightens the quiet, then releases), and charges the final image ("hold this furrowed hush until those who cross can breathe without armor"). The tone is coherent across turns and indispensable to the piece's atmosphere and closure effect.</comment>
