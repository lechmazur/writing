<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lio operates as a cipher for whimsy rather than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure. His choices—selecting a vine, placing bells, singing—are presented as graceful demonstrations of mastery without visible internal friction or cost. The village chorus and the child receive roles but no distinct interior pressure; they orbit Lio's ritual without agency. The final decision to lie down reads as ceremonial satisfaction rather than a renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (moon, bells, vine, song) and a cadence shift at "the arbor answered with a single shiver" reweights the dominant stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community commits to renewed practice with the promise "we will meet tomorrow...when everything aligns inside their breath." Orientation anchors arrive late—"verdant arbor at dawn" names place but "Lio" and "the village" remain abstract; specific who/where emerges past the 120-word mark without deliberate disorientation payoff, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The cost is implied (ongoing duty, daily renewal) but not visibly paid on the page; the felt price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The arbor and its lattice, bells, and vine provide micro-setting that constrains Lio's ritual choreography: he selects a specific tendril, fixes bells to a branch, rotates to align the shadow wheel with horizon markers. These choices shape the remedy's execution. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful—dew, sap pulse, rosy pollen—filtered through a collective observational stance. The recurring vine tendril returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("the arbor spun its own golden story"), charging the final image. No cap applied for orientation debt waiver consideration; however, the arbor itself does not sharply narrow a choice with visible consequence, limiting the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to restore sacred practices"—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens: Lio's ritual layering (bells, thread, song) builds pressure toward the arbor's answering shiver. One meaningful deepening occurs when "something snagged like a burr" and the child's observation prompts the pivot to align the shadow wheel, tightening the remedy's conditions. The resolution is earned by collective action (rotation, song, vow) with implied cost (daily renewal), but no on-page forfeiture or trade-off that visibly narrows future options. Agency is present but ceremonial; coincidence does not resolve, yet the escalation remains atmospheric rather than choice-driven with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: gratitude as tool, care as whetstone, whimsy as method of listening. The final image—"the arbor spun its own golden story"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (how do we renew covenant with place?) without overt moralizing. However, lines like "Treat gratitude like a tool, praise like a rope" and "we will continue through forgotten songs...not to trap power, but to share it" edge toward direct thematic statement rather than pure implication. The vine tendril and golden thread recur with charged specificity, yet the conceptual repricing remains gentle, a reweighting rather than a hard conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV holds a stable third-person collective observational stance with close access to Lio's actions but minimal individuated interiority. Diction is lyric and consistent: "breath braided into quiet," "moon sank a finger width," "birds stitched words into the air." The perceptual signature—poetic compression, nature-as-syntax metaphors—remains coherent under pressure. Free indirect touches are clean. However, the voice flattens distinctions: Lio, the elders, and the villagers share the same elevated register without idiomatic variation. Purposeful compression and patterned parallelism ("He spoke...He sang...He paused") teach a ritual cadence that pays off at closure, qualifying under the experimental tolerance; no head-hopping penalty for collective "we" stance. Register drift into abstraction ("a method of listening that made work into wonder") is minor but present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift ("Lio lifted," "He selected," "Around a branch," "The moon sank"). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every line carries metaphor or simile—but remains legible and pattern-taught (nature-as-syntax). Template-cadence runs appear: "He spoke...He spun...He sang...He pressed...He used...He touched" (seven consecutive "He" stems in the ritual sequence) trigger the −0.5 penalty for template cadence. Paraphrase loops are minimal; information density is moderate (ritual detail layered) but some lines restate without added pressure ("The remedy would not be complete until the old vow was spoken" followed by the child's observation that effectively restates the same need). No severe line-level opacity; artifacts do not obscure closure but dull mid-sequence propulsion. Deduction: −0.6 for template stems, −0.2 for minor paraphrase loop = −0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—restoring sacred practices through whimsical ritual—draws on familiar eco-spiritual and craft-magic templates without sharp transformation. Lio's whimsy and the golden-thread conceit are vivid but not causally indispensable; the emotional arc (collective renewal) could function unchanged with different ritual objects. The vine tendril and shadow-wheel alignment add specific texture, yet the resolution (the arbor answers, the village commits) follows a predictable covenant-renewal arc. No bold structural risk; the lyric accumulation is skillfully executed but within established literary-fantasy conventions. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: template eco-spiritual renewal without non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. Deduction: −0.8 for derivative premise, placing the score in the functional-but-familiar band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lio, the whimsical tinkerer, appears in the opening and executes the ritual across multiple beats (selecting vine, placing bells, singing, pressing tendril, folding thread, lying down). However, his choices are demonstrations of mastery rather than decisions under friction that narrow options or alter tactics. He pauses when "something snagged" and responds to the child's observation by rotating the shadow wheel, but this is reactive adjustment, not a contested on-page choice with visible cost. Setup is immediate; beats are numerous but functional (he enacts the remedy without internal conflict); closure participation is present (he lies down as the village continues). Two gates met (setup, closure cameo); middle development is reactive rather than causal. Late penalty does not apply. Swappability: moderate; a different ritual expert could perform similar acts. Friction: ornamental use in some beats (−0.4), label-only trait ("whimsical") without on-page tradeoff (−0.3). Positive: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, modest closure linkage +0.4. Net: 3.0 base +2.3 positive −0.7 friction = 4.6, round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vine tendril is selected early ("a vine tendril that had curled like a question mark"), handled in multiple beats (cradled, wrapped with golden thread, pressed to the spindle), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (the arbor's own "golden story" threading future mornings). Setup is clear; middle development shows Lio wrapping story-thread around it under pressure (the snagged remedy); closure participation is direct (the thread tightens "with a bright sigh," and the arbor's answer follows). All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.6, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables the remedy's completion) +1.0, closure linkage (charged reprise) +1.2, specificity (its "green patience" and question-mark curl matter) +0.5. No major frictions; the tendril is irreplaceable within the ritual logic. Net: 3.0 base +4.7 positive = 7.7, minor swappability consideration (another plant part could theoretically serve) −0.6 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The harvest moon is introduced early ("lingered low and wide, pale gold"), shapes the timeframe (dawn alignment), and participates in the shadow-wheel pivot ("matched the harvest moon and the rising light"). Setup is immediate; middle development includes the moon sinking "a finger width" as pressure builds; closure participation is present ("the harvest moon finally dipped, and the day took up the task"). All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.6, two beats (alignment pivot, final dip) +0.9, modest causal pressure (its position constrains timing) +0.7, closure linkage (its departure hands off to the day) +0.9. Friction: the moon is atmospheric anchor more than tactical lever; its removal would shift tone but not break story logic (−0.5 swappability, −0.4 ornamental in some mentions). Net: 3.0 base +3.1 positive −0.9 friction = 5.2, with lyric-resonance allowance for charged early–final reprise +0.7 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is introduced early ("known as one who spins golden stories, and sometimes they became tools when needed") and enacted on the page: Lio "spoke, and a story rose, a trickle of thread that glowed the color of ripe wheat. He spun the words around the vine tendril, letting each syllable wrap and tighten into shining fiber." Setup is clear; middle development shows the attribute constraining method (he must use story-threads, not other tools); closure participation is indirect (the arbor's answer follows his story-weaving). Two gates met solidly (setup, middle causal); closure linkage is conceptual (the arbor "spun its own golden story") but not a direct on-page cost tied to Lio's trait. Positive: early signal +0.6, two beats (story-thread creation, final conceptual echo) +0.9, causal pressure (enables the remedy) +0.9, specificity (the golden color and fiber mechanics matter) +0.5. Friction: the trait is enacted but could be renamed "song-weaving" or "word-binding" without breaking logic (−0.5 swappability). Net: 3.0 base +2.9 positive −0.5 friction = 5.4, with closure conceptual reprise +1.0 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Remedy" is the central action: signaled in "to restore sacred practices" and "his stories would weave a remedy," executed across the ritual (bells, thread, song, vow), tested when "the remedy would not be complete until the old vow was spoken," and resolved when "the arbor answered." Setup is immediate; middle development shows the remedy snagging and requiring alignment adjustment (major turn); closure is the remedy's success and the village's commitment to daily renewal. All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.7, four beats (setup, weaving, snagging turn, resolution) +1.4, strong causal pressure (the entire plot is remedy-shaped) +1.4, closure linkage (the remedy's completion defines the ending) +1.5, irreplaceability (remove "remedy" and the story loses coherence) +0.7. Friction: none; the element is indispensable. Net: 3.0 base +5.7 positive = 8.7, minor cost-visibility concern (the remedy succeeds without on-page forfeiture by Lio) −0.4, with lyric resonance ("our remedy is a habit we renew together") −0.5 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" appears in "through forgotten songs, his grandmother had kept in the lining of lullabies, he sang to the arbor" and "he spoke through forgotten songs again, but this time in the tree's grammar." Setup occurs mid-sequence (not in first third); middle development shows the method constraining Lio's approach (he must use inherited songs, not improvisation); closure participation is conceptual ("we will continue through forgotten songs"). Two gates met (middle, closure echo); setup is late. Positive: two beats (initial singing, tree-grammar reprise) +0.9, causal pressure (the songs are the vehicle for the remedy) +0.8, closure linkage (the elders promise continuity) +0.8, specificity (grandmother's lullabies, tree's grammar) +0.4. Friction: late first appearance (−0.4), swappability (could be "ancestral chants" or "old hymns") (−0.6), summary-only in closure mention (−0.5). Net: 3.0 base +2.9 positive −1.5 friction = 4.4, with lyric-resonance allowance for thematic echo +2.3 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "verdant arbor at dawn" is named in the opening line, provides the ritual's spatial anchor (trellis, branches, lattice), and participates in closure ("lay beneath the patient branches...the arbor spun its own golden story"). Setup is immediate; middle development shows the arbor's structure constraining Lio's choices (branch selection, shadow-wheel alignment); closure is the arbor's active response ("answered with a single shiver"). All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.7, three beats (setup, alignment pivot, answering shiver) +1.4, causal pressure (the arbor's structure enables and validates the remedy) +1.1, closure linkage (the arbor becomes active agent in final image) +1.3, irreplaceability (the story is arbor-specific) +0.6. Friction: the arbor is atmospheric container in some beats rather than tactical lever (−0.5). Net: 3.0 base +5.1 positive −0.5 friction = 7.6, minor ornamental description in opening (−0.3) = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" is seeded early ("This was when everything aligns, moon to sun, branch to shadow, vow to breath") and tested in the shadow-wheel pivot ("they rotated together...until the wheel matched the harvest moon and the rising light"). Setup is clear; middle development shows the timeframe forcing the alignment action (a distinct turn); closure repeats the phrase ("when everything aligns inside their breath") as commitment. All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.6, two beats (alignment turn, closure echo) +0.9, modest causal pressure (timing constrains the ritual's success) +0.6, closure linkage (the phrase charges the final commitment) +0.9, specificity (moon/sun/shadow convergence) +0.4. Friction: the alignment is described more than dramatized as a ticking constraint (−0.5), and the timeframe does not visibly narrow options with cost (−0.4). Net: 3.0 base +3.4 positive −0.9 friction = 5.5, with lyric-resonance allowance for charged reprise +1.3 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To restore sacred practices" is stated early ("they had come to restore sacred practices") and drives the entire ritual sequence. Setup is immediate; middle development shows the motivation tested when the remedy snags (the vow must be spoken "in the right direction"); closure is the village's renewed commitment ("our remedy is a habit we renew together"). All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.6, three beats (arrival, snagged remedy, closure commitment) +1.4, causal pressure (the motivation shapes all choices) +1.0, closure linkage (the ending crystallizes ongoing practice) +1.0. Friction: the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choice (−0.6), and the cost (daily renewal) is implied but not visibly paid by a character forfeiting a specific path (−0.5). Net: 3.0 base +4.0 positive −1.1 friction = 5.9, with thematic integration bonus +0.4 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" is introduced in the opening line ("held a gathering hush"), sustained through "quiet, waiting," "breath braided into quiet," and "the gathering hush deepen[ed], not as silence, but as a low chorus of belonging," then modulates at closure ("that woven quiet"). Setup is immediate; middle development shows the tone deepening as pressure builds (the hush becomes participatory chorus); closure transforms hush into "woven quiet" with the village's ongoing song. All three gates met. Positive: early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, deepening, woven closure) +1.4, causal pressure (the hush frames and intensifies the ritual's collective nature) +0.8, closure linkage (the tone shift charges the final image) +1.2, specificity (not mere silence but charged collective attention) +0.5. Friction: the tone is consistent but does not sharply constrain a choice with visible cost (−0.5), and some descriptions are atmospheric rather than tactically active (−0.3). Net: 3.0 base +4.6 positive −0.8 friction = 6.8, with tonal coherence bonus for modulation under pressure +0.4 = 7.2.</comment>
