<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction—skilled navigator lost to regret—drives embodied micro-choices (one foot in the kayak, pausing at the bow). The sister encounter earns the apology through accumulated pressure rather than epiphany. Interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("merrily melancholic by habit," "flickering faith sputter") that softens the embodied texture, and the final paragraph's "I understood" edges toward summary. The confession beat ("I said them anyway") lands with visible cost but the reconciliation telescopes slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist apologizes on-page, the sister closes the compass lid, and they reframe regret through the utility-pole naming ritual. Cost is felt in the seawater-taste apology and the shift from hoarding to offering. The accumulative lens coheres through repeated navigational motifs (compass, poles, Polaris) that reweight meaning at closure. Orientation anchors promptly (coastal launch, astronomical compass, sister meeting). One micro turn—grounding the kayak—sets up the confession without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kayak launch, channel, utility poles, and boatyard ground spatial choreography cleanly. The astronomical compass, a recurring micro-object, charges the final image when the sister closes its lid—blessing the wound. Sensory detail is purposeful: "feathery intertidal sand," "poles hummed like ribs," fog erasing except "thready silhouettes." The tarp and overturned kayak anchor the sister's space. Scope fits the single-scene window; no occupation depth is required beyond navigational idiom, which reads plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the protagonist will confess and align heart and action—is signaled early and tightens through the paddle crossing. One meaningful deepening: the protagonist moves from rehearsed patience and excuse-hoarding to speaking "words [that] tasted like seawater." Cost is legible in the apology and the visible shift from metronomic regret to "slack load...shift and settle." The backlash-of-regrets motif recurs but remains thematic accent rather than a dramatized obstacle mid-crossing. Agency is protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—aligning heart and action, navigating by constrained truths—emerges through compass, poles, and the mother's teaching rather than thesis statement. The utility-pole naming ritual (humility, patience, faith as wick) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the sister's silence and the compass-closing gesture. The final image—walking home by poles, feeling regrets "shift and settle"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "I understood" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary, though the final line rescues it with "smaller Polaris" and "flickering faith do the rest."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and voice is distinct: navigational idiom ("bearing wrong," "marked ships," "muscle-speech of ferries"), metaphor-rich syntax ("wind buttered the water," "gulls stitched errant commas"). Perceptual signature is selective (poles, Polaris, tides). Dialogue—brief and natural—advances the naming ritual without exposition. Minor register drift: "merrily melancholic by habit" and "flickering faith sputter" lean slightly literary-diagnostic for mid-crisis interiority. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the confession, wider at the walk home). No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("wind buttered the water," "kayak took the water like a letter sliding into an addressed envelope," "gulls stitched errant commas"). Two mixed metaphors strain clarity: "faith sputter under the weight of rehearsed patience" conflates fire and physical load; "regrets, snapping back harder than the original wave" mixes physics metaphors without grounding. Template cadence appears in the mother's teaching and the naming ritual (parallel stems). Paraphrase loop: "I had told my sister a hundred softened versions, but the pure one was this" followed immediately by the barge incident recap. Information density is otherwise strong. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of nautical navigation failure, familial reconciliation, and utility poles as spiritual waypoints is specific and non-obvious. The astronomical compass and pole navigation transform tropes through concrete action (closing the lid, naming poles as saints). Emotional truth in the protagonist's self-awareness ("good at beginning and terrible at arriving") avoids generic templates. The premise—confession via kayak crossing—could trend familiar but the pole motif and the mother's Polaris teaching give it fresh particularity. Risk-taking in the lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring the ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken navigator shapes the opening stance (lost a mile from home, quit after the barge error), drives the decision to cross by paddle, and delivers the confession that shifts tactics from hoarding to offering. Present in setup, middle (navigating the channel), and closure (apologizing, naming poles). Causal pressure: the identity frames the regret and the repair method. Cost is visible in the apology and the walk home by smaller Polaris.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The astronomical compass appears in four beats: held at launch, open on the kayak deck, in the protagonist's hand during confession, and closed by the sister as blessing. The closing gesture charges the closure image with felt cost. The compass's maternal history (mother's teaching about Polaris) reweights its meaning across the story. High irreplaceability: removing it would break the Polaris motif and the closure blessing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Backlash of regrets is named early, recurs as the "metronome, beating me awake," and shapes the protagonist's excuse-hoarding and confession delay. It pressures the decision to cross slowly and constrains tactics (wanting "to feel every inch of tide and every excuse"). At closure, regrets "shift and settle"—a reweighting with cost. The concept is more than thematic echo; it alters the protagonist's tempo and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Merrily melancholic appears twice: as self-description at the launch ("by habit") and attributed to the waving couple. It colors the narrator's voice but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is consistent with the protagonist's stance but remains more label than lever. Present in setup, absent from middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gravitate appears in three contexts: the utility-pole lines "told me where the unseen streets must gravitate," the protagonist's hands "gravitated to a steadier rhythm," and implicitly in the decision to approach the sister. The second use (hands) marks a micro turn in the crossing. The action shapes navigation tactics but is not irreplaceable—"settle" or "find" would work with minor edits. Causal role is present but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Navigating by utility poles is seeded in backstory (fog navigation a mile from home), explicitly chosen mid-crossing ("I decided to begin navigating by utility poles once more," keeping them at shoulder), returns at the sister's location (poles align with the moon), and structures the closure ritual (naming poles as saints, walking home by poles). The method constrains tactics, recharges at closure, and would break thematic coherence if removed. Present across setup, middle, and payoff with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch grounds the opening, supplies the kayak and channel as tactical resources, and frames the crossing that enables the confession. The boatyard at the sister's side recalls shared history (packing bait, practicing forgiveness). Setting pressures the choice to cross by paddle and anchors the closure walk. Micro-setting (compass on deck, sand grounding) adds texture. The launch itself is more stage than constraint after the opening, but the crossing as setting event shapes the apology's timing and cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"when expectations collapse"—is declared at the opening and colors the protagonist's stance (merrily melancholic, rehearsed patience). It reappears implicitly in the crossing as the protagonist confronts the postponed confession. The phrase is more tonal marker than live clock; time does not visibly tighten tactics mid-scene. Closure references "that night," signaling passage but not urgency. Present in setup and atmospheric through the middle; payoff is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to align heart and action is seeded in the mother's teaching, articulated at the decision to cross ("I wanted to align heart and action"), tested through the protagonist's excuse-rehearsal and apology delivery, and crystallized at closure ("I was done hoarding apologies"). It drives the confession choice with visible cost (seawater-taste words, regrets shifting). The motivation is dramatized in friction between wanting to arrive and fearing to keep the promise. Present in setup, pressures middle choices, and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Flickering faith appears early ("my flickering faith sputter"), recurs in the backstory (becoming "good at beginning and terrible at arriving"), and is reweighted at closure ("faith appeared not as fire but as a wick refusing to die"). Tone modulates with pressure: uncertain at launch, tested during the crossing, quietly resolved in the final walk. The wick image charges the ending. Coherent and purposeful across the arc, though the "sputter" line drifts slightly into label-speak under early pressure.</comment>
