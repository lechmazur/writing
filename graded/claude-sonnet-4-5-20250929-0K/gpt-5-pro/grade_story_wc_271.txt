<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Samira's interiority is deeply embodied through somatic markers—freeze, tremor in belly, iron on throat—that create contradictory impulses in real time. Her pivot from the overlook to the glasshouse is earned by her reading of her own body's wisdom, and the final act of placing the photograph under the basin forecloses display while accepting ballast with visible cost. Minor slip: Theo and the chair remain functional but thinly sketched, though they apply immediate pressure without diluting focus. The core arc—survivor learning to anchor hope in bodily realism—lands with specificity and renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues pressure through sensory density (spray, wind, gulls, drone hum) and somatic callbacks that teach the reader Samira's embodied grammar; the ceremony pivot crystallizes stakes, and the final image—photograph held where water returns—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she renounces display, accepts ballast) with undeniable cost. Orientation is swift (arboretum, cliff, Samira by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening: the decision to move benches into the glasshouse narrows options and charges the ending. Cost is legible in the photograph's placement and her refusal of the overlook's "applause."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arboretum's glass ribcage, cliff fissures, spray height, and automated lighthouse constrain the ceremony choice on the page—Samira shows the chair the overlook "now only a sketch under spray." The pearl basin, eucalyptus whisper, and gutter-caught rain function as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: she smells fog inheritance, hears wind lean on glass, reads the sea as having "more drama than any of them could hold." Environment decisively shapes the final spatial and emotional geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchor optimism in realism—is signaled early and pressured by the board's demand for the dramatic overlook versus Samira's somatic reading of danger. The tightening occurs when she pivots ceremony location mid-morning, narrowing the board's options and forcing the chair to accept safety over spectacle. Cost is visible: she refuses the photo-op, confronts the chair, and renounces display by placing the photograph under the basin. One harbor-drone freeze demonstrates persistent constraint. Agency is renunciation with on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—hope as rope knotted to reality, heart measuring danger and love in same units—emerges from Samira's somatic practice and the pearl-of-stillness motif without summary. The ending image (photograph under the basin where water returns but does not drown) reweights prior material: ballast becomes chosen anchor, not imposed shard. Her speech introduces the dead to the living through particulars, not platitudes. The final line's "steady weight of the pearl of stillness" resonates as earned endurance, not asserted wisdom. No thematic echo or late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV, close third with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: she reads tremor as "memory, not command," misses "the idea of someone watching weather." Diction remains character-particular ("the sea had more of it than any of them could hold") and modulates under pressure without breaking voice. Brief dialogue is goal-driven and carries subtext ("we are not abandoning it, we are listening to it"). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she said") are minimal and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no register drift, no tense slips. Purposeful compression in the ceremony sequence maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "she missed the idea of someone watching weather, the way a village misses a violin even if it never danced" advances voice, setting memory, and thematic longing simultaneously). Rhythm varies across beats; no template cadence runs. Minor slip: "quietly talented" recurs three times in similar syntactic slots without pattern payoff, approaching template repetition (−0.3). "Harbor drone skittered" and "spray swaggering" are fresh. No loops, clear propulsion, zero muddy metaphors at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—arboretum survivor who reads somatic markers to stage a ceremony indoors—feels specific and non-obvious. The pearl of stillness as both object and practice, the crumpled photograph's final placement (not buried, not displayed), and the lighthouse's "automated heart, faithful and cold" transform familiar trauma-recovery material through embodied particularity. Risk: the quiet ending and refusal of the overlook's drama could flatten, but the story commits fully and the image of water returning without drowning earns resonance. No close echo of famous lines; the voice is singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Samira (drone strike wedding survivor) is present throughout, her history seeds the somatic freeze response early, drives the middle pivot (reading her body to reject the overlook), and she delivers the ceremony speech that introduces the dead to the living. The attribute shapes her perception (emulsion ridge, ballast metaphor) and her final act (placing the photograph) with visible cost. Three beats; closure participation strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crumpled photograph appears in paragraph four (early), Samira touches it before the pivot (beat two: "felt the melted ridge of emulsion"), holds it up during the ceremony speech to introduce the dead (beat three), and places it in the niche under the basin at closure (beat four). Each use reweights meaning: from private wound to ballast metaphor to chosen anchor. Charged reprise with cost; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pearl of stillness is named early (paragraph eight), made physical as a stone sphere in a basin (paragraph twenty-one), present during the ceremony offering "its sheen without moving," and provides the final image ("steady weight of the pearl of stillness"). It articulates the dominant stake (stillness as earned practice, not escape) and anchors the thematic answer. Strong presence across structure; cost is conceptual (renunciation of display as false stillness).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is used twice as a label (coaxing green, making people taller) and demonstrated in the ceremony choreography and sapling-watering facilitation. It enables her leadership but does not visibly constrain a key choice with cost on the page—she could be "skilled" or "gifted" with minor edits. Functional but mid-replaceability; no specific tradeoff moment where quiet versus loud matters decisively.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Freeze action appears twice: harbor drone triggers "her skin pulled tight in a familiar flinch… her body freeze like a shutter catching light" (beat two, demonstrates somatic marker) and earlier gull/blade hum causes body freeze before mind knows (beat one, teaches the pattern). The action establishes her vulnerability, justifies the indoor pivot, and is referenced in her speech ("somatic markers that whisper turn, slow, or wait"). Central to characterization and thematic method; removing it breaks the logic of her risk-assessment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled early (paragraph six), demonstrated in two freeze beats (paragraph seven and nineteen), named in her decisive pivot thought ("she read tremor in her belly and iron on her throat as memory, not command"), and articulated in the ceremony speech. The method enables her to distinguish memory from command and drives the indoor-ceremony choice. Mechanics visible; shapes attempts and closure participation strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Arboretum perched on a seaside cliff anchors orientation in paragraph two, supplies the contested overlook (fissures, spray height) that Samira rejects, provides the glasshouse as safe alternative, and the automated lighthouse as thematic foil. Setting directly pressures the ceremony choice: she shows the chair the overlook "now only a sketch under spray" to justify the pivot. Cliff and glass constrain tactics and charge the final spatial image. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper left" frames the temporal premise (paragraph one), and the story of the keeper is told during the ceremony. The timeframe establishes the inheritance of care and contrasts automated light with human attention, but does not tighten on-page decisions with a live clock. The keeper's absence charges theme more than it pressures tactics. Functional lyric frame; mid-causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation—to anchor optimism in realism—is dramatized in paragraph ten ("she wanted it to anchor optimism in realism, not to perch ignorance at the edge"), pressures the overlook-versus-glasshouse choice, and is articulated in her ceremony speech ("hope was not a float but a rope, and she knots it to reality because the wind will test every strand"). Friction between board's want (drama) and Samira's cost-aware stance is on-page; the ending enacts the anchoring literally (photograph placement). Strong causal role and closure participation.</comment>
