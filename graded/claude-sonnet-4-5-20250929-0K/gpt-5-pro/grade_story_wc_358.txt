<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The investigator's interiority is consistent and specific—meticulous, professionally distanced, shaped by forensic training. Motivation is clear (cultivating foresight after a fatal convergence), and micro-choices (pocketing the patch, mapping eddies, drafting the grid order) reveal values under pressure. The final stance is earned: the investigator moves from documenting to prescribing, transforming singular convergence from trap to safer habit. Minor: the investigator remains largely unopposed internally; competence is high, struggle felt but not deeply contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered forensic detail, wind maps, and the flight engineer's patch, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final beat—grid holds, notes flutter, gust arrives on schedule—reweights the opening silence with undeniable conceptual cost (the town's fear, the engineer's death, the new order). Orientation is clear by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening (chain of errors → redesigned grid) is sufficient for this length. Cost is felt in the town's silence and the patch's return, though the ending skews reflective rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container maze functions as setting and antagonist: it funnels wind, traps gusts, constrains the investigator's path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt, rust, soot V, flapping crate door), filtered through forensic attention. The final beat—gust on schedule, grid holds—proves the setting has been tamed, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment shapes tactics (chalk arrows, anemometer readings) and supplies the conceptual repricing. The port breathes, and the investigator learns to breathe with it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preventing future accidents by understanding the singular convergence. Pressure accumulates through forensic discovery (patch, soot V, shift sheet, storm timing) and culminates in the drafted order that transforms the maze into a breathing grid. Agency is clear: the investigator's survey and recommendations foreclose future traps. One meaningful tightening (chain identified, then broken) is sufficient. The escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens. Minor: opposition is atmospheric (wind, silence) rather than interpersonal; no antagonist challenges the investigator's conclusions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: singular convergence as both fatal trap and potential discipline. The patch, wind roses, and breathing grid recur with shifting weight, avoiding overt statement. The final image—gust on schedule, notes flutter, grid holds—offers a resonant answer: foresight is a practice, air can be an ally when understood. The investigator's closing line, "I am still learning to move before the air decides for me," reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the town's silence, the engineer's trust, and the investigator's steadier hand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: forensic precision filtered through professional caution and salt-stained exactitude. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("hazy precision," "buildings that breathe like narrow lungs," "little horizon"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure—calm documentation accelerates into the crew's fatal moment, then returns to measured closure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. The patch "sits like a dial telling me which questions to ask" exemplifies the narrator's way of seeing: objects as instruments, evidence as compass. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances forensic logic or atmospheric charge. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative lens. Minor scaffold in the middle third: "The survey grows into a map of decisions, some human, some weather, and some that belong to both" abstracts what has been shown. A handful of participle openers ("Ribboned telltales," "I clip") risk simultaneity, though the effect is minor. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The final beats are clean and propulsive. Figurative language (port as lung, containers as streets, wind as ally) remains coherent and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forensic investigation frame is familiar, but the port-as-breathing-labyrinth and "singular convergence" as both concept and trap offer a fresh synthesis. The investigator's stance—cultivating foresight, learning to move before the air decides—feels earned and specific rather than generic. The patch as "compass" and "dial" transforms a stock evidence object into a charged motif. Risk-taking is modest but effective: the piece leans heavily on textural accumulation and lyric phrasing, trusting the reader to assemble causality from forensic fragments. Transformation test: swapping names and locale would alter the story's particularity significantly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early; drives forensic beats (mapping eddies, finding patch, reconstructing convergence); final decision (drafting order, painting wind roses) alters future tactics and closes the arc. All three gates met; causal pressure across multiple beats; closure participation strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: found snagged, pocketed as compass, clipped to board as "dial" guiding questions, imagined return to family. Reweighted meaning across appearances; charges final image as "little horizon." Early signal, middle development, closure linkage all present; specificity high (blue arc, three propellers, salt-stiff).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Central to stakes: the flight engineer's plan, the fatal convergence, and the investigator's redesign to prevent recurrence. Shapes tactics (investigator maps convergence points, breaks the chain). Present early, developed in the fatal-moment beat, and reweighted at closure ("singular convergence becomes a safer habit"). High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled in opening line ("rapidly adapting my steps") and demonstrated in forensic adjustments (following chalk, counting paces, marking tremor). Constrains method but does not impose visible cost or tradeoff. Lyric reprise in final line ("hazy precision is a practice") reweights the trait. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is descriptive rather than choice-altering.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The survey drives all major beats: wind mapping, patch discovery, soot-V analysis, chain reconstruction, final grid design. Irremovable; the entire investigative arc depends on this action. Early signal, persistent development, strong closure linkage. High specificity (chalk arrows, anemometer, streamlines) and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mechanics detailed early (ribbons, anemometer, chalk arrows) and sustained across beats. Shapes all forensic choices and the final redesign (stagger stacks, seal doors, paint wind roses). Present in closure: "my notes flutter and settle, and the grid holds." All three gates met; high irreplaceability and causal pressure; visible cost (labor, precision, institutional change).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is the antagonist: it funnels wind, traps gusts, shapes the fatal convergence, and constrains the investigator's path. Micro-setting throughout (corrugated steel, crane booth, eastern pier). Final beat tests the redesigned grid against the setting's breath. Indispensable; setting IS the conflict. All three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aftermath frame shapes all beats: the investigator works in the silence after the accident, reconstructing what happened. The timeframe creates urgency (town holding breath, no sirens) and charges the final restoration ("radios will say more than one syllable"). Early signal, sustained pressure, closure participation. Cost: the silence itself, which the investigator's work will eventually lift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("to cultivate foresight in action, because hindsight has emptied this quay") and dramatized through every forensic choice: mapping to prevent, not merely document. Friction between the engineer's failed foresight and the investigator's corrective discipline charges the arc. Final line ("learning to move before the air decides") crystallizes the motivation with cost (perpetual vigilance). All three gates; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Signaled in opening ("hazy precision") and sustained: forensic exactitude filtered through salt, uncertainty, and lyric cadence. Modulates with pressure (calm survey → urgent crew reconstruction → measured closure). Final beat charges the tone: "hazy precision is a practice" reweights the opening phrase with conceptual cost. Coherent through all turns; tone IS the narrative stance. High irreplaceability.</comment>
