<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's occupation and Mira's loss provide clear motivations, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains thin—observatory rather than contradictory. The thread-tying moment and planting gesture show micro-choices, yet the narrator's transformation into someone who "writes my own living obituary" arrives as assertion rather than earned shift. Embodiment is sporadic: "heart is a coastline rewritten by storms" leans abstract when the closure beat needs concrete cost. The piece withholds genuine flaws that would complicate the narrator's choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (quay, palace steward, shadowed garden), satisfying the test. The closure unit—planting seeds and stitching the map until "absence grows intimate with mercy"—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: staying without leaving, choosing continuation over flight). However, the cost remains oblique; the narrator's "staying does not halt travel" reframes the premise but the forfeit or price paid is implied rather than dramatized in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs mid-piece when Mira's letter confirms her husband will not return, reweighting the stakes from anticipation to acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed garden with lanterns, veiled vines, fig tree, and broken fountain is established early and revisited across beats. The palace carpet weft thread functions as a charged micro-object: tied around the finger, strung between rose canes, and finally used to stitch the map. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("brass polished by tears," "leaves scissor down, bronze on slate"). The thread constrains the narrator's projecting-presence method and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment/object pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—writing obituaries to understand the geography of healing—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens shows as density increase: the narrator moves from one client (Mira) to multiple petitioners (baker, teacher), and reflection deepens from observing others' absences to drafting their own. Mira's letter is a meaningful turn, narrowing hope to acceptance and prompting the seed-planting. Yet protagonist agency is diffuse; the narrator receives and transcribes rather than forcing choices that foreclose paths. The cost of staying is stated ("no ship tomorrow") but not viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—healing as migration rather than return—emerges organically from the seed-planting, the thread-map, and the registry of explained absences. The final image ("absence grows intimate with mercy") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the narrator's "heart is a coastline rewritten by storms" and the explicit "healing is not a return, but a migration" edge toward thesis statement. The palace thread and recurring "lonesome splendor" reweight across beats, providing resonance. Minor slips in thematic echo slightly lower the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from travel, cartography, and textiles ("rivers in drought, showing ribs of stone," "stitch my map"). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains character-coherent; the narrator's occupation justifies the heightened register. Brief dialogue with Mira and the steward feels natural and advances plot. Purposeful compression ("projecting presence") is taught early and paid off in the galley scene and final stitching, keeping the experimental method legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; openings shift. Information density is high in many beats ("Salt fog beads on tin, knives breathe iron"). However, adjacent lines occasionally paraphrase: "lonesome splendor" appears twice with similar vehicles; "geography of healing" recurs without fresh charge. Figurative density is heavy throughout without taught pattern—"gulls sound like hinges," "leaves scissor down," "laugh nobody else hears"—approaching overwriting in mid-pressure beats. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the accumulation of metaphor without escalation triggers a modest deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obituaries-for-the-living premise is fresh; "projecting presence" adds a speculative inflection. The thread as tether and map-stitching tool is specific. Yet the emotional arc—lonely traveler finds purpose by staying—follows a familiar template. The garden setting and autumn timeframe lean toward genre expectations (melancholy beauty, transition). Risk is moderate; the lyric register and mosaic structure elevate but do not fundamentally transform the core beats. The piece synthesizes well but stops short of a non-obvious moral calculus or structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The traveler-obituarist is present throughout, makes choices (accepting the commission, tying the thread, writing their own obituary, planting seeds), and those choices shape the arc. However, many beats are observatory rather than decisive: the narrator receives petitioners, records their stories, and reflects. The final choice to stay ("no ship tomorrow") is more renunciation than turn. Beat involvement is high; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The palace carpet weft thread appears early (table), is handled in multiple beats (tied around finger, strung between rose canes, used to stitch the map), and charges the final image. Its properties matter: a tether enabling projection, a map-making tool. Irreplaceability is strong—no generic object could serve this exact function. Closure participation is clear. Caps: no late arrival, no summary-only use. Strong causal work and specificity push into the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is the narrator's occupation, frames the commission from Mira, and returns in the registry filed under Compassion. The concept shapes stakes (writing to spare the ache of waiting) and tactics (projecting presence into the ship's galley). The narrator's own obituary in the final third reweights the premise. Beat involvement: at least three distinct uses. Causal pressure and closure linkage are both present. Specificity is high; the concept is not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is asserted in "I write in a vividly descriptive hand" but not demonstrated as a constraint or enabler with cost. The narrator's descriptive ability allows Mira to "recognize herself," a functional outcome, but no on-page action hinges on the trait's presence versus absence. This reads as label-only with minor causal relevance. Cap: attribute mentioned but not dramatized with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Intimate" (verb: to hint, suggest) appears in "I return and intimate what I have seen" and "I admit I travel to understand... and how mine unspools whenever I borrow their voices." The action shapes the narrator's method (projecting presence yields intimation, not certainty) and recurs in the self-obituary beat. However, the action is not the driver of major turns; it describes the narrator's output rather than forcing a choice. Closure participation is oblique. Lyric resonance (early seed, final reprise) is present but the action itself is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is introduced early ("my work is done by projecting presence"), demonstrated in the galley scene ("by projecting presence I enter the ship's small galley"), and returns in the final third ("by projecting presence into rooms where lamplight halos dust"). The method enables the narrator's obituary-writing and is tied to the thread. Beat involvement: at least three uses. Causal pressure: the method is how the narrator accesses absent subjects. Closure linkage: the narrator will "carry their stories across horizons by projecting presence." Specificity is high; no near-synonym.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is established in paragraph three, revisited across multiple beats (lanterns, hedges, fig, broken fountain, rose canes, soil), and houses the seed-planting closure. The setting provides the thread, the meeting place with Mira, and the final planting site. Causal pressure: the garden is where the work happens, though it does not constrain choices as sharply as a hostile environment would. Closure participation is strong (seeds planted "in the shadowed garden"). Specificity is good.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" frames the opening and returns in "There will be no ship tomorrow." The timeframe establishes the stakes (evacuation complete, no escape route) and tightens the narrator's decision to stay. However, the time element is static rather than a live clock; it sets context but does not alter tactics beat by beat. Closure participation is present (the choice to stay because no ship is coming). Two-gate model (setup, payoff) caps eligibility around 6.0; passive presence lowers the score within that range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the geography of healing" is stated early ("I accept because I want to understand...") and recurs ("I admit I travel to understand... because my heart is a coastline rewritten by storms"). The desire drives the narrator's acceptance of the commission and choice to stay. Friction: the narrator must borrow others' voices and draft their own obituary, risking loss of self. Beat involvement: at least two. Causal pressure: moderate. Closure linkage: the final map-stitching and staying are extensions of this motivation. However, much is told rather than dramatized in contradictory choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears in "The air carries lonesome splendor, like brass polished by tears and patience" and "the garden hums with lonesome splendor, a quiet choir of leaves rehearsing the future." The tone is coherent across beats—melancholy beauty, solitary grandeur—and modulates with pressure (early stillness, final hum of anticipation). The phrase charges the final image, reweighting solitude as generative rather than empty. Tone consistency and closure linkage are both strong. Specificity: the exact phrase recurs with shifted meaning, demonstrating irreplaceability.</comment>
