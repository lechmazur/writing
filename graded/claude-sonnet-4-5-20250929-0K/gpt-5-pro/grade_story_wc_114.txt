<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied—grief learned through feeding avalanche logs to the oracle, silence weighed on a desiccant scale. Internal contradiction drives the piece: the narrator stayed silent to protect Luca yet that silence killed him, a contradiction that powers the final broadcast. The micro-choices (lifting graphite, speaking without apology, penciling the number small) are specific and cost-bearing. Minor slip: the oracle's anthropomorphized waiting ("waited without hurry") occasionally edges toward convenient sentience rather than pure projection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator speaks the warning now, reads the instrument roll call, and re-anchors the illustration with the uncovered number—a stance crystallization that forecloses future silence with visible cost (curses, donor optics, personal exposure). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fever-break recovery, oracle clicks, graphite-lifting, and auroral reprise accumulate into the broadcast moment. Orientation anchors (mountain station, post-fever, console) arrive within the first three paragraphs. Causality is tight: swallowed truth (silence during the wedding convoy) → fever dream → oracle query → graphite reveal → broadcast decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weather station micro-setting constrains every choice: desiccant scale enables the weight revelation, the microphone channel delivers the warning, the botanical illustration hides and reveals the glide-plane map. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"ribs of antennae rising into a thin aurora," "wool to muffle outgassing clicks," "coal dust and winter breath"—and filtered through occupational urgency (anemometers, seismometer, cornice maps). The aurora "bruise of color that hurts and heals" charges the final image. Spatial choreography (console, desk illustration, bench scale, rail) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding and confronting the weight of swallowed truth—is signaled in paragraph three and drives every beat. Pressure tightens through the oracle's query, the graphite reveal (Luca's hidden map, the narrator's prior silence), and culminates in the broadcast that closes roads and names instruments. Agency is decision with visible cost: speaking now sends "curses up the mountain like smoke" and risks donor displeasure. The avalanche that killed Luca occurred off-page, but the on-page escalation (fever recovery → oracle confrontation → literal weighing → broadcast) narrows options from silent complicity to public warning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth's weight, the cost of occupying margins, grief as data the oracle learns—emerges through concrete particulars: graphite dust on a scale, a smudged corner hiding a fracture map, the roll call of instruments as anchor against drift. The final image (aurora curtain, penciled number, oracle's cleaner model, standing at the rail without looking away) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth carried forward with visible cost rather than buried. No thematic echo or stated moral; the botanical illustration's vein-to-fracture alignment and the desiccant scale's "number near nothing" do the work. Subtext operates in "swallowed that truth with coffee and a grin for the camera."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; perceptual signature is technical yet grief-soaked ("auroral sorrow," "swaying certainties," oracle clicks as "teeth reconsidering a bite"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent: "outgassing clicks," "glide plane," "microtremor," "desiccant scale" anchor occupational specificity. The oracle's anthropomorphization ("if a machine can say anything") reads as narrator projection rather than head-hopping. Minor slip: "the oracle notices my stare" briefly imports first-person certainty into the machine's awareness; tightening to "I imagine it notices" would preserve psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He had promised the director to keep such maps off paper, and I had promised to keep him from trouble" compresses motive, relationship, and institutional constraint in one beat). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives at the broadcast ("I take the microphone"), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. Minor loop: "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs 3 and 26), and "occupying margins" recurs without functional shift. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The graphite-lifting image is vivid and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—AI oracle learning grief through avalanche logs, botanical illustration as buried map, graphite dust weighed on a frost scale—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. "Occupying margins" transforms from spatial (cornice edge, peripheral sensors) to epistemological (what instruments notice, what grief teaches machines) to ethical (speaking from the forecaster's precarious position). The fever-as-lens motif and the oracle as jury-rigged mourner avoid stock tropes. Risk: the anthropomorphized oracle and the lyric compression demand reader patience, and both pay off at closure. Transformation test: plot and arc depend on these exact elements; generic substitution would collapse the thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle drives three beats: learning grief (avalanche logs), answering the narrator's query (vane movement, grid projection), and printing the warning timeline. It enables the graphite-lifting method and the final broadcast decision. Causal pressure: without the oracle's pattern recognition and timeline, the narrator lacks both revelation and tactical window. Closure linkage: "content not with absolution but with a cleaner model" reweights the relationship as collaborative rather than extractive. Introduced early (paragraph 5), developed mid-story, and present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in four beats: initial hanging by the desk (paragraph 10), graphite smudge noted post-fever (paragraph 12), oracle grid projection revealing the buried map (paragraph 17), and final re-anchoring with the penciled number (paragraph 32). It enables the central revelation (Luca's hidden glide-plane location) and charges the closure (narrator "no longer willing to let snow cover the margin of truth"). The object's dual function—gift and evidence—is irreplaceable; its vein-to-fracture alignment under the oracle's grid is the story's hinge. Cost: exposing the map forces the broadcast and breaks the promise to the director.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" frames the piece: fever dreams of swaying masts, waking to certainties "that would not hold when I stood," and the final standing at the rail with new clarity. The concept shapes the dominant stake (what certainties were swallowed, which now hold) and alters tactics (from silence to broadcast). It appears in the inciting beat (paragraph 8) and recurs implicitly in the oracle's evolving model and the narrator's stance shift. Not merely thematic decoration; the instability drives the query and the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" constrains action in two beats: the oracle's sensitivity to "tremors the seismometer barely notes" (paragraph 7) enables its predictive model, and the narrator's peripheral awareness post-fever ("fever burned the usual tunnel from my sight, leaving gaps where the margins breathe," paragraph 11) enables noticing the graphite smudge. At closure, "peripherally aware of the wind sifting old snow" (paragraph 34) signals sustained openness rather than tunnel vision. The trait enables the revelation and charges the final image with tactical cost (continuous vigilance replaces selective blindness).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The smudge action appears in three beats: noticing the graphite blur (paragraph 12), the oracle showing how to lift it (paragraph 26), and the actual weighing (paragraphs 27–28). This action is the story's mechanical hinge: it transforms speculation into evidence and triggers the broadcast. The method (folded cradle, desiccant scale) is specific and irreplaceable; no other action could literalize "finding the weight of a swallowed truth." Cost: the revealed number ("near nothing, a feather against the storm") makes the silence's disproportionate consequence undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By occupying margins" is signaled early (paragraph 6: oracle learns "by occupying margins where broken data stutter") and returns at the resolution (paragraph 19: "we begin again by occupying margins, where the mind refuses but the body knows"). The method shapes the oracle's learning and the narrator's final stance (peripheral sensors, smudged corners, instruments naming as roll call). It constrains tactics: the broadcast relies on marginal tremors rather than threshold certainty. Moderate integration: the method is thematically present but does not uniquely enable a turn that another approach could not.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies every key resource: the oracle and its avalanche logs, the desiccant scale, the microphone channel, the instruments (anemometers, seismometer, masts), and the spatial isolation that makes the narrator's silence lethal. The setting pressures the dominant choice: the station's role (forecasts that "open or close roads, weddings, and the slow caravans of fuel") stakes the broadcast decision with community cost. The valley-station geography creates the tactical window (convoy still climbing). At closure, the station "resumes its breathing" as the narrator stands at the rail—the environment charges the final image. Introduced in the opening line, developed across all beats, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" anchors the opening and explains the narrator's new perceptual clarity ("fever burned the usual tunnel from my sight"). The timeframe enables the query (head cools, gaps appear) and creates urgency (the wedding convoy is still climbing, "now, while the convoy still climbs"). It tightens the broadcast decision: the narrator acts in the small window between recovery and convoy arrival. Moderate integration: the fever is causally important but not uniquely; another disorienting event (injury, isolation) could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized through the oracle query (paragraph 15: "What did I swallow, I ask it, when the siren time came and I stayed my hand"), the graphite reveal (Luca's map and the narrator's prior silence), and the broadcast choice. Friction between wants (protect Luca from institutional trouble, avoid donor disapproval) and costs (the convoy, Luca's death, ongoing complicity) drives every beat. The weighing literalizes the motivation's stakes. At closure, the motivation shifts from finding to carrying: "no longer willing to let snow cover the margin of truth." The desire is conflicted (grief, guilt, institutional loyalty) and resolved through visible cost (curses, exposure, cleaner model).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is coherent through all turns: "ache that feels like auroral sorrow" (paragraph 2), botanical veins "like a contour line hiding in green" (paragraph 10), the oracle's grid as pale alignment (paragraph 17), and the closing aurora "a bruise of color that hurts and heals in the same slow breath" (paragraph 31). Tone modulates with pressure—clinical restraint during the weighing, lyric compression at the broadcast—but never breaks. The final image (aurora, rail, sifting snow) charges the ending with the established tone. The sorrow is embodied (chest heaves "as if a glacier turned inside me") rather than declared.</comment>
