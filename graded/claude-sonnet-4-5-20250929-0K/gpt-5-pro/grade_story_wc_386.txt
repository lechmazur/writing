<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied ("her voice is a bruise under my tongue, tasting like pennies and salt"), with micro-choices visible in the decision to carry the globe and speak the name. The ghost-whisperer's motivation is grounded in a hierarchy of values—truth as raft, names as salvage—shown through action. Internal contradiction emerges subtly in the line "to save her from erasure, to save myself from salvage without meaning," revealing dual stakes. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout, though the final departure lacks a visible cost that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator lifts the globe as "direction, not proof yet, but path," crystallizing the mission with felt cost in the final lines. The piece accumulates density through layered dream-fragments, the shrine encounter, and the promise to expose the owner's lie, building to a cadence shift in the final paragraph that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the girl's name is revealed and spoken, narrowing options from investigation to advocacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with specificity ("ice flickering with candle breath," "smoke writes requests that freeze before rising") and directly shapes the encounter with the ghost. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, its warped interior constraining the narrator's understanding and charging the final image when its base reveals the name. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's professional lens. The setting actively participates in closure: the shrine's windows become conduits for witness-faces, and "borrowed starlight" pours through to seal the promise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: salvage truth and the girl's name from erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator reads "Leda" on the globe's base, transforming investigation into testimonial mission. Agency is present in the decision to speak the name aloud and promise exposure of the owner's lie, which forecloses retreat and commits the narrator to a public role. The cost is visible in "windows of connection follow me" and the shift from solitary investigator to bearer of witness. Coincidence does not resolve; the dreams complicate by providing fragments the narrator must weave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mechanics of dream-weaving and truth-salvage: "truth is a raft," "names cross water better than bodies." The final image offers a resonant answer—lifting the globe as direction rather than proof—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the line "she chose the snow globe because the flakes looked like forgiveness," embedding the girl's motive without explanation. The piece resists tidy closure; the narrator steps into night with a name that "does not drown" but no guarantee of justice, embracing complexity. The snow globe's transformation from toy to relic to testimonial anchor accrues meaning across beats without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; the first-person narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and voice-specific ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer," "ghosts prefer threads to nets"). Diction remains within the narrator's professional idiom, blending investigative precision with lyric compression. The prose modulates with pressure: early exposition is measured, the shrine encounter tightens to image-dense beats, and the closing lines lengthen into declarative resolve. One purposeful elision: the mechanics of how dreams transmit are compressed, but the pattern is taught early and pays off when the shrine's ice-windows manifest the dreamers' faces. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines layer action, setting, and interiority without redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("ice holds a quiet that listens harder," "candles bob like buoys") with no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies, accelerating in the ghost's arrival and slowing for the final promise. Minor paraphrase loop in "windows of connection" repeated across three paragraphs without added pressure each time (lines 10, 32, 47)—functional but not always propulsive. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving investigator with ghost-mediation through dream-fragment analysis is specific and non-obvious. The melted snow globe as testimonial object feels inevitable in hindsight; its warped state indexes the disaster while its engraved base provides the salvageable truth. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the choice to let closure rest on a promise rather than vindication heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template ghost-story beats (no poltergeist theatrics, no vengeance payoff) and commits fully to its premise: truth as salvage, witness as reconstruction. The final image—lifting the globe as path—transforms prior material without retreating to safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer's professional role drives the investigation, shapes the shrine visit, and determines the method of truth-weaving. Key choices include carrying the globe, speaking the name aloud, and promising to expose the owner's lie—all of which narrow options and commit the narrator to a public testimonial role. The occupation is not ornamental; it constrains tactics (must work through dream fragments, not direct evidence) and enables the shrine encounter as a professional ritual. The final decision to "keep weaving until the water holds" crystallizes the character's function and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in the opening, is handled at the shrine, and its warped interior and engraved base drive the climax when "Leda" is revealed. Its physical state (melted, fog-filled, blank core) indexes the disaster and constrains the narrator's understanding until heat-scraped letters become legible. The globe is pressed into the narrator's palms, returns as lifted object in the final beat, and its "weight turn[s] to direction, not proof yet, but path"—a charged reprise that reweights the entire mission. Without this exact object, the name would remain unknown and closure would fail.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" shapes the narrator's method: dreams are explicitly called "windows" in line 10, and at the shrine ice-windows bloom to show witness-faces. The concept enables the climax when the dreamers' presences validate the testimony. It constrains tactics (must work through dream fragments rather than physical evidence) and charges the final image ("windows of connection follow me"). However, the concept is introduced as metaphor first and only literalized late at the shrine, limiting its causal pressure in earlier beats. It functions more as thematic frame than structural engine until the second half.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is dramatized on the page: the narrator explicitly chooses threads over nets, analyzes cameo dream appearances for tactical clues (porter/lifeboat, baker/coin, dockworker/frost), and "strings them carefully, careful as stitching a lung." This care constrains method—no aggressive interrogation, no shortcuts—and enables the successful communion with the ghost. The trait surfaces in at least two beats (dream interpretation, speaking the name at the shrine) and shapes the final promise to carry the name "where ledgers hide it." The cost is visible in the meticulous, solitary labor and the risk of failure if threads break.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Expose" is signaled early as motive ("I have come to expose it"), drives the narrator's promise at the shrine ("to expose the owner's lie where ledgers hide it"), and defines the final mission beyond the glacier. The action redefines options: the narrator shifts from private salvage to public testimony, accepting the cost of carrying witness into hostile institutional territory. Without this action, the story would end at name-recovery; "expose" adds the social and relational stakes that charge the closing image. It appears in three beats (stated motive, promise to the ghost, final resolve) and is irreplaceable—"reveal" or "uncover" would not carry the same adversarial commitment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("strangers told me their sleep carried a girl") and its mechanics matter: the narrator reads dream fragments for spatial and symbolic clues (lifeboat = tilted deck, coin to gull = giving things away, taste of frost = location of remains). This analysis enables the discovery of the vessel and globe, constrains tactics (must wait for dreams to arrive, cannot force them), and participates in closure when the dreamers' faces appear in the shrine's ice. The method shapes at least two attempts (finding the wreck, interpreting the girl's intent) and could not be easily swapped without losing the story's epistemic logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shrine is introduced in the opening line, its physical properties (ice, candles, seams, moaning wind) create the conditions for ghost contact, and its carved windows become the literal mechanism for witness-manifestation at closure. The setting pressures choices: the narrator must bring the globe here, not elsewhere; the shrine's ice "listens harder than any room of wood," enabling communion. The candles, rosaries, and sea bones establish the shrine as a site of prior testimonies, and "borrowed starlight" pours through at the end to seal the promise. Removing this exact setting would break the story's ritual logic and the climactic appearance of witness-faces.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>None specified.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated explicitly and dramatized through the decision to carry the globe, speak the name, and promise exposure. The motivation conflicts with easier options (leave the globe, let the girl fade, avoid institutional confrontation) and shapes the final choice to step into night as bearer rather than retreat. The friction between "salvage" and "pure" is visible: the narrator must accept that truth is "direction, not proof yet," a path without guarantee. The motive drives at least three beats (carrying the globe, speaking the name, making the promise) and charges the final image with visible cost in the commitment to "keep weaving until the water holds."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears in the opening ("borrowed starlight filters through seams"), returns at the shrine climax ("borrowed starlight pours through, cold as kindness, bright as rumor"), and closes the piece ("only borrowed starlight and a name that does not drown"). The tone is consistent—fragile illumination, secondhand light, provisional clarity—and modulates with pressure: it "pools in blue slabs" early, "pours through" at the communion peak, and becomes the narrator's sole resource at the end. The borrowed quality charges the final image by acknowledging the narrator's dependence on others' dreams and the precariousness of testimonial work. It shapes atmosphere across all beats and reweights the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
