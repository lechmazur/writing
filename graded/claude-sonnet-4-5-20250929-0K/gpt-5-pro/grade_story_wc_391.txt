<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"sculpt patience from impatience, beginning with my own restless pulse" embodies the internal struggle. The decision to demonstrate the lunar window to the council and later lead the expedition shows agency under pressure. However, the secondary characters (Kerr, the council, the dogs) remain functional instruments rather than fully realized presences; Kerr's arc from skepticism to acceptance feels telescoped rather than earned through visible micro-choices. The final stance crystallization is legible but arrives through summary more than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 2 (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, village). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (viaduct mechanics, moon schedule, council resistance) and culminates in a cadence shift when the village adopts the practice and "patience acquires a body." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the narrator's patient revolution succeeds, reweighting the dominant stake (speed versus patience) with visible social cost (the compact, three-night trial, altered village rhythm). The turn at the council demonstration narrows options meaningfully. One modest deduction: the middle third recounts the demonstration and expedition in summary mode rather than dramatizing the peak beats, which slightly flattens the escalation curve even as the closure itself remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly particularized and anchor the world. The viaduct's magnetite properties constrain tactics (iron nails, compasses) and the moon's position becomes a usable resource. The ending returns to the sanctuary, charging the frame. Micro-setting (iron slivers on slate, traces in kennels) tightens choices. However, spatial choreography across the lake and beyond the viaduct remains impressionistic; the journey to "windfallen ore" lacks tactile grounding, and the village itself is underdescribed—no sense of buildings, population scale, or material culture that would make the social shift more concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (speed versus patience) is signaled early and tightens through the council demonstration, where the needles slacken and the narrator wins a three-night compact—a clear narrowing of options with visible cost (return barren, return to haste). The expedition beat delivers a secondary reversal (success beyond the viaduct) that validates the new method. The final paragraph crystallizes the stance: "we choose running instead of being driven." One deduction: the middle expedition is summarized ("solve three winter shortages before dawn breaks thinly") rather than dramatized, so the peak test lacks on-page friction. The cost at closure is felt but oblique—social adoption rather than personal sacrifice—which fits the Accumulative lens but reduces visceral charge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (patience as leverage, not surrender; attention as covenant) emerges from the lunar mechanics and the unyoking metaphor without overt statement. The final image—"patience acquires a body and learns to stand"—reweights the premise non-literally, and the piece resists tidy morals by embedding ambiguity: the village still runs when danger asks, but now by choice. The viaduct as sleeping animal, the horizon mapper who never steps beyond the headwall yet teaches motion—these particulars carry thematic weight. Minor slip: "quiet is not surrender" and "the world itself keeps shape through pauses" tilt toward aphorism in the final third, edging close to theme summary, though they remain anchored in the narrator's voice and the on-page compact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct—metaphors of cartography, sculpture, tide—rooted in the narrator's role. Diction remains consistent (restrained wildness, "dream drunk," "chalk arcs laid over the lake") and elevated without breaking character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the demonstration, wider during the post-adoption summary. One slip: the final third shifts into lyric summary mode ("Children learn the moons like songs, and elders feel tendon and breath cease their feuds"), which risks losing the narrator's embodied present and reads more like retrospective narration than lived scene. The compression is purposeful but flattens immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (caldera rim, breath as slow congregation, bridge as sleeping animal) charges key beats without muddle. Information density is high. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "I stand my watch to sculpt patience" echoes "To sculpt patience from impatience is my labor"; "We live in a restrained wildness" returns as "I keep my watch with a restrained wildness"; "the opening, the held breath, the pause between tugs" cycles synonym variants. Template cadence runs in the final third: "We still run…but we choose…" "I keep my watch…" "The horizon keeps…" "We unyoke…" Filter-verb stacks ("I chart," "I ask," "I say," "I show," "I answer") dull immediacy in the council sequence. These patterns lower propulsion and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar timing, magnetic terrain, and social transformation through patient observation is non-obvious and specific. The unyoking metaphor and the viaduct as companion rather than thief offer fresh angles. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging. However, the patient-revolution-versus-speed frame and the skeptical-elder-convinced arc are familiar templates; the story transforms them through world detail (magnetite bridge, moon paths) but the emotional and moral calculus remains predictable. The closing lines ("To sculpt patience from impatience is my labor") loop back to the opening, which reads more as bookend symmetry than inevitable hinge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The horizon mapper's choices drive both major turns: the council demonstration narrows options, and the decision to lead the expedition validates the method. The role is causally active across setup (watch, charting), middle (slate demonstration), and closure (adoption, ongoing watch). The character's observation translates into decision with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in setup (description, mechanics), middle (demonstration with iron slivers, crossing during the expedition), and closure (companion metaphor, ongoing navigation). It constrains tactics (nails, compasses) and its reweighted meaning ("sleeping animal we refuse to wake," "companion instead of a thief") charges the final image. Specific properties (magnetite, hum, lunar interaction) make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patient revolution shapes stakes (council compact, three-night trial), tactics (unyoking dogs, moving at lunar tempo), and the ending's social transformation. It is signaled early ("I dream a patient revolution") and drives the middle choice (demonstrate patience versus speed). However, the concept edges toward theme-statement mode in the final third ("The patient revolution I dreamed does not arrive like thunder") rather than remaining embedded in action, which lowers causal pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears in the opening ("My steps are softly purposeful") and closing ("I stay softly purposeful") as a perceptual frame. It modulates the narrator's approach (patience, attention) and contrasts with Kerr's haste, but it does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-consistent but lacks a moment where being softly purposeful forces a trade-off or alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unyoking appears in setup (village "strains against old harness"), the pivotal middle beat ("I unyoke each harness and loop the leather from the pegs"), and closure ("We unyoke harm"). It redefines the central conflict from speed-as-survival to choice-driven motion and charges the final image. The action is irreplaceable: swapping it would break the metaphor and the social transformation. However, the dogs' unyoking is narrated in summary ("Tomorrow we will carry our cargo by sled…at a different tempo") rather than dramatized with on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is seeded early ("I chart its appetite by tracking moon paths"), demonstrated in the council scene (moon arcs low, needles slacken), and applied in the expedition ("The next night the moon dips"). The method's mechanics (lunar schedule, low node) enable the crossing and shape the village's new rhythm. It is specific, irreplaceable, and causal. Minor deduction: the mechanics are explained more than enacted—the reader is told how it works rather than feeling the discovery through trial.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary frames the opening and closing, and the frozen lake supplies spatial constraint (skirting cracks, crossing). The setting pressures the stakes (winter shortages, thaw deadline) and the viaduct's location beyond the western dune structures the journey. However, the sanctuary's specific features (nave of basalt, coals) do not alter tactics, and the lake-crossing itself is summarized rather than dramatized. The setting anchors tone but does not constrain a pivotal choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the lake freezes over") anchors urgency (thaw shatters certainty, winter shortages) and structures the three-night compact. The lunar schedule imposes a tactical clock (low node timing). However, the expedition's duration and the post-adoption period are vague—no sense of how many cycles pass or how long the transformation takes. The timeframe tightens the middle choice but does not pressure the ending with a live countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized through the council demonstration (showing versus declaring patience), the choice to unyoke the dogs, and the final stance ("we choose running instead of being driven"). Friction between the narrator's restless pulse and the village's demand for speed creates on-page tension. The motivation shapes both beats and closure. However, the narrator's internal conflict (impatience versus patience) is asserted more than enacted; we do not see a moment where the narrator's own impatience threatens the plan.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Restrained wildness is established early ("We live in a restrained wildness, our fires low, our ambitions banked like coals") and modulates through the demonstration (quiet that holds power) to the ending ("I keep my watch with a restrained wildness"). The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (patience with teeth, tide tamed enough to pull us home). However, the tone does not shift under peak pressure—the council scene and expedition maintain the same lyric register—which slightly flattens the emotional arc.</comment>
