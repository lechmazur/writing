<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet's motivations are coherent and drive micro-choices across the narrative—selecting jars, following the fox, offering the music box jar to children with specific instructions. Interiority remains concrete and particular ("I figured if the storm took me, it would at least take a town's vocabulary stitched into one breath"). The final choice to promise "more bridges in bottles" emerges from prior causality with visible cost (the storm risk, the jar given away), though the protagonist's reflective mode occasionally edges toward articulate epiphany rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. Minor deduction for the late vow that "settled differently" reading as tidy self-awareness rather than messy internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist promises to carry bridges across seasons, reweighting the initial exile from his mother into a vocation with visible social and relational cost (remaining in the loft, living on traded syllables). Orientation anchors early (loft beneath dunes, dawn, vagrant poet). The accumulative lens holds: density increases through the storm beat, three uncorked jars braid the night, and the widow's recognition charges the final exchange. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm forces the question of redemption, then the widow's gratitude answers it. Cost is legible: isolation, physical risk, and the irreversible gift of the jar. Minor tension: the reflective passages occasionally assert meaning rather than letting image carry it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the ladder, oilcloth against leaks, driftwood shelves, and proximity to the beach all shape the protagonist's daily tactics and the storm's threat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"sand whispering through the rafters like restless coins," "eelgrass," "brine from its seams"—filtered through the poet's attentive lens. The dune fox and the music box half-buried in eelgrass ground the world in tactile, lived-in specificity. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves (loft, dune face, beach, back to loft). The storm environment directly alters action (bracing the ladder, spreading oilcloth, opening jars) and the widow's hand on the shoulder in morning light charges the final beat. Setting actively pressures and enables rather than decorating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating between generations via captured sound—is signaled early and coheres through the narrative. One meaningful tightening occurs during the storm, which forces the protagonist to question whether "redemption had refused me or whether it waited inside a jar I had not opened," narrowing options to survival versus transmission of kinship. The widow's request for the jar and the children's intermediary role demonstrate earned escalation under the accumulative lens. Agency is expressed through micro-choices: following the fox, cleaning the music box, selecting three jars to open during the storm, giving the jar to children with instructions. Cost is visible: the protagonist remains isolated, risks the storm, and gives away irreplaceable work. Minor gap: the storm itself arrives by coincidence rather than protagonist action, complicating but not resolving stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the music box as memory vessel, the jars as kinship bridges, and the "penny, honestly offered, could carry a dynasty's heartbeat" realization. The protagonist's exile from his mother and promise to return "with a voice" braids personal redemption into communal translation without overt moralizing. The final image—walking the beach with pockets full of corks, "ready to trade them for breakfast"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how small gestures accumulate into belonging. Subtext operates through gesture (the fox watching, the widow's warm hand, children as bright gulls) and the recurring image of sound-as-object shifts meaning from isolation to connection. The new jar labeled "Kin" charges the closure without stating a thesis. No thematic echo or diagnostic phrasing weakens the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent—lyric compression, poetic register, purposeful syntactic inversion ("It is a lonesome splendor to work alone"), and a perceptual signature filtered through sound and memory. Diction remains character-particular ("salt-stung quiet," "feral loft," "crooked essay across the dunes"). The compressed, metaphor-dense style is taught early and sustained, fitting the poet's vocation. However, under peak emotional pressure (the storm reflection on his mother, the widow's tears), the narrator's articulate philosophical cadence does not degrade or compress, maintaining the same polished register throughout. This consistency is voice-motivated but reduces the sense of stress modulation. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction for uniform syntactic elegance that does not shift with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentence rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent ("sand whispering through the rafters like restless coins," "melody stumbled out like a child relearning how to walk the alphabet"), and information density is high. Clarity and concision are maintained across most beats. However, scattered mixed or strained metaphors reduce precision: "lightning wrote its crooked essay" pairs awkwardly with "language comes wet from the breakers and dries into bridges" in tonal register, and "silences rough as rope" feels forced. Template cadence appears in mid-section with repeated "I [verb]" openings across adjacent sentences (cleaned, set, climbed, arranged). Paraphrase loop detected: "to become the translator between generations" restated as "carry more bridges in bottles across the seasons." Deductions total approximately −0.8 for artifact presence and mixed metaphor, keeping the score in the 7.5–7.7 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—vagrant poet capturing sounds in jars to translate between generations—is fresh and specific, avoiding template plots. The music box as lighthouse memory and the jar-as-bridge conceit transform familiar redemption arcs through the particular world logic of bottled sound. Emotional specificity (the widow recognizing her husband's melody, the children laughing at archaic words until gulls uncork meaning) grounds universals in concrete action. However, the core emotional arc—exile seeking redemption through service—is a familiar template, and while the sound-jar method distinguishes execution, the protagonist's internal journey (fleeing maternal sorrow, discovering small gestures matter) follows a well-worn path. The fox and storm elements add texture but do not fundamentally transform the underlying structure. Derivative premise friction applies moderately: −0.6 for recognizable redemption template partially offset by +0.3 for the sound-capture world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is present from the opening line, drives every key choice (following the fox, cleaning the music box, opening three jars during the storm, giving the jar to children, promising to carry more bridges), and the final image shows him walking the beach gathering new sounds. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong. The character's choices create the escalation (uncorking jars, selecting which memory to gift) and the ending's resonance hinges on his vocation and relational stance. Cost is visible: isolation, material poverty, storm risk, and the irreversible gift of the jar. Specificity is high—no generic wanderer could replace this exact role. Minor gap: the character's interior arc (from fleeing mother to serving community) is somewhat narrated rather than fully dramatized in scene conflict. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5; summary-only use on the mother vow −0.3. Base 3.0 + 6.0 = 9.0, capped at 7.8 due to partial summary of the mother reconciliation beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten music box appears at setup (found in eelgrass), is handled and cleaned in development (unstiffening the crank, filling a jar with its tune), and its jar returns at closure (widow recognizes it, asks for it, protagonist gives it away). The object's melody is the lighthouse keeper's hum, creating causal pressure: without it, the widow cannot reconnect to her grief, and the protagonist cannot prove his translation method. The music box shifts meaning from forgotten artifact to kinship bridge. Three beats: discovery, jarring, gifting. Cost tied to it: giving away irreplaceable work. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, rounded down to 9.0, but ornamental use at discovery (described before dramatized action pressure) −0.2, adjusting to 8.8, then additional specificity detail (music box's stiff crank, brine in seams) +0.3 → 9.1, capped at 8.1 due to the object appearing only in recounted memory for the widow rather than on-page mechanical constraint during middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gleaned redemption shapes the protagonist's dominant stake and is explicitly dramatized during the storm beat: "I wondered whether redemption had refused me or whether it waited inside a jar I had not opened." The concept drives the choice to open jars and later promise more bridges, altering tactics (what to do with captured sounds) and the ending stance. However, "gleaned" as a specific attribute of redemption is more thematic echo than on-page mechanic—the story demonstrates redemption through small acts, but "gleaned" (gathered bit by bit) is asserted in narration rather than constrained by the story's physics. Setup present (street-corner verses, method), development present (storm question), closure present (widow's gratitude, new vow). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.4; label-only use of "gleaned" as modifier −0.3, swappability (could be "earned" or "accrued") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, rounded to 6.4 for strong thematic integration despite thin mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" appears once in narration ("solitude keeps the ears wide and the heart positively wistful") as a character label but does not constrain or enable specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait suggests a hopeful melancholy that colors the protagonist's perceptual filter (following the fox, listening for sentences no one else can hear), but no choice hinges on being wistful versus pragmatic or resigned. Setup present (early label), development absent (no middle choice shaped by wistfulness), closure absent (final vow is determined action, not wistful longing). Late first appearance avoided, but ornamental use and lack of causal pressure lower the score significantly. Early signal +0.5, one beat (notional filter) +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, but lyric-resonance allowance for tone consistency across the narrative +1.3 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sweeten" recurs as both verb and thematic anchor: jars "sweeten the silent bread of days when memories go stale," and the protagonist writes a new jar labeled "Kin, because sometimes the smallest word can sweeten a century of winter." The action is metaphorical but drives the protagonist's method—he selects which sounds to jar in order to sweeten (enrich, soften, connect) barren moments. The widow's recognition and the children's understanding both trace to this sweetening function. Setup present (early method description), development present (selecting jars during storm to "sweeten" the night), closure present (new jar labeled to sweeten winter). Three beats. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5; metaphorical rather than physical action limits higher score. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8, minor swappability (could be "soften" or "enrich") −0.2 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in glass jars is the protagonist's method, signaled early ("I have a method worth more than coins: capturing sounds in glass jars. I cork them with wax, label them in pencil"), applied across multiple beats (jarring the music box tune, opening three jars during the storm, filling a new jar with the melody, labeling a jar "Kin"), and central to closure (the widow asks for the jar, the protagonist promises to carry more). The mechanics matter: corking, labeling, uncorking to release sound, and the jar as portable memory vessel. Without this exact method, the plot cannot function—no other medium (recording, performance, writing) carries the same bottled-lighthouse resonance. Setup early +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.8, cost +0.4 (giving away jars). Base 3.0 + 6.6 = 9.6, but mechanics not fully dramatized (how does sound enter the jar? why glass?) −0.4, slight swappability with other container methods −0.3 → 8.9, further adjusted to 8.3 for the implicit rather than explicit physics of sound capture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is the protagonist's home and workspace, pressuring choices throughout: the ladder must be braced during the storm, the roof leaks and requires oilcloth, proximity to the beach enables sound-gathering walks, and the dune fox circles the loft as a recurring presence. The setting supplies resources (driftwood shelves for jars) and constraints (exposure to storm, isolation from town). Setup early, development strong (storm beats), closure present (children climb the ladder, widow's hand on shoulder in the loft). Micro-setting (body, loft structure) alters tactics (spreading oilcloth, bracing ladder). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, but the loft itself does not force a key choice—storm arrives by coincidence, loft is backdrop −0.5 → 7.4, adjusted to 7.2 for strong atmospheric but moderate decisional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" frames the opening and the final morning scene, creating a before/after echo, but time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The storm arrives "that evening," but no clock pressure narrows the protagonist's choices—he could have opened the jars earlier or later without consequence. The timeframe is more lyric refrain than constraint. Setup present (opening line), closure present (final morning), but middle development absent (no ticking clock). Lyric-resonance allowance applies for the dawn reprise that reweights the protagonist's stance. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +1.0, closure participation +0.7, ornamental time marker −0.7, no causal pressure from time −0.8. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, capped at 4.2 for missing middle gate and lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to become the translator between generations is stated early ("My aim is plain and peculiar: to become the translator between generations, using captured thunder and lullabies to make elders and children understand one another"), dramatized in the noon scene (children trade marbles for syllables, meanings "chose them like perch" when gulls uncork), and tested during the storm (redemption question) and closure (widow's recognition via music box, promise to carry more bridges). The desire drives choices: which jars to open, which to give away, the new jar labeled "Kin." Friction between want and cost: isolation, poverty, storm risk. Setup early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, but partial summary in the mother-reflection beat −0.4 → 8.2, adjusted to 7.9 for strong dramatization tempered by one told-only segment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is declared once ("It is a lonesome splendor to work alone in such salt-stung quiet") but coheres across the narrative: the protagonist's solitary loft, isolation from town, wistful ear for unheard sentences, and the final image of walking alone with pockets full of corks all embody the tone. The tone modulates slightly under storm pressure (anxiety about redemption, physical bracing) but remains within the lonesome-splendor register. The final image charges the tone: "No palace on the coast felt as sheltering as my feral loft beneath the dunes, where language comes wet from the breakers and dries into bridges." Setup present, development present (tone consistent through varied beats), closure present (tone elevates the final vow). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5; static mood rather than dynamic modulation −0.5, label-only declaration −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, but lyric coherence and final-image charge +1.9 → 8.0.</comment>
