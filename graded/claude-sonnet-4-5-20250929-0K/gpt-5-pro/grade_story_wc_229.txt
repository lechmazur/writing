<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly specific ("jasmine…found me with a softness that felt like my name spoken into my hair"), with embodied perception filtering every sensory choice. The core motive—proving whispers work—drives micro-choices (wiping brass, humming to iron, pressing cork to lips) that accumulate pressure. Mara remains off-page until the final beats, limiting relational friction, but her arrival permits a brief embodied exchange ("I hold her elbows as if they are fragile masts") that earns the closure cost. Minor dock: Alder's interior remains opaque; his "jaw looking for argument" and final mirroring gesture hint at change but lack contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The pattern—narrator layers whisper, scent, light, and waiting—is taught early and tightens through density increase and cadence shift when Mara's skiff turns. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the light has been holding you, and the garden will not let you be alone" crystallizes the thesis with felt relational cost (exhaustion, relief, Alder's reluctant witnessing). Orientation anchors dawn, post-heat-wave, cobalt lighthouse by line one. One meaningful deepening (the skiff's slow answer) narrows uncertainty and reweights the narrator's stance without requiring a causal reversal. Cost is visible in Mara's "blown pale" face and the narrator's breaking voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lens ("purifies intentions as they pass through") constrains the narrator's tactic: aim longing, not cruelty, to reach Mara. The vial cork's resin-and-night-flower scent becomes a micro-setting object that the narrator uses twice (pressed to lips, then opened to release garden into the room), charging the final beckon. Spatial choreography is clean (hatch, stairs, lantern shutters, lee of rock, skiff tie-line). The heat-wave aftermath creates sensory contrast (salt, cooled sea, thin dawn) that filters every perception and permits the whisper to travel without "burning" meanings. The garden scent wraps the light beam, a tactile environmental detail that alters the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bring Mara home by whisper rather than foghorn shout, proving the thesis under time pressure (dawn, exhaustion, Alder's impatience). One meaningful tightening: the skiff "turns its nose toward us" after the narrator releases scent-wrapped light, then "answers slowly, as if unlearning fear." Agency is the narrator's layered beckon (naming into wood and lens, seating cork in vial, angling shutters low) with visible cost—voice breaking, hands open and low, Alder's grudging mirror—that forecloses the loud-blasting path. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through waiting, Alder's grumbling counterpoint, and Mara's vulnerability. The escalation is a single decisive deepening under Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—attention as "screaming tenderness that does not injure air"—emerges through the narrator's tactile choices (humming to wake steps, beckoning with hands low) and Mara's return without being stated as thesis until the confrontation with Alder makes it legible. The final image ("the light has been holding you, and the garden will not let you be alone") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: care operates through patient structure, not force. The cobalt-lens purification and the garden-scent instrument layer specific metaphysics without allegory. Alder's "look of someone hearing a lullaby from the wrong century" permits counter-reading (skepticism yields, or merely pauses) without false balance. One thematic note—"attention is screaming tenderness"—risks direct statement but lands after the dramatized proof, minimizing sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices resin stains, "teeth of the lens," the way metal can "soften like a throat." Diction is lyric-elevated ("the sea has finally cooled, a sigh uncoiling," "anger birds," "moon grew bare and mean") but consistent and voice-motivated; the narrator's childhood memory of jasmine anchors the register in embodied past. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (short clauses when the skiff turns). Dialogue is minimal and goal-driven: the narrator's whispered beckon and the closing reassurance carry subtext (care, exhaustion, community). Minor slip: "we have cold water and bread, and the books you love are waiting" risks exposition-as-comfort but the specificity (books, not generic solace) keeps it anchored. No head-hopping; free indirect remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long breath ("After the heat wave breaks, the cobalt lighthouse at dawn stands breathing like a great blue lung") gives way to shorter tactical beats when the skiff approaches. Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "I wipe salt from the brass and hum a note to wake the old steps" = action + worldview). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and POV-anchored. Two friction points lower the score: (a) "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness that does not injure air" edge toward conceptual opacity in peak beats without full dramatic grounding, risking slight register drift (−0.3); (b) one paraphrase slip: "Whispers are not just quiet sounds; they are vibrations of intent" follows a paragraph already establishing that whispers "gather…into something that can cross water," creating minor redundancy (−0.2). Grammar and sequencing are clean; no loops or scaffold elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper uses scent and cobalt-lens "purification" to beckon rather than blast—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the familiar lighthouse-rescue frame through the metaphysics of attention and the garden instrument. The narrator's childhood memory of jasmine grounds the tactic in lived particular rather than quirk. Emotional specificity (Mara's "face…blown pale," Alder's grudging hand on shoulder) avoids template rescue beats. The ending reconfigures prior material: Alder mirrors the low, open-handed beckon "without knowing," a fresh beat that earns hindsight inevitability. Risk: the lyric density and conceptual vocabulary ("vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions") court overwriting but remain legible under the Accumulative lens. No close echoes of famous lines detected; the cobalt-lens conceit and scent-wrapping method feel original within maritime-rescue tradition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The assistant lighthouse keeper's choices—wipe brass, hum to iron, press cork, whisper Mara's name into lens and rail, seat cork in vial to release scent, angle shutters low—create every key turn. Early signal (line two: "I am its assistant lighthouse keeper"). Beat involvement: three distinct (prepare light, release scent-wrapped beam, receive Mara). Causal pressure: the narrator's refusal to blast the horn and choice to beckon with scent narrows options and enables Mara's return. Closure linkage: the narrator holds Mara's elbows and speaks the final reassurance, completing the proof. Visible cost: voice breaks, hands tremble, Alder's reluctant witness. Irreplaceable: only this character holds the garden memory and the thesis.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: introduced as survivor beside the vial (setup, ~line 12), pressed to narrator's lips to taste garden (first use, mid-story), seated in vial then pulled to release scent into room (second use, charging the beckon). Each use escalates: memory anchor → sensory retrieval → tactical instrument that wraps the light. Closure linkage: the released garden scent enables Mara's turn and frames the narrator's final reassurance ("the garden will not let you be alone"). Causal pressure: without the cork's resin-and-night-flower payload, the beckon lacks its vehicle. Specificity: "stained with resin and night flowers" makes it irreplaceable. Cost: the narrator's vulnerability in pressing it to lips, then trusting the released scent to work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept—vibrations of intent—shapes stakes and tactics on the page. Early signal: line two ("a stubborn wish to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts") and line three ("the panes hum with the small, private vibrations of intent"). Beat involvement: the narrator whispers Mara's name into rail and lens (mid-story), then releases scent as "patient way of saying yes" (late). Causal pressure: the concept narrows the narrator's method to low, gathered vibration rather than horn blast, altering tactics under Alder's opposition. Closure linkage: the final reassurance ("the light has been holding you") encodes the thesis without stating "vibrations." Mild dock: the phrase "vibrations of intent" risks abstraction; the story earns it through repeated embodied examples (hum, whisper, beckon) but the label itself trends conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lens's attribute—"purifies intentions as they pass through"—constrains the narrator's tactic: "If you aim cruelty at its heart, the beam sends out only the bone of longing, clean and sharp enough to find home." Setup: introduced ~line 9. Development: the narrator angles shutters and whispers "Come home, Mara" into the lens, trusting purification to strip coercion and leave only care. Closure: the skiff turns and Mara reaches the lee, validating the attribute's mechanics. Causal pressure: without purification, a desperate shout might scatter or wound; the attribute enables the low beam to carry longing intact. Cost: the narrator must trust the lens and forgo the horn's certainty. Swappability test: a "focusing" or "amplifying" lens could be substituted with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability slightly (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The action—beckon—drives every major turn. Early signal: line two ("a stubborn wish to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" implies beckon as method). Beat involvement: narrator beckons with voice (whisper into wood, lens), scent (release garden), light (angle shutters low), and finally hands ("I beckon with my hands low and open"). Causal pressure: beckoning (not blasting) narrows the tactic and forces Mara's skiff to "answer slowly, as if unlearning fear." Closure: the narrator's final spoken beckon ("We are here…the light has been holding you") and Alder's mirrored gesture complete the proof. Visible cost: voice breaks, exhaustion, Alder's grudging compliance. Irreplaceable: swapping "beckon" for "signal" or "call" would lose the thesis's core verb and the low, gathered intentionality. This action is the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—"by the scent of a garden at night"—is seeded in the narrator's childhood memory (~line 14: "I learned to beckon by the scent of a garden at night when I was a boy hiding from thunder. Back then, the jasmine did not shout; it climbed the dark and found me"). Mechanics matter: the narrator presses cork to lips, tastes bark, then releases the garden into the room to wrap the light beam. Beat involvement: memory (setup), cork-press (mid), scent-release (pre-closure). Causal: the garden scent becomes the "shawl over a newborn" that carries the whisper across water without burning it. Closure: "the garden will not let you be alone" recapitulates the method as proof. Specificity: jasmine and resin are named; no generic "fragrance." Minor dock: the mechanics of scent traveling with light are metaphoric rather than physical, risking slight implausibility, but the story earns it as metaphysics (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn supplies resources and constraints that affect outcome. Early signal: line one. The cobalt lens purifies intentions (see 9D); the "teeth of the lens" and shutters are handled to angle the beam low. The heat-wave aftermath (cool air, thin dawn light) permits whisper to travel without burning meanings—environmental constraint that alters tactics. The lighthouse's height and line-of-sight enable the narrator to spot Mara's skiff and guide it to the lee. Closure: the light's holding function ("the light has been holding you") and the lee anchorage complete the beckon. Spatial micro-choices: hatch, stairs, windowsill, lantern shutters, doorway—all tracked and used. The setting is not postcard; every element pressures or enables a beat. Irreplaceable: a generic lighthouse without cobalt purification would not support the thesis.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the heat wave breaks"—shapes the story's sensory palette and enables the whisper tactic. Setup: line one. The cooled air permits meanings to travel "without burning them" (stated ~line 16), a causal constraint. Dawn's "thin as milk" light charges the opening of the hatch and the angling of shutters. The narrator's urgency (Mara out since before midnight, exhaustion visible) creates implicit time pressure, though no live countdown tightens choices on the page. Development: the cooled rocks and cleared air are referenced twice. Closure: dawn and exhaustion converge when Mara arrives "blown pale" and the narrator's voice breaks. Moderate integration: the timeframe is more atmospheric anchor than escalating clock. Stronger causal role (e.g., tide or daylight deadline forcing a choice) would lift this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is signaled in line two and dramatized through on-page conflict with Alder ("would have me blast the horn") and the narrator's layered soft tactics (hum, whisper, cork, scent, low beam). Beat involvement: three (initial refusal, scent-wrapping beckon, final voiced reassurance). Causal pressure: the desire narrows method and forecloses horn-blasting, creating friction with Alder and forcing the narrator to trust unproven metaphysics under time pressure. Closure: Mara's return validates the thesis; the narrator's breaking voice and Alder's mirrored beckon encode the cost (vulnerability, relational shift). Friction: the narrator's want (prove whispers work) aligns with need (bring Mara home safely) without deep internal contradiction, slightly reducing tension. A fleeting doubt or temptation to blast the horn mid-scene would have sharpened this to 9+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone—"screaming tenderness that does not injure air"—is stated once (~line 23: "attention is screaming tenderness") and enacted through the narrator's contradictory intensity: fierce care (wiping brass, humming to iron, pressing cork hard enough to taste bark) delivered with restraint (low voice, open hands, no horn blast). Modulation: the tone tightens when the skiff turns ("I do not shout her name again") and softens at closure ("I let my voice break softly"). Coherence: lyric diction sustains the oxymoron (cobalt lung breathing, gulls as angry birds, moon "bare and mean"). Closure charge: Alder's "look of someone hearing a lullaby from the wrong century" and the narrator's broken voice embody the paradox. Dock: the phrase "screaming tenderness" is stated rather than purely enacted, risking slight tell-over-show (−0.3). The execution is mostly strong, but full 8.5+ would require the tone to remain implicit throughout.</comment>
