<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cool-headed fisher is established through embodied actions (slow pulse, slack face) and concrete choices (dropping the rail spike, voicing silence). Internal contradiction appears when the echo tests him "with voices he had loved" and he must transliterate them back to breath, showing genuine struggle. The motivation to return the echo for the girl is stated but not deeply pressured on the page; the fisher's competence dominates without visible mistakes that compound. The final choice to seal and return the echo feels inevitable given his skill rather than earned through a hierarchy of competing values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (fisher), where (sound wave garden), and what (catching an echo) by the second paragraph. The piece accumulates density through lyric layering and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the fisher seals the echo and rows toward harbor, ready to "finish the song" and "usher [emotions] home without losing their teeth"—a Charged Poise moment where the cost (drifting as "keeper of echoes") reconfigures his solitary role. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo walks through him "like windchimes" and he answers by voicing silence, narrowing his options to either yield or hold the line. The lens holds; the cost is felt in the final image of him drifting between garden and child.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting: stems shiver, petals unfurl, pockets pool echoes, and the garden "parts like lips" in response to the fisher's breath. The rail spike—smooth with weather and palms—is handled twice (swung to drop into a pocket, then steadied against during the pull) and its coldness signals the catch's strain. Spatial choreography of skiff, furrows, and pockets remains coherent. The garden's responsiveness directly enables the capture: the fisher offers "a bowl of nothing" and the roots taste his transliterated phonemes, constraining his method and charging the final image of the garden sighing behind him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo to finish the girl's lullaby—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the echo tests him with loved voices (hooks), and he must transliterate emotions back to breath or lose control. The cost is legible when "the letters keened, the rail spike turned cold as stars, and the skiff tilted," forcing him to zigzag with the pull rather than against it. Agency is present (he chooses to answer by voicing silence and to pull "slow as winter"), and the final sealing with breath forecloses other paths. Under the Accumulative lens, this pressure and tightening suffice, though the fisher's unshaken competence limits the felt difficulty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transliteration—rendering ineffable emotion into handleable form without taming it—emerges organically from the fisher's method and the recurring phrase "to transliterate emotions." The ending offers a non-literal answer: "to usher them home without losing their teeth" reweights the act as stewardship rather than mastery, and the final line ("a keeper of echoes") charges the role with solitary cost. The feral lullaby motif (tender and toothy, wild cradle) recurs and modulates, avoiding overt statement. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the closure. Subtext operates in the image of the sleepwalking constellations' relief or boredom, and in the contrast between the garden's sigh and the child's coming sleep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct lyric register ("moonwater," "star milk," "windchimes"). Purposeful compression and metaphoric density are consistent and taught early. Two significant weaknesses lower the score: (1) The phrase "transliterates emotions" recurs as a near-label across multiple beats without evolving into embodied action, reading as thematic claim rather than lived perception. (2) Perceptual specificity wavers—"He knew the echo of a goddess when it walked through him, because it wore his bones like windchimes" is vivid, but several lines ("People said he transliterates emotions without a pen") feel like external commentary rather than the fisher's own noticing. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but legible. Three distinct line-level issues lower the score: (1) The phrase "transliterates emotions" (and variants: "transliterate emotions," "transliterated ache") recurs five times, creating a label loop that dulls closure-adjacent beats. (2) Template cadence: "He [verb]" structures dominate ("He wore," "He does it," "He swung," "He let," "He leaned," "He cupped," "He would pour"), flattening propulsion in the final third. (3) Mixed metaphor: "pockets where echoes pooled" followed by "drew tight around the note as if around a bright animal"—liquid and capture-net vehicles clash. Information density is high and no scaffolding appears, but the loops and cadence stiffness prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-tangible-substance, constellation-driven tides, and emotion-as-transliteration is specific and non-obvious. The fisher's method ("voicing silence," using the rail spike as metronome and anchor) particularizes the premise beyond stock metaphor. Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphoric density heightens stakes without obscuring the central task. However, the "catching echoes to finish a song" frame leans on familiar myth-quest structure, and the transformation is moderate: swap "echo" for "lost voice" or "spirit" and the arc holds. The final image ("a keeper of echoes") offers quiet resonance but does not radically reweight prior material. Fresh inflection is present but not bold enough to reach the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cool-headed fisher drives all key beats: he poles the skiff (setup), swings and drops the rail spike (development), voices silence to test the echo, zigzags with the pull, and seals the catch (closure). His choices—offering "a bowl of nothing," answering hooks with breath, letting the boat move with the pull—constrain tactics and shape the ending. Present throughout; decisions alter options at each turn. Specific cost: "drifting, a keeper of echoes" in the final line.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rail spike is introduced early ("worn smooth with years"), used twice (swung to drop into a pocket, steadied against during the pull), and its state change ("turned cold as stars") signals the catch's strain. It functions as anchor and metronome, shaping his method. Missing stronger closure reprise: it does not reappear in the final image. Specific to his practice, not easily swapped, but its causal weight peaks mid-story rather than at the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations frame the opening ("slipped their leashes," pacing, "beating tides into the rows") and their steps create the pockets where echoes pool, enabling the catch. They reappear at closure ("slowed, maybe relieved, maybe bored") to mark the end of the disturbance. Their mechanics—wandering steps → tidal furrows → echo pockets—directly shape the fisher's tactics. However, their role is atmospheric constraint rather than active pressure; the fisher does not contend with them, only uses their effects. Present in all three gates but more backdrop than stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is stated early ("People said") and recurs five times, but its mechanics remain abstract: he "shapes the zero between notes," offers "transliterated ache," turns hooks to steam. One visible cost: the echo tests him with loved voices and he must transliterate them back to breath or lose control, a brief constraint. The trait enables his method but is told/labeled more than dramatized with on-page friction. Swappable with "channels" or "transmutes" without major edits. Present across beats but more thematic marker than specific, costly ability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Zigzag" appears twice: he lets the skiff zigzag between standing notes (listening move) and later zigzags with the pull to avoid tearing the catch—a tactical constraint that prevents direct force and shapes the resolution. The second use directly affects closure success. Early setup, causal middle turn, payoff in the capture sequence. Not the sole driver of turns (voicing silence and the rail spike also matter), but irreplaceable: straight-line force would fail. Cost is implicit (longer path, sustained strain).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By voicing silence" is seeded early ("shaping the zero between notes"), demonstrated twice in the capture sequence (offering "a bowl of nothing," answering the echo's hooks with "a cradle with claws"), and returns in the final paragraph ("pour the echo...by voicing silence"). The method is specific to his practice and shapes multiple beats. However, its mechanics remain metaphoric rather than concrete—what does "voicing silence" do that "singing" or "breathing" would not? Present in all three gates and tied to closure, but the specificity needed for higher bands is elusive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is present throughout: the fisher poles through its furrows, it breathes and shivers in response to his actions, it parts "like lips" when he offers silence, and the roots taste his phonemes. The garden's responsiveness directly enables the catch; it is not passive scenery. It constrains his method (he must speak in transliterated ache the roots can taste) and charges the final image ("the garden sighed"). Spatial coherence is maintained (skiff, furrows, pockets). Indispensable: remove the garden and the capture mechanism collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" opens the story and recurs near closure ("patterns broke themselves again"). The phrase marks the constellations' disturbance as the enabling condition for echo-pooling. However, the timeframe does not impose urgency or a ticking clock; the fisher works "unhurried as a stone," and no on-page deadline narrows his options. The phrase functions more as conceptual frame than tactical constraint. Early setup and closure reprise earn lyric credit, but lack of pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to catch the echo of a goddess" to finish the girl's broken lullaby—is stated early and remains the through-line. The stakes are clear (the girl waits, the echo can "stitch a broken lullaby or break a stitched lie"). The fisher's choices (offering silence, transliterating hooks to steam, pulling slow) all serve this goal. Visible cost: he becomes "a keeper of echoes," drifting between garden and child, defined by his solitary task. The girl and her mother are told rather than shown, slightly abstracting the personal friction, but the motivation drives every beat and the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" is introduced early ("tender and toothy, lulling the garden while daring it to wake mean") and recurs when the echo sings it "into his blood" and again in the final paragraph ("let the lullaby find its own wild cradle"). The oxymoron—tender yet toothy, wild yet cradling—is sustained and modulates under pressure without flattening into a single static mood. It charges the closure image (usher emotions "home without losing their teeth"). The tone coheres through turns and enriches the thematic question of transliteration without taming.</comment>
