<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pruner's interiority is heavily abstract—"branches speak in hues the throat cannot carry"—relying on lyric assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The charge "to preserve the color of wonder" drives action, but micro-choices lack visible internal conflict; the protagonist moves through beats with near-omniscient certainty. The creative attribute is mentioned ("insatiably creative") but never constrains a choice or creates friction. Emotional progression is poetic but flat; no micro-hesitation or competing impulse dramatizes cost at the key turns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (orchard, echo orchard, Gray, seed planting) and the final paragraphs shift cadence to communal practice. Orientation anchors late—"verdant parapet beside a waterfall" appears first line, but "who" and "when" remain vague past 120 words without taught disorientation; apply −0.3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise blending into communal Earned Stasis): the seed fulfills its promise, the valley speaks hope, and the pruner's role shifts to teaching. Cost is conceptual—wonder preserved at the price of constant tending—but the final image ("leaf by leaf by leaf") feels more affirmed than foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Gray drinks and reveals "a famine of stories," reweighting the conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The parapet and waterfall anchor spatially, and mist, roots, and seed function as micro-setting elements that enable key moves (door in foam, bridge of roots, planting). Sensory detail is lyric but often ornamental—"moss closed its starry mouths"—without altering tactics. The heirloom seed constrains the final choice (planting it charges closure), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography across the bridge and back remains legible, and the orchard's echo-double supplies a second pressure zone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve wonder against the Gray's encroachment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Gray waits at return and the pruner offers succor instead of striking—a choice that narrows options and redefines the conflict. Agency is present but the protagonist's near-invulnerability (capturing essence, crossing bridges, teaching neighbors) reduces felt cost. The reversal (Gray as hungry, not malicious) arrives late and is told rather than tested; no on-page resistance follows the revelation. Cost is asserted ("every severed branch must be told why") but rarely demonstrated as a tradeoff that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—tending meaning and color through patient craft—emerges through images (pruning, seed, essence-gathering) and the final communal practice. The piece avoids overt moralizing, but lines like "We tended color like language, and the valley spoke hope" hover near thematic statement. The heirloom seed and returning light motif reweight prior material at closure without a stated moral, meeting the 9+ test. Subtext is thinner than lyric surface; the Gray's reveal (famine of stories) lands as concept rather than dramatized friction. Earned wisdom arises from particular acts (naming hurt, sweetening grief), though the resolution feels more restored than reconfigured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with stable psychic distance and a lyric register ("shears remembered lullabies," "bees stitched with shadow thread"). Perceptual signature is consistent—everything filtered through pruning metaphor—but voice lacks modulation under pressure; diction remains elevated and poetic even at peak beats. No dialogue, so related bullets are waived. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (repeated "by capturing essence," parallelism in final third) are taught early and legible, qualifying as experimental allowance. Filter verbs ("I touched," "I listened," "I asked") cluster without harm to immediacy given the meditative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without pattern-teaching that differentiates peak beats from transit; apply −0.5 for overwriting spread. Paraphrase loops appear: "branches speak in hues" / "small bravery of buds" / "air ripened back toward color" recycle the color-as-wonder concept across adjacent beats without added pressure; apply −0.4. Template cadence runs in final third: "When grief came... When joy came... The Gray visited..." (three parallel stems); apply −0.4. Several lines blend vehicles incoherently: "moss closed its starry mouths" (mouths and stars), "bees stitched with shadow thread" (stitching bees vs. bees as needles). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.3 in Q7. Information density is uneven—some beats advance (planting seed), others ornament (waterfall braided light). No scaffold or synonym churn in the mechanical sense, but lyric repetition without escalation drags momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The orchard-pruner-as-healer premise is a recognizable archetype (wise gardener, Miyazaki-adjacent pastoral fantasy). The story transforms it through specificity: capturing essence in leaf cups, naming branches, sweetening grief in bowls—small concrete rituals that avoid stock gestures. The Gray as story-starved rather than malicious offers a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking (lyric compression, echo orchard, teaching closure rather than climactic confrontation) heightens thematic stakes but obscures causal escalation. The final image (leaf by leaf by leaf, valley spoke hope) feels inevitable in hindsight given the seed's charge, though the path lacks surprise. Proximity check: "orchard of echoes" and "bridge of roots" evoke folkloric templates without close echo of a single famous scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pruner present throughout, drives setup (pruning to let light in), middle choices (crossing bridge, asking bees permission, offering succor to Gray), and closure (planting seed, teaching neighbors). Early signal strong. Three+ distinct beats. Causal pressure: pruning decisions enable the door, permission shapes echo-orchard work, offering succor redefines the conflict. Closure linkage: planting the seed completes the charge and the final paragraphs rest on teaching the craft. Cost visible in sustained attention and the shift from solitary to communal role. Irreplaceable: role and method are fused. Minor friction: some beats (touching apple, crossing bridge) feel more received than chosen, lowering agency slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seed introduced early (paragraph 8: "In my pocket rested an heirloom seed") with clear charge. Mid-story reference (paragraph 20: "seed in palm"). Closure participation strong: planting the seed (paragraph 34) triggers the final transformation ("root like a silver thread, weaving between worlds"). Three beats. Causal pressure: the seed's charge steadies the pruner and its planting fulfills the promise, altering the valley's state. Closure linkage unmistakable. Cost tied to the charge (preserve wonder) and the act of kneeling to plant after the Gray drinks. Irreplaceability high: heirloom nature and the women's thumbprints anchor mercy and continuity. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Concept "weaving between worlds" named explicitly (paragraph 6: "My craft was weaving between worlds") and enacted through the door in foam, bridge of roots, crossing to echo orchard, and the seed's root "weaving between worlds as it grew." Setup and closure gates met. Development: crossing the bridge and working in the echo orchard involve inter-world movement, but the mechanics remain lyric assertion rather than constrained choice. Two beats clearly tied to the concept (crossing, planting). Causal pressure moderate: the concept enables access but does not force tradeoffs on the page. Closure linkage clear (root weaves, neighbors learn). Swappability moderate: "crossing thresholds" or "bridging realms" could substitute with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Attribute "insatiably creative" mentioned once (paragraph 10: "I was insatiably creative, but that charge steadied me more than invention ever could"). No setup before that line, no on-page demonstration. No middle beat where creativity enables or constrains a choice. No closure participation. The line reads as contrast (charge > creativity) rather than trait-in-action. Label-only mention; apply −0.3. Late first appearance (past midpoint); apply −0.4. Ornamental use; apply −0.7. Total friction exceeds positive signals. Gates: missing setup (pre-mention), missing development, missing closure. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup; actual work is weaker, scoring below that cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Action "succor" seeded early (paragraph 4: villagers "asking for succor"), central reversal (paragraph 30: protagonist offers succor to the Gray instead of striking), and closure echo (paragraph 42: "When grief came, we caught its breath... and returned it sweetened"). Three beats. Causal pressure high: offering succor redefines the Gray and enables the seed planting; the method spreads to communal practice. Closure linkage strong: sweetening grief and planting joy are succor-as-craft. Cost visible: the choice to offer rather than strike forecloses confrontation and requires vulnerability. Irreplaceability strong: "succor" carries semantic weight (aid, nourishment) that "help" or "comfort" would dilute. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Method "by capturing essence" appears in paragraph 7 (setup), recurs in echo orchard work (paragraph 27: "I gathered them, by capturing essence in leaf cups"), and again in communal teaching (paragraph 42: "learning gentleness by capturing essence before we touched a knife"). Three beats. Causal pressure: capturing essence (fragrance, wind, scent pearls, laughter/rain/gasp mix) enables the cup of light that the Gray drinks, changing the conflict. Closure participation through communal practice teaching. Cost implied (gathering requires patience, attention) but not dramatized as a tradeoff. Irreplaceability moderate: the phrase is distinctive, but "gathering" or "distilling" could substitute with minor edits. All three gates met, but mechanics remain lyric rather than constrained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Parapet and waterfall anchor the opening line and return in closure (paragraph 37: "The parapet remained green," paragraph 38: "the waterfall braided light"). Setup strong. Middle use: the waterfall parts to reveal the bridge (paragraph 19), enabling crossing; the parapet is the planting site (paragraph 34). Three beats. Causal pressure moderate: parting waterfall enables access, planting on parapet grounds the seed's growth. Closure linkage present but not decisive—setting persists rather than transforms. Swappability moderate: "cliff garden" or "terraced overlook" could replace with edits. Cost not tied to setting features (height, water, stone) but to acts performed there. All gates met; lyric reprise reweights slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "upon the hush of budding hope" appears in opening (paragraph 2) and echoed in closure mood (paragraph 44: "radiant hush settled like dew"). Setup present but vague—dawn is mentioned, but no clock or urgency tied to the time window. No middle beat where time pressure narrows options. Closure participation weak: the hush returns as tone, not temporal constraint. The phrase reads as atmospheric marker rather than stake-shaping deadline. Swappability high: "at first light" or "in spring's quiet" would serve similarly. Gates: setup yes, development no, closure mood-only. Cap at 3.4 for missing development. Label-only use in closure; apply −0.3. Ornamental; apply −0.5 within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to preserve the color of wonder" introduced early (paragraph 9: charge from the women), drives the pruning to restore color (paragraph 16), the gathering of light to offer the Gray (paragraph 28), and anchors the closure teaching (paragraph 47: "We tended color like language, and the valley spoke hope"). Four beats. Causal pressure: the charge steadies the pruner and shapes every major choice (pruning, offering, planting, teaching). Closure linkage strong: the valley speaking hope fulfills the preservation goal. Cost visible: constant tending, choosing succor over strike, teaching rather than solitary mastery. Friction: the goal is asserted more than conflicted—no on-page moment where wonder competes with another want. Irreplaceability high: "color of wonder" is semantically precise. All gates met.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone "radiant hush" appears in opening (paragraph 2), recurs mid-story (paragraph 11: pall of Gray contrasts the hush), and closes the piece (paragraph 44: "radiant hush settled like dew, and the orchard held its breath without fear"). Lyric reprise reweights: initial hush is vulnerable, final hush is secured. Setup and closure gates strong. Development participation weak—mid-story the tone shifts to threat (Gray dulls, waterfall forgets glitter) without modulating the hush itself. Causal pressure low: tone colors mood but does not constrain choices. Closure linkage present: the return of hush without fear marks transformation. Swappability moderate: "luminous stillness" or "glowing quiet" could substitute. Gates: setup yes, development partial (contrast only), closure yes. Two-of-three allows ~6.0; lyric reprise adds +0.3.</comment>
