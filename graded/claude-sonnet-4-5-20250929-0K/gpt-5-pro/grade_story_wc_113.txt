<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The musician's interiority is concrete and specific—rosin powder on margins, the physical weight of the program—with motivation clearly rooted in anxiety channeled through listening. The decision to disrupt rehearsal with a "harsh harmonic" is earned by prior beats and forecloses the path of passive observation with visible cost (professional exposure). Internal contradiction operates subtly: the protagonist trusts a ghost more than colleagues, yet cannot articulate why. Minor slip: the ghost's teaching method (watermarks into letters) feels slightly convenient, though the protagonist's interpretive leap remains grounded in musical thinking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the musician accepts the ghost's wordless collaboration and the impossible knowledge it confers, foreclosing rational explanation. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (water, lanterns, stains) and pattern (the ghost's prior rumor, tonight's images, the final silence)—and holds through the ending's resonant image of tuning "in between spaces." Causality is clean: the program's code prompts the disruptive note, which triggers evacuation before the bracket cracks. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist shifts from passive listener to active interpreter. The cost is conceptual and relational: tomorrow they "pretend nothing spoke to us," a chosen silence that isolates the protagonist's knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded pit with flickering lanterns constrains every choice—standing in water, program damp at corners, the visual code legible only by angled light. Spatial choreography is precise: pit, stage, mezzanine, north exit, and the cracked cornice all track cleanly. The antique program functions as micro-setting, its physical state (damp, soft as fabric, warm against chest) charging the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects the musician's priorities: varnish smell, rope, rosin powder, bow hair—all filtered through professional attention. The setting actively shapes the climax: lantern angle reveals the fracture diagram, and the north exit's position becomes tactically urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prevent disaster through wordless interpretation under time pressure. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: from passive listening to active code-reading to the disruptive harmonic that realigns the theater. One meaningful tightening occurs when the conductor lifts his baton and "the room leaned toward obedience"—the window for intervention closes to a single beat. The harsh harmonic is a high-cost choice (professional credibility, visible to all) that narrows options and forces the crowd's movement. The resolution is earned by prior causality: the ghost's images teach, the musician translates, the action saves. The cost is legible on-page: isolation in knowledge, the program's warmth a small animal secret, and tomorrow's pretense.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "in between spaces we keep tuning, not notes, not silence, but the merest breath that allows both." The ghost is not explained but embodied as a collaborative presence in musical rests and water-stained images. The final image—stains losing edges, settling into pale bruises, the code not needing to be read twice—offers a non-literal answer: some knowledge is single-use, some collaborations wordless. Subtext operates in the protagonist's refusal to "tell someone" because "language seemed as clumsy as wet wood." No thematic echo or moralizing; the closing line "pretend nothing spoke to us" carries ambiguity (denial or discretion) without resolving it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: musical metaphors (fermatas, harmonics, unstruck chords), technical vocabulary (rosin, bow hair, viola case), and a bias toward listening over speaking. Distance is controlled—narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows, with inference marked as such ("I preferred to think"). Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure: "consummately placed," "mirrored mine," "shallow water and unspoken gratitude." Minor slip: "lately inspired by an anxiety I could not play away" edges toward diagnostic phrasing, though it's brief and recovers quickly into embodied action. No head-hopping; the ghost's interiority is never claimed, only her effects.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"indecisive fireflies," "language seemed as clumsy as wet wood," "a single wrong sound, consummately placed, can realign a theater"—and occasionally competes for attention in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. The phrase "amid the hush of unstruck chords" recurs as bookend framing, which charges the closure but also reads slightly ornamental. Information density is strong: most lines do double work (sensory + stakes, or action + interiority). No loops or synonym churn. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final image lands cleanly. The overwriting remains just within tolerance because the voice is consistent and the closure image is not obscured, but sustained metaphor in the mezzanine-crack sequence ("surged," "took the crowd like a lung") begins to feel effortful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost-as-collaborator premise transforms the haunted-opera trope through musical specificity: she "tuned the spaces between planks" and "thought in music but printed in water." The watermark-code mechanism is inventive and grounded in the physical program. The protagonist's choice—disrupting rehearsal with a "harsh harmonic"—is a fresh synthesis of musician expertise and supernatural interpretation. Risk-taking (wordless communication, the ghost never appearing, tomorrow's denial) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor hedge: the drowned soprano backstory (rats waltzing, singing beneath boards) leans toward quirky ornament and isn't strictly necessary for the climax to function, though it does prime the ghost's method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The musician's professional skill (reading codes through rosin powder, interpreting stains as diagrams, deploying a precise disruptive harmonic) drives two key beats: decoding the program and realigning the theater. Present in setup (pit musician), middle (code-reading), and closure (holding the program to chest, waiting in gratitude). The choice to play the wrong note narrows options and exposes the protagonist professionally. Causal pressure is clear: without this exact skillset, the code remains unread and the evacuation doesn't happen. Cost is visible: professional risk and enforced silence afterward.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The antique opera program is handled across three beats: lifted from trunk (damp, soft), angled toward lantern to reveal diagrams, and held to chest as it warms "like a small animal" before losing its edges at the end. Its physical evolution (damp → warm → pale bruises) tracks the ghost's presence and withdrawal. The program's mechanics (watermarks forming letters and diagrams) enable the protagonist's key choice. Without this exact object, the code doesn't exist and the evacuation doesn't happen. The final image—stains settling, not needing to be read twice—charges closure with visible cost: the knowledge was ephemeral, single-use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"In between spaces" shapes stakes and tactics directly: the protagonist listens "during long fermatas," interprets codes "in between spaces," and the ghost "lives" in "the merest breath that allows both" notes and silence. The concept constrains the protagonist's method (listening rather than speaking, interpreting rests rather than pitches) and charges the final image: tuning the breath between sound and silence. It's not merely thematic but operational—the ghost communicates through what isn't played. Without this exact framing, the mechanics of ghostly code and the protagonist's mode of attention lose coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears in setup and motivates the protagonist's heightened listening during fermatas. It enables the choice to trust the ghost's images rather than dismiss them, but the trait itself doesn't visibly constrain a later action with felt cost—the anxiety it names does. The phrase recurs at closure ("a lately inspired musician can listen long enough to answer"), reweighting the opening frame, but the attribute functions more as thematic accent than tactical lever. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "anxious" or "attentive" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The disruptive harmonic is the story's hinge: it halts the downbeat, freezes stagehands, prompts the house manager's shout, and opens the window for evacuation before the bracket cracks. Setup (the need to interrupt without revealing panic), execution (the harsh note "sliced the air like cracked glass"), and payoff (crowd exits, mezzanine groans) are all on-page. The action is irreplaceable—no other move could realign the theater without violating the "wordless" constraint or the protagonist's professional identity. Cost is visible: professional exposure and isolation in knowledge. Major turns trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is signaled early (program "damp at the corners," stains "bruised the pages into maps") and its mechanics matter: blotches form "wings and stairwells," rosin powder links watermarks into letters, lantern angle reveals a balcony diagram. The method enables two key beats: reading "do not wait for the baton" and "mezzanine fails at first note, open the north exit." Without this exact means, the ghost cannot communicate and the protagonist has no actionable intelligence. The images' final dissolution ("stains lose their edges") confirms the method's ephemeral cost. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns constrains every choice: standing in calf-deep water, program damp, code visible only by angled lantern light, evacuation routes determined by "flooded corridors." The lanterns' instability creates urgency (they "died" after the tremor, replaced by moonlight). The north exit's position and the mezzanine's structural weakness are both setting-driven and drive the climax. Micro-setting (the pit, the program as handled object) functions as both resource and constraint. The setting actively shapes tactics and charges the final image (shallow water, unspoken gratitude). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "amid the hush of unstruck chords" brackets the story and defines the window of intervention: after the conductor arrives, before the downbeat. The phrase recurs at the moment of action ("Before the downbeat, amid the hush of unstruck chords, I played..."), tightening the decision to a single beat. The time constraint is legible and creates urgency, though it's more atmospheric than clock-driven (no countdown). The final image loops back to the phrase thematically, charging it with new weight: the hush now includes the ghost's silence and tomorrow's pretense. Strong but not indispensable—other time frames could work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel the ghost's code is dramatized through action: tracing margins with rosin, angling the program toward light, interpreting blotches as diagrams. Internal friction appears when the protagonist must choose between revealing panic (language) and trusting wordless disruption. The desire faces visible cost: professional exposure and isolation. Setup (listening during fermatas), development (code-reading under pressure), and payoff (the disruptive note) are all on-page. The motivation drives two major beats and is tied to the protagonist's identity as musician. Strong causal pressure, though slightly softened by the ghost's cooperative clarity—more puzzle than true conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Wordless conversation operates as method and tone: the ghost answers "in ripples," teaches through water-stained images, and her final silence "mirrored mine and steadied my hands." The tone is coherent through setup (breathing carefully, holding notes "at the lip of breath"), escalation (the harsh harmonic as non-verbal communication), and closure (the stains lose edges, "did not need to be read twice"). It modulates with pressure—quiet listening becomes urgent interpretation becomes resonant silence. The tone charges the final image: tomorrow's pretense is itself wordless complicity. Integral to every beat and inseparable from the story's logic.</comment>
