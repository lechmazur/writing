<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is present—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—but remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The operator is described through borrowed traits and mythic claims ("eyes, full of lucid turbulence") without on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final exchange ("He returned my laugh, and I returned a tenderness") gestures at change but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized through specific foreclosed options. Emotional progression relies on poetic summary instead of micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early: pattern of vanishing stars, printing sessions, borrowed traits. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when coalesce only after ~150 words—but the disorientation is taught as part of the "deliberate ambiguity" concept, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (transposed empathy enacted, both characters breathe cleaner), but the cost remains asserted via metaphor ("scratch on him," "shearing") rather than a pointed on-page forfeiture or visible constraint that alters later tactics. One meaningful deepening is present (the lever drops, senses shear) but the final image ("proof hung like a small constellation") recapitulates theme without legible price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars anchor the setting and recur across beats. The fragment is handled twice (held in palm, left on press) and the stars provide a ticking clock. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—characters move through the space without spatial friction, and the press mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical. The piece meets the micro-setting allowance but does not reach the 9+ gate because no environmental detail forces a trade-off or charges the final image with constraint-based cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "understand the mathematics of emotion." One tightening occurs when the operator sets "the line that will not lie" and the lever drops, forcing the transposed empathy moment. However, agency is diffuse—the narrator holds the fragment and counts, but the operator drives the action. The cost ("spikes with initials we dared not say aloud," shoulders drop, hands stop shaking) is told via summary rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows later options. The piece meets the lens-appropriate escalation requirement but misses higher bands due to protagonist passivity and summarized consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as measurable force, disorientating ambiguity as healing—emerges from action and image (vanishing stars, borrowed traits, transposed pronouns) without direct thesis statements until the final third. The theorem in small caps ("feeling becomes calculable only when shared") edges toward moralizing but is framed as the operator's voice, mitigating the intrusion. The ending offers a resonant answer (the proof as constellation, breathing cleaner) but leans on poetic assertion rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior particulars with undeniable pressure. Strong subtext in gesture and object use, but the final paragraph's "they could disorient for healing when read carefully enough" skirts explicit thematic echo, costing ~0.3 in Q5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person singular POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is lyric and metaphor-dense ("night hinged like a press bed," "lucid turbulence"), creating a distinct texture. However, the elevated register is consistent throughout—no modulation under peak pressure, which flattens the sense of escalation. Dialogue is minimal and effective ("Hold this… count the gap"). The piece teaches its compression pattern early, so the density is acceptable under the experimental allowance. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("derivative at that moment," "function from longing to relief") that reads as external vocabulary rather than the narrator's idiom under stress, costing eligibility for high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught payoff at closure, triggering overwriting deductions (−0.5). Multiple paraphrase loops: "vanishing stars" recurs decoratively across eight beats without evolving function; "transposed empathy" is restated in varied metaphors (chord, crossing, swapping of bearings) within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "He said… He called… He placed… He wrote…" and "We worked… We tested… We kept… We left…" for six consecutive sentence openers in the middle third (−0.6). Line-level clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate the core concept (empathy as math) without advancing situation or choice. The artifacts do not obscure the closure image but pervade the supporting moves, capping the score and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft, borrowed personalities, and emotional calculus as cartography is specific and non-obvious. However, the core framing—"mathematics of emotion," ambiguity as therapeutic device—closely follows prompt-response templates for experimental empathy narratives. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform it through lived occupational detail (press operation remains atmospheric) or a non-obvious moral calculus (the resolution affirms the premise without friction). The vanishing stars and halo fragment add freshness, but the emotional arc (isolation → transposed connection → relief) follows a familiar template without bold risk that redefines stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present by paragraph four (Setup ✓). The operator adjusts rollers, sets type, borrows traits, and arranges the final line that triggers transposition (Development ✓, Payoff ✓). However, most actions are atmospheric or habitual; the only distinct causal turn is setting "the line that will not lie," which is told rather than shown through specific type choices. The narrator describes the operator's methods but does not dramatize decisions that alter tactics under pressure. Score guided by functional presence across gates but low causal specificity and swappability (another mystical craftsperson could serve the same role with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early as "washer and lens" on the chase (Setup ✓). Handled twice: placed in narrator's palm to "ground" during the climax (Development ✓) and left on the press as a "hinge to hold the world open" (Payoff ✓). The fragment's properties (cool, grounding, cathedral origin) are described but its mechanical function—how it "holds the forme steady" or grounds the narrator—remains abstract. The object's return at closure ("left… as if it were a hinge") reweights its meaning slightly but does not constrain the transposition action or carry visible cost tied to its use. Score reflects all three gates met with modest causal pressure and closure linkage, but lacks irreplaceability (another talismanic object could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Defined midway ("transposed empathy, the swapping of bearings") and enacted in the climax beat when "our senses sheared" (Development ✓, Payoff ✓). The concept shapes the dominant stake and final image. However, its mechanics—how ambiguity triggers empathy transfer—are told via summary ("the mind loosened its borders") rather than shown through specific on-page actions that alter tactics. The concept is integral to theme but its presence in earlier beats is expository rather than pressure-generating. Score reflects late explicit arrival (~40% mark) and summary-only execution of the transposition, capping at 4.6 per late-introduction rule, lifted slightly by closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Introduced early: "He habitually borrows personalities… a single self prints a narrow proof" (Setup ✓). Demonstrated twice: borrowing the narrator's laugh ("I felt the emptiness," strangers trusted him—Development ✓) and returning it at the end (Payoff ✓). The trait enables the operator's empathy practice and constrains him ("each time… the lack left a scratch"), showing visible cost. However, the cost is told via metaphor rather than a specific on-page action that narrows options or changes tactics. The trait is essential to the premise but its effects are described rather than dramatized in distinct beats. Score reflects all gates met with modest causal pressure and stated cost, but limited irreplaceability (a similar empathic gift could serve).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The action is method and theme, woven throughout: operator uses "deliberate ambiguity" to loosen readers' borders; "palimpsests of pronouns" and blurred subjects enable transposition (Development ✓); the final line "spelled neither you nor I, but a third grammar" (Payoff ✓). However, no Setup beat before the 25% mark explicitly names or demonstrates disorientation as tactic. The action shapes multiple beats but is told via summary ("If a client read a line where the subject blurred") rather than shown through specific typesetting choices that the reader experiences. The disorientation is central to the concept but its execution remains abstract, and its mechanics could be swapped for another cognitive intervention (hypnotic rhythm, mirrored syntax). Score reflects strong thematic presence and closure linkage, capped by late explicit signal and ornamental/summary treatment in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Named at ~30% ("deliberate ambiguity") as the operator's tool, with mechanics explained: "so the mind loosened its borders" (Setup marginal). Applied in the climax: "a third grammar, built to pivot us into a common axis" (Payoff ✓). The method is central to the concept but its workings are told rather than shown—no specific ambiguous phrase is printed and tested on the page. The method shapes one turn (the lever drop and transposition) but does not constrain earlier tactics or appear in multiple distinct beats with different outcomes. Score reflects one beat of causal involvement and closure presence, reduced by late signal, summary-only demonstration, and swappability (other rhetorical or typographic tricks could achieve similar effects).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Named in the opening line ("Topaz workshop under stars") and revisited in the close ("Under the Topaz panes, the press idled")—Setup ✓, Payoff ✓. The workshop houses the press, stars provide the vanishing clock, and the space contains all action. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric container. The "rafters," "chase," and "tympan" are mentioned but not used tactically. The space is specific (Topaz, under stars, letterpress tools) but replaceable (another artisan's studio would work with minor edits). Score reflects lyric Setup → Payoff reprise and specificity, but lacks causal pressure or choice-shaping function, capping below 6.0 per the micro-setting rule.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Introduced early: "between vanishing stars," "measuring the hush that followed each fainting light" (Setup ✓). The timeframe recurs as a pressure device: "We logged each print with star intervals," "the vanishings quickened, the gaps tightening until our window… felt like a held breath" (Development ✓), and the final line: "the space between vanishing stars felt briefly ours to measure and to love" (Payoff ✓). However, the clock does not force a specific on-page trade-off or deadline that alters tactics—characters continue printing without visible time constraint binding a choice. The timeframe charges the atmosphere and final image but remains metaphorical rather than operational. Score reflects all gates met, thematic resonance, and closure linkage, but lacks concrete pressure that narrows options or costs time in a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stated early: "That was why I apprenticed here, to understand the mathematics of emotion" (Setup ✓). The motivation drives the narrator's presence and frames the entire narrative. However, it is never dramatized in conflicting micro-choices—no moment where understanding is weighed against another want or fear on the page. The narrator remains passive observer; the operator drives all action. At closure, the narrator reports relief ("the print stopped my hands from shaking") but does not make a decision that costs something to achieve understanding. The motivation shapes the frame but is not tested under pressure with visible friction. Score reflects early signal, frame coherence, and closure callback (understanding achieved), capped by told-only presence and lack of on-page conflict between desire and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tone—precise yet dreamlike, technical metaphor meeting cosmic scale—is established in the opening ("night hinged like a press bed," "lucid turbulence") and sustained throughout without lapses. The tone charges the final image ("the proof hung like a small constellation") and modulates subtly at the transposition beat ("our senses sheared"). However, the tone remains uniform across beats; no shift in cadence or register marks escalation or release. The piece demonstrates strong coherence and a distinct voice that supports the concept, but the static mood and lack of tonal escalation under pressure place it mid-band. Score reflects Setup ✓, consistency, and Payoff ✓, elevated by the tone's clear service to theme and closure, but capped by lack of purposeful modulation that would deepen pressure or charge the final turn.</comment>
