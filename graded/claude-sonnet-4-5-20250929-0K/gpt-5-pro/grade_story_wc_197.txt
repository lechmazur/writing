<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jessa is motivated by a clear vow ("hold the line against the tyranny of indifference") and acts resourcefully throughout—fitting the key, bridging wires, jamming the relay—with visible physical stakes. However, her interiority remains abstract and label-driven: "carefully resourceful" and "stubborn custodians" are asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-hesitations under pressure. The contact's rescue and the crowd's witness feel convenient rather than earned by Jessa's prior tactical trade-offs, and no meaningful internal cost or foreclosed path registers on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation (Jessa, lagoon, dusk) within the first third and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: the relay, puddle-map, key, and auric lagoon recur and intensify until the final flare reweights the erased names with witness. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the lagoon mirroring the deleted faces constitutes undeniable social cost and reframes the State's revision project. The causality is loose (squads recover quickly, crowds arrive on cue), but under the Accumulative lens that is acceptable; the cost is legible in "breaking the squads with witness" and Jessa's renewed vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The auric lagoon, maintenance tunnels, puddle reflections, and the phone booth key all function as micro-settings that constrain Jessa's route and enable tactics (hatch descent, wire-bridging, floodlight disruption). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"starlight dripped through grates, striping cables with celestial bars"—and the final image charges the lagoon with thematic weight. Spatial choreography remains clear across the culvert, reeds, and relay chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keeping the memory node breathing and retrieving the contact—is signaled early and tightens when Jessa finds him bound in the culvert. Her actions (key turn, wire-bridge, relay jam) narrow options and escalate pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens. The squads' recovery and the crowd's arrival feel coincidental rather than forced by Jessa's prior choices, limiting agency credit, but the visible cost (exposing the relay, seeding truth "like cattail fluff") is legible and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory, witness, and resistance to erasure—emerges organically from Jessa's relay work and the lagoon's final flare. The closing image ("you do not repair the pattern; you teach the threads a new way to touch") reweights the premise without moralizing, and the State's "revision squads" ground the conceptual stakes in concrete action. Subtext operates in puddle-maps, the key's "chiming" teeth, and the squads' inability to "arrest light," avoiding direct thesis statements until the final reflection, which borders on explicit but remains grounded in prior imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Jessa with a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature (coded freedom, auric glow, "puddle reflections at dusk"). Diction is elevated and patterned—"advertisements peeled like molting snakes," "starlight dripped through grates"—which suits the Accumulative mode. However, the contact's dialogue ("I am in the culvert beyond the lagoon, where the revision squads are cutting us from the records") reads expository rather than urgent, and the final paragraph's meta-reflection ("you do not repair the pattern; you teach the threads a new way to touch") shifts toward authorial stance, loosening distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and imagistic—"auric lagoon," "advertisements peeled like molting snakes," "starlight dripped through grates"—with strong rhythmic variety. However, density overload in peak beats (the relay chamber, the lagoon flare) layers metaphor without always advancing action: "the auric water flared, and for a breath the lagoon mirrored not the stars but the erased" is evocative but syntactically dense when clarity would sharpen momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("a map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk" recurs twice; "coded freedom" appears three times without functional shift). Minor filter-verb stacks ("watched," "felt," "studied") and template cadence in the middle third ("She knelt... She fitted... She moved") reduce propulsion, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of near-future resistance, archaic infrastructure (phone booth key, ceramic relay), and the puddle-map/lagoon-as-witness motif feels specific and non-obvious. The State's revision squads and the auric lagoon's memory-mirror offer fresh angles on erasure narratives, and the closing line ("you teach the threads a new way to touch") transforms the premise with lived detail. However, the underdog-rebel-versus-authoritarian-regime frame remains familiar, and the squads' halting at the lagoon's flare leans toward symbolic convenience rather than irreversible tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jessa is present throughout and makes key decisions: following the puddle-map, unlocking the hatch, bridging wires, jamming the relay. Her resourcefulness is demonstrated (not merely labeled) in at least three beats. The story hinges on her agency, satisfying setup, development, and payoff. However, the "underestimated" aspect is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows others undervaluing her or her proving them wrong with visible cost. Swapping her for a generic "resourceful operative" would not fundamentally alter the logic, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears in the pocket (early signal), unlocks the hatch (beat one), and is jammed into the relay's grounding plate to spill the grid's music (beat two, closure-adjacent). Its "worn teeth" that "chimed when she walked" provide specificity, and the final use—bridging and then hiding the key "beneath a panel that only rain would find"—charges the object with cost and closure participation. Removing it would break the hatch-access and relay-disruption logic. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Revised histories frame the stakes from the opening ("The State would revise the histories soon, wiping whole towns from textbooks") and drive Jessa's mission to "keep a memory node breathing." The squads "cutting us from the records" and the lagoon's flare returning "what had been deleted" demonstrate the concept shaping on-page tactics and the final image. The conceptual cost—witness breaking the squads, truth "seeded like cattail fluff"—is undeniable. Removing this element would collapse the story's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is asserted twice ("Jessa moved like someone carefully resourceful") and demonstrated in her selective tool use (key, wires, pocket notebook). However, the trait does not force a visible trade-off or constrain a choice with felt cost—she succeeds at each task without sacrificing an alternative or revealing the price of caution. The attribute is functional but could be replaced with "skilled" or "precise" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reappear" governs the mission: Jessa must make the contact "reappear, alive or archived" to prevent network fracture. She finds him bound, helps him "reappear at the hatch," and together they inject memory into the relay, making the erased "reappear" in the lagoon's flare. The action shapes setup, middle rescue, and closure image; neighbors "recognized names, dates, tiny faces" constitutes the payoff. Swapping "reappear" for "retrieve" or "restore" would weaken the thematic echo but not collapse the logic, so irreplaceability is high but not absolute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The puddle-map is signaled early ("a map suggested by puddle reflections at dusk bent her route through alleys") and revisited at the lagoon ("In each, an upside-down sky inked a different angle, and together they offered a map"). It guides Jessa to the hatch, shaping her route and the final tactic (squads "fooled by a sky printed underfoot"). However, its mechanics remain impressionistic—how puddles encode directions is not demonstrated—and the method does not impose a cost or constraint beyond atmospheric guidance. Two gates (setup, development) are met; closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon anchors the climax: Jessa kneels by it to read puddles, descends beneath it via the hatch, and jams the relay to make the lagoon flare, mirroring the erased. The mineral-lit water functions as both setting and active resource, drawing the crowd and "breaking the squads with witness." The setting constrains Jessa's route (drainage canals, maintenance tunnels) and supplies the final image's charge. Removing the lagoon would collapse the story's spatial logic and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" opens and closes the story, framing urgency ("the hour," "at sundown," "tonight"). The timeframe compresses action into one continuous dusk-to-night window, and Jessa's race to retrieve the contact before the squads finish their work creates implicit pressure. However, no on-page clock or countdown tightens decisions—she completes each task in sequence without visible time cost or a narrowing window forcing trade-offs. The timeframe is coherent but does not escalate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Jessa's vow "to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is stated early and renewed in the final paragraph, framing her mission. Her choice to "keep a memory node breathing" rather than "win a war" dramatizes the motivation, and her willingness to expose the relay (risking the network) to seed truth on the page demonstrates friction between safety and witness. The motivation drives setup, middle rescue, and closure action. Felt cost (exposing the relay, slipping back into the tunnel as "stubborn custodians") is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears three times as a recurring phrase and governs the story's atmosphere: Jessa broadcasts a tone "of coded freedom," messages unfold "with coded freedom," and the city hums with it. The tone modulates from watchful (opening) to urgent (rescue) to resonant (lagoon flare), and the final image—light that cannot be arrested—charges the concept. However, the phrase itself is abstract and relies on repetition rather than tonal shifts in diction or rhythm to embody the concept. Coherent but not fully integrated into line-level texture.</comment>
