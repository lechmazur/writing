<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is concrete and particular ("featherly determined," grain-reading as inheritance), and micro-choices—holding the logbook to light, stepping through the frame—embody stakes without therapy-speak. The argument memory and the realization "he chose the day of fog" ground the father relationship in contradictory impulses (anger, stubborn love, grief). Emotional progression is realistic, layering memory with present perception. Minor slip: the final epiphany about attention and distance skirts abstraction but remains anchored in the desk creak and open frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (architect's child), where (terrace/workshop), and when (after his vanishing) within the opening third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): crossing the threshold reweights the maze-letter and fog-departure into a legacy of necessary distances, with visible cost—the protagonist leaves the frame open, accepts the seams in the hush, and boards the drifting terrace alone. One meaningful deepening: the logbook-to-grain revelation narrows options from searching for the man to inheriting his method. Cost is legible in "stubborn with love" and the mended-but-seamed hush. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terrace's drifting prism motif recurs purposefully: light scatters in the opening, passes through logbook holes mid-story to align map codes, and settles at closure to resolve the maze-letter. The wooden desk grain becomes micro-setting, constraining the discovery method (vortex rings, compass knots) and charging the final creak "like a wing spar." The cedar frame threshold is worn where hands rubbed it, a tactile anchor that the protagonist crosses with embodied cost. Environment directly enables the central revelation and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering why thresholds feel sacred, signaled early and pursued through concrete investigation (logbook, grain analysis, frame crossing). One meaningful tightening: the convergence of fog code and ear-shaped knot narrows the search to the Mouth of Return frame. Agency is decision and attention—matching codes, breathing until pulse steadies, stepping through—with visible cost (accepting the father's chosen distance, leaving the frame open, mending the hush with seams intact). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through image density and cadence shift. No antagonist required; coincidence (finding the logbook) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: necessary distances are embodied in maze aisles, glide slopes, ajar doors, and fog as "meeting distance." The cedar frame's worn grain and the protagonist's pulse-steadying concretize the abstract question without stating a moral. The maze-letter closure ("initial of our town, his name, path that circles back") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material—the father left to place the threshold, not escape. "Sacredness is not magic, it is attention stretched across necessary distances" skirts thematic echo but is earned by prior grain-reading and fog logic. Minor slip: the articulation is slightly too neat, but the final image (creaking desk, open frame, drifting terrace) restores embodied resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("featherly determined," "green forgetfulness"), metaphor density (wood grain as river, vortex rings, compass roses), and perceptual filter (architect's child reading codes in textures). Psychic distance is stable; interiority is concrete ("stubborn with love," pulse steadying). The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the frame crossing, longer syntactic arcs during reflection. Minor density concern: figurative language appears in most sentences, approaching saturation, but the pattern is taught early (prism, fractured hush) and the voice remains coherent. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful compression: "wood remembers direction better than ink," "dust and weather" as memory anchors, "runway of wood" uniting pilot/carpenter motifs. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates (short declaratives at threshold, longer arcs in reflection). Minor overwriting: figurative language in most lines ("river where currents still run," "wet wing under cloud," "soft airport of the desk") approaches saturation without clear pattern-teaching payoff at closure. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. One small register drift: "Resonant Reconfiguration" sensibility in "attention stretched across necessary distances" is slightly elevated but voice-recoverable. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of pilot logbook + wood grain + prism light as a tri-modal map is specific and non-obvious, arising from the architect's dual craft (crop-duster/maze-builder). The fog-as-meeting-distance logic transforms the vanishing-parent trope into a threshold gift rather than abandonment. The maze-letter revelation (town/name/path initials) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: lyric density and compression without a traditional antagonist or dialogue could obscure, but the piece commits fully and the closure effect remains legible. The "necessary distances" frame is not wholly fresh but is particularized through grain-reading and weather codes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The architect's lost child is the protagonist POV throughout, driving every beat: finding the logbook (setup), analyzing grain to decode the map (development), crossing the cedar frame and reading the maze-letter (closure). Choices—matching codes, breathing to steady pulse, stepping through, leaving the frame open—directly alter tactics and understanding. Cost is visible: accepting the father's chosen distance, mending the hush with seams. The character is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pilot logbook weather code appears in three distinct beats: found beneath false drawer bottom (setup, ~25%), held to afternoon light to reveal margin-hole map (mid-development, ~50%), and lies open as "soft airport of the desk" during frame crossing (closure, ~85%). Its mechanics (fog/haze codes, dew notes) narrow the search to the Mouth of Return. The logbook's final state (open, codes folded to numerals) charges the closure. Specific properties (margin holes, weather prayers) are irreplaceable; a generic map would not unite pilot and architect motifs or enable the prism-grain convergence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" shapes stakes from the opening question ("why some thresholds feel sacred, what distances must be kept") and structures all tactics: maze aisles as measured space, glide slopes, rooms with ajar doors, fog as meeting distance. The concept directly constrains the frame-crossing choice—"some distances are necessary...to let us meet truly"—and charges the closure realization that the father placed the threshold at meeting distance. It reweights the abandonment into a gift. Not merely thematic echo; the concept alters interpretation and forecloses the grief-only reading.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears once in the opening third ("featherly determined to discover"), establishing voice texture and framing the search as light/delicate yet resolute. It does not recur or constrain a later choice; the determination is shown through grain-analysis and frame-crossing actions, but those beats do not invoke the specific "featherly" quality. Functional setup that colors voice but remains swappable with "quietly determined" or "persistently." Mid-band: present, voice-consistent, but not causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Intuit" is the core method: the father "trusting I would intuit the signal only when ready" (setup, ~35%), and the protagonist matches codes by intuition rather than instruction (development, ~60%). The frame-crossing is an intuitive leap—"I understand he chose the day of fog"—that completes the discovery (closure, ~80%). Removing intuition would break the inheritance logic; a purely mechanical decode would not honor the father's pedagogy or the protagonist's "featherly determined" stance. The action is specific and causally central, though not unique to this plot type.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Analyzing wood grain is introduced early ("wood remembers direction better than ink," ~20%) and structures two major beats: identifying swirls as vortex rings, knots as compass roses, scratches as flight paths (~40%), then aligning logbook holes with grain under prism light to decode the map (~55%). The method enables the Mouth of Return discovery and charges the final desk creak "like a wing spar" (~90%). Mechanics matter: without grain-reading, the logbook alone would not converge into a spatial answer. The method is specific (not generic "map reading") and irreplaceable within the pilot-carpenter synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace recurs across five beats: opening atmosphere (scattering light into shards), mid-story prism light passing through logbook holes to align the map, terrace tilt during frame crossing, prisms settling at closure, and final "drifting toward evening with me aboard." It provides the light-mechanics for the grain-map convergence (causal) and charges the ending image (closure participation). The "drifting" quality mirrors the protagonist's unmoored state and the father's vanishing. Minor penalty: early mentions are atmospheric; causal use concentrates mid-story. Strong closure linkage elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" is named in the opening third and frames causality ("tiny choices had already tilted the world"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The phrase is thematic rather than tactical; no live clock alters moves, and the protagonist's investigation proceeds without time pressure. The "one season he vanished" anchors backstory, but present-tense action is untimed. Functional as conceptual frame, replaceable as temporal constraint. Mid-low: present in setup, shapes theme, but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some thresholds feel sacred" is declared in the opening question (~10%) and dramatized through every investigative choice: finding the logbook, analyzing grain, matching codes, and crossing the cedar frame. Friction between want (understanding the father's disappearance) and cost (accepting he left to create the threshold, not to escape) charges the frame-crossing beat. The realization "he chose the day of fog...not to escape me, but to place the threshold" reweights the grief into inheritance with visible cost—leaving the frame open, mending the hush with seams. Desire is embodied, conflicted, and resolved with price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is introduced in the opening ("everything breathed a fractured hush, as if sound had to navigate glass") and recurs at the threshold crossing ("the hush fractures further, each shard a memory") and closure ("the fractured hush mends slightly, but keeps its seams"). Tone modulates with pressure: quiet investigation, intensified fragmentation at the frame, partial mending that retains cost. The hush-as-navigable-glass image coheres across turns and charges the final image (seams remain, terrace drifts). Strong lyric control; the tone is not static but evolves to embody the cost of crossing.</comment>
