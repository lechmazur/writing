<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator carries a consistent perceptual signature—tasting the world through the ring—but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("luminous skeptic," "futuristic nostalgia") rather than embodied. Naira's micro-climate trait is vivid, yet her choices feel exposition-driven rather than pressure-tested; the child with fog is ornamental. The final walk home registers as a stated shift rather than one earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation with visible cost. Diagnostic note: the closure choice (walking home "tasting the future") lacks the felt weight of foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (bluff, aurora, narrator's dust-glow). The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—pollen votes, flavor-as-map—and holds it through the convergence and weather-release ritual. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the carriers spill their skies, the aurora writes it back, duties are set down, and the narrator walks home "tasting the future." Cost is conceptual (debt cleared, next promise pointed to) but remains oblique; the final image reweights the premise without a sharp before/after in the narrator's stance or options. The lens is coherent, but the reconfiguration's felt price is muted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora is vivid and signal-rich; the aurora "drinking star milk" and the kettle's private rain are sensorially specific. The tin ring functions as micro-setting, constraining perception (taste-as-direction) and charging the convergence beat when flavors "lock into place like gears." Spatial choreography at the crest is clear, and the forest-election frame (pollen, leaf angles, lichen counters) feels purposeful. The aurora swallows and rewrites weather, directly enabling the closure image; environment shapes the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why people carry weather—is signaled early and pursued through tasting and conversation. The convergence at the crest tightens options (flavors turn saline, ring requests spilling), and the carriers' release narrows the ritual to completion. Agency at closure is collective (Naira opens hands, child breathes fog) rather than a choice by the protagonist that forecloses a live alternative; the narrator observes and tastes but does not alter tactics under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (the emergent compass "clicks" and duties are set down), but the cost reads as ambient relief rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as duty, the planet's need for legs—emerges through the carriers' weather and the forest vote rather than assertion. The tin ring's flavor-map and the aurora's rewriting of released weather avoid overt moralizing. The final image ("walked home tasting the future") offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the narrator's question, reweighting the ring's function from navigation to promise-tracking. However, the answer feels gentle and affirming rather than shadowed by cost or ambiguity; the piece leans toward conceptual satisfaction without the friction that charges high-band thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is lush and consistent—"terrestrially cosmic river," "granulated sugar sticking to my tongue"—but the diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("emergent compass," "futuristic nostalgia") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. Naira's dialogue ("Weather is memory and duty") carries subtext and advances understanding. POV distance is stable; the narrator's taste-based perception is selective and singular. However, the prose sometimes substitutes metaphor density for clarity in peak beats (e.g., "emergent compass … arranging direction from countless tiny pulls"), and the final paragraph's articulation of the method feels more like a thesis statement than dramatized insight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("Earth's own spine drinking star milk," "fog of orphaned glaciers"), but clusters of adjacent metaphors in high-pressure beats risk muddle without adding propulsion. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography is clean. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "I tasted the air" recurs with slight variations, and "emergent compass" is restated in the final paragraph without new pressure. The closing lines shift into expository summary ("What I wanted to know had been there all along") that tells rather than shows the narrator's realization. No severe artifacts, but density occasionally trades clarity for texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—taste-as-cartography, forest elections, weather-carriers—is a fresh synthesis that feels internally consistent and purposeful. The tin ring that "never pointed north but always tasted alive" and the aurora as a terrestrial-cosmic teacher avoid stock fantasy tropes. The convergence ritual and the flavor-lock mechanic (mint/iron/honey gears) are specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyric, sensory-dense register heightens atmosphere without obscuring the central question. The emotional arc leans toward affirmation rather than moral complexity, but the conceptual world is memorable and the elements cohere without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "luminous skeptic" narrator observes, tastes, and listens but makes few choices that alter tactics. The decision to converge on the crest is prompted by the ring's flavor-map rather than the narrator's agency under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but observation dominates over choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tin compass ring is handled in the opening (inheritance, taste-teaching), middle (amplification, flavor shifts), and climax (pressed to tongue, map arrives, pours mint/iron/honey). It constrains perception throughout and charges the convergence beat when "flavors locked into place like gears." Its method (sensing through taste) drives the narrator's tracking and shapes the ending walk. Strong causal involvement across beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "emergent compass" concept is introduced early (world as direction-source), demonstrated in the middle (flavors as map), and invoked at closure ("a map writ by mouths and bluffs and ballots"). It shapes the narrator's method and reappears in the final image ("pointing … toward the next promise"). However, the concept mostly functions as thematic framing rather than a concrete constraint that narrows options or alters tactics under pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with lyric resonance; eligible for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" anchors the aurora's dual nature (Earth's spine, star milk) and recurs when the aurora swallows and rewrites weather. It labels the ritual's scale but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Present in setup and closure image, but mostly ornamental descriptor. Functional but replaceable with similar cosmic-earth phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Converge" is the action that organizes the climax: carriers promised to converge at the violet hinge, the narrator tastes the saline directive, and all move to the crest where the ritual completes. It drives the major turn (from waiting to spilling skies) and is indispensable to the closure. The action is causally prepared (taste changes signal timing) and shapes the ending image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—sensing through taste changes—is taught early (sweet/warm, sour/pressure, bitter/storm debt), demonstrated throughout (granulated sugar, wintergreen, citrus spark, saline), and pivotal at the climax when the ring "poured mint, iron, and honey" to request the spilling. It enables the narrator's tracking and is mechanically indispensable; removing it would break the story's perceptual logic. Signals early, constrains middle choices, charges closure. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora is vivid and frames the convergence ritual. The crest becomes the functional stage for the climax when the narrator tastes saline there ("salt binds storms"), and the aurora swallows weather at that location. The setting is present in setup, pressures the choice to converge, and participates in closure. It supplies the ritual's stage rather than merely backdrop, but does not constrain earlier tactics beyond providing the meeting point.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "while forests hold elections" is established early and recurs ("branches argue in creaks," "the counting settled"). It provides thematic context and ambient pressure, but does not function as a ticking clock that alters the narrator's moves. The election's closure (trees ease, counting settles) coincides with the weather release, offering conceptual parallel. Present in setup and ending, but mostly atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint. Two-gate lyric presence; mid-5s to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—to learn why people carry weather—is stated early, pursued through tasting and conversation with Naira, and answered at closure ("carrying weather was never punishment, only a bridge"). The narrator's question organizes the arc and receives a dramatized answer when the carriers spill their skies and duties lift. However, the motivation is not conflicted or tested by competing wants; it reads as intellectual curiosity satisfied rather than desire under friction. Present across beats and answered at closure, but lacks friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone—futuristic nostalgia—is coherent in diction ("nightstudy dust," "the old cartographers kept secret," "terrestrially cosmic river") and balances forward-looking imagery (emergent compass, aurora as teacher) with inherited artifacts (grandmother's tin ring, old methods). The tone modulates gently through waiting, convergence, and resolution without jarring shifts. It charges the final image ("tasting the future" while honoring the past), though the emotional register remains steady rather than dynamically shifting under pressure. Present and coherent, but static mood rather than one that escalates with stakes.</comment>
