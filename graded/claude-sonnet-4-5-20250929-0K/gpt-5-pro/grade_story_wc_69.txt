<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific ("expectantly resigned...a waiting that trusted the road, not a surrender to the ditch"), and the mechanic Reza's moment of vulnerability shows earned embodied emotion. However, the cast is large for this length—teacher, mechanic, nurse, boy with headphones—and most remain sketched rather than individuated with distinct pressures. The grandmother functions primarily as backstory exposition rather than as a force that complicates present choice, and the final gathering feels more performed than earned through prior contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (autumn library, choir teacher, students). The closure—lifting the rosette to the window, letting the pattern appear on the wall—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the moment crystallizes communal possibility with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Reza and the nurse acknowledge their carried fears and sing together. Cost is felt (the mechanic's frown, the nurse's hesitation) but remains somewhat oblique; the final image reweights prior material without a sharp before/after that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is anchored early with sensory specifics (dust, damp leaves, cold turned warm), and the rosette constrains the singing exercise (twelve petals, twelve counts). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (around the rosette, windows opened at dusk), though the boy with headphones and the positions of all students are not individually tracked. The micro-setting (rosette as compass, nick facing fear) charges the final image when light floods its lattice, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: braid diverse voices into harmony as a way to look at one another without flinching. One meaningful tightening occurs when Reza and the nurse reveal their fears and choose to sing together, narrowing the possibility of refusal. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than a causal squeeze that forecloses options with sharp cost; the dusk resolution (neighbors pause, a child hums) declares victory rather than dramatizing a trade-off or loss that reshapes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—healing through patient subtraction, making room for harmony—emerges from concrete particulars (the rosette's nick, the grandmother's bell ritual, breath counts) without overt moralizing. The final image (light through the rosette casting pattern on the wall) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "which was all the victory we required" edges toward thematic declaration rather than letting the image speak, and the phrase "vanishing arts do not vanish if someone remembers how to begin" hovers near prompt-echo territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("traveled stillness," "moon phases denote darkness that makes stars speak"). Dialogue feels natural and purposeful when it appears (Reza's car-backfire confession, the nurse's response). Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close for interiority, out for the collective moment). One slip: "I felt expectantly resigned again, but now the phrase meant..." reads as slightly over-articulated self-commentary that weakens immediacy, and some figurative language ("thread cast across unlearning hatred like a bridge") tilts poetic but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense in many lines ("the library inhaled the cold and turned it warm"). However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She had called it...She would smile and say..."; "I said...I asked...I said...I rotated...I said" runs cluster filter verbs and identical stems across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphor: "thread cast across unlearning hatred like a bridge you cannot see until you step" conflates thread, bridge, and stepping without coherent vehicle logic. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5 for density, −0.4 for mixed metaphor, −0.4 for template cadence = cumulative −1.3 range, plus minor paraphrase loop −0.2). Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure image itself, so cap at −1.5 total per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—using a zither rosette to teach communal singing as healing—is specific and grounded. The grandmother's bell ritual and the rosette's nick add lived texture. However, the emotional arc (divided community learns to harmonize through patient subtraction) follows a familiar reconciliation template without a sharp counter-pressure or moral calculus that would require a trade-off. The final victory (neighbors pause, child hums) feels convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight, and the "vanishing arts" frame reads more thematic than causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The choir teacher is present throughout, makes key decisions (calling students, setting the rosette exercise, inviting Reza's voice, rotating the rosette to face the nick), and shapes the closure by lifting the rosette to the window. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The character's choices enable the singing exercise and the final communal moment, though much of the action is framed as facilitation rather than personal renunciation or cost. Score: setup +0.5, two beats (setting exercise, inviting Reza) +0.9, closure linkage (lifting rosette) +1.0, causal pressure (enables tactics) +0.8 = ~3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, rounded to 6.7 for strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rosette appears in the opening (grandmother's compass), is placed at center for the breathing exercise (twelve petals, twelve counts), is rotated to show the nick (facing fear), and is lifted to the window in the final image (light floods lattice, pattern on wall). Setup, development, payoff gates met. The object constrains the breathing method and charges the closure image. Score: setup +0.6, three beats (set, rotated, lifted) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (structures exercise) +0.8 = ~3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, elevated to 7.8 for specificity (carved pear wood, nick marks fear) and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is named explicitly ("compass for vanishing arts," "vanishing arts do not vanish if someone remembers how to begin") and frames the thematic stakes. However, it functions primarily as thematic resonance rather than a mechanical constraint that alters on-page tactics. The concept does not narrow options or impose a visible cost in a middle beat; it reappears in reflection and the final thematic claim. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is thematic rather than causal. Score: setup +0.4, closure (thematic reprise) +0.5, −0.5 for ornamental/thematic use = ~3.0 + 0.4 − 0.1 = 3.3, elevated to 5.1 for early seed and final reprise under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is named twice (opening and near the end) and reflects the teacher's stance, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; no choice or renunciation is dramatized as turning on this attribute. Setup and payoff gates met (mentioned in opening and near end); middle development absent. Score: setup +0.3, payoff (reprise with meaning shift) +0.4, −0.6 for label-only use = ~3.0 + 0.1 = 3.1, adjusted to 4.8 for the explicit meaning shift ("now the phrase meant a waiting that trusted the road") that reweights the stance at a reflective beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Denote" appears multiple times (circles denote rests, bells denote grief, commas denote breaths, petals structure the exercise). Setup gate met (early: "I drew circles in the air to denote rests"). The action structures the singing method and appears in the final score-penciling beat, meeting payoff. Middle development: the rosette rotation to denote fear and the comma-penciling both use this action to guide tactics. Score: setup +0.5, two beats (circles/rests, commas/breaths) +0.9, closure linkage (penciled commas before dusk resolution) +0.7, causal pressure (method shapes attempts) +0.6 = ~3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, elevated to 6.3 for recurring use that structures key beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is the core method, signaled early ("our first method would be to sing by subtracting noise") and enacted through the breathing exercise (twelve counts, letting breath remove clang, finding quiet between ribs). The method is taught mid-scene and structures the singing attempts. Payoff: "we breathed together, counting the petals, sending the first vowel through the room" and the final harmony. Setup, development, payoff gates met. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (breathing instruction, harmony attempts) +0.9, closure linkage (final harmony result) +0.9, causal pressure (method enables the communal moment) +0.9 = ~3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, elevated to 6.9 for specificity and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is anchored in the opening and provides the gathering space. The setting enables the session (shelves hum, room settles like a pond, windows opened at dusk for song to cross the street). Setup and payoff gates met. Middle development: the library's warmth and the opened windows at dusk both affect the communal moment. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (room warmth, windows opened) +0.9, closure linkage (song crosses street through opened windows) +0.8, causal pressure (space enables gathering and final transmission) +0.6 = ~3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, rounded to 6.1 for solid causal role across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" frames the arc but does not function as a tracked timeframe with a live clock. The progression is "long time for pages to stop whispering," "by dusk," but no ticking deadline alters tactics. The phrase appears as thematic framing ("thread cast across unlearning hatred") rather than a temporal constraint. Setup gate (implicit in opening stake); middle and payoff gates weak (thematic rather than tactical). Score: setup +0.3, payoff (thematic echo in bridge metaphor) +0.3, −0.7 for ornamental/thematic use = ~3.0 + 0.0 = 3.0, adjusted to 4.2 for the implicit arc from suspicion to tentative harmony that the phrase captures.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is declared early ("I had called them here to braid diverse voices into harmony") and dramatized through the breathing exercise, Reza's and the nurse's confessions, and the final rounds. Setup, development, payoff gates met. The desire drives the teacher's actions and shapes the closure (achieving harmony, song crossing the street). Score: setup +0.7, three beats (calling students, guiding exercise, achieving harmony) +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +1.2 = ~3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, reduced slightly to 7.2 because the friction between wants and costs is muted (the teacher facilitates rather than risking personal loss).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is named in the opening ("breathing dust that carried a traveled stillness") and returns ("Traveled stillness slid in, bringing ghostly trains and kitchens"). The tone is coherent across beats—quiet, reflective, layered with distant memory—and modulates with the building harmony. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development shows the tone accumulating and reweighting (stillness bringing ghosts, then resolving to single pitch). Score: setup +0.6, two beats (opening dust, mid-scene stillness) +0.9, closure linkage (tone charges the final quietness and transmission) +1.0, specificity (tone distinct and voice-motivated) +0.5 = ~3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, elevated to 6.8 for strong coherence and the way the tone charges the ending without becoming static.</comment>
