<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell-ringer protagonist demonstrates consistent interiority through sensory particulars ("dust listens as if preparing to confess") and makes a hierarchy of values legible through the decision to let the child ring the warning bell. The character's trait of "powerfully gentle" is embodied in concrete action—striking with patience, arranging listening—rather than merely labeled. Minor slip: the director and priest of logistics remain functional foils without applying immediate pressure that forces a micro-choice with visible cost, lowering the relationship-as-crucible score slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The opening anchors who/where/when by line 2 ("laboratory of lost sounds," "prism-song bell ringer"). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph reweights the dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—through the image of neighbors trusting "the slow bell of each other" and the narrator's realization that "gentleness propels, and propulsion here is simply permission." Cost is conceptual and social: the artificial pilgrimage must "change with those who travel it, or else it hardens into scenery," foreclosing the path of a fixed ritual. The lens holds without contradiction; pattern accumulates through bell-tuning, lens use, and stations, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The laboratory setting and the miner's carbide lamp lens constrain multiple choices: the lens is positioned "before the bells so colors cut across their throats," directly enabling the harmonic effect that structures the pilgrimage. The lens returns at closure ("I lift it, and I let the mined glass pour a rim of light over their shoulders"), charging the final image with coal-memory and trust. Micro-setting qualifies: the lens, bells, and door are tactile anchors that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy is maintained through the POV's professional filter—color refraction, harmonic ripple, knock patterns translated into maps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection in a city bruised by outages—is signaled early and tightens through the pilgrimage's assembly: archive table, salvaged door, bell choices that guide feet. The protagonist's decision to let the child ring the warning bell narrows options (renouncing control) and the final paragraph's realization that "an artificial pilgrimage must change with those who travel it" forecloses the path of static ritual with conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via density increase (stations accumulate) and cadence shift (final reflection reweights the premise). One meaningful deepening is achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—connection has surfaces that yield only to careful attention—emerges from particulars: the lens scars, bell tones, knock patterns, and the child's question about forgiveness. The closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "gentleness propels, and propulsion here is simply permission," reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the director's skepticism and the narrator's shrug, in the bells' "homily" and the people as "saints of patience." The piece resists tidy resolution: the pilgrimage must keep changing, and the narrator writes down what was learned rather than declaring a solution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices light refraction, coal memory, harmonic angles, and interprets silence as "a room waiting for company." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("bellows," "obedient fans," "shy edge that yields only to careful fingertips"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: the child's question about forgiveness and the narrator's response ("listening might be") advance the thematic stakes. Minor slip: the priest of logistics and some visitors speak in register that occasionally converges with the narrator's elevated syntax ("donors prefer obvious arrivals"), slightly reducing voice distinction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm: "I am the prism-song bell ringer, hired to call back music that slipped between history's ribs" anchors voice and stakes economically. Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loop detected: "golden shadows" appears three times (lines 4, 26, 40) without sufficient functional variation between first and second use, and "the bells" + verb structure recurs in adjacent lines mid-piece without pattern-teaching. These loops do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so penalty remains modest. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound laboratory, miner's lamp lens, and post-blackout pilgrimage offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The piece transforms the trope of "healing through art" by grounding it in tactile particulars: coal scars redirecting light, knock patterns as cartography, and the refusal to preach. The final insight—"gentleness propels, and propulsion here is simply permission"—feels inevitable in hindsight, earned by prior particulars. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the refusal of a traditional confrontation heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight proximity echo: "patients of patience" / "saints of patience" and the motif of light/shadow lean on familiar lyric gestures, preventing entry into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer is present from line 2, drives at least three beats (tuning bells, positioning the lens, letting the child ring), and the final image ("I think of miners trusting a glimmer, and of neighbors trusting the slow bell of each other") is shaped by the narrator's accumulated choices. The character's decision to "let the bells answer" and to write down what was learned constrains the pilgrimage's evolution and forecloses the path of static ritual with conceptual cost. Setup, development, and closure participation are all met. Causal pressure is strong; specificity is high (no generic "artist" could replace this exact role).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in line 5, is used in at least three beats (positioned before the bells, refracts light to teach harmonics, lifted at the end to pour light over shoulders), and its coal-memory scars are causally active: they "bend light into obedient fans" and enable the prism effect that structures the pilgrimage. The lens charges the final image ("the lens catches a last ember, and golden shadows ring once more") and its specific property—coal scars that redirect beams—is irreplaceable. Setup, development, and closure participation are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage is named in line 10 and shapes stakes across multiple beats: the narrator tunes bells to create a current, stations are assembled (archive table, salvaged door), and the pilgrimage's need to change or "harden into scenery" articulates the conceptual cost at closure. The concept constrains the protagonist's choices (arrangement, pacing, tone) and the final realization that it "must change with those who travel it" forecloses the path of fixed ritual. Setup, development, and closure participation are met. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity is adequate (not easily swappable).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is named in line 3 and embodied in multiple beats: "I strike with patience until resonance chooses to arrive," "my mallets hum without striking too hard," and the decision to let the child ring rather than control the moment. The attribute constrains tactics (non-coercive bell arrangement, steady pace) and the final line ("If I am powerfully gentle, it is because gentleness propels") reprises it with reweighted meaning. Setup and closure participation are met; middle development is present via the mallet choices. The trait enables on-page action with cost (renouncing control), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Propel" appears explicitly in line 13 ("We will propel people from station to station not by volume, but by questioning assumptions") and the final line ("gentleness propels, and propulsion here is simply permission"). The action shapes the pilgrimage's method—guiding rather than pushing—and the closure reweights it as permission rather than force. However, the action itself is not dramatized as a distinct physical beat; it functions more as thematic framing. Setup and closure participation are met; middle development is thin. The verb could be swapped for "guide" or "lead" with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By questioning assumptions" is signaled in line 13 and its mechanics appear in multiple beats: the bells ask "What if silence is not absence" and "What if noise is a flock," the knock patterns are translated into maps, and the pilgrimage itself questions the donor's expectation of "obvious arrivals." The method constrains the narrator's tactics (arranging listening rather than preaching) and the closure depends on this stance. Setup, development, and closure participation are met. Causal pressure is moderate; the method is specific enough to resist easy swapping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is anchored in line 1 and supplies multiple resources: racks of microphones, the table for the lens, the hallway that becomes a current, and the alcove where the lens stands at the end. The setting constrains choices (bell arrangement, microphone translation of knocks) and the final image occurs within its spatial logic ("as I douse the lights, the lens catches a last ember"). Setup, development, and closure participation are met. Micro-setting qualifies: the lens, bells, and door function as tactile anchors that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting pressures the protagonist's professional choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" is named in line 1 and frames the context: the city is "bruised by outages," visitors arrive "wary, still remembering refrigerators gone warm," and the pilgrimage addresses this recent trauma. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; it functions as backstory that primes the dominant stake rather than constraining present tactics. Setup is met; middle development and closure participation are weak (the timeframe does not alter the ending's logic). The element is present and logically consistent but replaceable with another recent disruption.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of connection" is stated in line 12 and dramatized across multiple beats: the narrator arranges stations to test connection ("grief tilt toward wonder," knock patterns as cartography), lets the child ring to model listening, and writes down what was learned ("Connection has surfaces: grain, warmth, and a shy edge"). The desire is conflicted with the director's demand for "obvious arrivals" and the risk that the pilgrimage will "harden into scenery." Setup, development, and closure participation are met. The motivation drives choices with conceptual cost (renouncing control, committing to ongoing revision).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in line 4 ("golden shadows pool under racks of microphones"), line 26 ("All evening golden shadows hang like patient banners"), and line 40 ("golden shadows ring once more"). The tone is coherent through turns and modulates with pressure: initially atmospheric, then patient during the pilgrimage, and finally resonant at closure when linked to the lens's "last ember" and the trust motif. The tone charges the final image and integrates with the coal-memory lens and the narrator's gentle stance. Setup, development, and closure participation are met; the tone is consistent and purposeful, supporting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
