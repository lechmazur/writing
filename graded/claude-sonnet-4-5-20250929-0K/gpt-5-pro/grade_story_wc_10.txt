<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior life is vivid and embodied, driven by concrete sensory memory ("blue-lipped," "smelling of salt") and shaped by trauma that generates a credible vow. Sura's presence adds relational pressure through gesture and shared work, though her interior remains opaque by design. The final beat—"is this enough music to keep you afloat"—earns its weight through the ferry backstory and the sustained project, with the narrator's affirmative answer rooted in lived particulars. Minor: the fisherman's cameo feels slightly ornamental, but his gift and silent acknowledgment deepen the narrator's arc without inflating the cast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: post-silence world, conservatory setting, narrator's survival vow. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered image (tuning forks, frost notation, heat-mapping) and the final movement—writing the capsize piece, Sura's question, the affirming gaze through winterglass—reconfigures the opening vow into lived practice with visible cost (endurance, industry, the choice to keep watch). The conceptual repricing is undeniable: "music is a verb...we are finally doing it right" charges prior material without moralizing. One substantive deepening suffices at this length; the cost is felt in the sustained labor and the fisherman's silent recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is not decorative: frost draws staves, heat from bodies drives compositions, the tower bell becomes a breathing circuit. Micro-setting details (glass bells, ice orchids, boot-prints in snow) constrain choice and charge the final image. The conservatory functions as both spatial anchor and instrument, with sensory selection (frost fretted into lace, aurora over the vault) filtered through the narrator's project-focused attention. The kelp coil at the door and the tower climb demonstrate lived-in use of the environment under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music to avoid becoming "drift"—is signaled early and tightened through collaborative escalation: mapping thermals to intervals, the first performance, the school bell request. Each beat narrows the narrator's isolation and deepens the project's stakes. The fisherman's arrival and Sura's question force a crystallization: the work has become a bridge, not merely compensation for loss. The final affirmation forecloses drift with visible cost (ongoing vigilance, "fragile endurance"). One meaningful tightening suffices; agency is expressed through sustained invention and renunciation of despair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the vow, the tuning fork case, and the heat-mapping project without explicit moralizing. The title phrases ("capsize survivor," "unshaken marvels") recur with reweighted meaning, anchored in concrete particulars (ferry, frost notation, printed ovation in snow). The final image—"if music is a verb, then here...we are finally doing it right"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether creation can replace voice, with the conceptual cost of perpetual vigilance made undeniable. Minor: "music is a verb" flirts with abstraction but is grounded in the prior labor and the father's teaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature ("frost gardens bloom under skylights like silent constellations"). The narrator's lexicon—maritime, musical, attentive to texture—fits a survivor turned archivist. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: compressed memory at the ferry, expansive reflection during project work, immediate sensation at closure. Minor register drift: "rectify distances between heartbeats" and "cognitively smoothness" nudge toward elevated diction, but the slips do not obscure the narrator's voice or the closure beat. No dialogue appears; Sura's gestural language is described, not quoted, maintaining tight focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high ("frost became score, hands became choir, and the tower learned to speak by warming"). Most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loop: "we never faked applause, but the snow...crusted with boot-prints" and the adjacent "printed ovation" rephrase the same concept without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language is concentrated but mostly coherent; "fretted into lace" and "braided through them like patient breath" work. One slip: "their noise curdled into nothing, like bubbles that forget to burst" mixes vehicle (curdling, forgetting) in a way that strains logic (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The post-noise premise is executed with fresh specificity: tuning forks that "thrummed invisibly," frost as notation, heat-mapping as compositional input. The accumulative structure feels inevitable rather than clever; the emotional arc—survivor guilt to creative endurance—synthesizes familiar recovery material through particular sensory anchors (kelp coil, boot-prints, aurora). The final reconfiguration ("music is a verb") transforms the opening vow without a twist. Risk: lyric density and non-linear time could obscure, but the piece teaches its pattern early and holds clarity. Minor: the fisherman's arrival edges toward convenient validation, but his silence and the kelp coil keep it specific.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout (ferry survivor, narrator, watchkeeper). Setup: ferry trauma and vow frame the dominant stake. Development: the survivor status drives the heat-mapping project and the tower collaboration. Payoff: writing "a movement for all who survived capsizing" and affirming that the work keeps the narrator afloat. Causal pressure: the identity constrains the project's emotional core and forecloses drift. Specificity: "blue-lipped," "buoy, bobbing without map," and the fisherman's recognition make it irreplaceable. Cost: ongoing vigilance and the choice to keep watch. Three gates met, high causal involvement, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Present in five beats: ferry (plucked from water with the case), opening the case and feeling the forks' unheard pitches, striking a fork to create frost staves, threading forks through the bell rim, and setting the case by the window before writing the capsize movement. Setup: early sensory anchor. Development: used twice in active problem-solving (frost notation, bell circuit). Payoff: final beat reweights it as legacy and prompt for the new composition. Causal: enables the notation method. Specificity: "waterproofed leather smelling of salt" and the father's teaching make it irreplaceable. Cost: the case embodies memory and loss. Three gates, multiple beats, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early as the project name and as rationale ("wonder must be counted among the things silence could not steal"). Development: shapes the collaborative ethos and the decision to "rectify" the bell rather than replicate sound. Payoff: signed into frost and repeated in the margin before closure. Causal pressure: the concept constrains the team's approach (no faking applause, no forced noise) and charges the final affirmation. Specificity: the phrasing is slightly abstract but tied to the vow and the project's tactics. Three gates met, meaningful causal role, closure linkage present. Minor: echoes theme more than constraining a single tactical choice, keeping it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: Sura introduced as "hands silently expressive in a language of winter." Development: her gestural language enables collaboration (arranging glass, tracing frost staves) and applies immediate pressure (her smile causes frost to fret, her glance sets metronomes). Payoff: her signed question at closure forces the narrator's final stance. Causal: her expressiveness is the communication medium and a constraint that shapes every joint beat. Cost: the trait forecloses verbal shortcuts and requires shared invention. Three gates met, multiple beats, strong closure linkage. Specificity: the trait is shown through action (threading forks, sealing title into frost) rather than labeled.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Action appears three times: coding thermals to "rectify distances," climbing to "rectify the silent school's bell," and the margin note reminding why "the heart goes on inventing bridges." Setup: father's teaching frames it as the project's purpose. Development: the bell collaboration is the action's peak manifestation, driving the tower scene and the crowd's response. Payoff: the margin note ties rectification to the vow and charges the final affirmation. Causal: the verb defines the project's method and stakes. Swappable test: "repair" or "restore" would weaken the specific linkage to musical intervals and relational distance. Three gates, high causal involvement, strong closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Introduced early: "we began heat-mapping emotions, watching visitors glow and cool." Development: drives the first performance ("mapped heat drove the silent bows") and the bell circuit ("thermal lines from gathered faces to the bronze"). Payoff: the method's results (child's tears, elder's laughter) reweight the narrator's fear of drift and enable the final affirmation. Causal: the means shapes every compositional choice and the project's scalability. Specificity: "camera sang in colors our ears could not" and "pulse-warmth to tempo" make the mechanics legible and irreplaceable. Three gates, multiple beats, strong closure linkage. Cost: labor and the need for live subjects.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Present throughout as spatial anchor and instrument. Setup: "I keep watch at the winterglass conservatory" frames the narrator's role. Development: the conservatory supplies resources (frost for notation, glass for thermal projection, the fern walk and tower) that enable every tactical choice. Payoff: the final gaze "up through winterglass" and the closing line ("this glass house of fragile endurance") charge the entire arc. Causal: the setting is not postcard; it pressures choices (sweeping frost, climbing the tower) and its physical properties (rimed glass, skylights) are the project's medium. Three gates, high irreplaceability, strong closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: opening line establishes the world state ("after noise becomes impossible"). Development: the silence constrains every beat—ferry engines fail, alarms are mute, communication is gestural, the bell cannot ring. Payoff: the narrator's affirmation that silent creation "moved the same river" reweights the timeframe's cost. Causal: the condition forces the entire project and forecloses easy solutions. Specificity: "their noise curdled into nothing" and "frost became score" show the world rule in action. Three gates met, strong causal role. Minor: the timeframe is more condition than ticking clock, so it shapes without tightening in the way a deadline would, keeping it mid-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "I crawled ashore with a single vow: to translate silence into music before memory cooled into stone." Development: every project beat (heat-mapping, frost notation, the bell circuit) dramatizes the vow under pressure. Payoff: Sura's question and the narrator's affirmative answer test whether the translation succeeded; the final line ("we are finally doing it right") crystallizes the motivation's fulfillment with visible cost (perpetual vigilance, "fragile endurance"). Causal: the desire drives every tactical choice and forecloses drift. Friction: the motivation is told early but then enacted across multiple beats, with the fisherman's recognition and Sura's question providing external validation that earns the closure. Three gates, high causal involvement, strong closure linkage.</comment>
