<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "analytically intuitive" trait drives the pattern-reading that propels the search, and the final choice to preserve rather than destroy shows earned alteration. Interior contradiction appears in the arsonist who "listen[s] to what [flames] try to say" rather than worshipping destruction. However, Mira's motivations for vandalism and self-exile remain tellingly vague, and the protagonist's voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("desire computes trajectories even numbers envy") that strains credibility under crisis pressure. The closure choice—keeping matches in water—embodies renunciation with visible cost, but the path there leans heavily on convenient discoveries rather than forced trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (arsonist narrator), what (search for Mira), and stakes (rescue vs. betrayal of archive) within the opening moves. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues gather density (coordinates in foam, date in clay wing, breath-map) until the tapestry unlocks the chamber and Mira's message reweights the arson. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise into Earned Stasis): "matches in a jar of water, a promise afloat" crystallizes the stance with palpable cost—fire kept but constrained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes the crossed-out eyes are shutters, not erasures, reframing prior guilt. Minor slip: the archive's stone doors "weigh" the narrator then "allow debt to accrue" without clear on-page cost mechanic at that beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The salt flats, ribcage arch, and dust-filled archive rooms ground the search in tactile particulars and guide the protagonist's choices—pressing the tapestry to the carving opens the hidden chamber. Micro-setting (portrait chamber, niches holding breath reels) constrains discovery and charges the final image of dawn "rummaging through bones." Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's priorities: visual pattern-seeking dominates, with atmospheric dust and breath sounds anchoring key beats. The archive functions as more than backdrop; its structure (walls accepting the tapestry, darkness yielding) actively enables the resolution, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Mira without betraying the archive—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator must interpret crossed-out eyes as invitation rather than erasure. The accumulative pressure of clue-solving (mural coordinates, clay date, cipher, breath-map) narrows options until the tapestry unlocks the chamber. Agency appears in the choice to "keep the blaze outside" by storing matches in water, a renunciation with visible cost. However, escalation relies heavily on discovery rather than forced trade-offs; Mira's survival and the archive's accessibility arrive without on-page obstacles that test commitment or extract immediate price during the search itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation vs. destruction, memory as living practice—emerges organically through the arson/archive tension and the vandalized portraits as "diagrams of refusal and survival." The matches-in-water image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: restraint charged with prior violence, a bridge rather than chain. Mira's line "you listen to what [flames] try to say" reframes the narrator's crime as interpretive rather than nihilistic, and the final Ember Lending space embodies testimonial breathing rather than static storage. The crossed-out eyes functioning as shutters rather than erasures deepens the motif without overt moralizing. Minor deduction: "volcanic tenderness" and "erupts" occasionally feel like prompt-echo rather than earned metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature appears in pattern-obsessed diction: "smoke graphs its own arguments," "dust...a retired constellation auditing." Distance remains stable in close third with lyric compression throughout. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("desire computes trajectories even numbers envy," "salted into anonymity") that strains the POV's plausible lexicon mid-crisis. The cipher-decoding and breath-map narration maintain voice-specific texture. Mira's single line of dialogue—"you do not worship flames...you listen"—carries goal and subtext cleanly, but her minimal on-page speech limits assessment of voice distinction between characters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density ("volcanic tenderness," "borrowing room," "ember-sparrow," "dawn rummaged through bones") charges multiple beats but occasionally stacks without breathing space, risking purple accumulation. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "A mural...concealed coordinates / A clay bird had a broken wing / Together they formed" runs parallel stems across three lines. The phrase "then withdrew" (wall accepting tapestry) and "then rethreaded" show minor synonym proximity. Information density is high—nearly every line advances discovery—but peak beats (finding Mira, the matches-in-water choice) could tighten by two to three lines to sharpen propulsion. No loops or major clarity breaks; the closure image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination—arsonist-as-preservationist reading vandalized art as map—offers a fresh synthesis, and "matches in water" as closure image feels specific and earned. The archive-as-breathing-whale and portraits-as-survival-diagrams transform familiar "hidden sanctuary" material through the narrator's pattern-reading lens. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the breath-reel mechanic heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Minor deduction: the "lost civilization archive" frame and mentor-vanishes-into-forbidden-place setup echo widely used templates; while the piece personalizes through the arson guilt and cipher mechanics, the bones remain recognizable. The emotional truth of guilt meeting forgiveness through interpretive labor elevates the familiar structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line ("lending library arsonist") and drives key decisions: striking the match, fleeing with evidence, interpreting clues, entering the archive with "hands open, surrendering matches," and the final choice to store matches in water. The arson guilt colors every beat and the closure renunciation hinges on this identity. Setup, development (pattern-solving constrained by past crime), and payoff (Ember Lending as transformation) all present. The choice to open a testimonial lending space rather than repeat destruction shows causal arc. Swappability is low—"collector" or "vandal" would lose the fire/preservation dialectic. Cost is felt in the wound spring reopens and the restraint the water-jar imposes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Appears in beat one (fled with it), returns when unrolled in the archive to match wall carvings, and again when pressed to stone to unlock the chamber. The fragment's threads "trembling" and the wall "accepting then withdrawing" give it agency that narrows options. Early signal, development (recognition scene), and payoff (unlocks closure path) all met. It enables the key discovery but does not constrain a competing choice or extract visible cost—the tapestry functions as key rather than trade-off object. Swappability moderate: another artifact with matching pattern could serve similarly, though "faded" and "reprisals" add thematic texture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early in Mira's notebook (eyes crossed out), reappears as the central portrait in the hidden chamber, and delivers the cipher "keep the blaze outside" that reweights the narrator's arson. The concept shapes stakes throughout: vandalism as protective misdirection rather than destruction, self-portrait as both "invitation and indictment." The realization that crossed lines are shutters rather than erasures drives the thematic turn and the narrator's final stance. Setup, development (cipher decoding), and payoff (reframes guilt, enables forgiveness) all strong. Removing this exact element—using a different cipher or map—would collapse the motif of defacement-as-preservation that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Label appears early ("analytically intuitive to a fault") and manifests in pattern-reading: coordinates in foam, date in lamplight, cipher from paint strokes, breath-map navigation. The trait enables the search and final discovery. However, the phrase itself is tell-heavy, and the story does not dramatize a cost or tradeoff tied to over-analysis—no moment where intuition misleads or where analytic coldness harms a relationship on the page. The ability functions as pure advantage rather than constraint. Setup and development present; payoff indirect (successful rescue). Swappability moderate: "observant" or "puzzle-solver" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The action threads through: Mira's original portraiture exhibit destroyed by the board, her self-portrait as cipher, the narrator's interpretive acts, and the final promise to "portray the archive truthfully" leading to Ember Lending's testimonial practice. It shapes motive and closure but does not drive a single decisive on-page turn where "portray" versus another verb alters the outcome. The pieces are "observed" and "interpreted" more than actively portrayed mid-search. Setup (Mira's work), development (decoding), and payoff (new testimonial space) met, but causality is diffuse. Swappability moderate: "document" or "witness" could serve with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("trailed her last installations"), developed across storm-wave mural, clay bird, coordinates and date forming the path, and breath reels as final guide. The method's mechanics matter: each clue constrains the next choice, and the trail's existence justifies the archive discovery. Setup, development (multiple beats of solving), and payoff (leads to Mira and closure) all strong. The specificity—artistic alterations under surveillance—fits the vandalism theme and feels irreplaceable. Minor deduction: the trail succeeds without false leads or cost of misreading; a single wrong turn that extracts time or safety would tighten causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced at the path's end ("archive breathed like a sleeping whale"), the stone-mouth doors test the narrator ("guard of silence weighed me"), and the niches/vault structure the discovery of breath reels and Mira. The setting supplies the constraint (darkness yields only when the narrator kneels) and the resource (reels, portraits, tapestry-lock mechanism). Micro-setting (chamber of slashed portraits, ribcage arch threshold) charges the final image when "we carried the reels...and rethreaded the tapestry fragment" before returning to the city. Setup delayed to ~40%, but development and payoff strong; the archive's existence and accessibility directly enable closure. Swappability low—generic "hidden library" would lose breath/memory specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Opening phrase establishes the timeframe, and the search unfolds in a continuous present without tracked duration or deadline pressure. "Off the grid" flavors the fugitive tone but does not constrain choices—no pursuers close in, no ticking clock forces haste or error. The search pace feels elastic; clue-solving and archive navigation occur without time cost affecting tactics. Setup met (opening line), but development and payoff absent; time neither tightens decisions nor shapes the closure image. Swappability high: "after the fire" or "in exile" could replace with no structural loss. The frame is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stated early ("rescue a forgotten promise") and embodied in guilt over the arson, drive to interpret Mira's trail, and final vow to "portray the archive truthfully." The motivation faces friction when the narrator realizes "I had put the blaze inside" against Mira's message, reopening the wound. The conflict between rescue and prior betrayal pressures the closure choice to store matches in water. Setup, development (guilt tested by Mira's cipher), and payoff (promise "less like a chain than a bridge") all present. Cost is felt in the renunciation and the new testimonial labor. Minor deduction: Mira's immediate forgiveness ("you listen to what [flames] try to say") arrives without on-page negotiation or visible reluctance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phrase seeds the opening ("volcanic tenderness, refusing ash") and modulates through "wound like spring," "erupts," and the closing "argue with tenderness that erupts." Tone holds a lyric intensity—passion restrained by care—that charges beats: surrendering matches, kneeling before darkness, the matches-in-water image. The oxymoron fits the arson/preservation dialectic and supports the closure stance. However, "volcanic" repeats only twice explicitly; the coherence relies more on sustained lyric register than on the specific vehicle. Under pressure the tone remains consistent rather than shifting, meeting situational design. Swappability moderate: "fierce care" or "protective violence" could substitute, though "volcanic" adds geological patience that "argue" and "ember" echo.</comment>
