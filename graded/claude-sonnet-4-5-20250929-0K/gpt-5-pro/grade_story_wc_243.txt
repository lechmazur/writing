<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and role-specific, with embodied emotion ("the euphoria that touches my throat is haunted by her absence"). Motivation intensifies through micro-choices (pressing the locket into the ledger, speaking her name, refusing to write her back into the roll). Internal contradiction appears when duty and grief overlap ("I can only write the ache she made useful"), and the final choice to close the locket demonstrates renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "exact flavor of duty" edges toward over-articulation but doesn't flatten the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the piece teaches its ritual-ledger pattern early and deepens through density increase and cadence shifts. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archivist closes the locket "not to deny her, but to preserve the weight of small moments," crystallizing the covenant's survival through chosen limitation with undeniable cost. The Orientation Test is waived—who/where/when anchor by line 3, and the twilight timing frames the ritual window. One meaningful tightening occurs when the locket photo is pressed into the ledger, narrowing options from hope of return to acceptance of absence as functional ache.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty supplies concrete constraints: salt roses, barnacles, rubber tires ground the ritual space, and the kettle's cooling marks ritual closure. The locket (micro-setting as body-tool) charges the final image by constraining the choice to close it. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: "walnut hulls dark as bruised moons," "thyme for courage and salt for memory." The jetty's tidal pulse ("takes back the edge…then gives it again") mirrors the covenant's rhythm and directly shapes the archivist's stance at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renewing the covenant without erasing grief—is signaled early and tightens when Kellen asks if she'll "write her back into the roll." The archivist's refusal ("I can only write the ache she made useful") forecloses restoration-through-denial, a visible trade-off. One clear deepening: the act of pressing the locket into the ledger reweights the ritual from mechanical duty to charged memorialization. The tidal pulse and Kellen's witness apply coherent external pressure. Agency reads as renunciation with on-page cost; the final choice to close the locket preserves grief's weight rather than resolve it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—covenant as continuous attending rather than magical repair—emerges through ritual particulars: "nets hung lower, then higher," "a child left a note asking us to listen." The locket's arc (warmed all day, pressed into ledger, closed at night) reweights the premise from nostalgia to functional memorial without stating a moral. "Haunted euphoria lives…between yield and return" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece resists tidy closure: the sea "might forgive" only through texture, not absolution. Minor wobble: "proximate causes" appears often enough to approach overt thesis, but the specific acts (Alma learning to swim, ferry schedule shifts) keep it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV archivist voice is distinct and stable: "to weigh each murmur and make it legible," "the euphoria…is haunted by her absence, the exact flavor of duty." Perceptual signature (ritual objects, tidal rhythms, textural metaphors) is consistent and role-specific. Kellen's brief dialogue ("if I will write her back into the roll") advances plot and carries subtext without filter clutter. Purposeful compression in lines like "her laugh almost arrive" fits the lyric accumulation. One slip: "the exact flavor of duty" edges toward over-articulation, and occasional elevated diction ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant") risks register drift, though it remains plausibly role-bound for an archivist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across declarative, participial, and temporal frames. Information density is high: "I palm the locket photo that has warmed against me all day, a harbor within a harbor" does triple work (object, emotion, metaphor). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "walnut hulls dark as bruised moons," "a lung learning itself." Two frictions: "surrendering a brown galaxy" mixed with "dark as bruised moons" feels vehicle-crowded in one beat. The phrase "the way gulls hinge silence" is striking but the verb "hinge" strains clarity slightly. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is clean through the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archivist-as-covenant-renewer premise is specific and non-obvious; the ritual of walnut ink, ledger, and locket grounds familiar grief in fresh occupational texture. The move from "call storms to heel" to "proximate causes" (nets adjusted, Alma learns to swim) transforms mourning-as-magic into mourning-as-attendance. The choice to preserve the ache rather than write her back is emotionally honest and particular. The blooming jetty and tidal pulse as covenant-meter adds conceptual freshness. Minor proximity concern: "haunted" paired with "euphoria" echoes common oxymoron templates, though the piece earns the pairing through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Walnut-ink archivist: present from the opening, frames the ritual window ("I walk the blooming jetty"), makes the key choice not to write her back into the roll, and closes the locket at the ending. The occupation constrains methods (ink, ledger, "gently thorough" recording) and the decision to "write the ache she made useful" alters the covenant's texture. Three distinct beats (walking jetty, pressing locket, closing locket) all involve character decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Locket photo: introduced early ("I palm the locket photo…a harbor within a harbor"), handled in the key beat ("I press the locket photo into the ledger, its metal outline making a bruise"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("I take the locket and close it, not to deny her, but to preserve the weight"). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (pressing creates the "tideline" stain that visualizes absence), and closure linkage. The closing gesture forecloses the path of erasure or fantasy reunion.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Regenerated covenant: named early, defines the dominant stake ("my work believes in making a regenerated covenant"), shapes the archivist's method ("gather the names, return the borrowed stitches"), and reappears at closure ("the covenant breathes because we do"). The concept narrows options: the archivist cannot "call storms to heel" but must attend to "proximate causes." Two beats (gathering names mid-ritual, signing to tide for one more season) and the ending restates it with visible cost (preservation of ache, not restoration).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gently thorough: introduced as trade descriptor ("my trade is to be gently thorough"), enacted when the archivist notes "when Alma shrugged, how Kellen paused," and restated near the end ("I try to be gently thorough in my recording"). The trait constrains method (no shortcuts, full textural capture) and connects to the ending's refusal to collapse grief into neat record. Two beats, mid-range causal pressure (the thoroughness justifies why proximate causes might work). Modest cost: the labor of recording all small adjustments rather than grand gestures.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Steep: the kettle and walnut hulls steep early ("I bring the little brazier…to steep my ink and my nerve"), the staining is visualized mid-ritual ("the ink blooms around the oval like a tideline"), and leftover warmth brews the closing tea ("I steep a tea in the leftover warmth"). Two beats involve the action (initial steep, final tea), and the brown stain becomes the visible trace of covenant-work. Causal pressure moderate: steeping enables the ink that records the covenant, but swapping to "mix" or "prepare" would not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Through proximate causes: signaled early ("my work believes…not by calling storms to heel, but through proximate causes"), demonstrated in the middle constellation ("nets hung lower, then higher; ferry schedule slid; Alma learned to swim"), and restated at closure ("I listen, counting the proximate causes we now own"). The method shapes the archivist's refusal to write her back as whole and the choice to record texture rather than demand outcome. Three beats, strong causal pressure (method determines what can be attempted), and closure participation (the covenant breathes via accumulated small acts).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight: introduced in line 3 ("I walk the blooming jetty at twilight, where salt roses cling to pylons"), used as ritual anchor mid-scene ("between breaths, the jetty blooms as if the water wears a wrist corsage"), and returns at closure ("the jetty darkens and glows in alternate beats, a lung learning itself"). The setting constrains timing (twilight as "the only correct hour") and the tidal pulse provides the rhythm for covenant renewal. Three beats, the environment supplies the "between yield and return" space where the covenant can breathe.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>When context changes: named as the trigger ("I wait for the only correct hour, when context changes, when the tide inhales"), demonstrated when lights click on and the jetty blooms, and closure hinges on the moment between tidal pulse ("the sea takes back the edge…then gives it again"). The timeframe tightens the decision window: the covenant must be signed before the ritual moment passes. Two beats (waiting, signing), and the tidal breathing structures the ending's poise. Moderate causal pressure: the hour matters, but exact mechanics of "context changes" remain poetic rather than plot-mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To preserve the weight of small moments: stated as closing motivation ("to preserve the weight of small moments in a clasp that will hold until morning"), but dramatized throughout via micro-notations (Alma's shrug, Kellen's pause, the child's note) and the choice not to erase grief. The desire is conflicted: preserving weight means carrying pain forward rather than resolving it. Three beats (gathering small adjustments, pressing locket to create weight-trace, closing locket to hold weight), and the final choice to close rather than deny her directly enacts the motivation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Haunted euphoria: introduced early ("the euphoria that touches my throat is haunted by her absence"), enacted in the ritual's charged atmosphere ("between those pulses I feel her laugh almost arrive"), and named at closure ("haunted euphoria lives there, between yield and return, a place that is both chapel and scar"). The tone is coherent across all turns: joy in ritual efficacy shadowed by permanent loss. The tone directly charges the final image (closing the locket preserves both dimensions without resolving the tension). Modulates with pressure: calm preparation, charged recording, quiet closing.</comment>
