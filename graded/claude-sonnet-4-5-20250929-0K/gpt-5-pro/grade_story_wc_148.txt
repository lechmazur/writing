<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and particular ("chasing hush where truth once hid"), and the inheritance motif meaningfully shapes his approach. However, the extended lyric mode keeps micro-choices abstract—he "pried loose," "carried," "pressed"—without dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance (teaching others to separate "hush from hunger") feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal conflict; the choice to act doesn't foreclose a live option with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (lattice, beam, hush, scuffs) build density and the final stanza reweights the opening inheritance motif with a cadence shift. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the narrator commits to "work and quiet, not wolves"—but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture. Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, lantern room, pantry) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice divides light and "the hush bent," revealing its appetite, though the mechanics of rescue ("opened nothing; I only kept the beam steady") stay oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse architecture (lens, lantern pit, drowned pantry, confessional lattice) is vivid and particular, and the lattice physically enables the climax by dividing light. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical movement (chapel → corridor → pantry → lantern pit). Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's professional vigilance ("vinegar tang history wipes on its teeth") and the copperlight beam charges the final image. The recurring lattice and beam constrain the protagonist's method and shape the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescue the missing before discovery—is signaled early and the timeframe ("before they find the bodies") creates urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes the hush "fed on certainty" and must "tangle it" with his spoken path. However, the escalation is conceptual: the act of holding "the beam steady and the lattice true" lacks visible cost or a trade-off that narrows options. The missing "breathed from the stairs below" without dramatized peril or resistance, softening the stakes test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inherited alarms versus earned caution, the cost of easy certainty versus laborious truth. The lattice-as-sieve and the "hush" that feeds on relief avoid label-only abstraction. The final stanza offers a resonant answer—"I choose a new inheritance, where caution sings without crying"—that reweights the opening cry-wolf motif without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution (the missing are "not bodies yet, not answers, just air returned") and invites reflection on trust and vigilance through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person narration maintains stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "clockwork salt," "knees" smell in the lattice). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains internally coherent; no register drift into anachronism. The narrator's way of noticing (scuffs as hieroglyphs, foam as instructions) is selective and character-specific. However, sustained figurative density in nearly every line ("sea rehearsed storms," "gull hover like commas") risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff; the high metaphor load in the climax ("the hush bent") remains legible but presses the limit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("slow as a heart made of clockwork salt"), but the accumulation across consecutive sentences ("rumors were my inheritance," "thread a labyrinth with your own story," "sustains impossibilities," "filtering the corridor into strips") without variation in mode triggers overwriting penalties (−0.5). Template-cadence runs appear ("I learned," "I needed," "I understood," "I had to," "I will") in the final third (−0.4). A paraphrase loop occurs in the pantry beat: "false panic" / "different" restates the same contrast without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is high, but the figurative load and stem repetition dull momentum approaching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-prison, inherited-alarm motif, and personified hush that "fed on certainty" feels fresh and non-obvious. The lattice from confessional as a tool to "sieve" voices is specific and earned. However, the core frame—protagonist must save the missing by understanding an invisible threat—follows familiar paranormal-investigation templates. The transformation comes through lyric voice and the inheritance reversal, but the central action (holding a beam to free trapped souls) lacks the specificity to feel fully inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator's identity as "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son" frames his motivation and final stance reversal. He makes one key choice—to speak his path aloud through the lattice—that alters the missing's state. Present in opening, middle (recognition of the hush's appetite), and ending (new inheritance declaration), satisfying all three gates. However, the decision feels thematic rather than tactically costly; removing the specific lineage would weaken thematic resonance but the rescue mechanics could proceed with a generic vigilant protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears in three distinct beats: retrieved from the confessional, pressed to the door to "filter" whispers, and set into the beam path to divide light and trap the hush. Its crosshatch structure enables the climax mechanics ("held the voice in squares"). Early signal (confessional chapel), middle use (door listening), and closure participation (beam + lattice = rescue) satisfy all gates. The object's specific geometry (crosshatch, sieve) matters to the action, though "filtering" remains somewhat abstract; a more concrete depiction of how it constrains the hush would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is introduced early, recurs throughout, and shapes the protagonist's method (listening "the other way," tracking "subtraction"). The climax depends on understanding that the hush "fed on certainty" and must be tangled with speech. Present in opening, middle (corridor listening), and ending (holding silence to "carry weight"). However, "chasing hush" reads more as thematic language than a tactic with clear rules; the mechanics of pursuit remain oblique, trending toward atmosphere over executable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the place early ("The place sustains impossibilities, and so I did not question"). It licenses the hush, the lens-as-portal rumor, and the missing pressed in alcoves. However, the attribute functions as world-rule permission rather than a trait that constrains on-page action; it enables plot but does not force a visible cost or tactical choice. Present in setup, implicit throughout, but absent from closure—missing the ending gate caps the score at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Hover" is signaled ("gulls hover like commas"), claimed as intentional tactic ("I began to hover in earnest, my steps barely claiming the stone"), and associated with careful movement. However, its role in the rescue is passive: the narrator holds position with lattice and beam rather than using "hovering" as a distinct capability. The word appears in setup and middle but does not shape the closure mechanics; easily replaceable with "move cautiously" without structural loss. Two gates (setup, middle mention) cap at ~6.0; lack of causal necessity in the ending and swappability lower further.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scuffs on the narrow door are signaled early, examined closely ("Boot heels had written curled hieroglyphs"), and used as a diagnostic method ("I read the island through the scuffs"). The protagonist later speaks "every scuff I had read" aloud to trap the hush. Present in setup (door discovery), middle (reading scuffs to navigate), and ending (spoken aloud in the rescue). The method enables navigation and becomes part of the tangling strategy, though its mechanics remain impressionistic. All three gates met; moderate causal pressure and closure linkage justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison anchors every beat: the lens casts copperlight, the chapel and lantern pit provide descent structure, the jagged reef isolates, and the turning beam becomes the rescue tool. The setting pressures the protagonist (confined vertical space, tide-negotiated cell, "drowned pantry") and supplies the key resource (the beam). Architecture shapes tactics (following corridors, descending to the lantern pit) and the final image ("this lantern where a lattice teaches"). Early, persistent, and indispensable to closure—strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is declared early and repeated near the end ("I will do it before they find the bodies"). It establishes urgency and the protagonist acts within that window. However, the timeframe remains abstract—no countdown, no encroaching searchers, no visible clock tightening choices. Present in setup and ending (framing stakes), but does not constrain middle tactics or alter the protagonist's moves. Two gates and modest pressure justify mid-5s; lack of on-page tightening prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Thread a labyrinth with your own story" is introduced as rumor-inheritance strategy, becomes the tactic ("I had to tangle it, to trap its appetite, to thread a labyrinth with your own story so it feasted slow"), and is enacted when the narrator speaks his path aloud. The motivation drives the climax action and links to the inheritance theme. Present in setup, explicitly guides the middle realization, and executes at closure. However, "threading a labyrinth" remains metaphorical; the friction between want and cost is conceptual rather than embodied in a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears in the opening image (lens casting light), recurs in the rescue ("copperlight repose dress our shoulders like blankets"), and colors the closing mood. The tone is elegiac, meditative, and sustained through lyric diction. It modulates subtly—urgent in the corridor, calm in the resolution—without breaking coherence. Early seed and final reprise with stake-reweighting (from vigilant dread to earned calm) justify mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance, though the tone does not independently constrain a choice or tighten pressure in the middle beats.</comment>
