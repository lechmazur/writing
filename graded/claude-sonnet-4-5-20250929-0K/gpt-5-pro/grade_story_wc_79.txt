<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation is clear and sustained: grief for the lost teacher drives the gate-breaking and journey. Interiority is poetic but remains concrete through gestures like "wrapped stone" and "my mouth taste of copper." The final stance—"I carry my sunwashed dread like a cautionary map"—reflects an earned acceptance of the teacher's transformation without resolving grief, a credible renunciation with visible cost. However, the protagonist's emotional state reads smoothly processed rather than contradictory under pressure, missing the hypocrisy or self-deception that would elevate the band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through pattern repetition ("pattern languages"), sensory density, and motif recurrence (whistle, watchers, shells) toward a final cadence shift where the protagonist learns the expedition "was braided into the paths" and reorients the city's passages. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing): the cartographer accepts the teacher's absorption into the city's navigation and returns "oriented" rather than safe, foreclosing rescue but opening new routes with felt cost. Orientation anchors by line 3 (who, where, when). One minor slip: the watchers' answer mechanism ("arranging the glare, shadow knitting itself into hexagons") is asserted rather than causally prepared, but the ending image holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The turtles as living infrastructure constrain every choice: the protagonist must use the whistle to move them, and their shell-ridges function as navigational texts. The gate, lowest bridge, and watchers are spatially coherent and persistent anchors. The final touch—"Its surface etched with tidal genealogies"—charges the closure image by making the watchers legible as record-keepers rather than threats. Sensory detail is filtered through the cartographer's professional lens (whorls, strake, hexagons) and modulates with urgency: under stress, perception narrows to "heatless cold" and fingertip thought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learn the fate of the lost expedition and the teacher. The gate-cracking is the protagonist's agency under pressure, breaking the city's paralysis. The watchers' answer—expedition folded into navigation—tightens the choice: the cartographer cannot retrieve the lost but can honor their paths by reorienting the city. One meaningful turn where knowledge narrows options and forecloses rescue. The cost is legible: "I thank them in shell grammar for the return of what could not return." However, the escalation reads as accumulation (density increase) rather than rising jeopardy, fitting the Accumulative lens but capping urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as listening, loss as transformation, orientation as pragmatic hope. The recurring whistle and "pattern languages" motif shift from tool to communion to acceptance without stating a moral. The final line—"We are not safe, but we are oriented, and that is enough to begin"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (what was lost?) by reweighting survival from rescue to navigation. The watchers' hexagon-shadow language and the teacher "braided into backwash" resist easy resolution. Minor slip: "sunwashed dread" appears as both title phrase and closing refrain but risks becoming a thematic label rather than emerging purely from scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, distance controlled, perceptual signature consistent: the cartographer notices whorls, strake, pattern languages, showing professional bias. Diction is lyric and compressed but remains legible and voice-motivated: "breath and shell were old friends of wind" reads as the teacher's idiom internalized. Purposeful compression ("They say the expedition did not perish, but was braided into the paths") signals the watchers' answer economically. One hairline slip: "heatless cold" and "ink walking toward the nib" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, but the effect enhances rather than obscures pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("spiral-shell cartographer," "notes break into motifs"). Information density is high: most lines advance world, character, or atmosphere. However, repetitive stems cluster in the middle third: "I ask...I ask...I read...I blow...I touch...I thank...I turn...I carry" stacks first-person declaratives across seven lines without syntactic variety, triggering −0.4 for template cadence. The phrase "pattern languages" recurs eight times, risking synonym churn, though it functions as a taught motif. No paraphrase loops at closure; the final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The city-on-turtles premise is fresh and fully committed: the creatures are navigational agents, not backdrop. The watchers as glare-speaking monuments and "tidal genealogies" offer a non-obvious synthesis of archive and oracle. The choice to crack the gate and use breath (whistle) rather than force to move living geography feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the non-rescue closure elevates without gimmickry. One limiting factor: the "lost expedition teaches the city" frame echoes familiar transformation-through-sacrifice templates; the execution is strong but the premise itself is not wholly novel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist named and role established by line 3. Development: choice to crack the gate (line 16), blow the whistle (line 19), and adjust intervals (line 35) are all protagonist-driven decisions that alter the city's movement and access to the watchers. Payoff: the cartographer's return "through pattern languages" and resolve to remain "quietly driven" close the arc. Causal pressure is strong: each choice narrows options (gate breaking is "final," whistle calls are iterative experiments). Cost is visible: the teacher cannot return, and the protagonist accepts orientation over safety. Two beats (gate-cracking, whistle-blowing) plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 11, tied to the teacher and breath/shell communion. Development: used twice on-page (lines 19, 35) to move the turtles and adjust their course, each use driving a beat. Payoff: the whistle's "rough harmonic" frees the rusted chain and enables contact with the watchers, directly shaping closure. Specificity: its mechanics (intervals, motifs, grammar) are irreplaceable; no generic tool could substitute. Cost connection: the whistle embodies the teacher's gift and the protagonist's ongoing dialogue with his absence. Three beats plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 5, frames the inciting condition. Development: the expedition's fate is the dominant question driving the gate-breaking and journey; the protagonist traces "his last path" (line 13) before acting. Payoff: the watchers' answer—expedition "braided into the paths"—resolves the question and reconfigures the city's navigation, making the lost a persistent resource rather than a void. Causal pressure: the mystery narrows options (paralysis vs. action). However, the expedition itself is mostly told rather than shown; we never see the expedition's departure or the protagonist's earlier relationship to it beyond the teacher. Two gates (setup, payoff) with strong closure linkage but limited on-page dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "quietly driven" appears line 3, repeated line 43 as bookend. Development: the trait enables the gate-cracking ("my resolve stops pretending to be patience," line 8) and the journey rather than waiting. Cost: the quiet drive forecloses loud rebellion or communal action, isolating the protagonist's path. However, the attribute is more label than embodied constraint; we see resolve but not the cost of quietness in scene—no moment where speaking up or rallying others is visibly rejected. Lyric reprise (first third → last line) with one causal link (gate choice) but limited mid-scene friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: the gate's rust is established line 7; the latch is targeted line 16. Development: cracking the seal is the pivotal act of agency that breaks the city's paralysis and enables all subsequent movement. The sound is "small but final, like a spine admitting it has been carrying too much" (line 17), charging the moment with cost. Payoff: the crack initiates the journey that culminates in the watchers' answer and the city's reorientation. However, the crack itself is mechanically simple (wrapped stone) and could be replaced by other gate-opening methods with minor edits. One strong causal beat plus thematic resonance, but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "pattern languages" introduced line 4, taught as the cartographer's method. Development: used across multiple beats—tracing the teacher's path (line 13), reading whorls (line 14), interpreting the watchers' hexagon-shadow answer (line 29), thanking in "shell grammar" (line 38), and navigating home (line 41). The method is irreplaceable: it defines how the protagonist reads, speaks, and moves through the world. Payoff: the final journey home is explicitly "through pattern languages" (line 41), making the method the closure vehicle. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we see application but not the cost or difficulty of mastering it. Three beats plus closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: established line 2, anchors the world immediately. Development: the turtles' movement is the enabling constraint—protagonist must whistle to steer them (line 19), their shell-ridges are navigational texts (lines 14, 18), and their alignment frees the chain (line 36). The turtles pressure every choice: without them, no journey; without the whistle-language, no control. Payoff: the city's reorientation depends on the turtles learning new turnings from the lost expedition, and the protagonist's return adjusts those paths. The setting is indispensable: removing the turtles breaks all logic, stakes, and closure. Three beats, high causal pressure, closure-shaping, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: timeframe anchored line 1 and repeated line 8, establishing the inciting condition. Development: the rusted gate is the constraint that must be cracked (line 16), and "after" signals a shift from paralysis to action. The timeframe shapes the city's mood ("holds its breath") and the protagonist's urgency. Payoff: the journey and answer occur within this "after" window, and the ending reorients the city's future passages. However, elapsed time within the journey is vague—no clock tightens tactics, and the three-month gap since the expedition's loss is told rather than felt. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff) with moderate causal pressure but no live ticking urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: desire to "question the silent watchers" stated line 9, tied to the teacher's loss (line 11). Development: this want drives the gate-cracking, the journey, and the reed-whistle questions (lines 26–27). The watchers' answer is the payoff that reconfigures the protagonist's grief into orientation. Cost: the protagonist cannot retrieve the lost but must accept their transformation. However, the motivation reads more as mourning-driven curiosity than conflicted desire—no moment where questioning the watchers competes with another want (safety, revenge, denial). Two beats (inciting want, closure question) with strong closure linkage but limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: "sunwashed dread" introduced line 2, repeated as phrase line 9 and motif throughout (e.g., "burnished to blindness" line 10, "heatless cold" line 37). Development: tone modulates—early dread is static ("holds its breath"), middle dread becomes active pressure ("copper and prayers" line 25), and final dread is carried as "cautionary map" (line 42), a pragmatic tool rather than paralysis. Payoff: the closing line—"We are not safe, but we are oriented"—transforms dread into navigational realism. The tone charges the final image by acknowledging ongoing danger without surrender. Coherent modulation across turns with strong closure linkage.</comment>
