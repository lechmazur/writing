<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrator remains consistent in voice and motivation (conducting broadcasts, orchestrating resistance), but interiority is largely absent—we see actions and declarations without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. Kestrel's choices (standing under the portico, taking the hit) arrive without visible internal conflict or cost-laden hesitation. The piece tells us about emotional stakes ("starved," "lonely visionary") but rarely dramatizes them through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final collaboration between narrator and Kestrel is asserted rather than earned through on-page tension or transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who (narrator at observatory), where (stormlit tower above clouds), and basic situation (broadcasts inspiring resistance) early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (lightning, portico, frequencies, council attack) and a cadence shift at the confrontation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final collaborative broadcast and the conceptual repricing of "ancient shadows" as blueprints, but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, injury consequence, or tactical narrowing charges the final image. The council "blinks" without dramatized consequence, and the ending's declaration of intent ("keep singing," "steer by thunder") lacks the felt price required for high-band RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico functions as micro-setting that constrains action: it "bent lightning into indigo ladders," "hummed like a whale skull," protected the tower, and Kestrel stood beneath it to take the strike. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's lyric perspective ("thunder that smelled like pennies," "blue light smearing our cheeks"). The observatory's spatial layout is legible enough for the confrontation choreography, and recurring storm imagery charges the final image. The portico's mechanics directly affect the climax and closure, elevating the score despite some postcard abstraction in early paragraphs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (broadcasting resistance to shape a new order) is signaled early and the council's attack provides external pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council sends cutters and then traitors, forcing the narrator to deploy "ancient shadows" and Kestrel to stand exposed. However, the escalation bypasses protagonist agency—the lightning "favored the portico" passively, the crowd's choice is described in summary, and the council's retreat ("blinked") lacks on-page consequence. Cost at closure is conceptual (visibility of the work's strings) rather than a visible forfeiture or injury that narrows later options, fitting Accumulative lens but not charging the final image with urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images of broadcast mediation, collective interpretation ("variant allegiance"), and the tension between myth-making and transparency. The final decision to "keep the strings visible" and treat "ancient shadows not as chains but as blueprints" offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to lead without mystification. However, the thematic synthesis is somewhat explicit ("so no one mistook the work for magic") and the closure leans toward statement rather than charged image. The piece resists moralizing but does not fully earn its conceptual repricing through particulars—shadows and frequencies remain more symbolic than causally grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, distinct, and controlled: lyric compression, purposeful archaism ("gritty whimsy," "lyrically prophetic"), and a perceptual signature that filters the world through broadcast metaphors. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Diction stays within the narrator's register (conductor/prophet hybrid) and syntactic variety supports the textural drive. The piece teaches its pattern early (compressed, imagistic syntax) and maintains it through closure. Elision of transitional mechanics (how the crowd chooses, how Kestrel grows tall) is consistent with the lyric mode and does not obscure the dominant lens or closure effect, justifying high placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is densely figurative and rhythmically controlled, with vivid images that advance atmosphere and character stance. However, overwriting clusters in nearly every paragraph: "stormlight crawled, tracing neighborhoods that beat in unwieldy harmonies," "ash toned music through fragmented radio frequencies," "paper storm crane." In the climax, mixed metaphors accumulate ("crack the glass like a cathedral confession," "batons fell like rain gutters") and some phrases loop conceptually ("lyrically prophetic" appears three times). Information density is high but the figurative load occasionally obscures causal linkage (how the crowd's choice "held" is told, not shown). Template cadence is minimal, but the relentless elevation in diction at peak beats triggers −0.5 under the Overwriting penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise (pirate radio prophet orchestrating resistance via storm-powered broadcasts) synthesizes familiar elements (messianic figure, oppressive council, fragmented resistance) into a specific atmospheric frame. The cobalt portico and Kestrel's tin kite offer particular, non-obvious details, and the decision to "keep the strings visible" subverts the prophet archetype with self-awareness. However, the core arc (lone visionary inspires underdog resistance, council attacks, crowd rallies) follows a recognizable template, and the transformation relies more on lyric texture than on a fresh moral calculus or structural risk. The piece commits fully to its vision but does not fundamentally surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator ("lonely visionary") is present throughout, makes choices (send riddles to Kestrel, open the vault of ancient shadows, decide to keep strings visible), and those choices drive two key beats (arming Kestrel, countering the council's attack). The character's decisions alter tactics and charge the ending image. However, interiority is thin—choices are narrated rather than dramatized through hesitation or cost—and the final collaboration is asserted without on-page negotiation. Two gates (setup, closure) are strong; middle development is summary-driven. Score reflects solid beat involvement and closure linkage, capped by low dramatization of cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in at least four distinct beats: early description (bending lightning), Kestrel's practice, the council's attack (glass cracks, hums, protects), and the morning-after closure (spidered but standing). It constrains action (protects the tower, site of Kestrel's stance) and charges the final image ("blue light smearing our cheeks"). Early signal, multiple causal uses, and closure linkage support high placement. Swappability is low—removing it would break the storm-defense logic and the symbolic repricing of fragility/endurance. Cost connection is visible (glass cracks, yet stands).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is named and dramatized: listeners form different vows to the same pulse, each district adores a different verse, the narrator stitches the chorus nightly to prevent fracture, and the crowd's final choice is "a braid of choices that held." The concept shapes stakes (how to unify without uniformity) and appears in the closure decision (accept the variant allegiance as a choir). Setup is clear, middle beats show the narrator managing fragmentation, and the ending reprices it as strength. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how stitching happens, what fracture would cost on the page—limiting causal pressure. Two strong gates plus closure linkage place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" is applied to the narrator's voice and twice to Kestrel's coat of symbols, but it functions as description rather than constraint. No on-page action visibly depends on this quality; it could be swapped for "cryptic" or "poetic" without altering beats. The label colors tone but does not enable a tactic or impose a visible cost. Present in setup and closure vicinity (Kestrel's coat), but ornamental. Lack of middle causal work and low irreplaceability cap the score below mid-band despite two-gate presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears explicitly in the ending plan ("let tomorrow unfold like a paper storm crane") and implicitly governs the narrator's approach (let the map unfold, let the variant allegiance develop, accept rather than force). The action shapes the closure stance (transparency, patience) and contrasts with the council's rigid control. However, the verb is more thematic posture than plot driver—no major turn traces uniquely to "unfold" as a tactic. Setup is diffuse, closure linkage is strong, middle development is conceptual. Swappability is moderate; "allow" or "reveal" could substitute with minor edits. Score reflects closure participation and thematic coherence, capped by low middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The radio frequencies are present in at least five beats: initial broadcasts, sending riddles to Kestrel, braiding call-and-answer across rooftops, threading ancient shadows into Kestrel's song, and the collaborative final broadcast. The method shapes tactics (how the narrator reaches listeners, teaches harmony, counters the council) and is integral to the closure plan ("keep singing truth through fragmented radio frequencies"). Early signal, multiple causal beats, and closure linkage are strong. Swappability is low—removing it collapses the story's central mechanism. Minor penalty for summary-only treatment of some beats (harmony teaching is told, not shown), but overall integration is solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is present throughout: the narrator keeps it alive, visitors climb to it, it houses antennas and the map desk, the council sends cutters to starve it, lightning protects it, and the morning-after scene grounds the closure. The setting supplies resources (antennas, elevation, storm energy) that enable the resistance and constrain the council's approach. Spatial choreography is clear (above clouds, portico entrance, desk, vault). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage are exemplary. The setting is indispensable—removing it breaks the storm-broadcast logic and the symbolic height/isolation dynamic. Cost is visible (cutters, cracked glass).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" frames the timeframe and is repeated twice, marking the piece as a span rather than a single incident. The passage of time is legible (Kestrel grows tall, districts form allegiance, council escalates from cutters to traitors to march), but no live clock tightens decisions—events could be reordered without breaking causality. Setup is clear, closure references the span ("when the council marched"), but middle beats do not use time pressure as a constraint. The element shapes scope more than tactics. Two-gate presence and thematic coherence place it in mid-band, capped by lack of urgency-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrator's desire "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early, drives action (collecting myths, sending riddles, opening the vault of shadows, stitching the chorus), and is repriced at closure ("ancient shadows not as chains but as blueprints"). The motivation shapes stakes and is dramatized through choices, though internal conflict or friction between this want and another is minimal. Setup, middle beats (vault use), and closure linkage are solid. Swappability is moderate—"build a better future from the past" could substitute with edits. Cost connection is conceptual (visibility, risk of misuse) rather than visceral. Score reflects strong beat involvement and closure repricing, capped by low on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is embodied in images (tin kite of spoons, paper storm crane, "honest paint") and the narrator's self-description, and modulates with pressure (playful details coexist with violence, the ending balances "tinker joy and soldier aim"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image's repricing of transparency as craft. However, tonal modulation is subtle rather than dramatic—high-pressure beats (council attack, Kestrel's injury) maintain the same lyric register without sharper compression or rawness. Present in setup and closure, less dynamically in middle beats. Two-gate presence and thematic coherence support mid-band; cap reflects modest pressure-driven shift.</comment>
