<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and distinctive—"hands practiced at weighing evidence and a heart trained to pretend" establishes her professional-emotional split early. Her internal conflict between empire complicity and ethical obligation drives the climactic choice to play and melt the violin. Embodiment is strong ("mulberry ache, a bruised scent that catches in the hinge of breath"), and the telepathic-plant trait generates micro-choices (consulting jasmine, reading coffee stains) that alter present stance. Minor slip: the director's brief appearance at the end feels underdeveloped; his "frowns like weather learning itself" is evocative but his presence doesn't meaningfully pressure the protagonist's already-completed act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure—density builds through plant communion, stain-reading, and the violin's melting until the final act crystallizes the ethical stance. Orientation anchors (provenance researcher, velvet observatory, midsummer night, donors at dawn) land cleanly in the opening stanza. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist plays, melts the violin, returns it to the river, and walks away—a renunciation that forecloses the empire's claim with visible cost (the artifact destroyed, her complicity ended, "the decision hurts"). One small friction: the director's late entrance and his ankle-tangled moment feel like a micro-turn rather than integral pressure, slightly loosening the single-scene window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is sensuously specific ("night smells of wool and cosmic dust," "damp velvet") and the violin's ice-crystal materiality directly enables the climax—it must melt to fulfill the pledge. Micro-setting (desk fern, night jasmine, courtyard vines, coffee saucers) functions as active infrastructure: plants propagate the music "root to root, leaf to leaf," making the setting a co-agent in the closure. The river at dawn provides the spatial goal and baptismal closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional-mystic lens (scent, texture, light over generic visuals).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "weigh a dream against an empire" and "decide before the promise loses its glow." Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's solitary deliberation, plant consultation, and coffee-stain divination, then crystallizes in the act of playing—one meaningful tightening that narrows options (play and melt vs. preserve and enable theft). The cost is legible: the violin becomes "a handful of shining rivulets," the empire loses its alibi, and the protagonist accepts "mulberry ache" as the price. Agency is renunciation with visible cost. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single turn (decision to play) suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—ethical complicity, repatriation, and the empire's theft rebranded as care—emerges through concrete images (ice violin, coffee-stain maps, plant witnesses) rather than assertion. The "perforated destiny" motif and the repeated question "who promised what to whom, and who kept the promise" frame the piece without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the protagonist keeps the mountain people's pledge by playing and melting the violin, propagating the message through roots, and baptizing stones with the meltwater. "The promise, having been kept, keeps its glow" reweights the opening's urgency with Conceptual Repricing—the cost is visible (artifact destroyed) and the thematic question lands without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, psychic distance intimate and consistent. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinctive: professional provenance vocabulary ("authenticate the chain of ownership, initials and seals") interwoven with lyric-mystic diction ("vow waiting to be kept," "mulberry ache"). Purposeful compression and patterned line breaks serve the accumulative design; the piece teaches its cadence early ("I came early to weigh a dream against an empire") and maintains it through closure. Free indirect blurs slightly when plants "speak" ("Your hands can propagate what truth the empire cannot catalog, it says"), but the convention is taught and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("transparent violin made of ice crystal, cold as confession," "rain formed brown galaxies on my desk"). Two friction points lower the score from 8+: (1) minor paraphrase loop in the coffee-stain sequence ("The stains are maps… inviting a thumb to tear… a dotted arch… All maps point to a single uncut line that my thumb now cannot resist")—the "map/line/thumb" cluster repeats conceptually across four lines without added pressure; (2) occasional elevated diction that edges toward over-writing ("stations of return," "netted city"). Clarity remains high and no artifacts touch the closure beat, so the penalty is modest. Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of provenance research, accidental plant telepathy, ice-crystal instrument, and repatriation ethics feels non-obvious and purposeful. The "accidentally telepathic with plants when a hurricane rearranged the library roof" origin is specific and grounded, avoiding generic mystic-gift tropes. The perforated-destiny motif and coffee-stain divination are fresh inflections on fate-reading. Risk-taking (lyric density, mystical realism within a museum heist frame) heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The final image—meltwater baptizing stones, roots singing memory forward—transforms the repatriation premise into an ecological act of witness, which feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The provenance researcher's professional role frames the ethical conflict from the first line and her expertise ("authenticate the chain of ownership") is dramatized in the choice to reject that trade and play the violin. Her decision to consult plants and coffee stains (rather than seals and signatures) is character-specific and drives the key turn. She appears in setup, middle deliberation, and closure action. Cost is visible: she abandons her museum role, destroys the artifact, and walks away. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The transparent violin made of ice crystal is introduced early ("rests on velvet like a small moon"), handled in the climactic beat (lifted, bowed, played), and its melting constitutes the closure's physical cost. Its material properties (ice that melts when played) are mechanically essential—no other instrument could deliver this exact closure. The "ribbon of light hums like a vow" charges it with thematic weight, and the meltwater's return to the river completes the repatriation arc. Indispensable to story logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Perforated destiny is seeded early ("trace the perforated destiny punched into every choice"), recurs in the coffee-stain divination ("pooled darkness I see perforations, a dotted arch"), and the protagonist follows "the dotted arch in my stain map to the morning river." It shapes her decision method and provides the lyric through-line. However, it functions more as thematic resonance than as a constraint that narrows tactics—she could have made the same choice without the metaphor. Present across setup, middle, and ending, but the stakes would hold if reworded. Solid lyric reprise, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accidentally telepathic with plants is introduced with a specific origin ("hurricane rearranged the library roof"), enables multiple middle beats (ficus memories, jasmine counsel, ivy naming "stations of return"), and the plant network propagates the violin's message at closure ("root to root, leaf to leaf"). The trait generates visible costs (she must consult plants rather than archive evidence) and constrains her method. It appears in setup, drives the divination sequence, and the vines' "green applause" validates her choice at the end. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Propagate is introduced as the jasmine's instruction ("Your hands can propagate what truth the empire cannot catalog"), enacted when the protagonist plays and "the plants propagate it through their netted city," and the ending confirms "The plants keep singing the memory forward, a lineage of leaves promising winter." The action is causally active: it transforms the violin's single performance into distributed ecological witness. Appears in middle and closure, shapes the final image's charge. Highly specific; no synonym (spread, share, transmit) would carry the botanical and generational weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reading the future in coffee stains is seeded early ("I read the future in coffee stains, and the leaves nod or shiver agreement"), demonstrated in the pivotal divination sequence ("I set out the saucers and pour coffee… In the pooled darkness I see perforations, a dotted arch"), and the dried map at the end confirms its use ("I walk the bank until the stain map dries, its perforations gone"). The method shapes her decision to act and provides the spatial guide to the river. It constrains her approach (she cannot rely on empire records) and the cost is felt (the map's erasure signals irreversibility). Appears in setup, middle turn, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is established in the opening line and provides the spatial anchor for the entire narrative. The setting's details (velvet that dampens and betrays her act, the courtyard vines, the observatory bells at the end) are woven through action. Midsummer frames the thematic urgency (the mountain people's pledge to "return our winter in song" when "summer scorches the old guilt away"). The director notices "damp velvet," linking setting to consequence. The observatory as the empire's showcase charges the transgressive act. Present across setup, action, and ending; constrains and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the promise loses its glow" is introduced early and creates immediate urgency. The phrase recurs at closure ("the promise, having been kept, keeps its glow"), bookending the narrative and affirming that the deadline shaped her choice. The ticking clock (donors arriving at dawn) is mentioned twice and tightens the window for action. The director's late entrance (pausing "because the night jasmine has tangled his ankle") signals time running out. The constraint is felt: she must act now, in solitude, or lose the chance. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure validation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to weigh a dream against an empire is articulated in the opening ("I came early to weigh a dream against an empire") and enacted throughout: she weighs the mountain people's pledge against the museum's alibi, consults plants and coffee stains, and plays the violin despite the cost. The motivation generates friction (her professional role vs. ethical imperative) and drives the climactic choice. The ending confirms the decision ("I have done what I came to do, to weigh a dream against an empire, and decide"). Visible cost (artifact destroyed, complicity renounced) and the "mulberry ache" embody the emotional price. Essential to setup, escalation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mulberry ache is introduced mid-narrative ("a mulberry ache, a bruised scent that catches in the hinge of breath"), recurs near the end ("the hurt is mulberry ache, thick sweet and stained with sky"), and charges the final emotional register. The tone is coherent—melancholy, sensuous, ethically weighted—and modulates subtly as pressure builds (early contemplation → plant communion → performance → renunciation). The final image ("promise, having been kept, keeps its glow") resolves the ache into bittersweet fulfillment. The metaphor is specific and apt, blending pain and richness. Present in middle and ending; elevates the closure's emotional texture.</comment>
