<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and particularized—"trust cracked like shell, so I gathered the shards in shoeboxes" embodies emotion through specific action. Internal contradiction operates well: the impulse to refuse Ezra's request conflicts with the attic's unspoken demand and the melody's echo of Mara. The final choice to send Thimble and accept Ezra's grip as balance feels earned by the prior causality of lost trust and the meteorite's anchoring function. Minor: some reflection edges toward summary rather than dramatized micro-choices, but the stakes remain clear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ledger of safe returns and teaching balance represent a stance crystallization with felt cost—the narrator moves from isolated keeper of ghosts to someone who lends balance and maps harmony again. The accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through Ezra's arrival, the meteorite's anchoring function, the confession about Mara, and Thimble's return with a reply. Cost is visible in the confession itself and in the risk of reopening paper trails. Orientation is clear early (attic, pigeons, scale, meteorite). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator tells Ezra about Mara and Ezra "did not try to edit my ghosts"—this changes the narrator's willingness to act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains and charges multiple choices: cedar drawers repurposed from card catalogs teach navigation history, the skylight and dust motes provide the training method that shapes bird memory, and the meteorite chip anchors the scale—each detail functions tactically. The final image ("keep the ledger of safe returns… and teach balance by mapping the swirl of dust motes") directly links the micro-setting to closure. Spatial choreography is coherent (scale, window, rafters, ledger pages). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's professional priorities without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve echoes of lost songs while navigating the危险 of paper trails—is signaled early and tightens when Ezra's melody traces "intervals Mara used to favor." Pressure escalates through the narrator's internal conflict (refuse versus trust again), the meteorite's anchoring function, and the storm that tests Thimble's return. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to send the bird after confessing about Mara, and that choice forecloses the path of pure isolation. Cost is legible in the confession itself and in the resumed practice of mapping harmony. One meaningful deepening occurs when "learning to trust again" shifts from Ezra's need to the narrator's parallel journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: paper trails as both record and snare, trust as fugitive/lent balance, meteorite chip as cold anchor against crosswinds. The final image—"keep the ledger of safe returns… and teach balance by mapping the swirl of dust motes"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one rebuilds trust after betrayal, reweighting the opening's "blooming withering" cycle without stating a moral. The melody's minor thirds "that lifted and fell like wings" integrates song, flight, and emotional arc. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending; the recurrence of "learning to trust again" and "balance" accumulates pressure rather than summarizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: poetic compression ("blooming withering," "sympathy, the ache of a note seeking its echo") remains controlled and legible throughout. POV is stable; perceptual signature is character-specific (navigation by dust motes, trust as fugitive, ledger margins as charts). Diction stays within the narrator's register—no sudden academic intrusions. Purposeful compression in lines like "She vanished into a calendar square" and "trust cracked like shell" serve emotional precision without obscuring causality. The final paragraph's rhythm modulates to closure cadence without losing texture. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I tell," "I learned") are acceptable here as voice-motivated anchors rather than dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, stakes, or setting without padding. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. The metaphor chain around paper trails, echoes, and balance coheres without contradiction. Minor deductions: "blooming withering" as a coined term appears three times but only the final use reweights meaning; the middle mention feels slightly ornamental. A few near-paraphrase moments in the Mara backstory section ("She vanished… / …I claimed other towns and fathers") could compress further. No template cadence, loops, or artifacting. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeons, meteorite chip as scale weight, dust-mote navigation, and the metaphor of paper trails as both archive and snare feels specific and non-obvious. The emotional particulars—trust as shoeboxed shards, melody intervals that mirror wing motion—avoid generic templates. The piece transforms the "wounded keeper" trope through the tactile world of card catalogs, waxed capsules, and silver thread. Risk-taking in the compressed, lyric register heightens stakes without gimmickry. The conceptual turn from "paper trails can be snares" to "keep the ledger of safe returns" is earned in hindsight and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courier pigeon trainer character drives key turns: chooses to weigh Ezra's envelope with the meteorite, confesses about Mara (shifting tactics from refusal to trust), steadies arm with Ezra's help, and returns to "teach balance" at closure. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending. Choices alter tactics and reweigh the dominant stake. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Mars meteorite chip appears in at least four beats: steadies the scale pan, is claimed as superstition (while truth "hums through the metal"), is taped inside the capsule cap to anchor against crosswinds, and implicitly underwrites the final ledger-keeping of "balance." Early signal, middle use constrains tactics (weight/anchor function), and the closure image of teaching balance recalls its gravitational anchoring. Specific, irreplaceable properties matter (cold, red, gravitational metaphor). Cost connection: its use enables risk.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Paper trails shape stakes explicitly: "Paper trails can be snares, and we were caught"; Ezra fears her brother is "discovered by shipping logs, search results, and the arithmetic of maps"; the narrator keeps "the ledger of safe returns, the paper trails of harmony." The concept narrows options (unmarked delivery chosen over post/phone) and charges the closure image. Present in setup (card catalogs, ledger pages), complicates middle choice, and reweights at ending. High causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" appears once as explicit statement ("one reinvents personal history when the true one is hunted") and enables the narrator's survival tactic ("I claimed other towns and fathers"). It constrains present trust and motivates the choice to help Ezra despite fear. Present in backstory with on-page cost (isolation, speaking more to wings than people). Middle development is implied rather than dramatized in a second beat, and closure participation is oblique. Functional but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Balance" drives multiple beats: weighing Ezra's envelope with the meteorite, the narrator's attempt to "balance obligation and mercy," Ezra lending balance by holding the frame, and the closing commitment to "teach balance by mapping the swirl of dust motes." Early signal, shapes middle tactics (scale use, mutual support), and charges the final image with reweighted meaning. The action redefines options: from isolated keeper to collaborative teacher. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes under the skylight is signaled early ("I learned navigation by mapping the swirl of dust motes"), used in middle training ("my birds study those eddies until memory corners them"), and returns in the closure line as the teaching method. The mechanics matter: dust spirals as navigation curriculum. Present in setup and ending with clear lyric reprise that reweights the stake. Middle development is slightly summary but the method's mechanics constrain bird training. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic supplies resources and pressures: folios/feathers establish dual archive, roof timbers "keep names" (memory metaphor), cedar drawers from card catalogs house pigeons and echo paper-trail history, ledger-page margins serve as charts, and the skylight provides the dust-navigation well. Setting choices shape tactics (repurposed drawers, scale use, window for launch) and charge the final image of ledger-keeping. Early anchor, middle constraint, and closure participation. Micro-setting elements (scale, window, drawers) function tactically across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" is Ezra's stated desire and becomes the narrator's parallel journey by the ending. It brackets the narrative arc and reweights in the final line. The timeframe is more thematic than tactical—it does not create a live clock that alters moves beat-by-beat—but it does frame the emotional stake and reappears with added meaning at closure. Lyric reprise with some cost legibility. Functional early-to-final structure, but middle urgency is low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is stated early ("I fly them for one reason only"), dramatized through the Mara backstory (singing that went wordless after betrayal), tested in the choice to send Ezra's melody despite fear, and reweighted at closure as "the paper trails of harmony." The motivation is conflicted: desire to preserve versus fear of paper trails. Friction between want and cost is visible in the confession scene and the risk taken. Early signal, middle choice pressure, closure linkage. High causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" is named early as the attic's breath ("life sprouting from faithful decay"), reappears at the storm-watch moment ("the blooming withering hour when everything is almost its own memory"), and implicitly underwrites the closure image of teaching balance through dust and ledger-keeping. The tone modulates coherently—lyric compression holds through turns, and the final image charges the dual life/decay cycle with renewed purpose. Consistent through pressure and integrated into the ending's resonance. Strong cohesion and closure linkage.</comment>
