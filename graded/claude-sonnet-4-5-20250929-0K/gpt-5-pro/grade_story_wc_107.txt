<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The glassblower's interiority is present and textured through specifics like holding the bookmark with her teeth and narrating to empty chairs, and her reflective mode is anchored to present actions. However, the protagonist remains contemplative rather than pressured by contradiction; the choice to "craft safe zones for inquiry" unfolds as a patient demonstration rather than a dilemma that forces competing goods or visible sacrifice on the page. The final choice—"I will count breaths until inquiry simply feels like home"—reads as gentle arrival rather than a renunciation or trade-off, so Q1 caps below high-band entry despite strong voice texture.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens through drip-timed beats and repeated turns with the bookmark, lamp, and bells. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis (continuing the work despite conditions) with quiet cost implied in the phrase "patient as a tide pool, brave as a breath." The cost, however, remains oblique—no on-page line names a specific forfeiture, social price, or visible renunciation; the final image reconfigures tone but not options. Under the accumulative lens, the piece coheres, but the cost proof test shows only implied persistence rather than legible sacrifice, capping Q2 at mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The abandoned control room supplies concrete details—rafters, gauges, ducts, intercom—that anchor the glassblowing action and constrain choice (no generator reliability, ice melt as clock, pooled water reflecting flame). The cracked leather bookmark functions as micro-setting, held in the teeth during marver work, charging the final promise. The setting participates in the closure image ("puddles mirror the sky") and ties the environment to the protagonist's reflective stance, satisfying the 9+ gate criteria of constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—"craft safe zones for inquiry"—is signaled early and sustained through the making of three bells. The escalation under the accumulative lens shows one meaningful deepening: moving from solitary work to writing a note inviting strangers ("Please enter...heat is shared"). The piece lacks a visible trade-off or narrowing; the generator coughs but obeys, no material is wasted, no question remains unanswered with on-page friction. The tightening is present but gentle, so Q4 remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring bookmark, drips as metronome, and the contrast between the "crowded studio with brash voices" and the ruin's patient silence. The question "Who benefits when heat is hoarded" is asked aloud and answered through the act of making sheltering bells. The final image—"my questions mirror my steadier hands"—offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question without summary, and the piece resists simplification by weaving mercy, resistance, and shared warmth into craft particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "We do not blow to impress, we blow to listen" and the theatrical self-narration ("Cue the oxygen") establish a consistent perceptual signature. Free indirect thought is clean, and the bookmark's "taste of old oil and library dust" grounds reflection in sensory present. Reflection percentage exceeds 30% but every beat anchors in present action (lighting lamp, opening valve, rolling rod) and micro-choices alter tactics (singing to the generator, counting breaths), satisfying the BRR expanded mode. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Clarity and rhythm are strong in many beats ("ice was loosening its grip on the rafters, clicking like timid fingernails"), but paraphrase loops appear: "The answer arrives as a rattle...Back then, I silenced my questions" recounts rather than dramatizes the memory's pressure. Template cadence runs in the "Cue the oxygen...Cue the fire...Cue the turn" sequence without clear payoff that reweights stakes. Several lines restate gentleness and patience ("patient," "slow," "kindly") in adjacent paragraphs. Applying the paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties (−0.2, −0.4) and the Non-closure Accumulation Cap yields a mid-6 score.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of glassblowing craft with the "safe zones for inquiry" premise is specific and grounded in verifiable detail (marver, torch mechanics, sixteen-breath count), transforming the art-as-metaphor trope through embodied particulars. The theatrical self-narration ("Ladies and gentlemen, we begin...") and the bookmark-as-anchor are fresh inflections. However, the emotional arc—solitary artist finds peace and opens space for others—follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious moral calculus or high-risk structural choice. The piece is polished and particular but does not transform its premise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The contemplative glassblower is present throughout, making micro-choices (lighting the lamp, opening the valve, writing the invitation note) that advance the work. Setup is immediate; development beats include singing to the generator and counting breaths to steady the curve. The final paragraph shows the character pledging to continue ("Tomorrow I will read the manual again"), a stance crystallization that participates in closure. However, the choices are patient demonstrations rather than high-stakes turns that narrow options or impose visible cost, capping the element in the mid-5s under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The cracked leather bookmark appears in four distinct beats: wedged in the manual (setup), held in teeth during marver work (tactile anchor), shadowing the cooled bell, and referenced in the final paragraph ("the bookmark soft between my teeth"). Its presence constrains action (multitasking with mouth) and charges the closure by linking mentor's teaching to present persistence. The element is irreplaceable—"taste of old oil and library dust" is specific and sensory—and participates in the ending's pledge, satisfying all three gates and earning strong causal linkage credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The core concept "thawing heart" appears explicitly once ("the thawing heart that glass wants") and is echoed in the ice-melting timeframe and the phrase "resistance warms." It shapes atmosphere and tone but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter options on the page; the protagonist's work proceeds identically whether the heart thaws or not. The concept functions as thematic layer rather than causal pressure, placing it in the low-functional band despite lyric resonance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The attribute "thoughtfully spirited" is signaled in the phrase "thoughtfully spirited stubbornness" (setup after 40% mark) and demonstrated through the self-narration and singing to the generator. It enables persistence but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the same beats would function if the character were patient, determined, or earnest. Late introduction and swappability with near-synonyms cap the element at mid-functional despite coherent presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>The action "abandon" appears thematically ("I do not abandon the project") and in the reflection on silencing questions to "please the inspectors." It is signaled but does not drive a major turn; the protagonist's choice is to continue rather than to stop, so the action's causal role is inverse (renunciation of abandonment). The pledge not to abandon is setup; no middle beat tests it with friction, and the closure affirms continuation. The element is present but replaceable with "persist" or "commit" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The method "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is introduced early ("Ladies and gentlemen, we begin by sweeping") and recurs in "Cue the oxygen...Cue the fire...Cue the turn" and the address to empty chairs. It shapes the voice texture and serves as a coping mechanism under solitude, but it does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the outcome; the glass would blow the same without narration. The method charges the tone and middle beats, satisfying setup and development, but closure participation is thematic rather than causal, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The abandoned control room supplies the rafters, gauges, panels, intercom, and generator that anchor action and impose constraints (no reliable power, drips as clock, cold that makes fire shy). The room participates in closure when the bells are set over the dead intercom and the final image mirrors inside/outside ("puddles mirror the sky, and inside, my questions mirror my steadier hands"). The setting is irreplaceable—no studio or workshop would supply the ruin's thematic charge—and its constraints shape tactics (singing to the generator, using the manual's page). All three gates satisfied with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "during ice melting" is signaled immediately ("Ice was loosening its grip") and recurs in drip metronomes and the final "sheets like applause." It structures the atmosphere and paces the work, but it does not tighten a decision or force a trade-off; the protagonist could complete the same beats at any season. The element provides a lyric frame and charges the final image through the inside/outside mirror, earning mid-band credit for setup, development (drips mark time during shaping), and closure participation without strict causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to craft safe zones for inquiry" is stated explicitly ("I came here to craft safe zones...domes where curiosity can breathe") and demonstrated through making three bells and writing the invitation note. It drives the accumulative beats and participates in closure ("Please enter...heat is shared"). However, it is never conflicted on the page—no competing desire, no cost that tests commitment—so the element remains a declared goal rather than a dramatized friction. Setup and payoff are strong; middle friction is absent, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The tone "weighty lightness" is coherent through paradoxes like "patient as a tide pool, brave as a breath" and "Weight presses on me, then lifts, a weighty lightness that is almost music." It modulates with the drip tempo and the shifts from memory ("hail" of critique) to present patience, and it charges the final image ("my questions mirror my steadier hands"). The tone is consistent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens without contradiction, and it participates in closure through the buoyant pledge, earning solid integration credit across all three gates.</comment>
