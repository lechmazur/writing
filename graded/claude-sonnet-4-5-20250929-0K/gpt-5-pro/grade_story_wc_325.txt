<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivo's interiority is concrete and character-particular: his claustrophobia is embodied through breath-counting and the caves' pressure on his ribs, and his devotion to Ada and Sorel is dramatized through ritual (mugs, names spoken aloud). The micro-choices—waiting for tidal slack, chilling then warming housings, refusing to export—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when fear "lined itself up behind duty and followed like a trained dog," showing struggle without resolution into tidy stages. Minor slip: Ada and Sorel remain vivid through their skills but lack on-page pressure to test Ivo's choices directly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (tidal rhythm, phase transitions, fragments of technical memory) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ivo's promise to return, his acceptance that the point is vigil not ownership, and the final image of attention "riding the sheath" reconfigure the premise with felt cost—he remains claustrophobic, the archives won't speak easily, and he must keep coming. One meaningful deepening occurs when the electroscope flickers and the file index wakes, reweighting absence into presence. Cost is visible: he closes notebooks without exporting, leaves before the tide, and binds himself to repeated return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The caves, tidal clock, and steel console constrain every choice: Ivo waits for exact slack, tracks the siren's rise, and must leave before flooding. The mica electroscope and copper housings are handled across beats and their physical states (chill, warmth, charge) alter tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through professional priorities—air currents, cable hum, mineral taste—and accumulates pressure without tourism. The micro-setting (body as instrument: cupped ear, hands warming copper) and recurring objects (mugs, thermos, canned cold) charge the final image when spray and steam mark the threshold. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to coax back colleagues' encoded traces and hold vigil. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through tidal urgency, the electroscope's flicker, and the file index waking—each tightens options. Ivo's agency is renunciation with visible cost: he does not print or export, promising instead to return and "keep vigil while it lived." The choice to leave at the siren's toll forecloses permanence but honors presence. One friction: the tightening is more temporal (flood threat) than driven by Ivo's internal contradictions, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—fidelity to the unremembered—emerges through concrete particulars: spoken names, filled mugs, phase-transition coaxing, and the refusal to own data. The final image (attention riding the cable sheath "where barnacles could not cling") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture (mugs set for absent colleagues) and the electroscope's agreement-flicker. No thematic echo or moralizing; the story commits fully to its premise and follows implications (repeated returns, no export) without retreat. Minor gap from 9+: the theme of institutional erasure is richly embodied but the ending's conceptual repricing could press harder on what "the archives learned to say their names" costs Ivo beyond repeated visits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is selective and technical (air currents, cable hum, phase vocabulary). Diction remains within Ivo's plausible lexicon—specialist terms (sump, littoral, phase, amplitude) anchor voice without drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during ritual moments (mugs, whispering), pulled back during technical work. Syntax reflects his disciplined, patient stance. One friction: some figurative constructions ("crashing hush," "secret tongue," "pale fish turning") recur across emotional registers without clear escalation, risking ornamental density. No head-hopping, tense is stable, and the compression during peak stress (file index waking) stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the surf kept time above him" anchors setting, urgency, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is strong in peak beats. One distinct issue: figurative language appears frequently without always advancing pressure—"crashing hush" recurs four times, "phase transitions" structures multiple beats, and several metaphors (cables as veins, walkway as tongue, electroscope as pale fish) feel decorative rather than causal. This density doesn't obscure closure but risks overwriting. Apply baseline artifact deduction (−0.6) for metaphor saturation across non-closure beats, keeping the score in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—vigil for institutional erasure via physical/technical ritual in tidal caves—is specific and non-obvious. Phase-transition mechanics (frost/drip/steam, chill then warm copper) transform the familiar "visiting a lost site" premise into something particular. Ivo's claustrophobia and the electroscope (analog over screens) add fresh inflection. The final image (attention riding undersea cables) feels earned and memorable. Risk-taking in structure (Accumulative lens, technical idiom, refusal of causal rescue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, justifying a small within-band lift. One friction: the "unremembered colleague" frame echoes common institutional-memory narratives; transformation through phase mechanics and tidal constraint rescues it from derivative mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Claustrophobic spelunker. Setup: established opening ("claustrophobic spelunker who took slow breaths"). Development: constrains choices—he counts seconds, waits for exact slack, maps caves "with tenderness" because fear taught him. Payoff: closure mentions "still a claustrophobic spelunker, still wary of the dark compressing his ribs, but the fear now lined itself up behind duty." Causal pressure across three beats; the trait enables tactics (listening, patience) and charges the final stance. Specific cost: enduring fear to perform vigil. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.4 = baseline ~7.3; strong irreplaceability (fear as both obstacle and teacher) +0.5 → 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Codex margin illuminant gold fleck. Setup: introduced early ("In his pocket lay a codex margin illuminant gold fleck, pressed under mica, the trembling needle of a crude electroscope"). Development: used in middle beat—set on console, fleck lifts and quivers showing charge, then flickers "as if agreeing" when names are spoken. Payoff: not explicitly mentioned in closure; implied as part of the instruments he closes. Two beats, enables detection of signal presence, but the object could be replaced with any analog charge detector. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal involvement +0.6, specificity moderate +0.4 = ~6.4. Swappability and no direct closure mention prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Undersea cables. Setup: framed in opening third (facility "guided the first continental undersea cables," cables as "buried veins"). Development: multiple beats—Ivo listens to cables "crooning interference and loss," works to coax data through them, the pattern (short long long short) rises from them, they carry the vigil's "shimmer of attention." Payoff: closure image depends on them ("the undersea cables hummed across continents...and also this small vigil"). Causal pressure throughout; they are the literal medium of recovery and the thematic vessel. Early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection +0.5 = ~8.2. The entire story's logic hinges on their presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tracks invisible things. Setup: stated early ("people once called him, because he tracks invisible things"). Development: enables multiple tactics—listening to air currents, cable hum, setting the electroscope to show charge, interpreting phase and amplitude. Payoff: the ending references "tracking what could not be seen." Visible across three beats, the trait constrains method (analog instruments, patience) and is tied to his professional identity. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal enablement +1.0, closure mention +0.8, cost (must use slow, archaic methods) +0.3 = ~7.1. Slight swappability (could be "sensitive listener") and moderate specificity keep it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Return. Setup: signaled early in motivation ("to stand by the unremembered") and the tidal rhythm implies repetition. Development: the action structures every beat—he comes to return data, opens conduction by reversing phase (frost to steam), and the verb "Return" is whispered as a promise before leaving. Payoff: closure hinges on it ("promising to come back the next slack and stand again beside the names," "he would keep coming"). The entire narrative arc is an act of return (to the site, to the colleagues, through phase reversal) and the ending commits to repeated return. Early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure centrality +1.8, irreplaceability +0.9, cost (endurance, repetition without resolution) +0.6 = ~8.9. Removing "Return" breaks the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Through phase transitions. Setup: introduced early ("Return what the sea had taken by coaxing data back through phase transitions, from frost to drip to steam"). Development: the method structures the central beat—he chills copper with canned cold, then warms with hands, causing hairline fractures to breathe and instruments to remember. Payoff: the threshold moment uses phase language ("phase transitions of light and water, where spray cooled his skin and steam warmed his mask"). The mechanics shape tactics and are irreplaceable. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure participation +1.0, specificity +0.7, cost (requires precise timing, physical contact) +0.4 = ~7.6. Could score higher if the final image depended more explicitly on phase logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Forgotten research facility. Setup: named and described in opening ("the mouth of the forgotten research facility," history of cable parsing). Development: the setting supplies resources (steel console, speakers, copper housings) and constraints (flooding threat, mineral air). Ivo's memory of "the day the lights blinked out" personalizes it. Payoff: the facility's forgottenness is the premise of vigil; the ending promises return "until the archives learned to say their names." The space pressures every choice via tidal clock and equipment state. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6, cost (dangerous, unstable) +0.5 = ~8.4. Micro-setting (console, housings) alters tactics at each turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Between tidal changes. Setup: established immediately ("At low tide the caves breathed," Ivo "counted the seconds between tidal changes"). Development: the timeframe tightens every decision—he waits for "exact minute," works faster knowing "everything here lived on the edge of flooding," and the siren tolls the rise forcing him to leave. Payoff: closure commits to the rhythm ("Between tidal changes he would keep coming"). The clock is live, tracked, and shapes all tactics. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.8, cost (forces incomplete work, repeated return) +0.6 = ~8.7. Removing the tidal clock breaks escalation and the entire narrative structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To stand by the unremembered. Setup: stated early ("He was here to stand by the unremembered"). Development: dramatized through choices—setting mugs, speaking names aloud, refusing to export data, working to hear colleagues' laughter in the signal. Internal friction: the desire to recover conflicts with the tidal clock and the impossibility of permanence. Payoff: the ending commits to repeated vigil ("keep coming...until the archives learned to say their names"). The motivation drives every beat and the final renunciation (not owning, but standing). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure centrality +1.6, cost (endurance without resolution, repeated exposure to claustrophobia) +0.5 = ~8.3. Friction between want (permanence) and reality (tidal limits) is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crashing hush. Setup: established in opening line ("a crashing hush rolling in the dark") and recurs as the surf's rhythm. Development: tone modulates with pressure—the hush "was not silence but a pressure that urged patience," "like a crowd hushes before a name is spoken," and "beat its crashing hush until it felt like a steady hand." Payoff: the oxymoron charges the final image, binding violence (crash) and care (hush) in Ivo's vigil. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and reweights the dominant stake. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, coherence +0.9, closure charge +1.3, specificity +0.6 = ~7.9. The phrase recurs four times, risking decorative density, but each use deepens meaning and the final invocation supports closure without mechanics.</comment>
