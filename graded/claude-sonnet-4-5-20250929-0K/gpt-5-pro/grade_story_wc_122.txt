<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is established early and drives her to the cavern, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("guilt weighed less when shaped like an instrument") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation—"a tremor like a candle deciding to be fire again"—reads as declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Risto functions primarily as facilitator without applying independent pressure or forcing Lena to make a costly trade-off. The change feels asserted by lyric accumulation rather than dramatized through conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear spatial anchoring (cavern, filament, drum) and a coherent arc from numbness to tentative feeling. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (students "leaned forward... faces opened"), reweighting Lena's teaching stance with visible cost (she must now embody vulnerability). However, the middle section loops through similar gestures—hands on drum, vibrations as metaphor—without a decisive narrowing of options or a moment where Lena risks something concrete. The cassette's backward songs and the needle-as-stylus create texture but don't force a choice that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("rooms of hides and wood smelling of rain and hearth," "filament of hush strung between stalactites") and the drum functions as micro-setting that Lena reads "as if a braille river." The setting constrains her method (she must work beneath the filament) and charges the final classroom image where the drum becomes a teaching tool. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The piece does not exceed 7.2 because the environment's role is more atmospheric scaffold than a live constraint that alters Lena's tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting to feeling so her students can find their pulses—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on layered imagery (backward songs, filament, needle tracing) rather than a tightening that forecloses options or imposes visible cost. Lena's agency is largely receptive (pressing play, feeling vibrations) rather than a decision that trades one path for another. The classroom ending shows a shift in her teaching, but the price paid—vulnerability, exposure—is asserted in the final lines rather than tested in the cavern scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of restraint, backward motion, and the "room of restraint where courage could grow against the grain." The filament of hush and the reversed lullabies create a non-literal answer to how feeling returns when space is offered. The final image—students leaning forward, "their town breathed, no longer numb"—resonates without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph's line "that feeling arrives when space is offered a home" tilts slightly toward thematic statement rather than trusting the dramatized particulars to carry the insight, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third, filtered through Lena's tactile and vibrational perception. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("a courteous partner refusing to lead," "a tide reciting its coastline to the moon"). However, elevated metaphor density in high-pressure beats—"absence tug back," "enthrall by composing space around each beat"—risks abstraction that distances the reader from embodied experience. Filter constructions ("she imagined," "she felt") appear frequently without clear purpose, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as polished but occasionally substitutes figurative flourish for concrete sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence in the cavern sequence: multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "He [verb]" across adjacent lines, and the drum's effect is restated in near-synonyms ("mirrored hush," "audibly muted," "patient throbs," "tremor like a candle"). The backward-songs concept and filament mechanics are described rather than made tactile through distinct action. Stock metaphor strings ("grief walking back to its doorway," "timid bird warming its own egg") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she imagined," "she noticed") in high-pressure beats reduce propulsion and trigger template-cadence and paraphrase-loop deductions totaling approximately −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination of deaf music teacher, backward-recorded songs, and a filament that "holds absence" offers a fresh synthesis, and the focus on restraint as a teaching tool avoids the template arc of "disabled character overcomes limitation." However, the core emotional journey—numb teacher rediscovers feeling and inspires students—follows a familiar shape, and the cavern mentor figure (wise craftsman guides seeker) is well-worn. The backward-songs mechanic is introduced but not transformed through specific cost or failure; it works as intended without complication. Specificity in sensory detail (moth silk, winter fog, brass and ash phonograph) elevates execution but does not fully escape the template's gravitational pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout and her journey from numbness to renewed teaching anchors the arc. She makes two key choices: traveling to the cavern and later placing the drum in her classroom. However, both decisions occur at structural hinges rather than under live pressure that forces a costly trade-off. Her role in the cavern is largely receptive—she responds to Risto's gestures and feels the drum's vibrations—without a moment where her agency narrows options or risks failure. The element is essential to the frame but does not drive reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears in the opening (wrapped in her mother's shirt, a guilt token) and is used by Risto as a stylus to trace paths on the drum's rim. It bridges two beats and carries symbolic weight (grief, loss of hearing, now repurposed for restraint). However, its mechanical role is summarized ("used it as a stylus to trace ringed paths") rather than shown as a choice or tactic that alters the drum's effect in a visible way. The element is functional but could be replaced with another scoring tool without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The filament of hush is introduced early, described with vivid specificity ("drawn from moth silk and winter fog, braided until absence held"), and directly shapes Lena's method—she works beneath it, and Risto seals the drum by letting the filament kiss its rim. It reappears in the final school scene as an internalized metaphor ("the drum maker's cavern echoed inside each heart"). The concept constrains Risto's drum-tuning practice and charges the closure image, though its mechanical effect on the drum is told rather than demonstrated through a failed attempt or visible alteration in vibration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" is used as a descriptor for Lena's sensory world in the opening ("Everything felt audibly muted") and reappears when she plays the first beat for her students ("audibly muted, but strong enough to sketch invisible chalk"). The attribute signals restraint and quietness as positive qualities rather than deficits. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it functions as thematic coloring rather than a tactical pressure. The element is present in setup and closure but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once in the cavern scene—"The drum did not roar; it learned to enthrall by composing space around each beat"—and is echoed in the final classroom paragraph where Lena's backward songs "enthrall their waiting air with kindness." The action is described as an effect of the drum's tuning rather than a choice Lena makes or a method she enacts. It serves as thematic vocabulary but does not drive a turn or alter tactics. The element is swappable with "captivate" or "draw in" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are introduced early on the cassette recorder and used in the cavern scene where Lena presses play and feels the "ripples, syllables collapsing into inhalations, grief walking back to its doorway." The method shapes the drum's tuning session and returns in the final classroom scene ("let the backward recorded songs return... to enthrall"). It appears in setup, middle, and closure, contributing to the lyric pattern of reversal and recovery. However, the mechanics—how reversing a lullaby reveals a pulse—are asserted rather than tested through a failed first attempt or a moment where Lena adjusts her approach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is anchored early with sensory and spatial detail (stone breaths, hides and wood, filament strung between stalactites) and provides the resources (drum, filament, Risto's guidance) that Lena needs. The setting constrains her method—she must work beneath the filament—and the cavern's "mirrored hush" becomes an internalized space for her students at closure. The environment is essential to the arc and shapes the tactics of the tuning session. It appears in setup and development and is directly invoked in the final image, meeting all three gates with clear causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" opens the story and is echoed in the final line ("And so the season turned in them as outside"). The timeframe provides lyric bookends and thematic resonance (internal and external change mirroring each other) but does not create urgency or constrain Lena's choices. The cavern visit and the classroom application occur in unspecified sequence without a ticking clock or deadline. The element is present in setup and closure but remains decorative rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena's desire "to defeat emotional numbness" is stated explicitly in dialogue with Risto ("I need to feel again, she wrote, because my students cannot find their pulses") and drives her journey to the cavern. The motivation is present in setup, shapes the middle drum session, and resolves at closure when she feels "a tremor like a candle deciding to be fire again" and her students respond. However, the motivation is told and restated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a moment where feeling returns at a visible cost (e.g., vulnerability, exposure to judgment). The element is essential but not friction-laden.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears as a descriptor for the cavern's atmosphere and recurs in the final classroom scene where "the world kept its tone of mirrored hush." The tone is coherent throughout, modulating from Lena's initial numbness to the "patient throbs" of the drum to the students' quiet opening at closure. The restraint and quietness charge the final image—students leaning forward, town breathing—rather than deflating into flatness. The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the thematic work of space and restraint, meeting all three gates and shaping the ending's emotional register.</comment>
