<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly embodied—"I took responsibility, because responsibility is something you can hold while the cosmos misbehaves"—and contradictory impulses (fatigue versus precision, heroics versus listening) drive the key repair choice. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, earning the pen-warming sequence. Minor deduction: Mara's characterization remains instrumental; her voice and agency serve primarily to anchor the narrator's arc rather than applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (anomaly sings, array gropes backward) and escalates through density increase—wrong seed → unmade call → bent spine → coolant beads. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the past "invited to sit differently" reweights the opening mistake with visible cost (the pen's resurrection, the shuttle's ornamental beads). Orientation anchors are present by line three. One micro turn (pen revival) sets up the final reconfiguration without breaking accumulative coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly flexes as a tide with no moon, the listening well and quiet room are spatially grounded, and the pen's exotic nib ("storm maps from a world that never hardened") constrains the repair choice—its dried reservoir is the material obstacle the protagonist must solve. The coolant beads frozen into "harmless ornaments" charge the final image. Minor gap: the docking spine's physical layout remains abstract; clearer spatial choreography of the shuttle's approach would elevate further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair the array's error) is signaled early and tightens when "contingency net had tightened into a snare of equivalences." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: fatigue causes the mistake, then active pen-warming and cartridge unbending alter tactics. The resolution earns cost—five safe tomorrows traded, ornamental beads cataloged—and the final docking forecloses the path of heroic overwrite. One meaningful deepening (pen revival) suffices for this length under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (negotiation with irreversible change, repair as accompaniment rather than erasure) emerges from particulars—the nine written beside the one, not overwriting but proposing a duet. The pen's return reweights its gift-meaning ("please unbend what can bend, and release what refuses rescue") without moralizing. The final image—"the past had not been corrected; it had been invited to sit differently"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening mistake. No thematic echo or label-speak in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "regretful starlight," "strange comfort like a blanket woven from echoes," syntax matching the narrator's ruminative, precise stance. POV modesty holds—inference reads as inference ("Call it superstition, but superstition is just a lover's name for the physics we do not yet model"). Mara's brief dialogue on the comm carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor slip: a few lines edge toward elevated diction ("winnow what holds from what lets go") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally slow momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled (anomaly as choir, pen as rainstick). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "I am confidently uncertain, because certainty closes doors" reads expository in a reflective passage; the phrase "through contingent relationships" recurs three times, twice as near-synonym without fresh pressure. The closure image ("invited to sit differently") is clean and propulsive, so non-closure adjustments remain capped at −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrospective array editing, gravitational anomaly, and pen-as-repair-tool feels specific and non-obvious. The emotional stakes (responsibility as holding, not heroics) transform a familiar regret-and-repair frame through lived detail and the physics of "contingent relationships." Risk-taking in voice (poetic compression, technical idiom) heightens coherence. Minor limit: the frozen coolant beads as ornaments, while resonant, edge toward symbolic convenience—a late motif introduced to harvest closure charge without prior cost-bearing work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter role is established early, frames stakes (harvest regretful starlight, parse scatter into rhythm), and drives two key decisions: taking responsibility for the wrong seed and choosing to unbend the pen rather than force a system override. The role's ethic ("refuse heroics," "thresh meaning from experience") shapes the repair tactic and charges the closure image. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dried-up fountain pen appears in three distinct beats: Mara's gift after the first crisis (establishes meaning), discovery in the quiet room (material obstacle), and the warming/unbending sequence (enables repair). The exotic nib's storm-map etch and chalk-dry reservoir are irreplaceable details that constrain the protagonist's choice. The pen's revival directly shapes the margin-note tactic and the closure reconfiguration. Strong causal pressure, early signal, and closure linkage; the pen could not be swapped without breaking the repair logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Editing history is the story's engine: the retrospective array "gropes backward by editing history through contingent relationships," the wrong seed exhales an alternative past, and the protagonist's repair writes "beside the one, not erasing, proposing a duet." The concept shapes every tactic—unbending over overwriting, accompaniment over deletion—and charges the final reconfiguration ("the past had not been corrected; it had been invited to sit differently"). Indispensable to logic and closure; removing it collapses the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is stated early and motivates the listening ethic ("uncertainty keeps the air moving"), but its constraint is more atmospheric than on-page. The phrase does not visibly narrow a choice or impose cost in a key beat; the protagonist's tactics (pen revival, margin note) could proceed under adjacent traits (patience, humility) with minor edits. Lyric reprise in closure vicinity reweights the opening, qualifying for mid-band, but swappability and lack of distinct causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unbend" drives the story's major turn: the protagonist unbends the pen's cartridge spring, enabling the repair, and earlier Mara's gift instructs "please unbend what can bend." The action is irreplaceable—substituting "fix" or "repair" would lose the thematic and tactical specificity. It appears in setup (Mara's instruction), middle (cartridge unbending), and closure (the docking spine "adjusted by a hair, not a fix, a preference whispered in metal"). Strong causal pressure, early signal, and closure linkage; the story's logic hinges on this exact verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" is signaled early (the array tugs one thread of cause, another unspools), shapes the repair method (system "listens to suggestion and maps new possibility across the old terrain"), and recurs at closure ("through contingent relationships again"). The mechanics matter: the protagonist writes beside the existing log entry, allowing the system to hear accompaniment rather than command. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure; the method is irreplaceable to the tactic, though slightly abstract at peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is established early (sings in a minor key, flexes as a tide), supplies the listening well where the protagonist sits, and flexes again during the pen-warming sequence, applying ambient pressure. It does not directly constrain the repair choice but provides the story's dominant atmosphere and validates the physics of "regretful starlight" curling through it. Present in setup and closure vicinity; it charges the final image (the nearest star pulses against teeth) but could be replaced by another exotic-physics backdrop with moderate edits. Mood and specificity elevate above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after planting the wrong seeds" anchors the entire story: the inciting error has occurred, and all action is response. It tightens the protagonist's urgency (five safe tomorrows traded, the shuttle approach in progress) and shapes the repair tactic—no time for system rewrites, only the smaller kindness of pen revival. The "before the cleanup" beat and "by the time the shuttle finally docked" bracket enforce consequence. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure; removing it would dissolve narrative causality and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is stated twice and dramatized throughout: the protagonist listens to scatter, parses the anomaly's song, and refuses heroics in favor of accompaniment. The motive drives the repair choice—writing beside the one, not overwriting—and charges the closure image ("strange comfort like a blanket woven from echoes"). Visible cost: the protagonist accepts that the past "had not been corrected" but reweighted. Present in setup, multiple middle choices, and payoff with causal pressure and irreplaceability; the exact phrasing recurs with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" appears in the opening (the anomaly's song, the listening well) and returns at closure ("a strange comfort like a blanket woven from echoes"). The tone modulates with pressure—ruminative during reflection, tactile during the pen-warming sequence—and remains coherent through the final reconfiguration. It charges the ending by validating the protagonist's acceptance of imperfect repair. The tone is specific to this narrator's ethic (listening over heroics) and could not be replaced by generic reassurance without flattening the closure effect. Present in setup and payoff with strong closure linkage.</comment>
