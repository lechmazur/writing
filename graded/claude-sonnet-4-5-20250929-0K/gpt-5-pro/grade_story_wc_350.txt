<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is established through lyric gesture—hands smelling of brass, voice folding a room—but her internal contradictions and embodied struggle remain thin. The "empathetically decisive" label is invoked rather than dramatized through simultaneous conflicting impulses. Her choices to climb, lower the weight, and signal the choir advance the plot but lack visceral cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path on the page. The councilman's swift conversion ("he nodded once, twice, tres veces") skips the friction that would test Mara's resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: lyric density and patterned callbacks ("hush of borrowed starlight" opening and near-closing) reweight the bridge-building task. Orientation anchors (Mara, clock tower, night) arrive early. However, the closure unit—bridge completion by morning, cuckoo blessing, grain elevator now saying "puente"—reads as summary told rather than a Decisive Change or Charged Poise dramatized on the page with visible cost. The councilman's reversal and the elevator's "rehabilitation" happen off-stage or in compressed montage, diluting causal pressure at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and grain elevator are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: bevel gears, hoppers, augers, pelts of oats. Sensory selection reflects Mara's POV (brass and paper smells, zodiacal face tilting). The cuckoo clock weight functions as micro-setting when lowered as plumb line, constraining tactics. Spatial choreography—tower, catwalk, elevator—tracks cleanly. The final image of children testing the span like swallows charges the environment with consequence, lifting the category despite some generic lyric phrasing ("vigorous tender").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—constructing a bridge from silos to rehabilitate a conversation—is signaled early. Mara's decision to unshelve voices and lower the weight provides one meaningful tightening. However, the councilman's opposition dissolves without dramatized friction, and the elevator's "loneliness pilled off like old paint" through Mara's choral liturgy is asserted rather than tested. The bridge's completion by morning compresses escalation into summary, making the cost of her night's labor feel told rather than felt in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—passage versus storage, voices as seeds meant to travel—emerges through the bridge construction and interspersed languages without overt moralizing. The cuckoo weight's return as "a promise that measure could also mean mercy" offers a resonant non-literal answer. The grain elevator's polyvocal awakening and the final "puente, mitawa, ours" accumulate symbolic weight. Minor slips: "vigorous tender" feels label-only, and the elevator "rehabilitated by purpose" edges toward abstraction. Still, the piece coheres around its central question of connection across silos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) holds throughout with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature—"voices shelved like constellations," "fear tasted like hulls"—is character-specific. No head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("purpose that matched her pulse," "liturgy for timber, iron, and seed") that strains against immediate embodiment. The grain elevator's dialogue ("Hola…salut…ciao") and Mara's multilingual scales are purposeful but risk slipping into ornament when not anchored in micro-choice. Distance and tense remain stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often effective ("wheat bows to wind," "elevator loomed, a siloed organ") but clusters heavily in many lines without always advancing pressure. Template stems recur: "she [verb], [object]" patterns and "The [noun] [verb]-ed" constructions appear across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops surface: "elevator talks began" / "elevator talks thickened" / "grain elevator talks again" without clear escalation between instances. Propulsion slows in the middle third when exposition ("That was why she kept the choral library") interrupts momentum. No major causality break, but cumulative line-level drag prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—choral librarian rehabilitating a sentient grain elevator through multilingual scales to build a bridge—is specific and non-obvious. The astronomical clock as witness and the cuckoo weight as plumb line show fresh particulars. However, the emotional arc (community united by empathetic artistry overcoming bureaucratic refusal) follows a familiar template, and the councilman's swift conversion lacks the friction that would make the transformation feel earned rather than convenient. Risk-taking in voice and structure is present but not fully integrated with causality at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara appears early, drives multiple beats (climbing, lowering weight, signaling choir), and participates in the ending image. However, her choices lack visible cost or tradeoff; the narrative asserts her empathetic decisiveness rather than dramatizing a moment where that trait forecloses an option. She is present across setup, development, and payoff but functions more as orchestrator than protagonist forced to sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight is introduced in the first third as talisman, lowered as plumb line in a middle beat, and returns in the final paragraph as promise tied in the tower. Its mechanics (weight as measure, patience) shape the bridge-building tactic. Early signal, two-beat use, closure reprise. Cap at ~6.8 because its presence in the ending is symbolic mention rather than causal agent; the bridge would stand without it, and the grandmother's backstory adds thematic color but no on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grain elevator talking in multiple languages is core to stakes and tactics: its loneliness drives Mara's goal, its voice ("Hola…oui, da, si") shapes her multilingual response, and its final utterance ("puente, mitawa, ours") charges the closure image. Setup early, development through dialogue, payoff in the ending line. The concept constrains Mara's method and redefines the town's relationship to the elevator. Strong integration across all three gates with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is labeled in paragraph five but not tested on the page. Mara's actions—climbing, lowering weight, signaling choir—could be read as decisive, but no scene shows her empathy creating a tradeoff or cost (e.g., hearing the elevator's ache does not force her to sacrifice another goal). The trait is asserted in narration ("hearing ache where others heard the groan of rivets") without enabling or constraining a choice with visible consequence. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" appears early as goal ("rehabilitate a conversation") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("elevator, rehabilitated by purpose"). It frames the entire action: Mara's liturgy and the bridge construction are mechanisms of rehabilitation. The action is present across setup, development, and payoff, shaping the dominant stake and the ending. However, the rehabilitation itself is summary-told rather than dramatized in a pivotal beat with visible friction, preventing a score above mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is signaled early ("Waonsila…amigo…pax"), drives middle beats ("Uno…deux…nape…mitakuye" as scaffold counting), and charges the ending ("puente, mitawa, ours"). The method shapes Mara's tactical response to the elevator's polyvocal speech and serves as both bridge-building score and empathetic answer. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. The mechanics matter: each language marks a span or joining, making the method indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is present early as Mara's workspace and framing location. It provides resources (the cuckoo weight, the dial light for the choir, the catwalk) and its gears "listen" and click responsively. The tower appears in the ending image ("tied in the tower as a promise"). Setup, development (choir gathers inside), and closure participation satisfied. However, the tower's constraint on action is mild—Mara could orchestrate from another vantage—so it trends toward essential backdrop rather than indispensable pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" opens and nearly closes the piece, establishing night as the timeframe. The astronomical clock's midnight alignment and dawn arrival bookend the action, providing temporal boundaries. However, the time constraint does not visibly tighten Mara's choices on the page; the work "rose like dawn" in summary without a dramatized race against the clock. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weak. Lyric reprise reweights the frame but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "construct bridges from silos" is stated early and drives her actions: climbing, lowering the weight, summoning the choir, walking the span. The councilman's refusal provides friction, though his reversal is swift. The motivation is present across setup, development, and ending. However, the desire is more told than conflicted—Mara faces no visible tradeoff between bridge-building and another want—so the dramatization lacks the friction that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" is declared as label in one line ("Work rose like dawn, vigorous tender") but the tone modulates across the piece: lyric patience in the opening, urgency when Mara climbs, communal warmth when the choir gathers, blessing at the close. The tone charges the final image (soft cuckoo, children as swallows) and coheres with the dual pressures of empathy and action. However, the label itself is ornamental; the tonal work would stand without it. Tone is present and effective but not indispensable in its exact phrasing.</comment>
