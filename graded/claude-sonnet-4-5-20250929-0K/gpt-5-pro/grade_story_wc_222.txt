<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "apprentice of wonder" identity provides consistent interior filtering, and Kestrel's chivalrous-thief persona is grounded in the driftwood knight confession. Internal conflict appears in "fear was a doorway I longed to open," but the piece leans toward poetic assertion over embodied contradiction—the narrator's fear never visibly complicates a choice on the page. The emotional arc from fear to embrace registers conceptually but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "we amended ourselves to it, and promised to keep learning how to listen" reweights the vow premise with conceptual cost (sameness abandoned, flexibility embraced). Orientation anchors by ~100 words (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when Kestrel's betrayal secret is accepted and the false king melts, opening the stair—this narrows options and charges the final amendment. Cost is legible in the conceptual shift from "fix" to "amend" and the acceptance of wrongness, though the felt price remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire constrains movement and charges the atmosphere throughout; the frozen tide clock at the heart shapes the final amendment action. Micro-setting details (frost blossoming into letters, ice ticking like teeth) anchor perception and pressure. Sensory selection reflects urgency: wind, cold, colors bleeding into wrong constellations. The sundial lid's physical placement in the niche and crown directly affects the closure image ("time dripped sweeter from the ledges").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: amend the vow holding the sky to sameness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spire splits the room into mirrors and false boards, forcing Kestrel to offer his worst secret—this choice narrows options and opens the stair. The final act (placing the queen's secret, fitting the sundial lid) is protagonist-driven and reweights the covenant with visible conceptual cost: the sky remains wrong but flexible. The piece trends Accumulative, so escalation reads as density increase and pattern payoff rather than causal narrowing; that single tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the vow's demand for sameness versus the embrace of change, dramatized through the chess-piece exchanges and the tide clock's backward-then-forward pulse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"we amended ourselves to it"—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the spire's listening, the secrets traded, and Kestrel's betrayal-as-chivalry calculus. The final image ("adopted constellation that winked like a conspirator") reweights prior wrongness as generative rather than correctable. The teacher's scroll ("forgive what the future makes of your plans") earns the shift without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "apprentice of wonder" filters diction ("muffled palace of vapor," "snow moths"). Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows; elision of the teacher's identity and the old vow's origin is purposeful and charges closure when the scroll's wisdom lands. Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter cadence during the false-board split). One weakness: elevated register ("contravent," "sacredly playful") occasionally drifts from a plausible novice voice, though it reads consistent enough to hold as voice-motivated lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "wind scraped our faces like a patient file" anchors sensation and introduces the medical-precision motif). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is dense ("colors bled into wrong constellations," "secrets fluttered out like snow moths") but mostly coherent. Two slips: "sacredly playful" appears three times as a descriptor without evolving function, trending toward template repetition; "swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside" is repeated verbatim twice, creating mild synonym-loop effect. These do not touch closure but accumulate to −0.8 under the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of icebound spire, chess-set secrets, and broken tide clock is specific and non-obvious; the "amend not fix" resolution transforms the quest-to-restore trope. Kestrel's betrayal-as-chivalry backstory adds moral complexity. The "sky is wrong" premise and the vow-covenant mechanics feel fresh within the fantasy-quest frame. Risk-taking in pacing (lyric accumulation over set-piece action) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "apprentice" and "chivalrous thief" pairing trends toward stock archetype pairings, though the specific actions (trading secrets via chess pieces) earn enough originality to lift the score solidly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kestrel appears throughout, leads the climb, carries the sundial lid, offers his betrayal secret (a key turn that melts the false king and opens the stair), and places the lid at closure. His decision to reveal the driftwood knight secret drives escalation and participates in the ending. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Specificity high (betrayal of compass maker to free maps). Cost connection visible (thorn carried ever since, now traded for passage).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sundial lid is introduced early ("Kestrel carried the pocket sundial lid on a cord"), used in the shallow niche (air ticks, numbers flow), and placed at the heart to fit the tide clock's broken crown, enabling the final amendment. Three beats: carry, niche placement, crown fit. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Specificity high (brass, warm, belonged to sky cartographer who misplaced time). The lid's exact properties (catching new rhythm, allowing time to drip sweeter) are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" frames the narrator's stance early ("sworn to curiosity, yet still learning how to bow before mystery"), tested mid-story ("whether I still wanted to be an apprentice of wonder"), and affirmed at closure ("feared only living without wonder"). It shapes tactics (presenting the chess set, accepting the pledge test) and charges the final promise ("keep learning how to listen"). Setup, development (pledge test), and payoff present. Causal pressure moderate; the concept enables rather than constrains. Cost connection present (fear as doorway).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" is applied to Kestrel three times but functions as a tonal label rather than a constraint. It describes his bow and his final gesture but does not visibly enable or block an action with cost. The trait is present by implication in his grin and courtly fingertips, but no beat hinges on this specific duality. Setup present (early description), closure reprise present (final bow), but middle development weak. Swappable with "irreverent devotion" or similar. Label-only usage trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Amend" is signaled early ("come not to conquer the spire, but to amend a vow"), drives the middle (tide clock asks for amendment, old promise curdled into wrongness), and defines closure ("we amended ourselves to it"). The action is irreplaceable: the entire quest logic pivots on correction versus acceptance. Three beats, causal pressure high, closure participation decisive. The amendment concept redefines options (from fix to adapt) and carries conceptual cost (abandoning sameness). Setup, development, and payoff all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is introduced early ("chess set wrapped in felt, each hand carved piece hollowed to guard a single folded secret"), used twice on the page ("swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside" for passage and at the heart when the queen is broken), and shapes the spire's acceptance logic. Two distinct beats, causal pressure (the spire tests via piece-for-piece exchange), and closure participation (queen's secret absorbed by tide clock). Specificity high (hand-carved, hollowed, driftwood knight). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter; not merely end-appearance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire pressures every beat: cold affects movement, the door seals behind them, frost names intentions, the room splits into mirrors, the narrower exit throat shapes the final passage. Setup immediate (title and opening line), development continuous (spire's listening, false boards, frozen tide clock), payoff strong (spire exhales, exit applauds). Spatial constraints alter tactics throughout. The spire is not postcard; it is an active agent. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" anchors the opening and final paragraphs, establishing atmosphere and thematic wrongness. It does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; time flows but is not tracked as constraint. The timeframe is more setting-as-condition than urgency mechanism. Setup present, closure reprise present (sky remains wrong), but middle development absent—no moment where the wrongness narrows options or accelerates pressure. Lyric resonance without tactical constraint. Swappable with "twilight" or "eclipse" for similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Embrace the unknown with open arms" is stated early as motive, dramatized when the narrator accepts the pledge test ("fear was a doorway I longed to open"), and affirmed at closure ("feared only living without wonder"). The desire is conflicted (fear versus longing) and shapes the middle choice to continue after the spire's test. Setup, development (pledge moment), and payoff present. Causal pressure moderate; the motivation enables rather than obstructs. Cost connection visible (fear as price of wonder). Friction between want and cost trends high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" appears in the opening ("we kept going with cautious abandon") and modulates through the piece: Kestrel's hesitation-plus-gleam, the narrator's fear-as-doorway stance. The tone charges the final image ("sacredly playful and stern, like Kestrel, like the spire"). Setup present, closure reprise strong. Middle coherence present (cautious secret-gathering, abandon in kissing secrets for luck). The tone is not static but does not visibly shift under peak pressure; it remains a steady duality rather than a tension that resolves. Closure charge elevates the score.</comment>
