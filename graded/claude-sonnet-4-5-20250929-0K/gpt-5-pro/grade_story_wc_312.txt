<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nera's "earnestly naive" devotion and shift from "brittle devotion to their starched logic" to embodied action with the bell shows clear internal contradiction and growth. Her micro-choices—counting drops, aligning the crack, rubbing water along the seam—are concrete and embodied. Aro's arc from "fingers smelling of rope and apology" to choking laughter and promising restraint is credible. Minor strain: Nera's epiphany about "tepid feels like the one temperature water never resists" borders on self-aware articulation, but the metaphor stays rooted in her magic's specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through Nera's drip-counting ritual, Aro's memory-gift, and the bell's alignment, culminating in the seam stitching itself with silver and fish rising. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell left ringing, Aro's vow of restraint, and Nera's departure with "lukewarm magic proving itself exactly warm enough" reweight the opening emptiness with visible cost (restraint, patience). Orientation is clean by ~90 words (sapphire viaduct, Nera, bell, dawn, empty nets). One meaningful deepening: from ritual to enacted change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct's slag-glass filtering dawn, the weeping seam, and dripping rates constrain Nera's entire method and charge the final image. The bell's bronze warmth, the rope "thin as regret," and the seam opening "where the light turns thick as sap" are sensory, specific, and purposeful. Micro-setting (the arch's hairline crack, puddle water, drops by breath and heartbeat) directly shapes tactics. The body and small objects (bell, line, clapper) function as tactile anchors throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—righting the cosmic imbalance that emptied nets—is signaled in the third line. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: drip arithmetic → shared pulse with Aro → bell ringing three times → seam stitching with fish rising. Aro's memory-gift ("give it back, not the body, but the moment") narrows options and raises cost. The resolution (Aro's restraint vow, bell left as pendulum) is earned by Nera's enacted ritual and carries visible cost: patience over harvest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of "lukewarm" power proving sufficient emerges through specifics: tepid kettle, water that never resists, drip arithmetic, and the bell teaching the tide. The final image—"the world is a bell and she is only the clapper"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Aro's "shrine to failure" question and hisChoking laughter layers ambiguity. The story reweights insufficiency as patience without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Nera filters the world through her tepid magic and drip-counting ("drops gather on the arch like thoughts," "a living metronome"). Diction—"earnestly naive," "brittle devotion," "wet arithmetic," "lighthouse alphabet"—is consistent, lyric, and voice-specific. Dialogue between Nera and Aro is subtext-driven ("Not a shrine, a song") and goal-oriented. Psychic distance is stable third-limited; no filter clutter or head-hopping. Compression under pressure (bell falters, old rules crumble) supports urgency without losing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "rope thin as regret and twice as strong" conveys both object and emotion). Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "ordinary miracle, a plausible impossibility you can catch on the tongue" stacks metaphor without clear advancement. A few near-paraphrases: "earnestly naive" appears twice in close proximity without new pressure. No loops or artifacts in the closure beat. Propulsion is clean through the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "lukewarm mage," drip-rate arithmetic, and broken bell as tide-teacher is specific and non-obvious. The viaduct's slag-glass filtration and Nera's rejection of guild logic avoid stock magical-failure tropes. Risk: the lyric, accumulative structure and quiet closure (patience over power) heighten stakes without gimmickry. Minor deduction: the "world is a bell" metaphor in the final line is elegant but borders on familiar closing-image territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nera's choices—setting the bell, counting drops, aligning the crack, rubbing puddle water, ringing three times—create the story's pressure sequence and closure. She is present in every beat and her decisions drive the ritual's escalation and the sea's response.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell appears in line two, is handled across multiple beats (set under the seam, warmed by Aro, aligned with the arch's hairline, clapper lifted and struck three times), and left slung at closure as "a pendulum of patience." Its crack and bronze both constrain method and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brittle devotion" is named once in reference to Nera's past guild loyalty and her departure with "the bell nobody wanted." It motivates her presence on the viaduct but does not constrain on-page choices during the ritual itself; the shift from brittle to flexible is told rather than tested in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Earnestly naive" is named in line four and once more in line nineteen; it frames Nera's belief that the bell kept tide time. It enables her willingness to try the ritual (others laughed) but does not force a visible tradeoff or mistake on the page; the trait remains label-proximate rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" anchors Nera's goal (line twelve: "a way to rebuild what cracked when hunger overruled memory") and the story's major turn: the seam stitching itself with silver thread and fish rising. The action is specific to this ritual; swapping it would require rewriting the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" is introduced in line five, revisited in lines sixteen and seventeen (three breaths equal five drops, seven equal two), and again in line thirty-one ("becomes choreography"). The method shapes every middle beat and the timing of the three rings that summon the seam. Without it, the ritual's mechanics collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is named in the opening line and closing paragraph; its weeping seam supplies the drip-rate clock, the hairline crack aligns with the bell's crack, and the slag-glass dawn filters light that quickens the drops. The setting enables the ritual's method and charges the final image of the bell left "where the arch weeps."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the last fish is caught" anchors the story's inciting condition (line two) and Aro's confession (line twenty-four: "I pulled it, and the sky tugged back"). It tightens urgency—the nets are empty, the town quiet—but does not impose a ticking clock on Nera's ritual; the timeframe is open enough that middle beats could compress or stretch without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To right a cosmic imbalance" is named in line three and drives Nera's entire ritual sequence. Friction surfaces in Aro's "shrine to failure" question and Nera's reply ("not a shrine, a song"), and the cost—Aro's vow not to cast for a season—makes the motivation's price legible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Plausible impossibility" is named in line six ("an ordinary miracle, a plausible impossibility") and sustained through diction: "cosmic imbalance," "the sea clear its throat," "seam opens where the light turns thick as sap," fish that "remember how to be fins." Tone modulates from earnest setup to charged closure ("lukewarm magic proving itself exactly warm enough") without tipping into fantasy convenience or ironic deflation.</comment>
