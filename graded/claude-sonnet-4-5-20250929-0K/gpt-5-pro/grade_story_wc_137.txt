<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's sympathetic skepticism ("I scoff the first time I heard it, then apologized") and relationship to Lio show interior complexity, and the choice to include painful memories demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract register ("sympathy had found a shape") rather than embodied contradiction in peak beats. The final choice to give up their own memory of abandoning Estera earns the closure, but the emotional progression feels more narrated than dramatized—we're told about courage and kindness more than we witness the struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds through layered images (whales, tile, tower corridors) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chamber becomes a memorial space that can "hold truth." Closure cost is present—Lio plants his anger alongside laughter, narrator sacrifices their guilt—and the magic square's mechanics provide constraint. Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (tower, whale migration, tile). One deduction: the middle escalation relies on metaphorical description ("corridors of faint starlight") rather than dramatized choice-points, slightly softening causal pressure even under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stargazer's tower, magic square tile, and whale soundscape are vivid and purposeful. The tile's "crazed glaze like winter ice on ink" and the "lantern circle" anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Micro-setting excels: the tile constrains the ritual, the open tower admits whale-song, and the resulting "chamber with windows onto years" charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (whales' "low moans seemed to pass through our bones without sound"). Minor slip: "harbor" and "city" appear without prior spatial grounding, creating a brief anchor wobble mid-story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—building a memorial space that holds painful truth—is signaled early and tightens when Lio hesitates over his anger and the narrator must decide whether to include their own guilt. The whale migration functions as atmospheric clock rather than hard deadline, softening urgency slightly. The escalation is a deepening (narrator's sacrifice joins Lio's) rather than a reversal, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is visible: both characters forfeit emotional safety. One limitation: the tile's "ask" feels externalized rather than driven by protagonist agency, slightly reducing the sense of earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as bridge, not ghost; truth without suffocation—emerges through concrete ritual (placing anger and laughter in the open squares) and the final image of the chamber "holding generous quiet like a tidepool holding starlight." The piece resists moralizing; Estera's marginalia whispers guidance without thesis. The whale migration and "unheard symphony" function as recurring motifs that shift meaning (guidance → tide of held notes → surf against mussels). Minor deduction: "sympathy had found a shape" in the final paragraph edges toward abstract summary, though the preceding image work earns most of the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyric voice is consistent and purposeful ("Wind wrote pale calligraphy," "I scoff politely"). Register remains elevated throughout, which fits the reflective narrator but occasionally drifts into self-conscious lyricism ("corridors of faint starlight where our steps left no dust, only chorded echoes") that abstracts rather than grounds high-pressure beats. No dialogue present; evaluation focuses on narrative voice. Perceptual signature is distinct (sympathetic skeptic filtering through metaphor), but peak moments like the tile flaring and corridors opening would gain immediacy from more embodied syntax. FOV stable, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several beats show overwriting: "thin stars braided like hair across the table, luminous strands spooling" stacks metaphors without clarifying the tile's mechanics. "Unheard symphony" recurs five times, approaching template cadence without sufficient reweighting. Paraphrase loop: "I realized that to transcribe was not to trap, but to catch the wind" / "we had planted the hollows as well as the seeds" both restate balance without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in reflection-heavy beats ("I knew," "I realized," "I told him") slightly dulls immediacy. Clarity remains mostly intact; deductions for density and loop accumulation reach −1.0 within Q7, with artifacts touching but not obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of memorial ritual, magic square constraint, and whale-guided rhythm offers a specific, non-obvious frame. The narrator's dual guilt (scoffing at Estera, abandoning her) and Lio's frozen-out winter create particular emotional stakes rather than generic grief. Transformation test passes: the exact constellation of elements matters. Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphor density heightens stakes without obscuring closure. One limitation: the magic square's entanglement mechanics remain conceptually asserted rather than dramatized with unique properties, leaving some "borrowed mysticism" feel that slightly reduces irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sympathetic skeptic drives two key choices: agreeing to use the tile despite prior scoffing (setup), and offering their own painful memory to straighten the paths (closure beat). Present across all three gates with causal pressure at the ending. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4, rounded to 6.7 for specificity (the trait's contradiction—skeptic who acts—shapes tactics). Swappability slight (could be "reluctant believer") −0.2 absorbed in rounding.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Magic square tile present in setup (brought in satchel, placed on table), development (patterns form, open squares ask for memories), and closure (warm, ash-filled, placed in doorway). Three beats, handled physically, its mechanics (lunar order, balanced sums, open squares) constrain the ritual. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0. Minor swappability (another mystical object could serve) −0.2 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Entangled memories shapes the premise (Estera believed they are "bridges across forgetting") and the stakes (build a space where memories breathe without suffocating). The concept guides the ritual's logic (placing anger and laughter to open corridors) and charges the closure ("chamber holding generous quiet"). Present in all three gates. Early +0.5, two beats (ritual setup, corridor opening) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1. Minor deduction for abstraction: the entanglement mechanism remains metaphorical rather than dramatized with specific constraints −0.2 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Courageously kind appears as label in setup ("courageously kind even in his grief" for Lio; "I am not brave, but sometimes I am courageously kind" for narrator) and enables one key choice: narrator tells Lio "kindness without courage would buckle" and climbs the rope first (middle beat). Visible at closure when Lio laughs through tears and narrator stays to sweep and listen. Early +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.8, cost connection (narrator's sacrifice) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5. Bonus for constraint (trait enables the hard truth moment) +0.9 = 6.4. Label-only in setup −0.3 absorbed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Transcribe frames the narrator's goal ("to transcribe this music through forgotten patterns") and the tile's function (chalking numbers, mapping stories). The action drives the middle ritual beat and the narrator's realization ("to transcribe was not to trap, but to catch the wind"). Present in closure context (chamber as transcribed space). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1. Additional credit for irreplaceability: "transcribe" specifically links the tile's number-work to memory inscription +0.7 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Forgotten patterns appears in Estera's marginalia ("we could only transcribe this music through forgotten patterns") and guides the ritual method (lunar order, chalking numbers against stories). The phrase shapes tactics in the middle beat and returns implicitly at closure ("chamber crafted through forgotten patterns"). Early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal +0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8. Bonus for specificity: "forgotten" distinguishes this from obvious memory-work +0.3 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stargazer's open tower anchors the entire scene (setup, all beats, closure). Its openness admits whale-song, the lantern circle holds the ritual, the seams open to reveal corridors, and the final chamber "kept breathing." Environment constrains: the cracked star table holds the tile, the open design allows the unheard symphony to pass through. Early +0.7, three+ beats (arrival, ritual, transformation, closure) +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +1.3, irreplaceability +0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5. Minor swappability (another liminal space could work) −0.3, spatial grounding slip (harbor/city) −0.2 = 7.2 after rounding down remainder.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Whale migration provides atmospheric clock and thematic resonance (whales as guides, "unheard symphony"). Present in setup, middle (whales sound during ritual), and closure (whales roll and vanish). The timeframe doesn't tighten tactics—no urgency that migration will end—but it charges mood and offers the guiding rhythm metaphor. Early +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6. Deduction for pressure: time doesn't constrain choices, only frames them −0.3 = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sculpt space for reflection is the narrator's stated goal (setup: "I had come to sculpt space for reflection"), drives the ritual (middle: choosing which memories to include), and achieves closure (the chamber becomes that space). The motivation is tested when Lio fears meddling and narrator must argue for truth over kindness. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, cost connection +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4. No major deductions; friction between want (safe memorial) and cost (painful inclusion) is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Unheard symphony establishes tone in setup ("that conflict hummed like an unheard symphony"), recurs through whale-song ("guiding us by an unheard symphony's tempo"), presses against the narrator's chest mid-ritual, and culminates in Lio's laughter "like surf against mussels" at closure. Tone modulates from inaudible pressure to released sound, charging the final image. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, coherence through turns +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0. Minor template-cadence penalty (phrase recurs five times with slight variation but consistent metaphoric vehicle) −0.1 = 6.9.</comment>
