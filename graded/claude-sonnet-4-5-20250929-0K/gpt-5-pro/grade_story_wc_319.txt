<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates coherent motivation—seeking friendship with uncertainty after certainty broke them—and the guardian's "dimensional homesickness" is embodied through his conflicted watchfulness. Interior states are mostly concrete ("Every breath filled with glittering needles"), though the final renunciation ("love sometimes means not crossing a line") edges toward platitude. The waiting-as-choice sequence earns the protagonist's shift from seeker to companion, foreclosing the crossing with visible restraint. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("make friends with uncertainty") that risks label-speak, though the piece dramatizes it through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the pair choose not to cross the threshold, warming "whatever came next" through waiting—a renunciation with visible cost (the guardian's old sky remains unreached). The accumulative lens coheres: mist-circle → pendant → waiting → interiorizing → threshold, each beat deepening the stake from seeking answers to learning restraint. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the comma-ice unlocks the seam, narrowing the path inward and setting up the threshold choice. Cost is legible in the guardian's averted gaze and the mutual decision to hold the veil ajar rather than step through.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden constrains movement and choice throughout: the mist-circle as entry ritual, the hoarfrost words, the bench "glossed with rime" where waiting occurs, and the sundial reset that opens the inward path. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("glittering needles that drew maps on our tongues"), filtered through the protagonist's stance. The pendant's crystal eye and the comma of ice function as micro-setting tools that alter what can be seen and accessed. The final corridor of frost—"trees grew from the margins of glimmer"—charges the closure by making the threshold spatially real, and the recurring "interiorizing exteriors" method ties body to weather in a way that affects tactics (tucking mist into sleeves, pulling cold inside).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to "make friends with uncertainty"—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian requires the protagonist to "wait without freezing" before teaching the method. One meaningful pressure point: the sundial reset that opens the inward path, a choice that leads to the threshold and forces the final renunciation. The decision not to cross the line forecloses reunion with the guardian's old sky, a visible cost that charges the ending. Under the accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase (garden opens → names hover → seam appears → threshold materializes) rather than a causal chain of reversals, and the final image reweights the opening stake: uncertainty is befriended not by crossing but by waiting. Agency is clear in the shared acts of waiting, resetting the dial, and choosing restraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the cultists' pendant is abandoned because "they feared the boundaries of light and could not name the dark," and the protagonist's arc from seeking certainty's antidote to practicing "plain bravery of letting minutes pass" avoids didacticism. The library's hoard of "wrong answers that had saved someone's life" reframes error as survival tool without moralizing. The final threshold—opened but not crossed—offers a resonant answer to the uncertainty question: intimacy can mean holding a line rather than erasing it. The comma-as-key (a mark of continuation, not completion) charges the thematic layer without overt statement. Minor proximity concern: "love sometimes means not crossing a line" skirts platitude, though the prior material earns the restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in first person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices edges, pauses, and margins ("looped handwriting that shimmered only at the borders where light admitted defeat"). Dialogue between protagonist and guardian carries subtext—his "sideways animal way" smile and evasive answers about the library's purpose—and advances plot by teaching waiting and the interiorizing method. Diction stays within a lyric-philosophical register ("foggy lucidity," "dimensionally homesick") that matches the dreamlike frame without slipping into generic fantasy. The guardian's speech feels differentiated (clipped, wary: "help begins when people learn to wait without freezing") from the protagonist's more exploratory tone. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know within the dream logic established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs ("He clicked his tongue against a gold tooth and lifted a cultist's pendant from a tangle of vines frozen into glass" conveys action, object, and world texture in one). However, paraphrase loops appear: "we practiced the plain bravery of letting minutes pass" is immediately echoed by "When the waiting steadied us," and "interiorizing exteriors" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("letters cut from hoarfrost and breathed into motion," "generous ribs") and some metaphors strain coherence (shelves as "generous ribs" imports anatomy without clear vehicle logic). Template cadence: runs of "We [verb]" structures in the final third ("We walked," "We turned," "We entered") flatten momentum. These artifacts lower Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-maze, threshold-guardianship, and the "boundaries of light" metaphor feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven, and the cultists' pendant as oculus is a specific image. The "interiorizing exteriors" method and the comma-shaped ice key offer fresh inflections on portal fantasy. However, the dreamlike veil-of-sleep frame and the wise-animal-guide trope are well-worn, and the piece does not fully transform them—the guardian's dimensional homesickness and the protagonist's uncertainty-quest remain within recognizable YA-fantasy idiom. The final restraint (not crossing) is the strongest original choice, elevating the piece above template resolution, but the journey's beats echo familiar beats of threshold-trials and wisdom-tests.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The guardian is present in setup (watches from gate, asks how protagonist arrived), constrains middle action (teaches waiting, hands the comma-ice, explains the library's purpose), and appears in closure (opens the book-window to his old sky, chooses not to cross). His choices—especially the decision to wait and not step through—alter the protagonist's understanding and the final stance. The dimensional homesickness trait drives his actions and the story's emotional center, making removal structurally damaging.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pendant appears in setup (lifted from vines, described with its map of boundaries), is used in the middle (protagonist places it over eye to see the garden's silver paths), and returns in closure preparation (comma-ice inserted into its crystal eye, enabling the seam-reading that leads to the threshold). It enables at least two distinct beats and its specific property—showing "edges where brightness refuses to proceed"—shapes what can be seen and accessed. Swappability is low; a generic lens would lack the boundaries-of-light resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "boundaries of light" concept is signaled early (pendant's rim inscribed with them, cultists feared them) and recurs as the guardian explains why the cultists froze. The phrase directly shapes the protagonist's perception through the pendant and the final threshold scene involves margins and glimmers. However, it functions more as thematic backdrop than a stake that alters tactics on the page—the actual choices (waiting, resetting sundial, not crossing) are driven by relationship and restraint rather than navigating light's edges. Present across beats but not indispensable to the closure's emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dimensional homesickness is introduced early ("he said he was dimensionally homesick, because the stacks were doors, and one door had closed on the wrong sky"), drives the middle quest (finding the seam of missed doorways), and charges the closure (the guardian's averted look when his old sky appears, his choice not to cross). The trait enables the final restraint with visible cost—reunion is possible but declined. Label-only in first mention, but later embodied through his "looking away" and the shared decision to hold the veil ajar, making the attribute causally active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Waiting is introduced as a test ("help begins when people learn to wait without freezing"), practiced on the rime-glazed bench (the beat that steadies them and unlocks the interiorizing method), and returns in closure ("we sat again and waited, keeping the veil of sleep ajar, and our waiting warmed whatever came next"). The action defines the protagonist's arc from seeker to patient companion and is the hinge for both the middle teaching and the final renunciation. Swapping "wait" for another verb would gut the thematic and causal spine; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiorizing exteriors is taught mid-story ("he taught me a method he called interiorizing exteriors, a way to borrow rooms from weather"), practiced immediately (tucking mist into sleeves, pulling cold inside until "it found its chair and sat"), and returns in the final corridor walk ("We entered, interiorizing exteriors with each step"). The method enables the inward path and the pendant's balanced breathing. However, its mechanics remain somewhat abstract—what exactly happens when the cold "sits"?—and it does not constrain a choice so much as facilitate passage. Present across three beats with closure participation, but swappability is moderate (could be "attuning" or "harmonizing" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden pressures entry (mist-circle ritual), supplies the rime-bench for waiting, and the sundial reset that opens the inward path. Sensory particulars (hoarfrost letters, black hedges, sleeping roses) are woven through action rather than postcard description. The garden's state—thawing when the cold is interiorized, shelves rising as "generous ribs"—responds to the characters' choices and charges the final threshold. Removal would collapse both the spatial logic and the tactile vocabulary that anchors the dream frame. Micro-setting (body, pendant, ice-comma) also functions as setting per the allowance, reinforcing the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veil-of-sleep timeframe is mentioned in setup ("how I had slipped here through the veil of sleep") and closing ("keeping the veil of sleep ajar"), establishing a dreamlike temporal boundary. However, the middle action does not track or tighten time—minutes pass during waiting, but no clock pressures the choices, and the threshold could be reached at any pace. The frame functions as tone-setter and exit metaphor rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present in first and final thirds but inactive in middle development; cap at 4.6 per missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to make friends with uncertainty—is stated early ("I had come to make friends with uncertainty, because certainty had broken me into safe, useless pieces"), tested through waiting (resisting the urge to act or know), and resolved in closure (the protagonist learns that friendship can mean holding a threshold open rather than crossing it). The desire drives the arc and is dramatized through choices (sitting still, resetting the sundial, declining the crossing). Slight deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing in the declaration, but the friction between wanting answers and learning restraint is enacted on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is established early ("We spoke in foggy lucidity, every word crisp and wet, like letters cut from hoarfrost") and sustained through diction (glittering needles, smoky crystal, shimmering handwriting) and syntax that balances dreamlike imagery with clear causal steps. The tone modulates: wary in the gate interview, meditative during waiting, charged at the threshold. The final image—sitting to wait and warm "whatever came next"—maintains the lucid-fog balance without collapsing into pure abstraction or waking realism. The tone charges the closure by making restraint feel both mysterious and precise, supporting the thematic layer without announcing itself.</comment>
