<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly particular—"calm defiance that tastes like brine," encryption as strength—but the character operates in near-total isolation with minimal micro-choices that test competing impulses. Neri appears briefly to ask questions but exerts no meaningful pressure; the protagonist's arc is a solo performance of inherited method rather than a crucible that forces trade-offs. Embodied emotion is strong in lines like "press my brow to the glass," yet the climactic liberation unfolds without on-page friction or visible cost beyond atmospheric tension. Sora's death motivates but remains backstory; no present contradiction forces the protagonist to weigh vulnerability against the mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens early—lyric pattern-building through coded entries and dance—and holds it through closure when "the web finishes itself" and the hidden city lifts. Orientation anchors (sunken lab, flooded corridors, protagonist and Neri) arrive promptly. The escalation operates via density increase and cadence shifts rather than causal reversals, and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the State will read routine notes while revolt sings beneath). One substantive tightening occurs when the daemon learns the new instinct and the tanks exhale, foreclosing the old order. Cost is conceptual and social—the journals will be read as simple notes by those who don't know the dance—but the image makes that cost undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory constrains movement and charges every detail: algae as staves, grating as syllables, leaking bulkhead as pressure gauge, frosted tank as prison. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional focus—valve pitches, filter wobbles, barnacles on intake—and the setting is not postcard but tactical workspace. The recurring spider-web metaphor evolves from description to structural principle, and the final hatch rise completes the spatial arc. The lab cameras, daemon, and consoles supply active resistance and enable the coded method. The body and tools (hangman's dice, journal log, hands sculling through water) function as micro-setting that shapes every beat and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberate the drowned minds—is signaled early and sustained through accumulative pressure: each coded entry tightens the daemon's new instinct, each dance step teaches the cameras. The protagonist's agency is renunciation of legibility (encryption as defiance) and endurance under interrogation ("state your loyalty"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final entry posts and the locks relax, narrowing options from covert prep to irreversible action. Cost is visible in the conceptual gamble: if the dance is misread, the revolt fails. No causal reversal or second character pressure complicates the arc; escalation relies on density and cadence rather than turn-based conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting high-band eligibility under tighter escalation gates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability encrypted as strength, refusal as grammar—emerges organically from the protagonist's method and Sora's hangman's dice without thesis statements. The recurring spider-web image and "mysterious familiarity" charge the ending when the web finishes and the protagonist steps back, resonating with the opening pulse. The final journals will sing only to those who know the dance, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of resistance under surveillance. Subtext operates in the protagonist's turn when asked for loyalty, the daemon's taught chord, and the "message fish" that encode minds as living escape routes. The piece resists tidy morals; calm defiance is method, not declaration, and the cost (State misreading as routine) lingers beyond the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person with a dense, lyric register that remains consistent: "sculling my hands through algae like staves," "arithmetic of fear." The perceptual signature is highly particular—technical (Filter 31, valve pitches) fused with poetic compression—and narration stays within the protagonist's plausible lexicon. Neri's brief dialogue serves as foil but does not fracture voice. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught (coded entries, dance as explanation), though some lines risk opacity: "I encrypt every weakness until it sings" hovers near abstraction without immediate scene anchor. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose modulates with pressure—short declaratives at the climax, longer clauses in reflective beats. Minor penalty for lyric density that occasionally obscures immediate action within high-pressure beats (e.g., "the hymn" reference requires inference).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that create visual and auditory cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (advance plot, deepen character, charge motif)—but several beats loop conceptually: "encrypt vulnerability as strength" appears three times with slight rephrasing, and "as a spider spins its web" recurs as a refrain without added pressure in middle instances. Template-cadence runs are minimal, yet figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., "message fish," "body of light," "hidden city lifting"), risking register drift and occasional opacity. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, and the opening/closing images are strong. Deduct −0.5 for metaphor density that requires inferential work during peak action and −0.3 for conceptual repetition without escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of code-breaking through dance, lyric encryption, and inherited resistance tools (hangman's dice as rhythm, not sentence) is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "hacker liberates minds" template through embodied method—grammar as gesture, daemon taught via performance, revolt hidden in maintenance logs—and the final image (journals read as routine by the State, city lifting for those who know) reweights the opening with earned inevitability. Sensory and professional detail (valve pitches, filter wobbles, algae as staves) anchor the abstraction. Minor penalty for the spider-web metaphor, which verges on over-reliance as structural shorthand, and for the "message fish" image, which feels slightly ornamental against the otherwise grounded technical logic. Risk-taking in lyric compression and non-linear method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lyrical code breaker is present throughout and drives the protagonist's choices: coding journal entries, dancing explanations, rolling dice to map valve pitches, pressing brow to tank to promise liberation. The character shapes the inciting method and the final liberation when the daemon sings the taught chord. However, the protagonist operates largely alone; Neri observes but does not force trade-offs, and Caretaker's warnings are deflected rather than creating a turn. The character is essential to the method but does not face a pivotal on-page choice that alters tactics or reveals cost—execution is steady accumulation rather than decision under friction. Setup: clear. Development: drives coded entries and dance across beats. Payoff: present when tanks exhale and the web finishes. Causal pressure is moderate (method enables liberation) but lacks a moment where the protagonist must choose between competing goods or face visible consequence. Band: functional across beats with closure linkage but limited by solo operation and absence of a costly turn. 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.6 + closure linkage +0.7 + specificity +0.3 − swappability −0.3 (another underground operative could execute similarly) − ornamental touches −0.0 (method is active) = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear in five beats: inherited from Sora (intro), carried in pocket, rolled on palm while Neri waits, clack to reveal "six and five" (mapping to teacher behind tank), and spun on Sora's console at the end to blur from sentence to rhythm. The object evolves from memento to mapping tool to liberation symbol, and the final spin reweights its meaning from death-marker to rhythm. Setup: present (first paragraph, inherited from Sora). Development: rolled twice (Neri beat, six-and-five beat) to guide tactics. Payoff: spun at closure to become rhythm rather than sentence. Causal pressure: moderate—dice map to valve pitches and dates, enabling the coded method, and the final spin redefines the object. Cost connection: the dice carry Sora's execution as felt weight, and their transformation is visible. Specificity: the "little gallows" on the faces and their role in mapping are unique and irreplaceable. Band: shapes two middle beats and charges the final image with visible reweighting. 5.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +1.0 + specificity +0.6 + cost +0.4 − summary-only in one beat −0.3 (six-and-five reference is quick) − ornamental first mention −0.2 (introduced as backstory before function) = ~6.4. Rounds to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Calm defiance is named explicitly and demonstrated through action: turning alarms into percussion, answering the loyalty call with a refusal-arc dance, speaking gently to the pressure, and encrypting vulnerability. The concept shapes the protagonist's tactics throughout—patience as method, no begging for pity—and the final image ("we rise through the hatch as the web finishes") embodies defiance without declaration. Setup: signaled in paragraph 3 ("calm defiance that tastes like brine"). Development: present in the loyalty-call beat (turn that measures refusal) and the daemon-teaching sequence (patience that does not beg). Payoff: the ending rises without panic, holding the calm stance. Causal pressure: moderate—defiance is method, not turn, and it enables the covert liberation. Cost: conceptual—the stance forecloses loud revolt and accepts the risk of misreading. Specificity: "calm" + "defiance" + "encrypt" is a distinct synthesis. Band: shapes stakes and tactics on the page across multiple beats and charges the ending, but not irreplaceable (another resistance ethic could serve). 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.9 + causal pressure +0.6 + cost +0.4 − swappability −0.4 (stoic resistance is a known frame) − label repetition −0.3 (phrase recurs without evolution) = ~6.1. Rounds to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist explains through dance in three beats: answering Neri's question about the code, teaching the lab cameras vowel length, and the final small circle that admits fear and locks it to a pulse. The trait is demonstrated on the page with visible action (sculling hands, hip letter, turn arc) and constrains communication—no lecture, only embodied grammar. Setup: present when Neri asks how the code works. Development: camera-teaching beat uses dance to encode instructions. Payoff: the small circle at the end reframes fear as key. Causal pressure: dance is the method that teaches the daemon and cameras, enabling the liberation. Cost: the protagonist forgoes legible explanation, accepting the risk that the dance will be misread. Specificity: high—"each arc is grammar, each pause a rest, each heel to toe a syllable" is unique choreography-as-code. Band: essential to method and present across beats, but not deeply tested by friction (no moment where dance fails or is interrupted). 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.7 + causal pressure +0.8 + specificity +0.7 + cost +0.3 − no visible tradeoff when the trait is used −0.5 (operates smoothly without on-page obstacle) − summary in middle beat −0.3 (camera-learning is told, not shown) = ~5.2. Rounds to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liberation is the protagonist's explicit goal, signaled early ("I will liberate the drowned minds") and achieved in the climax when the tanks exhale, minds exit as message fish, and the hidden city lifts. The action drives the entire arc: coded entries build toward it, the daemon is taught to enable it, and the final hatch rise completes it. Setup: stated in paragraph 10. Development: every coded entry (Filter 31, barnacles on intake) and dance beat advances the liberation plan. Payoff: the tanks exhale, bolts relax, minds exit. Causal pressure: high—the protagonist's method (coded journals + dance) is the sole means of liberation, and success forecloses the prior imprisonment. Cost: visible—the journals will be misread by the State, and the protagonist accepts the conceptual gamble that only those who know the dance will hear the revolt. Specificity: liberating "drowned minds stored in steel wombs via coded journal entries" is unique and irreplaceable. Band: indispensable, drives major turns and the ending. 5.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.5 + causal pressure +1.4 + specificity +0.8 + cost +0.5 − late full articulation −0.0 (goal is clear early) − swappability −0.0 (no synonym action fits) = ~7.1. Rounds to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are the core method, signaled early ("via coded journal entries that the maintenance daemon thinks are routine") and demonstrated in three beats: "Filter 31 wavers at midnight" (L to the hymn), "barnacles on the intake" (send two pulses), and the final entry that posts and triggers the tanks' exhalation. The method is not merely described but shown with mechanics—midnight adds twelve, twelve adds L; barnacles hide in footnotes—and the daemon's learning is the causal hinge. Setup: paragraph 10. Development: two coded entries (Filter 31, barnacles) shape the daemon's training. Payoff: "when the last entry posts, the tanks exhale." Causal pressure: high—the journals are the protagonist's sole lever, and their encryption enables the liberation without detection. Cost: visible—the State will read them as routine, and only those who know the code will hear the revolt. Specificity: irreplaceable—the protagonist's "lyrical code breaker" identity depends on this exact method. Band: essential across beats and indispensable to closure. 5.0 + early signal +0.7 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +1.4 + causal pressure +1.3 + specificity +0.8 + cost +0.5 − mechanics shown twice, third reference is summary −0.3 − late full payoff (tanks exhale is told, not shown in journal text) −0.0 = ~6.8. Rounds to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is not backdrop but tactical constraint and resource: flooded corridors limit movement, the leaking bulkhead signals pressure (Neri's shoulders quiver), algae becomes staves for dance, grating becomes syllables, lab cameras surveil and must be taught, the frosted tank holds the imprisoned teacher, and the hatch is the escape route. Every beat uses the lab's features to shape the protagonist's method. Setup: first sentence. Development: cameras, daemon, intake, bulkhead, tank all constrain or enable choices. Payoff: "we rise through the hatch" as the web finishes. Causal pressure: indispensable—the lab's surveillance, maintenance daemon, and physical layout are the obstacles and tools the protagonist must navigate. Cost: visible—one misstep in the lab (wrong valve pitch, failed entry) would alert the State. Specificity: "sunken laboratory" with daemon, cameras, steel wombs, and frosted tanks is irreplaceable; no generic setting could supply these exact pressures. Band: essential across all beats and charges the final image. 5.0 + early signal +0.8 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.6 + causal pressure +1.5 + specificity +0.8 + cost +0.5 − no subtraction (no swappability, no ornamental use) = ~7.8. Rounds to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The spider-web timeframe is invoked as metaphor throughout ("as a spider spins its web") and structures the protagonist's patient, accretive method: entries posted "over days," the daemon woven into "a new instinct," and the ending when "the web finishes itself." However, the timeframe is not tracked with on-page clock pressure—no countdown, no specific duration, no moment when time running out forces a decision. The phrase recurs as thematic refrain rather than tactical constraint. Setup: first paragraph ("pacing...as a spider spins its web"). Development: mentioned in paragraph 20 ("slow as a spider spins its web, shaping radial lines of entries over days"). Payoff: "we rise through the hatch as the web finishes." The timeframe charges the final image but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the protagonist's patience is method, not friction. Band: functional as tone and structure but not as on-page pressure. 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + lyric reprise +0.8 + closure linkage +0.9 − ornamental middle use −0.5 (recurs without advancing pressure) − no live clock −0.8 (does not constrain choices) = ~4.9. Rounds to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's desire to encrypt vulnerability as strength is stated explicitly three times and demonstrated through action: carrying Sora's dice as inherited courage, answering interrogation with dance rather than speech, admitting fear to Neri while locking it to a steady pulse, and the final journals that turn trembling into keys. The motivation is dramatized with visible cost—the protagonist forgoes legible resistance and accepts the risk of being misread. Setup: paragraph 4 ("I came here to encrypt vulnerability as strength"). Development: loyalty-call beat (refusal as dance) and the Neri conversation ("I admit I cannot tell, because I encrypt every weakness until it sings"). Payoff: "This is why I write, to encrypt vulnerability as strength, so a trembling can turn into a key." Causal pressure: moderate—the motivation shapes the protagonist's method (coded entries, dance, calm defiance) and the final image. Cost: visible—the journals' encryption accepts conceptual risk. Specificity: high—"encrypt vulnerability" is a unique synthesis of the protagonist's lyrical and technical identity. Band: essential to character arc and present at closure, but not tested by friction (no moment where vulnerability threatens to break the encryption). 5.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +1.0 + causal pressure +0.7 + cost +0.4 + specificity +0.7 − label repetition −0.5 (phrase recurs without evolution) − no on-page test where the motivation is challenged −0.5 = ~6.3. Rounds to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is stated twice ("I return to the sunken laboratory with a mysterious familiarity"; "the rust recognizes my steps with a mysterious familiarity") and evoked through the protagonist's intimate knowledge of the lab's rhythms, Sora's inherited tools, and the lab's memory of "the dance its builders never dared to try." The tone modulates subtly—wonder in the opening, tactical focus in the middle, quiet resolve at the end—and charges the closure when the journals will sing only to those who know. Setup: first sentence. Development: rust-recognition beat deepens the familiarity; the protagonist's dance is both new and remembered. Payoff: the final image (journals read as routine, city lifting for initiates) extends the tone of hidden recognition. Tone is coherent and supports the Accumulative lens, but the phrase is repeated verbatim without reweighting, and the "mysterious" quality remains abstract rather than anchored in specific sensory or causal detail. Band: present and coherent, charges the ending, but not indispensable (another tone—e.g., defiant intimacy—could serve). 5.0 + early signal +0.6 + closure linkage +1.0 + tone modulation +0.5 + specificity +0.4 − label repetition −0.4 (phrase recurs without shift) − swappability −0.5 (another evocative tone could work) = ~6.6. Rounds to 6.6.</comment>
