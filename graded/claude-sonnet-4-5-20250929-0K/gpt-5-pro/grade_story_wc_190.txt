<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gondola operator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("rails tutored me," "fluidly logical"), with embodied perception through the storm glass and meter. The core choice—teaching the girl to space the bell's rings—shows micro-agency under pressure and alters the mother's stance. However, the protagonist's emotional arc remains stable rather than contradictory; no internal conflict complicates the helping impulse, and the resolution feels assured rather than forfeited with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (gondola operator, terrace, post-train quiet) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the storm-glass imagery and bell-counting ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the mother exhales and the bell "sleeps in a pocket"—a reweighting of grief's noise into held silence. The cost is legible but muted: the mother's grief is eased, not transformed with a felt forfeiture. One meaningful deepening is present (the girl's counting bridge), satisfying the 600–800 word requirement, but the ending leans toward comfort without a sharp price that charges the final image with undeniable tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drifting terrace, storm-glass vial, and noise meter function as micro-setting that constrains the operator's choices: adjusting swing, dimming lights, avoiding the glass orchard. Sensory selection (catenary wires, signal beacons, cable hum) is filtered through the operator's professional lens. The vial's crystal shifts and meter's flutter directly shape the protagonist's path adjustments, satisfying the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across the gondola, terrace, and orchard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early and tightens when the bell "ricocheted" and "the hush buckled." The protagonist's agency (path adjustment, story-telling, bell-counting) narrows the girl's panic into a structured ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the counting becomes "a bridge that her grief could cross." However, the escalation is smooth rather than forfeited; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the resolution arrives without a trade-off that charges the final image with felt loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as active care, the city breathing, names riding the wires. The final image—"the door of quiet"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The bell's transformation from alarm to lantern, and the vial's crystal shift, ground the theme in concrete sensory changes. However, the thematic question is answered too fully; the ending explains ("What we call silence is only the place...") rather than trusting image alone, and the operator's wisdom ("If I am fluidly logical, it is because the rails demand proof") edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: "the hush is not empty here; it springs, arches, a vaulting hush." Perceptual signature is consistent (monitoring instruments, catenary wires, signal beacons). Distance remains stable in first-person present. The dialogue ("his name") is purposefully minimal, allowing silence to carry subtext. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the operator's working idiom—"yawed its facets," "facet" as terrace descriptor—without clear voice motivation, and a few lines ("the noisy parts of us know they can set down their aches") slip into aphorism that feels authored rather than operator-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere and character. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears twice; "monitoring noise levels" is repeated with "I monitor the corridor" and "my hands kept monitoring noise levels"; "the hush" and "silence" are synonym-churned across adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("I adjusted... I dimmed... I told... I set...") flattens momentum. Storm-glass description ("blooms with feathered crystals," "knit spiky snow," "softened to filigree") stacks figurative language densely without pattern-teaching, triggering the overwriting density check. Applying −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template stems (−1.0 cumulative under the patterned-artifact penalty pack), plus −0.3 for figurative density in one beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of gondola travel, sound monitoring, and grief counseling offers a fresh angle. The storm-glass vial as a silence-forecasting tool and the counting-as-bridge ritual are specific and non-obvious. Voice and premise cohere into a singular vision. However, the emotional arc (stranger comforts grieving child) is a familiar template, and the resolution's kindness lacks the bold risk or moral calculus that would elevate originality into the high 8s. The "teaching silence" frame, while lyrical, edges toward abstraction without a harder choice or cost that would ground it in durable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gondola operator is present throughout, makes the key decisions (adjust swing, tell story, guide counting), and those choices drive the bell's transformation from alarm to lantern. Setup is immediate, development spans the middle (story, counting ritual), and the operator's final wait ("I kept the gondola adrift") participates in closure. However, the operator's choices are all successful and face no visible trade-off or cost; the agency is enabling rather than constrained, and no live option is foreclosed. Present in all three gates with causal role in two beats (story, counting), but swappability is moderate (a different mediator role could achieve similar comfort), and the lack of a felt price limits the score. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure +0.8, but swappability −0.5 and no visible cost −0.6 yield a mid-6 placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in setup ("I carry a storm glass vial"), is consulted in development ("the vial knit spiky snow," "the vial softened its crystals"), and its clearing signals the mother's ease near closure. Three distinct beats with evolving state that guides the operator's path adjustments. However, the vial's mechanics are passive observation rather than active constraint; it forecasts rather than enables or forecloses, and its role could be replaced by other atmospheric cues with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.5, but swappability −0.7 and ornamental-leaning use −0.4 place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"In transit" is signaled early ("We were in transit") and shapes the story's container: the gondola ride frames the encounter, and the concept anchors the operator's role as mediator between stations. The transit state enables the teachable moment ("only motion can carve") and the final arrival ("completing a thought, in transit made whole") directly participates in closure by reweighting the journey as emotional passage. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; no on-page choice hinges specifically on being mid-journey versus stationary. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, thematic charge +0.5, but limited causal pressure (no narrowed options due to transit itself) −0.5 and some swappability (the comfort could occur in a waiting room) −0.4 place it at 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is established in setup ("my mind learned the art of being fluidly logical") and claimed again at closure ("If I am fluidly logical, it is because the rails demand proof"). However, the trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates fluid logic with a visible cost or constraint. The operator's choices (path adjustment, story, counting) are all empathetic and intuitive, not analytically logical. The trait does not enable a distinct tactic or foreclose an option. Early signal +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but label-only use −0.9 and no causal work −0.8 cap it at 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is invoked in setup ("where I must catalyze the next gentle drop in volume") and the operator's interventions (adjusting swing, telling story, guiding counting) are catalytic actions that shift the bell from alarm to comfort. The action drives the middle beats and enables the mother's exhale. However, "catalyze" is a metaphor for "facilitate" or "ease," not a distinct, irreplaceable action; the specificity is modest and swappable with "guide," "soothe," or "mediate." Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.4, but swappability −0.8 and summary-only invocation (the word appears once as abstract claim, not dramatized verb) −0.5 yield 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" is introduced early ("the meter I use for monitoring noise levels"), consulted in development ("My meter stuttered," "my hands kept monitoring noise levels"), and the meter's steadying signals success near closure ("The meter steadied"). Three touches across setup, middle, and ending. The monitoring shapes the operator's path adjustments (avoid the glass orchard, trim echo eddies). However, the meter's mechanics are passive observation rather than active tool use, and the protagonist could achieve similar results by listening alone. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +0.5, but swappability −0.6 and passive-observation friction −0.5 place it at 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" is named in the opening line and returns in closure ("the terrace rose to meet our slowness," "the terrace shifted"). The terrace supplies the wind ("the terrace wind met us head-on") that the operator uses to adjust the gondola's path. However, the terrace is primarily atmospheric backdrop; its drifting and facets are described but do not constrain choice in a specific, irreplaceable way. The operator's adjustments depend on swing and wind direction, which any aerial setting could provide. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +0.6, causal involvement +0.4, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental-leaning description −0.5 yield 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" is invoked twice (opening and mid-story) and frames the story's mood. The post-train quiet is the operator's work window and shapes the stakes (tending the hush). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with a live clock; the gondola ride's duration is untracked, and no choice is pressured by elapsed or remaining time. The quiet is thematic atmosphere rather than a tactical constraint. Early signal +0.6, thematic charge +0.6, but no causal pressure (no narrowed time window) −0.8 and vague duration −0.4 place it at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To teach silence how to comfort" is stated in setup ("my motive has sharpened... to teach silence how to comfort, not to intimidate") and the operator's entire arc dramatizes this desire through the story-telling and counting ritual. The motivation drives the middle beats and is reweighted at closure when the operator honors "the vaulting hush we had made." Internal friction is light (the operator is confident, not conflicted), but the cost is modest: the effort and attention spent, and the operator's solitary wait at the end. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, but limited internal conflict −0.5 and muted cost −0.5 yield 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" appears in setup ("a vaulting hush that can hold the weight of a thousand thoughts") and returns at closure ("the vaulting hush we had made"). The tone is coherent throughout—quiet, lyrical, meditative—and modulates under pressure when the bell "ricocheted" and "the hush buckled," then eases as the vial clears and the meter steadies. The final image of "the door of quiet" charges the tone with closure weight. However, the tone is largely static (contemplative reverence) rather than dynamically shifting with each beat. Early signal +0.7, closure charge +1.1, coherence +0.6, modulation +0.4, but static mood across middle −0.4 place it at 7.4.</comment>
