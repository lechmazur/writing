<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's interior landscape is distinctive—tasting metal and snow, understanding quiet as lattice rather than absence—and micro-choices (pressing the stone to ice, setting it on the drum) feel earned by prior perception. The narrator's arc from "mistook quiet for absence" to collaborative tuning with the energy beings shows genuine learning through on-page struggle. Minor slip: the energy beings remain somewhat abstract; their "hungering" is asserted more than embodied, and their dimming "to listening" lacks the physical particularity the mapkeeper receives. The final mutual discovery carries visible cost (waiting, measuring breaths) but the beings' interiority stays opaque.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the cave mapped us, and we agreed to be found" crystallizes a shift from solitary task to collaborative attunement, with the cost legible in the measured waiting and the hush becoming portable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered sensory particulars (ice drum, tuned darkness, frost-bitten thyme) and the final cadence shift ("weather that loved us") reweights the opening's "wild resonance" into "hammered repose." Causality within the accumulative frame holds: each beat (Throat Alcove tracings, corridor narrowing, ice drum convergence, tuning together) deepens the stake until readiness materializes. One persistent constraint (the echo chamber stone's warmth/cooling cycles) shapes tactics throughout and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (magnifies both danger and path, warmed as if kissed, gathered echoes like a shepherd) and charging the final image when lifted after the ice drum quiets. The harmonic caves supply tangible pressure: stalactites that would fall "like teeth," calcite ribs "like frozen surf," and the ice sheet that "crawls slow as a beast that dreams" all filter through the mapkeeper's professional attention. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—metal and snow taste, crack patterns read as script, the bloom of hush carries a fragrance—and the spatial choreography (Throat Alcove → narrowing corridor → room of tuned darkness) tracks clearly. The "gently luminous" lamp detail recurs with purpose (anything harsher would trigger collapse), grounding the world's acoustic fragility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"find the quiet in the storm before it crushes the tunnels again"—is signaled in the opening and sustained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mapkeeper discovers the ice drum and realizes the energy beings seek the same quiet and "had failed alone"; this narrows options from solo mapping to collaborative tuning, with the visible cost of waiting "until the promise held." The protagonist's agency drives the escalation: lifting the stone at the Throat Alcove, following the hush, setting the stone on the drum, and co-tuning with the beings are all volitional acts that foreclose solitary resolution. The price—backing the hush with rhythm, measuring breaths against chords, delaying departure until others can follow—is legible and felt in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mapkeeper's journey: quiet as lattice (holding space for motion) versus quiet as absence, and the necessity of collaboration when individual mastery fails. The final image—"the bloom of hush traveled with us, and the storms bowed their heads so others might pass"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral, reweighting the opening's "hammered repose" into a portable, shared condition. The ice drum, echo chamber stone, and crack-pattern script recur with shifted meaning, each constraining choices and charging closure. No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak; insights arise from tactile particulars (stone warming, hush blooming petal by petal, frost-bitten thyme scent). The piece commits fully to its acoustic-cartographic premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is highly distinctive: "clamor folded upon clamor, a pressure you taste," "like script that refuses ink," "the bloom of hush is not silence; it is a contour." Perceptual signature (reading by crack patterns, tasting metal and snow, hearing ceilings answer "like iron remembering fire") remains consistent and character-specific throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during stone-handling beats, slightly wider during reflective passages on first charts and past mistakes. The prose texture reflects the focalizer's professional idiom (ripple-mark, calcite ribs, tuned darkness) without register drift. One brief slip: "bringing memory in from the cold" edges toward poetic ornament that slightly loosens the tactile grip, but recovers immediately in the next beat's concrete action (tracing on leather with bone needle).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously—and the rhythm modulates with pressure (short declaratives at peak moments: "I knelt and read"; longer, layered sentences during reflective beats). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor deduction for occasional figurative density that risks opacity: "the hush gathered until it carried a fragrance like frost bitten thyme" stacks metaphor (bloom, fragrance, frost-bitten) in rapid succession, and "weather that refuses to break" followed immediately by "weather that loved us" shifts the vehicle without clear transition. The final paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("I am a mapkeeper… the cave mapped us") is purposeful and lands cleanly. Overall line-level control is strong with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic cartography, energy beings as collaborators rather than antagonists, and "quiet as lattice" rather than absence or victory feels specific and non-obvious. The mapkeeper's professional idiom (ripple-mark, echo chamber stone, conjure maps from frost) grounds the speculative premise in tactile particulars, avoiding generic "cave explorer" or "mystic guide" templates. The piece takes the bold risk of prioritizing sensory accumulation and collaborative attunement over confrontation, and the ending's "readiness that waited" and "weather that loved us" deliver earned resonance without sentimentality. The bloom-of-hush concept, developed across multiple beats with shifting meaning (petal by petal growth, fragrance, thickening into constellations, traveling portably), demonstrates conceptual integrity and transformation of familiar "quest for silence" material into something memorable and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's choices create every key turn: lifting the stone at the Throat Alcove (initiates hush bloom), following the hush (discovers the ice drum), setting the stone on the drum (enables convergence), co-tuning with beings (opens the door in the air), and deciding to wait until the hush can guide others (final stance crystallization). Present in setup (opening lines), middle (multiple on-page decisions that narrow tactics), and closure (the pact to be found together). Causal pressure is strong; removing this character would collapse the story's logic. One small friction: the character observes and interprets frequently, but the ratio of observation to decision still favors action at pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in setup ("I carry the echo chamber stone wrapped in felt, for it magnifies both danger and path"), middle beats (warmed at Throat Alcove, answered the ceilings, gathered stray echoes at the ice drum, set upon the drum to tune the room), and closure (lifted after the work is done, its presence on the map shines faintly). Handled physically across four distinct beats, its properties constrain choices (magnifies danger/path, warmth signals direction, gathering function enables collaboration) and the final lifting caps the arc. Irreplaceable: no generic tool could perform its specific acoustic mediation. Strong integration with visible cost (risk of magnifying danger, requiring felt wrapping, needing careful timing).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Bloom of hush" is seeded early ("I pressed it to the ice and heard a hush grow, petal by petal, until it bloomed"), shapes middle tactics (following the hush as direction-giver, backing it with rhythm to unstick the door), and charges closure ("the bloom of hush traveled with us"). The concept alters options on the page: without the bloom, no convergence with the beings or portable readiness. Cost is visible (waiting until it thickens, measuring breaths against chords). Specific mechanics matter: it is not mere silence but a contour that gathers scattered sound, enabling both mapping and collaborative passage. The element drives two major beats and is causally indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" is applied to the energy beings ("auroral threads, gently luminous and uneasy") and the mapkeeper's lamp ("a clouded sphere whose glow stayed polite before the cave"). The lamp constrains on-page action with cost: "Anything harsher, and the stalactites would fall like teeth." This visible tradeoff (safety vs. visibility) shapes one key tactic and recurs in the final map description ("shone faintly, gently luminous where our pact had settled"). Present in setup and closure, with one clear causal beat. Slightly swappable (another adjective for restrained light could work), but the repetition across beings, lamp, and map creates thematic coherence that lifts integration above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Conjure" is the mapkeeper's stated method ("I conjure maps from ripple marks and frost") and is demonstrated on-page when tracing passages "not as tunnels but as promises" onto leather with a bone needle. The action is present in setup (the task description) and payoff (the physical map-making at the ice drum), shaping the final image (the map "shone faintly"). One friction: the verb "conjure" suggests active agency, but the moment of map creation feels more transcriptive than generative—the ice drum flashes constellations and the mapkeeper traces them. The action is irreplaceable in framing the mapkeeper's role, yet slightly swappable in execution (another verb like "read" or "translate" could substitute with minor edits). Two-gate integration (setup, payoff) with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Examining crack patterns in ice" is signaled early ("I knelt and read by examining crack patterns in ice, for the cave writes with fracture") and its mechanics matter: "A fan of lines arced east, then broke, then braided back toward a chamber none had named." This method drives the middle turn (discovery of the unnamed chamber and the ice drum), enabling the convergence that shapes closure. The method is demonstrated on-page with specific detail (fan, arc, braid) and its output (the tracings left by energy beings) alters tactics. Present in setup, middle, and indirectly in closure (the final map extends this interpretive skill). Irreplaceable: no other method fits the harmonic-caves world logic as tightly. Visible cost: kneeling, slow decipherment, reliance on fracture legibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harmonic caves pressure every choice: stalactites fall if light is harsh, corridors narrow and curve (ribs of calcite), the ice drum's thinness enables sound convergence, and the Throat Alcove's ice sheet provides the crack-pattern script. Micro-setting (the drum of ice over basalt, the echo chamber stone as portable environment) constrains protagonist action and charges the final image ("the caves unclench, like a jaw no longer afraid to sing"). The setting is indispensable: no other locale could support the acoustic-mapping premise or the collaboration with sound-sensitive energy beings. Present across all three gates (setup, middle beats, closure transformation) with high specificity and visible cost (risk of collapse, need for "polite" light, measured breath during tuning).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" anchors the story's present and is referenced throughout: the beings came, tested breath, left tracings, and are waiting in the room when the mapkeeper arrives. The temporal frame shapes the middle choice (realizing the beings "had failed alone" and deciding to collaborate) and tightens the ending (waiting together "until the promise held"). One friction: the timeframe is more situational anchor than live pressure; no urgency or countdown alters tactics within the on-page action. The backstory reference to "when the caves still clanged like smithies at mourning" provides contrast, and the waiting at the end involves time as cost, lifting integration into the 6+ band. Two-gate presence (setup context, closure cost) with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is dramatized from the opening ("My task is to find the quiet in the storm before it crushes the tunnels again") through the ice-drum convergence ("In that convergence I heard the energy beings… They sought the same thing I sought") to the closure pact ("we waited, measuring breaths against chords until the promise held"). The desire drives on-page choices (following the hush, pressing the stone, tuning the room) and faces friction (danger of magnified storms, the beings' failure alone, the cost of waiting). The final realization that the caves "mapped us, and we agreed to be found" reconfigures the want from solitary task to mutual discovery. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost and character-specific inflection (learning quiet as lattice vs. absence).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" is seeded in the opening ("when wild resonance fades into hammered repose"), modulates through the narrative (the hush blooming, the convergence settling, "the caves unclench, like a jaw no longer afraid to sing"), and charges the final image ("In that hammered repose, I felt the caves unclench"). The tone balances tension (pressure that tastes, danger of collapse) with measured calm (the lamp's polite glow, the petal-by-petal hush), cohering through turns. It supports the concept by framing the acoustic stakes as violent energy forged into stillness. One slight friction: "hammered" suggests force and craft, but some beats (the bloom as organic, petal-like growth) lean pastoral, creating minor tonal variance. Still, the final invocation ties the thread cleanly, and the tone's duality (wild → shaped → repose) mirrors the plot arc. Three-gate presence with strong thematic linkage.</comment>
