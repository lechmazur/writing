<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("creeping normality noticer," documenting losses), with embodied choices (untying the bell clapper, sweeping with pine). Internal contradiction appears in the confessed passivity ("never chained myself to anything") versus present action. However, the group dynamic dilutes individual agency; Maro and Keziah remain functional but underdeveloped, and the final stance reads more as collective ritual than a personal choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (palace grounds, tea house, narrator + companions). The piece accumulates pressure through layered ritual—unpacking tools, pruning ivy, planting bulbs, breaking bread—and the ending reweights the opening frame ("Each season, we will uncloak") with a cadence shift that deepens the stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the group commits to cyclical return with tenuous absolution, foregrounding attention and repetition as the cost. One deduction: the ending drifts toward theme summary rather than a charged final image, softening the closure's bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: cracked fountain, koi tiles "more powder than color," shells from the riverbank, wisteria and ivy. The tea house constrains action (pruning, sweeping tatami) and charges the final image (the chalk name revised by dew, the shell pocketed as anchor). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Minor slip: the courtyard's spatial choreography during the group work is occasionally vague, but the micro-setting (bell, kettle, broom) functions as pressure and closure apparatus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "to find the sacred in the ordinary" and restore what the city forgets. Pressure accumulates through guerrilla gardening tasks and the group's shared confessions of complicity. One tightening occurs when morning threatens and they must decide what to leave visible, forcing a trade-off between sanctuary and survival. The ending reweights the stake (cyclical return) but the cost remains diffuse—no single choice forecloses a live option with sharp consequence. Under Accumulative lens, this is sufficient but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (attention, ritual, resistance as care) emerges through concrete particulars: the vanished bakery's bread, planting crumbs, writing the bakery's name in chalk for dew to revise. The piece resists moralizing and embraces tenuous absolution without forced resolution. Final image ("let the city relearn its own pulse") reweights prior material without stating a thesis. One slip: "what I seek is not redemption, but a place where action and attention stay married" edges toward thematic echo, though it remains rooted in the narrator's voice and the scene's ritual logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and voice-motivated: "creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle," the rhythm of "Snip, lift, thank, return." POV distance is stable; psychic reach stays within the narrator's knowledge. Diction is controlled and apt. Two deductions: (1) occasional elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "guerrilla gardening") sits uneasily against the lyric texture in peak beats, and (2) dialogue is absent, so subtext and character distinction through speech cannot be evaluated. Free indirect passages are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two deductions: (1) repetitive syntactic stems in the middle third ("We begin," "We uncloak," "We decide," "We recloak") create template cadence (−0.5), and (2) a handful of paraphrase loops (e.g., "guerrilla gardening" recurs without evolving function, "tenuous" explained twice). Minor figurative muddle: "the loaf's last warmth rides beside my heartbeat" strains credibility. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ritual resistance, guerrilla gardening as sanctuary-making, and the specific image of planting bread crumbs between bulbs. The narrator's role as "creeping normality noticer" and the group's confessions (selling herbs, watering concrete) personalize a familiar activist premise. One deduction: the core frame (reclaiming a forgotten space, cyclical return) is well-executed but not conceptually surprising. Risk-taking in voice and structure is present but modest. Emotional specificity ("tenuous suits us") avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: first line. Development: observes losses, unwraps tools, rings the bell, breaks bread, confesses documentation. Closure: "I will return…each season, we will uncloak." The character narrates and participates but does not make a singular decision that alters tactics; the group's collective action diffuses individual agency. Causal pressure is moderate; the character's attention shapes the ritual but does not drive a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("carry bread from vanished bakery in my knapsack"). Development: shared with tea, steam rises "like a map of lanes," crumbs planted between bulbs, warmth "rides beside my heartbeat" in closure. The bread appears in three distinct beats and charges the final image. One deduction: the bread's function is symbolic and ritualistic rather than a constraint that alters a choice under pressure. Strong lyric reprise but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: implied early in "to admit my delays." Development: "tenuous absolution, the kind you must renew by sweeping"; "Tenuous suits us." Closure: present in the tea house's offer and the group's decision to return cyclically. The concept shapes the stake (seeking absolution through ritual) and modulates tone, but it does not constrain a middle choice or force a trade-off. Present across beats; thematic pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "heuristically gentle" appears in the plan. Development: the rhythm "Snip, lift, thank, return" embodies the trait. Closure: recloaking "lightly" reflects gentleness. The attribute colors tactics but does not impose a visible cost or enable a key turn. Label-only at introduction; enacted modestly in the pruning rhythm. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in the plan ("uncloak the tea house"). Development: uncloaking the doorway with shells, loosening ivy, hanging the broom. Closure: "we will uncloak what matters." The action drives multiple beats and structures the narrative arc. One deduction: the action could be replaced with similar restoration verbs (restore, reveal) without breaking logic. Strong integration but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned in the plan. Development: pruning, planting bulbs, patching the teapot, laying shells—all guerrilla gardening acts. Closure: the method frames the cyclical return. The means shapes attempts and charges the resistance-as-care theme. One deduction: the mechanics are shown but do not impose a constraint or cost that narrows options. Present across beats; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: second line. Development: the tea house supplies the space for ritual (tatami, bell, kettle, doorway), constrains action (pruning ivy to access it), and provides the threshold. Closure: "the tea house offers…tenuous absolution" and the decision to return. The setting is indispensable; story logic and final image depend on this exact space. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: first line and closure echo ("after the birds fly south"). Development: morning threatens officials, forcing the decision to recloak. The timeframe signals seasonal rhythm and imposes one constraint (pre-dawn urgency). Closure: cyclical return tied to seasons. Present in setup and closure; middle constraint is brief. Functional but could be replaced with another seasonal or temporal marker without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: fourth line. Development: dramatized through ritual actions (pruning, planting, breaking bread, speaking names of erased streets). Closure: "let the city relearn its own pulse." The motivation drives the stake and shapes choices across beats. One deduction: the friction between want and cost is present (confessions, tenuous absolution) but diffuse rather than crystallized in a single choice. Strong integration; desire is embodied, not merely told.</comment>
