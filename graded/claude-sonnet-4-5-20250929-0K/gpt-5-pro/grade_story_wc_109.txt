<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scribe's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through craft obsession and the father's pier memory. The oracle arrives as a distinct voice with tactile details (grains in braids, foam-tasted stick), and their interaction generates genuine pressure. The scribe's arc—from "a map needs edges" to naming pauses as harbors—feels earned through on-page negotiation with the oracle's pedagogy. Minor slip: the commander and fort men remain functional props without individuated pressure, and the ending's collective gentleness ("men listened… began to tie their gear with gentler fingers") gestures at change without showing a forfeited path or visible cost in the scribe's final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (ridge fort, storm, scribe at charts, one remaining star). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through the oracle's arrival, the gold booklet's shedding flakes, and the scribe's evolving map notation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the map weighted with cannonballs and bread, the star lowering, the booklet emptied. Felt cost is present but muted: the night gains "rooms" rather than an escape, and the collaborative naming forecloses the scribe's initial insistence on edges. The closure image reweights prior material (silence as first shore, pauses as harbors) but the cost to the scribe personally—what specific path or stance is lost—remains atmospheric rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ridge fort is vivid and pressure-laden: wind braids spindrift through arrow slits, the storm worries driftwood, the cliff drops to surf. Sensory hierarchy is strong—sea breath, lantern glass, the star's shine "scraping the sky"—and details like cannonballs and bread weighting the map corners ground the closure beat. The oracle's body (salted ankles, foam-tasted stick) and the gold booklet (flaking, shedding specks) function as micro-setting that charges the final image. The fort's physical layout (wall, yard, battlements, storerooms, barracks) remains coherent throughout, and the last star acts as a recurring spatial anchor that tightens the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (draw a map of an endless night to give it rooms/thresholds) is signaled early and sustained. The oracle's pedagogy applies immediate pressure: "edges begin at the ear," forcing the scribe to abandon linear cartography for silence-summary. The booklet's flaking gold provides a deepening mechanism—each shed flake becomes a harbor—and the scribe's renaming ("unbroken breath," "held-back tear") narrows options from conventional mapmaking to collaborative, ephemeral notation. Cost is legible in the shift from "edges" to "rooms, not limits," but the ending's communal gentling (men tie gear with gentler fingers, commander mutters but does not argue) diffuses urgency. The map's completion coincides with the star's descent and the booklet's emptying, delivering closure through exhaustion rather than a protagonist-driven trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as first shore, pauses as harbors, the map as retelling of the unspoken. The scribe's father's dictum ("maps are promises you make to tomorrow… promise the night a way to knock") seeds the thematic question and recurs with earned weight at closure when the scribe names silences. The oracle's pedagogy (summarizing silence, recognizing thresholds) integrates with the scribe's obsession with "distances no compass could name," and the final image—chart weighted with cannonballs and bread, booklet emptied, star lowering—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the night ceases to be endless when it has rooms. No overt moralizing; the piece trusts its imagery. Subtext operates in gesture (oracle tapping the stick, men stepping softer) and the commander's muttered question ("through being longer than out") adds thematic friction without resolving it tidily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and apt; the scribe's perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic obsession, memory of father's pier, attention to silence and distance). Diction is purposeful and voice-distinct: "marbled hush," "syruped quietude," "shore arrived in the flesh," "wind paced… like a tired animal." The oracle's direct speech carries distinct idiom ("edges begin at the ear," "rooms, not limits") and the scribe's internal register modulates under pressure without losing texture. Minor slip: "men stepping softer as if not to bruise the unwritten" and "tie their gear with gentler fingers" risk abstraction, and the final paragraph's stacked clauses ("We waited… We set… Wind paced") compress closure beats in a way that slightly flattens the scribe's interior charge. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong images ("spindrift across the storm-tossed ridge," "the star riding like a nail above the surf," "reefs wait"). Information density is high in early paragraphs, and figurative language is mostly vivid and coherent. Three friction points lower the grade: (1) "marbled hush" recurs four times without functional variation, risking motif fatigue; (2) the sequence "We set… Wind paced… We waited" in the final paragraph uses identical "We [verb]" stems in close succession, creating template cadence at closure; (3) minor opacity in "ambered hush" and "syruped quietude poured from a wound in time"—the vehicles are adjacent in sensory register and blur slightly. The closure beat ("We waited in the marbled hush until the last star lowered, and the booklet emptied its gold") is clean but the prior template run dulls momentum just before it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—mapmaking by naming silences in a dimming endless night—is fresh and commits fully to its implications. The oracle as pedagogue, the flaking gold booklet as living text, and the scribe's shift from edges to rooms offer specific, non-obvious synthesis. The piece resists generic abstraction through grounded detail (grain-click braids, foam-tasted stick, cannonballs and bread as weights). Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, minimal conflict, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limit: the fort setting and scribe-cartographer premise echo familiar fantasy/speculative templates; transformation through the silence-summary method and the father's pier memory elevates it, but the core frame (lone scholar, mystic visitor, symbolic task) remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle appears early (~15% in), drives two beats (arrival and correction of the scribe's hand, then guiding the naming), and shapes closure by affirming "it would lead us through." Her pedagogy constrains the scribe's method and enables the final map. Causal pressure is moderate; she teaches rather than opposes, so the friction is pedagogical rather than adversarial. Specificity is strong (pebble-shore, grain-click braids, foam-tasted stick) and her presence is indispensable to the scribe's shift from edges to rooms.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The booklet is seeded early (~20% in), handled in multiple beats (set between them, studied, sheds flakes that become harbors, empties at closure), and its state change (flaking → emptied) marks the ending. Causal role is solid: the flakes become small harbors on the map, and the booklet's emptying coincides with the night's transformation. Cost is present—each flake sacrifices the booklet's material to create the map—but the mechanism is slightly ornamental (flakes landing and becoming harbors reads more metaphorical than constraining). Strong closure linkage elevates it into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "marbled hush" (variant of ambered hush) recurs four times, frames the piece's tone, and describes the room's atmosphere when the booklet is opened. It appears early, resurfaces at closure ("We waited in the marbled hush"), and charges the final image by naming the texture of the ending moment. However, it primarily functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than a stake or tactic; the hush does not constrain choices or alter options directly. Lyric reprise with thematic weight lifts it into mid-5s, but swappability with "quiet" or "stillness" in most beats limits it to ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The trait appears once in the opening ("I was the scribe, mildly obsessed with distances no compass could name") and is echoed thematically in the scribe's father's pier memory and the final naming of unmappable pauses. It shapes the scribe's receptiveness to the oracle's method but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The obsession is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable; a generic "curious" or "dedicated" scribe would yield a similar arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Retelling is seeded in the oracle's instruction ("if you can learn to retell what is not said"), enacted mid-story ("I began to draw lines that were less like roads and more like pauses between breaths"), and climaxes when the scribe reads the map aloud by naming each pause. The action drives the scribe's transformation from cartographic edges to silence-summary and constitutes the closure beat. Causal pressure is strong, and the method is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on this exact verb. Cost is present in the shift from conventional mapping to ephemeral, collaborative notation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is introduced early by the commander ("a map should begin by summarizing silence, not by stabbing lines"), signaled again by the oracle ("retell what is not said"), and executed at closure when the scribe reads the map aloud by naming each pause. It shapes the scribe's attempts (correcting hurried hand, renaming pauses) and defines the final product. Mechanics matter: the summary-by-naming transforms silence into navigable rooms. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure across three beats justify high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fort is present throughout, vividly described (wind through arrow slits, storm-worried driftwood, battlements, yard), and provides spatial anchors (wall, lantern glass, cannonballs and bread). However, the setting does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the mapmaking could occur in any isolated shelter. The storm pressures the atmosphere but does not force the scribe to adapt tactics. Micro-setting (body, tool) is strong (oracle's stick, booklet, the scribe's charts), which lifts the score into mid-6s, but the fort itself remains postcard-functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early (title, opening line) and recurs at closure ("the last star lowered"). The single remaining star functions as a visible clock that tightens the ending image, and the dimming sky creates ambient urgency. However, the narrative does not track elapsed time or use the star's descent to force a decision; the mapmaking proceeds without a ticking deadline. Lyric reprise with thematic charge (the star as nail, then lowering) elevates it into upper-5s, but it does not alter tactics or compress choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("My charge was to draw a map of an endless night before it swallowed our coasts") and drives the scribe's receptiveness to the oracle's pedagogy. Friction between the scribe's initial method (edges, compass) and the oracle's (silence, pauses) dramatizes the want. The scribe's shift from edges to rooms by the ending shows the motivation evolving under pressure. Cost is present—the scribe renounces conventional cartography—and the final map (weighted with cannonballs and bread, chart on the floor) embodies the transformed desire. Strong causal role and closure linkage justify upper-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "marbled hush" recurs four times, coheres through all beats, and modulates slightly (from "marbled hush… holds your pulse" to "marbled the room, swirled with our heartbeats" to "We waited in the marbled hush"). Tone supports the piece's quiet, accumulative design and charges the final image by naming the texture of the ending moment. The tone does not shift dramatically under pressure but maintains consistent lyric gravity. Coherence and closure linkage justify low-7s; a more pronounced modulation (e.g., hush breaking or crystallizing) would lift it higher.</comment>
