<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is poetic and specific ("culture shock absorber," "hopeful desperation had a smell, like citrus rind squeezed over rust"), but the piece leans heavily on labels and metaphorical self-description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to press the chip into both leaders' palms and broker the compromise feels motivated by prior setup, but the decision arc is more narrated than dramatized—we're told the dual allegiance becomes "a braid" rather than seeing the internal conflict wrestle itself out. Micro-choices under pressure exist (painting the herons, moving the parade), yet the emotional progression stays smooth and articulate throughout, lacking the credible irrationality or self-deception that high-band characterization demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (the chip, the graffiti code, the parade reroute) that converge at the ending when the narrator stands "between Yano and Miri, my dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the city "not triumphant, but not conquered either"—and the cost is legible in the developers' grumbling and the muted collective hum. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (raft city, carnival, privatization week). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator's painted herons shift both factions' tactics, and the final image of tucking the chip under the tongue charges the reconfiguration with ritual weight. The lens holds without contradiction, and the ending reweights the dual role with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft city is vivid and purposeful: rope bridges, tide charts, hulls bearing graffiti, floating libraries and clinics. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting—its "pocked like a map" texture and its socket in the shrimp mural constrain the narrator's tactical choices and charge the final image when it's tucked under the tongue. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's professional lens (confetti routes, tide-shadow, diesel and jasmine). Spatial choreography is clean across moves (mast, docks, bridge, Lantern Gate keel), and the setting actively shapes the reroute that starves the financiers while anchoring rents. The environment embodies the stakes and enables the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the raft city's soul against privatization—is signaled early and tightens when the guild and council make competing demands. One meaningful escalation occurs when the narrator's painted code reroutes the parade, narrowing the developers' access while flooding vulnerable districts with customers; the cost is visible in Yano's and Miri's reluctant agreement and the financiers' departure. The narrator's agency drives the turn: the dual-message painting and the physical pressing of the chip into each leader's palm foreclose easy options with on-page consequence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the ending shows a trade-off—survival without triumph—that reweights prior tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the raft city's material struggle: dual allegiance, the weight of foundation versus the pressure of change, survival through tactical compromise. The foundation stone chip shifts meaning from talisman to shared burden to oral sacrament, charging the ending without overt statement. "Hopeful desperation" and "the water keeps receipts" avoid platitude through concrete anchoring. The final image—chip under tongue, dreams of steadier choices—offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of how to turn together without breaking. However, the phrase "dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid" edges toward thematic summary, and the ending risks over-explaining the pivot rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies braided together," "orderly intuitive," the chip as memory of weight. Diction is poetic but controlled, staying within a voice that blends bureaucratic practicality with lyric specificity. No head-hopping; the single POV is stable. Purposeful compression (e.g., "hopeful desperation had a smell") teaches a pattern that pays off in the final image. The two brief dialogue exchanges ("move east, slow drums, open hands" in the painting code; "it is not a finale, it is a pivot") feel goal-driven and voice-matched. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer under pressure, wider in the final reflective beat—and free indirect style remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and many lines do double work ("The chip found its place inside the mouth of a painted shrimp, and a path bloomed that rerouted the main glitter current around Old Clinic Row"). However, the piece accumulates metaphorical density without clear escalation—nearly every sentence in the first third carries figurative language ("confetti, tide charts, and whispered apologies braided together," "feathers were not already molting," "flowed like song"), which softens momentum rather than sharpening it. Several phrases loop conceptually: "hopeful desperation" appears twice with similar framing, and "dual allegiance" is restated in multiple forms across the arc. The final paragraph's "dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid" followed by "steadier choices" risks paraphrase. Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the smell of our dawns," "the shared costume") occasionally dull immediacy. No major grammatical errors, but the prose would benefit from selective pruning to raise information density and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival setting and graffiti-code navigation system offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis that feels fresh. The foundation stone chip as both talisman and tactical key avoids token symbolism by shaping multiple beats. The dual-allegiance premise is grounded in concrete occupational detail (parade routes, vendor clusters, tide charts) rather than abstract politicking. However, the core arc—insider mediator brokers compromise to resist gentrification—echoes familiar templates, and the transformation relies more on setting texture than on a surprising moral calculus or character contradiction. The ending's hopeful-but-not-triumphant tone is earned but predictable. Risk-taking is modest: the graffiti mechanic and the chip-under-tongue ritual elevate the material, yet the emotional and plot trajectories follow expected paths without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "culture shock absorber" label appears in the opening line and frames the narrator's role across beats: reading the mural, drafting the dual-message painting, pressing the chip into both leaders' palms. These are decisions that alter tactics and drive the parade reroute, not mere observation. The element shapes the middle escalation (painting the herons) and participates in closure (standing between Yano and Miri, dual allegiance as braid). However, the character's choices feel more narrated than dramatically contested—the internal conflict is told rather than shown wrestling in scene—so causal pressure is moderate. Setup early, development in the middle painting beat, payoff in the final standing-between image: all three gates are met. Score reflects solid causal involvement with some swappability in execution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip is introduced early ("In my pocket I carried…"), handled in multiple beats (finding the socket in the shrimp mural, pressing into Miri's and Yano's palms, tucked under tongue at the end), and its meaning evolves from talisman to shared burden to oral sacrament. Each use constrains or enables a choice: the socket unlocks the reroute path, the physical passing mediates the compromise, the final placement charges the narrator's dream of steadier choices. The object is irreplaceable—its "pocked like a map" specificity and its ritual weight tie directly to the raft city's founding and the closure's reconfiguration. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met with high causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor deduction for one beat (the socket moment) being slightly more described than dramatized in consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dual allegiance shapes stakes from the opening ("one pledge to the Revel Guild…and one to the Drift Council") and drives the central conflict: the guild wants a grand finale, the council wants safety. The concept constrains tactics throughout—the narrator must satisfy both masters—and the middle escalation (painting the dual-message herons) is a direct expression of this pressure. The ending explicitly names the concept ("my dual allegiance no longer a split but a braid") and the cost is legible in Yano's and Miri's reluctant agreement. Setup early, development in the painting beat, payoff in the closure image. However, the final naming risks thematic echo, and the concept occasionally reads more as theme than as on-page friction that narrows options in real time. Still, the dual demands alter tactics across multiple beats, so causal pressure is solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" appears in two lines: "The guild called me orderly intuitive, because I could read a swirl of chaos and slot it into a path that flowed like song" and "orderly intuitive in action, reorganizing drummers, blossom sellers, and stilt walkers by rhythm and need." The trait is claimed but not tested with visible cost—the narrator's reorganization succeeds without friction or a demonstrated tradeoff between order and intuition. The attribute shapes the narrator's identity and enables the reroute action, but it's more label than dramatized constraint. Setup in the first third, invoked again in the middle, but no closure participation and no on-page moment where the trait's limits or advantages create a pivotal choice. Two gates (setup, development mention) yield eligibility up to ~6.0, but lack of cost and swappability (could be "strategic mediator" or similar) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is the central action: the narrator reorganizes parade routes and market clusters to navigate gentrification, and the word recurs across beats ("We needed to reorganize…quickly," "reorganizing drummers, blossom sellers, and stilt walkers"). The painted herons trigger the float shifts ("the parade captains began shifting floats like chess with oars"), and the resulting reroute starves the financiers while anchoring rents—a major turn that redefines the city's options. The action is signaled early, drives the middle escalation, and shapes the closure (the city "not conquered"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met with high causal pressure. Minor swappability remains (could be "redirect" or "reroute" with edits), but the action's repetition and its direct link to the stakes and ending earn a strong score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Messages encoded in graffiti art" is introduced early ("Our plans traveled through messages encoded in graffiti art, layered on hulls and bunting") and its mechanics matter: the chip unlocks color-aligned arrows in the mural, and the narrator paints the dual-message herons whose hidden lines ("move east, slow drums, open hands") are passed by boatwright kids. The method enables the middle escalation (the parade reroute) and is referenced in the final line ("the city would learn it step by step through messages encoded in graffiti art, and survive"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. However, the method's mechanics are more described than tested under pressure—we don't see a moment where the code fails or where its constraints force a tactical choice. Solid causal involvement but moderate irreplaceability; another covert signaling method could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "perpetual carnival afloat on a raft city" is anchored in the opening line and supplies resources and constraints throughout: rope bridges, tide charts, floating hulls for graffiti, the geography of docks versus Old Clinic Row versus Lantern Gate. The setting enables the reroute tactic (the "main glitter current" can be redirected around specific districts) and pressures choices (the developers' favored pier can be turned into a "quiet backwater"). The carnival's pending privatization drives urgency, and the raft's tidal nature shapes the narrator's navigation metaphors. The final image—diesel and jasmine from upriver, the city's low hum—charges the closure with environmental texture. Setup, development, payoff all met with high causal pressure and irreplaceability. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"The last week before privatization" is signaled early and frames urgency: "venture boats circled like gulls," the need to reorganize "quickly." The timeframe tightens the decision to act now rather than later, and the ending's "morning" and "before sleep" anchor the resolution in a final countdown moment. However, the week itself is not tracked day by day, and no on-page beat shows the clock narrowing options in real time—the pressure is more atmospheric than mechanically enforced. Setup and closure participation are present (the week frames the arc, the final night/morning marks the pivot), but middle development is weak. Two gates yield eligibility up to ~6.0; the timeframe's contribution to urgency and its presence at closure lift the score modestly, but it remains somewhat replaceable with "final days" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Navigate gentrification" is the dominant motivation, signaled early ("to navigate gentrification without surrendering the soul we danced on") and dramatized in conflicting choices: the guild wants spectacle for financiers, the council wants safety and dignity. The desire drives the middle escalation (rerouting to starve developers) and the ending shows the cost (the city "not triumphant, but not conquered"). Friction between wants (preserving soul) and costs (losing easy spectacle, risking both factions' trust) is visible on the page. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The motivation is slightly abstract—"gentrification" and "soul" are high-level concepts—but the narrator's tactics (rerouting the glitter current, moving vendors) ground it in concrete choices. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, minor deduction for occasional thematic drift rather than urgent immediate want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named explicitly ("had a smell, like citrus rind squeezed over rust") and embodied in imagery throughout: feathers molting, the city's low hum, "not triumphant, but not conquered." The tone modulates with pressure—brighter metaphors in the opening (confetti, carnival), heavier in the midnight mural walk (tide-shadow, cinders), muted and ritualistic at the end (chip under tongue, diesel and jasmine). The tone charges the final image by sustaining the duality: survival without victory. However, the explicit naming of the tone twice ("hopeful desperation") and the phrase "the shared costume of people who know the water keeps receipts" edge toward thematic summary rather than pure tonal embodiment. Setup early, coherent through turns, strong payoff. Solid integration with minor over-articulation.</comment>
