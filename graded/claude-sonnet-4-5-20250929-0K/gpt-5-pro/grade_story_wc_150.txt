<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear interiority around diaspora and faith ("warmly curious rather than brave"), but much of the character work lives in reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The decision to rebuild the sundial emerges from Aram's prompting more than internal conflict, and the final whispered promise feels declarative rather than costly. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("carried it as if carrying a sleeping bird"), but therapy-adjacent phrasing like "rebuild the road between them" and "faith is not a treasure chest but a road crew" flattens peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (roots threading skulls, dial shadow traveling like blessing) that reweight the dominant stake of restoring faith and temporal connection. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraphs. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the sundial holding moonlight and "time stepped over the threshold we rebuilt for it" crystallizes the protagonist's shift from passive longing to active continuity-maker with felt cost (the renunciation of detached observation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the gnomon clicks into place and "time climb[s] out of the soil," altering the narrator's relation to the dead and the living. Minor cost-legibility issue: the exact trade-off or foreclosed path could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("air carried figs and damp limestone," "bark slick, each tree a ladder for the restless dead") and the setting constrains choice: the narrator must search among roots and ribs to find the gnomon, and the spatial choreography of the dig team, orchard, and crypt remains clear throughout. The sundial base on the crypt step charges the final image, making the environment integral to closure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) meets the 9+ gate: the dial and its shadow govern the bread-making and the closing blessing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—restoring faith and temporal continuity—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist begins searching for the gnomon, then deepens when the dial is reassembled and "time climb[s] out of the soil." Agency is present: the protagonist chooses to search, gather fragments, and set the dial, and these actions foreclose the path of passive diaspora detachment. Cost is legible but soft: the whispered promise and the shift from "warmly curious" observer to active restorer show a change in stance, yet the exact price paid (what option is lost, what fear confronted) remains more implied than viscerally dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and final image reweight the stake sufficiently for mid-7s, but a sharper on-page trade-off would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: interrupted journeys, temporal rupture, and diaspora loss converge in the sundial's restoration without overt thesis statements. The final image—"shadow traveled across us like a hand in blessing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how faith and continuity are rebuilt. Minor deduction for one near-thematic-echo moment: "faith is not a treasure chest but a road crew that meets you where the bridge fell" reads slightly declarative, though it remains tied to the scene's particulars and avoids full sermonizing. The recurring motifs (roots, shadows, bread, the dial) accumulate pressure and reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a lyric, meditative voice that fits the reflective diaspora returnee. Perceptual signature is evident in the figurative texture ("questions like water carried light," "bones looked less like endings and more like rested luggage"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated, workshop-register phrasing ("Resonant Reconfiguration" is not in the text, but "belief arrived in mixed tenses" and "compass of stains that refused to fade" push toward abstraction). No dialogue is present to judge naturalism or subtext. Free indirect style is clean, tense is consistent, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. Minor penalty for slight over-reliance on metaphor density in peak beats, which risks obscuring immediacy, though voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and a lyric ear, but several artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("Our journeys were not over; they had been interrupted" / "interrupted journeys braided into one long walk"), synonym churn around "interrupted" and "restless," and near-identical stems ("I carried," "I understood," "I realized"). Template-cadence runs appear in the middle third ("I thought of…," "I did it through…," "I carried it as if…"). Stock metaphors like "door opening slowly" and "hand in blessing" lack sharp specificity. Information density is high in places, but scaffold sentences ("So I…," "So we…") and minor redundancies (e.g., "shifted from fear to welcome" echoes prior "less like endings") dull momentum. No major clarity breaks, but combined texture issues prevent higher scoring and trigger the artifact penalty pack baseline (~−0.8 in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, archaeological excavation, and sundial restoration as a metaphor for temporal and spiritual continuity feels specific and non-obvious. The orchard/catacomb setting and the grandmother's dial offer fresh particulars that resist generic templates. Minor deduction for proximity to familiar "return to roots" and "lost heirloom restoration" arcs, though the story transforms these through the lived detail of the dig and the specific mechanics of the sundial. The emotional arc and thematic question are inextricable, and the ending's image (moonlit shadow blessing) grows inevitably from prior beats. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the quiet, reflective closure, which heightens stakes without gimmickry; within-band bonus (+0.3) applied for sustained voice and conceptual integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Diaspora returnee frames the story from the opening line and the protagonist's choices—to join the dig, search for the gnomon, rebuild the dial—create key turns in the middle and ending. The character's observation is purposeful and leads to decisions that alter tactics (searching "with feet that drift and stop when a scent or glint spoke up," setting the dial). Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure is moderate (the returnee status motivates the search but could be fulfilled by a similar outsider/insider role). Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability −0.5, minus late development arrival −0.3 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sundial base appears early (Aram shows it), recurs in the middle (fragments gathered, gnomon found), and charges the final image (holds moonlight, shadow travels). Handled across at least three beats and its specific properties (cracked into three, faint lines, the gnomon groove) matter to the action. Causal pressure: the dial's reassembly enables the bread-timing and the closing blessing, narrowing the protagonist's path from passive observer to active restorer. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4, minus slight ornamental description in first mention −0.3 = ~7.8 (round 7.8).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys is named explicitly and shapes the thematic stakes throughout: "journeys were not over; they had been interrupted," "ships that reversed course," "interrupted journeys braided into one long walk." The concept informs the protagonist's motivation and the sundial's symbolic role (restoring temporal continuity). Present in setup (diaspora framing), development (search and rebuild as resumption), and payoff (final image of arriving ships and remembered streets). Causal pressure is moderate: the concept guides the protagonist's interpretive frame but does not create a distinct on-page choice or tactic beyond thematic resonance. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, minus primarily thematic rather than tactical −0.6 = ~6.7 (round 6.7).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" is named early ("I was warmly curious rather than brave") and subtly shapes the protagonist's approach: the searching is exploratory rather than urgent, and the narrator frames the work as question-carrying. The trait enables the purposeful wandering and the openness to Aram's guidance, but no single on-page choice hinges on being warmly curious versus another trait (e.g., determined, reverent). Present in setup and implied in development; payoff mentions "still warmly curious" at the end. Score: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.4, minus label-only in key moments −0.5, minus swappability −0.4 = ~5.8 (round 5.8).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rebuild is the dominant action: gathering fragments, stitching stone to stone, setting the gnomon. It drives the middle beats and defines the ending's change (temporal and relational continuity restored). Major turns trace to this action: the dial's completion allows the bread-timing and charges the final blessing image. Specificity: the mechanics of lime, alignment, and the gnomon groove matter. Present in setup (Aram's prompt), development (search and assembly), and payoff (dial holding moonlight). Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5, minus slight passivity (Aram initiates) −0.4 = ~7.6 (round 7.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through purposeful wandering" is named explicitly ("I did it through purposeful wandering") and the mechanics appear: "letting my feet drift and stop when a scent or glint spoke up." The method shapes the search beats and distinguishes the protagonist's approach from systematic excavation. Present in development and implied in the final wandering posture ("kept walking, still warmly curious"). Not present in setup; first named past the one-third mark. Score: mid-arrival −0.3, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.5, specificity +0.4, minus slight summary-only framing −0.3 = ~6.2 (round 6.2).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is integral: the roots snake between bones, the trees rise from crypt floors, and the spatial layout governs the search and dial placement. Setting pressures choices (where to search, where to set the dial) and supplies resources (the crypt step, the fig tree ribs). Present in setup, development, and payoff (orchard breathes, learns names, frames the moonlit dial). The specific details (roots cupping ribs, bark slick, skulls winking like lanterns) are irreplaceable and charge the final image. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost connection +0.5, minus slight postcard description in opening −0.2 = ~7.9 (round 7.9).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" frames the timeframe and recurs as a structural refrain ("Our days unfolded across excavating a tomb," "Again and again, across excavating a tomb"). The duration tightens the bread-timing decision and the orchard's gradual acceptance. Present in setup, development, and payoff. Time is tracked loosely (days, dusk, night, morning) but does not create urgent pressure or a live clock. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus vague tracking −0.5, minus no urgent pressure −0.4 = ~6.1 (round 6.1).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To restore lost faith" is the protagonist's declared motivation and informs the entire arc. The desire is dramatized through the dial restoration and the shift from detachment to active continuity-maker. Friction is present: the protagonist must confront uncertainty ("belief arrived in mixed tenses") and the physical labor of rebuilding. Present in setup, development, and payoff (whispered promise to carry on the hours). Cost connection is moderate: the faith is "restored" but the exact trade-off or fear confronted is more implied than viscerally shown. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.3, minus some told-only moments −0.5 = ~6.9 (round 6.9).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cautious enchantment is coherent throughout: the protagonist's steps are "in cautious enchantment," the searching is exploratory, and the tone modulates from initial uncertainty to the final "orchard breathed" and "shadow traveled…like a hand in blessing." The tone charges the final image and fits the accumulative, lyric design. Present in setup, maintained through development, and peaks at payoff. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, coherence +0.6, minus slight static quality in middle beats −0.4 = ~7.2 (round 7.2).</comment>
