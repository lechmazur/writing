<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spinner's internal state is conveyed through embodied action—touching the bead to steady breath, threading herself into listening posture—and her choices (arranging puzzle edges, releasing the bead rather than crossing herself) are causally motivated by grief and duty. The decision to stay and send only the bead rather than vanish forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor slip: the sister's late arrival reads slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized, and some interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("distance was nothing but how many layers of silence") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres under accumulative pressure—raveling silence, jigsaw edges, amber bead—building density until the final image reweights the orchard from dying to living through the sister's return. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~80 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise into fulfillment): the spinner's patient waiting and the bead's journey across impossible distance pay off on the page when the sister arrives wearing the bead, and the orchard shifts from fruitless to "a ferment of warmth, bread, and bees." The cost is legible: seasons of solitary vigil and the spinner's near-sacrifice. One meaningful deepening—her choice to stay rather than cross—tightens options and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo forest ground the piece early and recur with specificity: fruitless branches, bamboo whispering, moonbeams stippling fabric. The jigsaw edges and amber bead function as micro-setting elements that constrain the spinner's ritual choices. The final image—orchard sighing, dropping a pale leaf—charges the closure by signaling regeneration. Spatial choreography (blanket, frame, throat, wrist) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reaching the sister across impossible distance) is signaled early and tightens when the spinner must choose between crossing herself and preserving the orchard as a living place for return. The reversal—releasing the bead instead of herself—narrows options and carries visible cost: seasons of waiting, feeding lantern oil and patience. Agency is clear in the spinner's renunciation (stopping at the threshold) and the bead's dispatch. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the layered ritual and deepens when the sister's footfall finally answers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (connection across impossible distance, sacrifice as tether) emerges from particulars: the raveling silence, jigsaw edges as "soft knives," the bead as ferry-boat. The final image—orchard shifting from fruitless to "a ferment of warmth, bread, and bees"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: the sister arrives "thinner and taller," carrying rain and roads, embodying cost. Minor slip: one line ("distance was nothing but how many layers of silence") edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable and lyric; the spinner's perceptual signature (listening for threads the living cannot hear, combing burrs from wool) is consistent and specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching the loom-spinner idiom. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear but fit the reflective, accumulative texture without dulling immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping. Minor slip: some metaphoric intensifiers ("stoically sparkling" recurs three times) edge toward decorative repetition rather than dynamic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or ritual action. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (raveling silence, soft knives, filament) is coherent. However, several phrasesLoop or paraphrase: "stoically sparkling" appears three times with minimal variation; "raveling silence" recurs without reweighting; "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" bookends without added pressure. Template cadence in the ritual sequence (one by one she nested, she whispered, she spoke, she untied) flattens momentum slightly. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull line-level propulsion in the middle third, triggering baseline deduction in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of loom-spinning, jigsaw puzzle edges as threshold, and amber bead as message-ferry is specific and non-obvious. The orchard setting and the spinner's choice to stay rather than cross transform the familiar "message to a lost loved one" premise through lived ritual detail and a credible moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative logic. Minor limitation: the jigsaw-edge mechanism, while fresh, is introduced somewhat late (~30%) and its exact function (square hummed, edges tightened) remains slightly abstract, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spinner's choices—arranging edges, threading herself into listening posture, stopping at the threshold to stay rather than cross, releasing the bead—create key turns and constrain the ending. She is present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure) and drives the escalation. However, the final beat shifts focus to the sister's arrival, slightly reducing the spinner's direct agency in the closure image itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber bead is handled in multiple beats: hanging at her throat (early signal), touched to steady breath, looped with hair over the frame, released across the threshold, and reappearing at the sister's throat in the final image with reweighted meaning (inheritance → message → reunion token). Its unique property (holding lost voices) shapes the ritual's logic and charges the closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The raveling silence is signaled early ("from the grove's roots rose a raveling silence") and shapes tactics: the spinner reads it, combs fragments, lets it draw to the jigsaw ring, and sends the bead through it. It recurs across beats and participates in the closure when "the raveling silence reknit" and "eased, no longer raveling." Its mechanics (unspooling, parting hush from hush) constrain the ritual's logic and carry conceptual cost (layers of silence as distance). Slightly abstract but functional across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" appears three times as a descriptor for the bead (moonbeams, when wind sets bamboo whispering, across the threshold) but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. It functions as atmospheric labeling rather than a trait that alters tactics. Present in setup and closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears once ("she let the weaving recommence, not with shuttle or reed, but with breath, pulse, and the remembered rhythm of lullabies") and signals the shift from preparation to active sending. It marks a key turn in the ritual but is not causally indispensable; the sequence could proceed with minor rephrasing. Present in middle development and linked to closure, but swappable with near-synonyms (resume, begin again).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jigsaw puzzle edges are signaled early (bought years ago, learned to make a threshold), arranged in the middle beat (nesting edges, aligning notches), and shape the ending (the frame breathed out a footfall, the sister stood there). Their unique mechanics (outer bones, square ring one could speak through, soft knives parting hush) constrain the ritual's logic and enable the crossing. Setup, development, and closure are present; causal pressure is strong. Minor limitation: exact function remains slightly abstract, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest ground the piece early, recur with specificity (fruitless branches, bamboo whispering, moonbeams, well whose rope snapped), and supply the constraint that pressures the spinner's choice: "the orchard would die if she vanished." The final image—orchard dropping a pale leaf, then becoming "a ferment of warmth, bread, and bees"—charges the closure by signaling regeneration. Setup, development (spinner must preserve it), and closure participation are present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" bookends the piece (opening and near-closure: "she waited through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, night after night") and the passage of seasons is signaled ("at last, seasons later"). However, the timeframe functions more as atmospheric texture than a live constraint that alters tactics. Setup and closure reprise are present, but middle pressure is indirect; no ticking clock narrows decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation—to carry a message to the sister "vanished beyond mountains and years, who might still live if the right words arrived"—is dramatized early and drives all key choices: arranging edges, whispering the message, choosing to stay rather than cross, releasing the bead. Friction between want (reach the sister) and cost (orchard would die, latent sacrifice tugging) is visible and shapes the climactic choice. Setup, development, and closure participation are strong; causal pressure and cost are legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" is signaled early ("the air held a latent sacrifice, like a vow unspent but always ready to pay") and modulates under pressure: the spinner prepares to cross, feels herself thin, then stops and chooses a different toll (seasons of waiting). The tone charges the final image when the sacrifice is both paid (seasons, solitude) and rewarded (reunion). Setup and closure linkage are present; tone shifts purposefully with the reversal. However, the phrase itself appears only twice and functions more as thematic label than pervasive tonal control across all beats.</comment>
