<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinctive and embodied through concrete actions (withdrawing the needle, trembling hands that still hold the stitch). The journey from paralyzed accumulation to decisive simplification is earned through micro-choices at the ford. The coachman remains observant rather than fully developed, but his function as catalyst is clear. Minor deduction: the bride remains abstract, a destination rather than a presence that complicates choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist moves from layered palimpsest to a single thread ("stay, and labor beside"), crosses the ford, and walks toward town lighter—a decisive change with visible cost (all prior ornament abandoned). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: fog, waiting, percolation, and ambient awareness build pressure that breaks into simplification. Causality is clean; the coachman's needle-lift and the river's example motivate the protagonist's final stitch. One persistent constraint (the damp tightening threads) shapes tactics and the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ford, fog, rain gutters, and ferry chain create a coherent pressure-system that constrains the crossing and mirrors the protagonist's internal process. The yarn needle and embroidered linen function as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final repair of the coachman's map. Sensory detail is purposeful: "spindrift serenity," the chain groaning "like memory," beads condensing on iron. The far bank as "an answer, not a warning" reweights prior material without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—distilling a palimpsest promise into a weddable vow—is signaled early and tightens through ambient listening, the coachman's intervention, and the protagonist's single-line stitch. The tightening is meaningful: the protagonist arrives unable to unpick, listens, and stitches one line with visible cost (all prior layers abandoned). Agency is clear (the decision to wait, to stitch simply), and the final crossing forecloses ornament with felt relief. One strong deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—clarity through subtraction, the cost of revision, vows as boats—emerges organically from the palimpsest object, the river's single-channel choice, and the coachman's wisdom without didacticism. The final image (walking lighter, the palimpsest now a clear line) offers a resonant answer to the opening thicket. No thematic echo or moralizing; the story trusts image and action. Subtext operates in the coachman's breath-holding, the protagonist's fear of smallness, and the unspoken bride waiting in "arrow-straight streets and barbed comments."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and tightly controlled: "fog breathed," "shivering light," "percolate through the damp and iron." Diction remains within the narrator's reflective, slightly archaic register without drift. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. The coachman's brief dialogue feels natural and purposeful. Minor density concern: occasional stacked modifiers ("closely attentive," "spindrift serenity") approach decorative in mid-passage, though they charge the closure when reprised. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under peak pressure (the trembling stitch).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. "Fog breathed across the ford like old silk unspooling" and "rain stitched the eaves" work. However, mid-story density approaches overwriting: "ambient awareness," "percolate," "spindrift serenity," and "closely attentive" recur as motifs but occasionally slow momentum in the waiting sequence. No loops or template cadence. Final image is clean. Deduction for moderate figurative density in non-peak beats (−0.3 to −0.5 range) that does not obscure but slows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The palimpsest-as-wedding-shawl and the ferryman-as-therapist setup risks familiar ground, but the piece transforms through specificity: the yarn needle as harbor moon, the horse's tail wool for map repair, "a vow is a boat; too many names on the hull sink it." The risk—lyric compression, ambient method—succeeds without obscuring clarity. The final repair (mending the coachman's map with the same needle) is a fresh, symmetrical closure. No close echoes of famous lines; the synthesis feels earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gloom-hill coachman appears early, sets the brake to impose waiting, lifts the tightest stitch with the needle (a key enabling act), speaks the boat metaphor that reframes the protagonist's task, and ferries across. His choices (to wait, to intervene, to refuse coin) create multiple turns. He is causally active in at least three beats and shapes closure by asking the hypothetical question and grinning. Strong integration; only the modest renunciation (no coin, only map repair) keeps this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The yarn needle is introduced early ("bright as a small harbor moon"), handled in the failed unpicking attempt, borrowed by the coachman who lifts the stitch, returned for the protagonist's final stitch, and repurposed to mend the coachman's map with horse-tail wool. It appears in four distinct beats, enables two key actions (loosening, stitching), and charges the closure through the reciprocal repair. High irreplaceability; the needle's brightness and bluntness matter. Cost is visible (trembling hands, risk of failure).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The palimpsest promise is the story's engine: introduced in the opening beat, layered with "initials shimmered over vows, dates scumbled under revised intentions," drives the protagonist's paralysis, motivates the journey to the coachman, and resolves through the single-line stitch that rejects all prior layers. It shapes every choice, narrows options (cannot erase, cannot add more), and the cost (abandoning genealogies and apologies) is undeniable. The concept is irreplaceable; swapping for "conflicted letter" would collapse specificity and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" appears three times: the coachman notices boot-sinking, studies the linen "like a map," and is compared to tidepools "holding flashes without insistence." The trait enables the coachman's diagnostic perception (he sees the problem before the protagonist articulates it) and his careful intervention. It constrains his method (he lifts rather than pulls) and charges his final grin. Present in setup, middle beats, and thematic closure. Cost: his attention requires patience, delaying the crossing. Strong but not indispensable; "observant" could substitute with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Percolate" is used twice as metaphor for waiting's clarifying function: "let the minutes percolate through the damp and iron" and "let that certainty percolate." It frames the coachman's method and justifies the delay that enables the protagonist's shift. The action redefines waiting as active transformation (like tea settling). Present in middle and closure-adjacent beats; the river-listening and stitch follow the percolation. Strong thematic charge, though the action itself is passive. Swapping for "settle" or "steep" would weaken but not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is signaled early ("Everything he knew, he said, he learned through ambient awareness and long roads"), operationalized when the fog "carried lives" and "condensed them into beads on the chain," and internalized by the protagonist ("By listening to the river... Through ambient awareness, the words settled"). The method shapes both coachman's teaching and protagonist's breakthrough. It appears in three beats, drives the climax choice (listening yields the single thread), and charges closure. Specificity is high; "intuition" would flatten the sensory-accumulative mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is present in the opening line, anchors all action (the ford is swollen, ferry chain groans, gutters tick as timer), pressures the decision to wait, and the crossing itself is the story's hinge: "Halfway, he asked what I would do if the bride refused." The far bank as "an answer, not a warning" reweights all prior anxiety. The mist lifting reveals resolution. Geography constrains every beat; the story cannot occur elsewhere. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "until rain gutters stop ticking" is introduced early, tracked through "every drip keeping a measured time," and provides the closure cue: "When the gutters slowed their ticking, the coachman loosed the ferry." It tightens the wait into a live constraint and synchronizes external weather with internal clarity ("decisions clarified the way tea settles"). Present in three beats and participates in closure timing. Strong, though the timer is ambient rather than urgent; the protagonist never fears missing the window, so tactical pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to distill complexity into essence" is articulated early ("Because I wanted to distill complexity into essence, I replied"), enacted through the protagonist's struggle with the overgrown shawl, and fulfilled in the climax stitch ("stay, and labor beside. No adornments..."). It drives the inciting choice (seeking the coachman instead of priest/solicitor), shapes all reflection, and the cost (abandoning prior layers, risking the bride's refusal) is visible. The desire is conflicted (fear that simplicity is "too small") and tested on the page. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" appears in the opening ("the water kept its spindrift serenity despite the chill") and closing ("spindrift serenity following like a cloak as the fog unwove"), framing the tonal arc. The tone—calm yet charged, lyric stillness under pressure—modulates subtly: gutters ticking create measured time, the coachman's grin breaks solemnity briefly, and the final walk is lighter without flattening into relief. Coherent through turns, charges the final image by reprising the opening phrase with new weight (serenity now earned, not imposed). Strong lyric resonance; only modest mid-scene modulation keeps this below 8.0.</comment>
