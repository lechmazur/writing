<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains abstract—described through poetic labels ("narrow man of lucid silence") rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. His "infinitely patient" trait is asserted but never tested by an on-page cost or temptation that would reveal character limits. The narrator's interiority is thin; we observe the tuner's actions but rarely feel the narrator's own stakes or conflicted impulses driving choices. The boy's stamping moment offers a brief reversal, but the tuner's response is immediate correction without visible struggle, flattening what could have been a character-revealing beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: footsteps layer until the archway "drinks the pattern" and stones respond. Orientation is delayed—who the narrator is, why they arrived, and what specific question drove them remains vague past the opening third, costing ~−0.4. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator inherits the tuner's listening role), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no visible forfeiture or altered relationship. The final image reweights the opening hush, yet the narrator's agency remains observational throughout, weakening the sense of a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archway functions as micro-setting: it "drinks" the rhythm, its shadow thickens, and a mortar seam responds to cadence, directly shaping the story's central action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("smoke-dark hum," "cobblestones," "ebony tuning fork"), filtered through the narrator's wondering perspective. Spatial choreography is clear across the plaza walks. The archway charges the final image when the narrator stands beneath it, feeling prior steps "trembling in the stones," meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the town's shared balance via rhythm—is signaled early and accumulates through the walking ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's hard stamp cracks the stone and the tuner must guide him to "borrow gentleness," a micro-escalation that narrows tactics. However, the narrator's own agency is passive observation; the tuner drives all turns. No visible trade-off or loss alters later tactics—tools and participants appear as needed. The conceptual cost (the narrator's promise to "keep time") is felt but not paid on the page, limiting escalation clarity under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—balance as a chorus of feet, not a throne—emerges organically from the ritual and the tuner's whispered history. The final image ("balance is not a throne, but a chorus of feet") leans slightly toward direct statement but is grounded in prior action: the walking circles, the boy's mistake, the clock waking. The piece resists easy moralizing by embedding insight in the tuner's demonstration rather than assertion. Subtext operates in the tuner's silence, the townsfolk's hesitant emergence, and the archway's "listening" stones, creating resonance without spelling out meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; the narrator's perceptual signature favors poetic compression ("shadow that expects the moon," "alleys like dry riverbeds"). However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ordinary courage of returning home," "pattern of charged callbacks") that feels more essayistic than embodied perception. Distance control is consistent, though the narrator's interior remains underdeveloped—more witness than participant. The tuner's sparse dialogue ("names carry only one mouth, but rhythm carries a square") is voice-distinct but borders on aphorism. No head-hopping; compression is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and vivid ("wild hush," "smoke-dark hum," "black gull on tide"), but figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile, risking overwriting in a piece this compressed. Minor template cadence appears: "He told me... His name did not matter... We circled..." runs of similar stems. A paraphrase loop surfaces mid-story: "the archway drank the pattern" / "stones listen for the downbeat" restate the same premise across adjacent paragraphs without new pressure. No outright clarity breaks, but the accumulation of ornament slows momentum in non-peak beats, costing ~−0.6 in aggregate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—rebuilding a town through synchronized footsteps rather than hammers—offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on post-collapse recovery, transforming the ghost-town trope via embodied ritual. The tuner's method (tuning fork, cadence-listening, collective walking) is specific and memorable. Risk-taking is present: the piece commits to accumulative/textural mode without causal confrontation, trusting pattern and image to carry closure. However, the emotional arc remains familiar—stranger arrives, town heals through collective action—and the narrator's role as observer limits transformation depth. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, earning +0.3 for risk within the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cryptic bell tuner is present early, drives two beats (striking the fork, correcting the boy), and shapes the ending by departing and leaving the narrator to "keep time." However, his choices are largely instructive rather than conflicted; he demonstrates patience and precision without on-page cost or a visible trade-off that alters his own tactics. He enables the ritual but does not face a dilemma that tests his commitment, limiting causal depth.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears early, is handled in three beats (arch strike, air-loom adjustment, final pocket return), and its "smoke-dark hum" seeds the walking cadence. It returns with reweighted meaning when pocketed at dawn, marking the ritual's transfer to the narrator. However, its mechanics remain abstract—how the note "seeds itself in our cadence" is asserted, not demonstrated through specific sensory linkage or a visible cost when the fork is absent. Strong presence and reprise, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's spine: the stake is explicit ("revival waiting in its ribs"), the walking ritual directly enacts reconstruction (lintel lifts, market stalls fill), and the ending measures success via the restarted clock and the narrator's inheritance of the tuner's role. The concept shapes every tactic and the closure image ("we would rebuild it every dawn, together"). It is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic and final meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is signaled early and applied twice: the tuner waits for the narrator to approach and waits after the boy's mistake. However, the trait is label-only—no on-page moment tests his patience with a visible cost or temptation to rush. When the boy cracks the stone, the tuner "raised his hand and waited," but the waiting itself doesn't alter tactics or foreclose an option; the ritual simply resumes. Functional but replaceable with "calm" or "steady" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the story's anchor action: signaled in the opening third ("revival waiting"), enacted through the walking ritual (mortar loosens, lintel lifts, market stalls fill), and crystallized in the final promise ("rebuild it every dawn"). The method of rebuilding—via rhythm rather than hammers—defines the central conflict and closure. Removing this action would erase the story's causality and thematic spine. Essential across setup, development, and payoff with clear cost (collective discipline required).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—"via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones"—is signaled early ("the city would rebuild via the rhythm of footsteps"), demonstrated through the plaza-walking ritual (three beats: initial circling, boy's correction, dawn continuation), and directly produces the story's key turn (stones respond, clock restarts). The mechanics matter: "Left, pause, right, pause" and the tuner's adjustments via nod and fork constrain tactics. The method is indispensable; swapping it for another repair technique would break the story's causal and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient archway is present from the opening line, serves as the focal point for the tuning-fork strike (beat 1), "drinks the pattern" during the walking ritual (beat 2), and frames the ending where "our steps still trembled in the stones." It constrains the ritual's location and charges the closure image. Removing the archway would require replacing the story's spatial anchor and symbolic resonance chamber. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is referenced twice: the tuner whispers that bells "measured fairness, harvests, truce" before collapse, and later that he "tuned the city before the collapse." This backstory contextualizes the present ritual and sharpens the stake (restoration vs. original loss), but the timeframe itself doesn't tighten present tactics—no clock pressure or visible cost tied to elapsed time since collapse. The historical frame enriches theme but remains background rather than a live constraint on choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is stated early (the tuner "had come back to restore shared balance") and dramatized through the walking ritual: correcting the boy's hard stamp to prevent cracks, adjusting the group's cadence via the fork. The motivation shapes two beats and the ending promise ("keep time for the city"). However, the desire is more collective than conflicted—no on-page friction between the tuner's goal and a competing want or personal cost. The motivation is essential to the plot but not tested by internal contradiction, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is established in the opening line ("wild hush as if even dust remembered how to listen"), returns twice mid-story ("the silence... grew vivid, a wild hush"), and charges the penultimate beat ("In the wild hush that followed, I promised..."). The tone modulates with pressure: initial expectancy, deepening during the ritual's uncertain turns, resolving into charged stillness at closure. It coheres through all beats and reweights the final image, though the phrase risks ornament when repeated without fresh pressure. Strong integration and closure linkage.</comment>
