<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Keeper's interiority leans heavily on abstract, lyric assertion ("I am the tender shadow keeper") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The figure's suffocation is described but never enacted through concrete micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; the scar at the neck remains a static symbol. The teaching sequence offers embodied breath-work detail, yet the visitor's transformation lacks causally earned resistance or visible cost—trembling at "staying" is told, not shown through a choice that forecloses a path. Motivation reads coherent but remains at a declarative distance, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of linked images (ash, starlight, doorknocker, breath) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the visitor's departure "without a door" and the Keeper's solitary vigil. Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is established only through self-declaration ("Call me Keeper"), and the sanctuary's nature remains abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering a −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure image—ash accepting fewer footprints, silence becoming generous—reweights the dominant stake (teaching breath to the suffocating) with a felt cost (the Keeper remains alone, the loaded emptiness now "carries a pulse"). However, the cost is conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or renunciation makes the price unmistakable in a single pointed sentence. The lens holds, but the closure unit lacks the sharp edge required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (ash, starlight as "fine salt," doorknocker "shaped like a throat clasped by a star"), yet it functions primarily as backdrop. The missing door and the floor that "keeps footprints like notes" offer micro-setting texture, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics during the breath-teaching sequence. The doorknocker chimes once, producing a metaphorical effect (sound sinking "into the floor") without changing the visitor's options or the Keeper's approach. Spatial choreography is clear, tone is consistent, but the environment does not pressure the central conflict, capping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the visitor to breathe—is signaled early and pursued through the breath-counting ritual. Pressure accumulates through the visitor's trembling and the Keeper's pedagogical patience, but no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs: the visitor simply succeeds after repetition. The transition from "tremor shook loose a sound" to "hand fell from the hinge scar" reads as smooth progress rather than a choice that narrows options or trades one cost for another. The Keeper's backstory ("I stopped answering the living who wanted me to drown") provides thematic weight but does not constrain present tactics. One deepening moment—inviting air rather than pulling it in—shifts the teaching method, earning mid-band placement, yet the cost remains implied rather than viscerally on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the breath-teaching ritual and the Keeper's ethos of "burning bridges carefully" to mark safe embers. The piece resists moralizing and sustains ambiguity: the Keeper's solitude is both cost and calling, and the visitor's departure is neither triumph nor collapse. The doorknocker as "a circle promised not to close too hard" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to survive after severance) without stating a thesis. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Some bridges will burn when dawn touches them, and I will mark the safe embers with stars") that tells more than it shows. The balance of embodied image and reflective assertion keeps the score in the solid 7-band, just shy of higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, deploying lyric compression and metaphor throughout ("shame suffocates, slow, polite, and relentless"). POV remains stable in first person, and the Keeper's perceptual signature—prioritizing breath, scars, and spatial thresholds—reads character-specific. However, elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats without clear narrative justification: "encroach," "hinge," "cadence of surf that has forgotten the sea" cluster densely in the teaching sequence, drifting into a uniform lyric register that obscures immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Show me how to breathe") but lacks subtext or goal-driven friction. Free indirect thought is clean, yet the prose never modulates rhythm under peak stress, maintaining a single stately tempo that flattens pressure differentiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("loaded emptiness," "listening was another kind of breathing," "suffocating the way shame suffocates"), creating a persistent lyric density that slows momentum and obscures cause-effect linkage at key beats. The teaching sequence—"In for four, stay for four, out for six"—offers concrete instruction, yet surrounding lines loop metaphorically ("trembled at the staying, because staying felt like drowning disguised as patience") without advancing the action. Template cadence appears in the opening third: "I am the tender shadow keeper… I am one who burns bridges…" Stack of declarative "I am" stems signals scaffold. Paraphrase loops recur: "suffocating to breathe" appears twice within three paragraphs. Deductions: −0.6 for figurative density across high-pressure beats, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop = −1.2 total in Q7, placing the score in the upper 5-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—a sanctuary keeper teaching breath-work to the suffocating after severance—synthesizes grief counseling and liminal space metaphor in a fresh frame. The missing door and doorknocker as ritual tool offer specific, non-obvious angles. However, the emotional arc (visitor arrives trembling, learns to breathe, departs steadied) follows a familiar recovery template without a turn that redefines cost or complicates the Keeper's pedagogy. The "burns bridges carefully" ethos and the scar-linking gesture provide character-specific inflection, yet the teaching sequence itself—count breaths, repeat, succeed—lacks the friction or failed attempt that would elevate originality. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, but the moves within that mode remain predictable, landing in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tender shadow keeper (Keeper) makes several on-page choices: gesturing toward the ring, instructing breath-work, pressing the doorknocker into the visitor's palm. These actions frame and guide the teaching sequence, shaping two distinct beats (invitation and instruction). However, none of these choices narrows the Keeper's own options or imposes a visible cost; the Keeper's stance remains stable throughout. The character is present across all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) and essential to the teaching role, but the Keeper's decisions do not create reversals or alter their own trajectory, capping the score in the mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in three beats: description at the threshold, the visitor's knock that makes sound "sink down into the floor," and the final transfer into the visitor's palm as a gift. Early signal (+0.6), three-beat involvement (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), charged reprise as "a circle promised not to close too hard" (+0.5). The object constrains the visitor's choice to "make sound and invite air," shaping the closure image. However, the ring's unique properties (iron, throat-and-star shape) remain ornamental; a generic bell or charm could serve the same function with minor edits, triggering swappability friction (−0.8). The doorknocker is essential to the teaching ritual's symbolism but not mechanically irreplaceable, placing the score in the upper 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fading threshold is named in the opening and explicitly described ("the threshold between in and out had become a fading threshold, dim as old charcoal"). It shapes the Keeper's pedagogy: the visitor is "crossing a fading threshold, not back to what was, but toward a room that moves with you." The concept constrains the teaching approach (inviting breath rather than forcing recovery) and charges the closure image (the visitor leaves "without a door, stepping past where walls once insisted"). Early signal (+0.7), middle pressure (the visitor's struggle at the threshold between suffocation and breath, +0.9), closure linkage (the final image of crossing without structure, +1.5), causal pressure (the fading threshold defines the stakes and the Keeper's method, +1.3). The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and resonance, placing the score in the solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Burns bridges carefully is asserted in the opening ("I am one who burns bridges carefully, not from spite, but to make sure flames point forward") and recalled in the middle ("I left, burned that bridge, then posted lanterns"). The trait informs the Keeper's backstory and ethos, yet it does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost in the present scene. The teaching sequence proceeds through breath-work instruction, not bridge-burning; the attribute remains thematic rather than tactical. Setup gate met (+0.5), ornamental middle use (−0.7), absent from closure action (−0.6). The trait is present and logically consistent but functionally replaceable, capping the score in the low-4 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Encroach appears once: "I heard footsteps encroach, soft at first, then insisting as if they needed to be believed." This action initiates the visitor's arrival and sets up the teaching sequence, marking the inciting beat. However, the encroachment itself is not returned to or reweighted; the visitor's later departure is described as stepping "past where walls once insisted," which echoes threshold-crossing but does not reprise the encroach action specifically. Setup gate met (+0.6), one-beat involvement (+0.4), no closure reprise (−0.8), swappability (approach, arrive, or enter could substitute with minimal edit, −0.6). The action is functional but not essential to the story's final image, placing the score in the mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Linking through scars is signaled in the teaching beat: "I touched my chest and then theirs, linking through scars the way teachers link through chalk." The method provides a concrete, embodied mechanism for the breath-work instruction and is reinforced by the Keeper's reflection ("My ribs had their own map of old fires"). The visitor's scar at the neck is noted early, priming the linkage. Setup (visitor's scar mentioned, +0.5), middle development (the linking touch constrains the teaching method, +0.9), closure absence (the doorknocker, not the scars, appears in the final image, −0.8). The method is specific and mechanically present but not charged or reweighted at the ending, capping the score in the low-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight is established in the opening line and sustained throughout. Ash "understood footsteps and starlight," the walls "seemed to lean in," and the floor "kept our footprints like notes written to night." The setting provides texture and tone, yet it does not constrain a tactical choice: the breath-work could occur in any quiet, removed space. Starlight "counted" the breath-work beats (mild personification) but does not alter the Keeper's method or the visitor's success. Early signal (+0.7), pervasive presence across beats (+0.9), closure image (ash accepting fewer footprints, +0.8), ornamental constraint (−0.6). The setting charges atmosphere and the final image but does not pressure the central choice, placing the score in the upper 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After cutting off all contact appears in the opening line, framing the Keeper's return and informing their ethos. However, the timeframe does not tighten present decisions or create urgency: the teaching sequence proceeds at a contemplative pace, and no clock or deadline pressures the Keeper or visitor. The timeframe is thematic context rather than a tactical constraint. Setup gate met (+0.4), no middle or closure pressure (−0.9), swappability (after loss, after departure could substitute, −0.5). The element is present and logically consistent but does not shape the story's escalation, capping the score in the low-4 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To teach suffocating to breathe is the Keeper's explicit motivation, stated directly ("I had returned for this, to teach suffocating to breathe without giving back the knives it craved") and enacted through the breath-counting ritual. The desire drives the central sequence: the Keeper invites the visitor in, instructs the breathing pattern, and repeats until success. The motivation is tested when the visitor trembles at "staying," forcing the Keeper to persist and adjust pacing. Early signal (+0.7), middle friction (the visitor's resistance tests the Keeper's patience, +1.0), closure linkage (the Keeper's final vigil reflects ongoing commitment, +1.2), causal pressure (the motivation constrains method and defines success, +1.4), visible cost (the Keeper remains alone, "counting breaths like held lanterns," +0.4). The motivation is indispensable to the story's logic and arc, placing the score in the solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Loaded emptiness is named in the opening ("The night carried a loaded emptiness") and sustained through paradoxical images: "a hush heavy as a lung that had forgotten its own rhythm," "the listening was another kind of breathing," "the loaded emptiness stayed, but now it carried a pulse I did not have to supply alone." The tone modulates subtly from solitary weight to shared burden, charging the closure image. Early signal (+0.8), coherent presence across beats (+1.0), closure reprise with reweighted meaning (emptiness now carries a pulse, +1.5), causal pressure (the tone shapes the Keeper's pedagogy and the visitor's experience, +1.0), small swappability friction (heavy silence could substitute in some beats, −0.3). The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional arc and final resonance, placing the score in the upper 7-band.</comment>
