<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied through the repair work, with concrete sensory anchors (the leaf recording, governor floating loose). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between holding and listening, and Lina's departure provides emotional weight that complicates the present task. The final choice to send frames "to Lina if she was watching" earns its renunciation with visible cost, though some reflection edges toward abstraction ("forgiveness I could not name").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts that "leaving and staying can be one motion," a stance crystallization with felt cost (longing persists, but the repair allows continuation). The accumulative/textural lens holds—pressure builds through layered images (spinning hand, thermal tides, Lina's departure) and resolves via the cameras capturing ephemeral movement. One meaningful tightening occurs when the governor seats and the hand settles. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, timing dome, Earth below) arrive within the first third and remain stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting constrains choices throughout: quakes threaten the shutters, dust reaches escape velocity, and the viewport frames Earth as "a candle drowned in its own glass." The leaf recording functions as micro-setting, a gravity relic that guides the repair sequence and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (bolts ping like hail, dome hums like a shell), though some phrases lean ornamental without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the comet's shadow before thermal tides wreck the shutters—is signaled early and tightens once when the governor seats and exposures are set "by the sound of a leaf falling." Agency appears in the protagonist's decision to "let her thought restructure me" and in the hands-on repair that forecloses further malfunction. The reversal (hand spinning → hand settled) is modest but earned; cost is legible in the acceptance that "there is no cure for longing, only art."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the paradox that "holding needs more listening than grip" recurs in the repair, Lina's departure, and the cameras' "silver sips." The final image—"we reached a kind of escape velocity from fear"—reweights prior material (escape velocity, leaf sound, luminous ache) without stating a moral. The concept integrates organically; no thematic echo or label-speak touches the closure. Subtext operates in gesture (tapping the frame, pressing play) and the unspoken question of whether Lina is watching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices machines "like stories" and filters the observatory through metaphors of breath, gravity, and afternoons. Diction remains character-specific ("sage not for years, but because I listen") and modulates under pressure without register drift. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Some figurative language in peak beats (comet's shadow "comb[ing] the exosphere") leans decorative, but voice remains internally coherent and the compression serves the lyric mode taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines layer action, image, and thematic charge (e.g., "the hand dials through centuries in a minute, smearing any hope of capture"). Rhythm varies naturally, though a few adjacent sentences repeat structure ("I set exposures… and the cameras took…" / "Some grains surrendered… and some reached…"). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Minor figurative muddle: "luminous ache" recurs but remains legible. Zero scaffold; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of repair-as-metaphor and lunar setting with the leaf recording as calibration tool feels specific and non-obvious. The piece risks lyric compression and commits fully to its accumulative design; the final image (escape velocity from fear via captured plumes) grows inevitably from prior material. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact observatory, this recording, this protagonist's listening method. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sage camera repairer drives all major turns: opens the casing, seats the governor, sets exposures, sends frames. Appears in first paragraph, shapes middle repair beats, and delivers the closure action (sending frames to Lina). Choices are active and specific; removing this character would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clock hand that won't stop spinning appears in paragraph two, wrecks shutters (causal pressure), is diagnosed mid-story (governor floating loose), and settles in the climax beat ("the hand slowed, then settled, then clicked forward"). Three distinct beats; directly enables closure (cameras can capture the comet). Irreplaceable: the spinning hand is the obstacle that the protagonist must solve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Escape velocity shapes stakes (dust leaping toward escape, Lina leaving Earth) and the final conceptual repricing ("we reached a kind of escape velocity from fear"). Present in first third, reappears in the comet beat, and charges the ending. Functions beyond metaphor: the cameras must "blink faster than longing" to capture particles at threshold speed. Not fully causal in middle beats but indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" appears in paragraph four as the ideal the clock was supposed to anchor, returns obliquely in the governor's refusal to "bow to anything but its private drift," and is repriced at closure: "What proves changelessly constant is not the tick… but the urge to name the brief." Lyric reprise that reweights the stake. Not causal in middle action but essential to thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Restructure" drives the protagonist's approach: "restructure the timing bay" (paragraph eight), "let her thought restructure me" (paragraph seventeen). The action is the repair itself—rethreading fiber, swapping boards, seating the governor—which occupies three beats and enables all closure outcomes. Irreplaceable: the story is the act of restructuring; no synonym fits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method "by the sound of a leaf falling" is introduced in paragraph five, used to seat the governor (paragraph fourteen: "I set the leaf on loop and counted microseconds"), and returns in the final repair (paragraph twenty: "I set exposures by the sound of a leaf falling"). Three beats; mechanics matter (timing the fall calibrates the timing bay). Specific and irreplaceable; removing it would require a new calibration logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory above the clouds appears in the opening line, pressures choices throughout (quakes shake rails, dust leaps in low gravity, Earth is visible below), and supplies the viewport frame for the closure image. Micro-setting (timing dome, bolts, gyros) alters tactics. Not merely postcard description; the environment actively constrains and enables the repair.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"When foundations shake" is the timeframe trigger: the moon quakes when thermal tides brew, threatening the comet capture window. Introduced in paragraph three, tightens in paragraph twelve ("Thermal tides were brewing"), and resolves in paragraph nineteen ("The quake came thin as thread"). The clock matters: the protagonist must finish before the next quake. Live urgency that shapes pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to harness the ephemeral" appears in paragraph two and recurs in paragraph fifteen: "We built this place to harness the ephemeral, but the lesson keeps reversing." Conflict is dramatized: the protagonist must capture fleeting comet dust, balance holding with listening, and accept that "leaving and staying can be one motion." Desire drives all repair choices and charges the closure act (sending frames).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears in the opening paragraph (learned the trade "in a quiet that tastes like luminous ache"), returns with Lina's laughter (paragraph ten), and closes the story ("in that luminous ache we reached a kind of escape velocity from fear"). Tone is consistent—wistful, precise, charged—and modulates under pressure without flattening. The phrase charges the final image and is indispensable to closure resonance.</comment>
