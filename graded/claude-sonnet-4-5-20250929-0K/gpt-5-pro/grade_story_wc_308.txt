<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior world is richly textured through embodied metaphor ("letting their decays and overlaps sketch out distances") and the physicality of listening. The grandmother's presence provides specific emotional grounding. However, the piece relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—the narrator's resolve remains largely static, with no visible struggle between competing wants. The final choice to "seat myself again" feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. The piece accumulates through layered sensory observation and the wandering pulse's gradual approach, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where stillness becomes navigation. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (canyon, harmonic stone skimmer, arrowhead). The closure lands as Charged Poise—"this map is never finished"—with the cost legible in the commitment to endless iteration. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pulse "tests me with a stutter" and the narrator holds steady, reweighting the relationship from pursuit to guidance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The canyon's bone towers and acoustic properties constrain every choice—the narrator cannot move, must read echoes, must use the arrowhead as tuning wedge. The gulls function as living instruments that annotate resonance, and their movements directly shape the narrator's appraisal. The micro-setting of the arrowhead warming in the palm charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract stakes, and the environment evolves causally as the pulse moves through the "hollow seam."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled immediately and remains coherent throughout. The piece offers one meaningful tightening when the pulse "sidles into my tone until our two waves beat like mismatched hearts," forcing the narrator to "shave the note, thinner, colder." The cost is legible in the commitment to motionless waiting and the rejection of the "old urge to chase." However, the escalation is more textural than action-driven; the wandering pulse's resistance feels more atmospheric than a genuine threat that narrows options with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: stillness as mastery, forgetting as a navigable barrier, mapping as endless practice. The arrowhead's warming and the canyon's "brief gratitude owed between patient craftsmen" avoid stated morals while offering a resonant answer to the central question. The traders' "fear folding the map into a cruel accordion" and the narrator's "tally of forgiveness" ground abstraction in specific image. The ending resists closure while reweighting all prior material—"dust keeps writing, and the birds keep reading"—without thematic echo or sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"Every note returns bearing grit, a date written as abrasion." The diction remains consistently elevated and character-particular throughout, blending technical vocabulary ("harmonic stone skimmer," "tuning wedge") with lyric compression. No head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("letting my stillness become a door the canyon can graciously swing") that risks losing narrative immediacy under pressure, and some metaphors feel more crafted than organically perceived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose carries high information density and purposeful rhythm, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("I speak to it softly, historically reverent, promising no theft, only guidance"). However, figurative density approaches overwriting in several beats—nearly every sentence layers metaphor without respite, creating cumulative drag. Paraphrase loops appear: "The canyon has served as ledger and liturgy" followed immediately by similar accounting metaphors. Template cadence emerges in repeated "I [verb]" openings across the final third. These artifacts dull momentum without breaking causality, meriting penalty here per the routing rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic navigation, motionless travel, and historical accounting through sound creates a specific, non-obvious premise. The wandering pulse as both guide and prisoner, the traders' barricade of forgetting, and the grandmother's patient humming offer fresh inflections on familiar material. The piece commits fully to its lyric-situational mode without retreat. However, the core framing—learning through stillness, ancestral wisdom, landscape as living archive—draws from well-worn templates; the story elevates through execution and voice rather than transforming the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer's choices drive two key turns: the decision to begin the audit with a low drone, and the choice to hold pitch steady when the pulse tests with a stutter. Present from the opening and shapes the final seated return. However, many beats are observational—listening, taking readings, remembering—rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in at least four distinct beats: clutching it while listening, using it to tap bone and set ripples, angling it to "shave the note," and feeling it warm at closure. Setup, development (enables the tonal work), and payoff (warmth signals success) are all present. The arrowhead's specific property as "tuning wedge" with "tip chipped by questions" constrains method. Strong integration, though the warming at closure is more lyric echo than causal driver of the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wandering pulse shapes every beat: the narrator comes to find it, listens for it, coaxes it, reads its tug north, negotiates its barricade, and finally loops it back as guide. It is the central problem and the solution's mechanism. Setup in paragraph 5, continuous development through the middle (the pulse "tests me with a stutter"), and decisive payoff when it "loops back as guide and not prisoner." The concept is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is mentioned twice but constrains only one visible choice: the promise to the pulse ("I speak to it softly, historically reverent, promising no theft"). The trait colors the narrator's relationship to the grandmother and the canyon's records but does not create an on-page tradeoff or visible cost. Present and thematically consistent, but more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Appraise" frames the entire endeavor from paragraph 6 onward: appraising whether the rhythm still searches, appraising the cause of the boundary, conducting an audit, offering a tally of forgiveness, and vowing to "appraise until night." The action is irreplaceable—substituting "listen" or "navigate" would require structural rewrites. Setup, continuous middle development (the boundary appraisal, the barricade's cause), and payoff (the seated return to ongoing appraisal) are all present. The accounting/audit metaphor depends entirely on this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gulls are introduced early (paragraph 9) and used across multiple beats: their turns annotate resonance, their knot signals the pulse's tug north, their braid marks the boundary the pulse will not cross, and their unknotting and pouring guide the pulse into the seam. Setup, development (reading their flare and braid), and payoff (they "settle in pale commas" at closure) are present. The method is specific but could be replaced with another environmental signaling device—echoes alone, wind patterns—without full collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The towers of bone constrain every action: the narrator taps them to set ripples, they keep count of historical events, they record the tally of forgiveness "without interest," and they serve as "kindly accountants" at closure. The canyon's acoustic properties are the story's engine—without the echoes, the entire method collapses. Setup in the opening line, continuous development (the bone as ledger, the hollow seam as remembered river), and decisive payoff (the canyon breathing and closing "on its own spine"). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" establishes deep time in paragraph 12 and recurs in the final line ("dust keeps writing"). The timeframe colors the narrator's reverence and the traders' long-ago bargain, but it does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock. The piece operates in a single extended moment; the centuries are backdrop, not pressure. Lyric reprise at closure reweights meaning slightly but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 3 and dramatized throughout: the narrator resists the urge to chase, lets the world do the walking, and finally honors "the lesson of stillness" by seating again. The friction between the desire to navigate and the discipline to remain motionless drives the middle choices (holding pitch steady, not chasing the pulse). Setup, development (the pulse's test and the narrator's stillness), and payoff (the final seated bow and return) are all present. Cost is legible in the renunciation of active pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is named once but sustained across the entire arc: the narrator listens "with weathered resolve," endures the pulse's tests without flinching, and commits to appraise "until night spines the world with chill." The tone modulates subtly—quiet patience at the start, cautious negotiation in the middle ("It tests me with a stutter"), and earned satisfaction at closure—without breaking coherence. The final image of seated waiting charges the tone with purpose. Not indispensable, but purposeful and consistent.</comment>
