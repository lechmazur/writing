<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. The mentor's aphorism and the dictionary consultations gesture toward characterization but never constrain a live decision with felt consequence. The final declaration "We unify by agreeing to be seen through one another" reads as thesis rather than earned shift, and no prior action forecloses a path or imposes visible price. The character witnesses and narrates but does not struggle between competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "who" and "where" anchor by the opening lines; "when" (across a universe's hiccup) is signaled early; waive penalty. Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (spiral pacing, layered image-work, pattern of refinement). Closure attempt: the protagonist places the book on the dais, invites the chorus to lean over it, and speaks a unifying sentence; the library "listens back" and the illusion folds into the definition. This reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spiral arbitration completes and the definitions expand to include what refused them), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no choice is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered on the page. The final image offers thematic repricing without a legible price paid, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The temple library is vividly rendered through selective detail (velvet hush, spiral aisles, ribs-curved shelves, window showing no outside) and the spatial choreography of the three circles is legible. The dais and the book function as micro-setting that structures the protagonist's movement and frames the arbitration. However, the environment does not constrain a live choice or supply a contested resource; it stages the ritual but does not pressure it. The setting charges the final image but does not alter tactics, holding the score below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: unravel cosmic illusions before they harden as law. The spiral arbitration provides a frame for escalation, and the three-circle structure offers a visible progression. However, each circle deepens understanding without narrowing options or imposing cost; the protagonist's whispered words ("this, now, we") and the placement of the dictionary are symbolic gestures rather than choices that foreclose alternatives. The "chorus of revisions" complicates perception but does not force a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient, yet here the intensification reads as thematic accretion without a felt price, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (witnessing, unification through mutual seeing, play versus illusion) emerges from image and action rather than direct statement, and the dictionary's etymology of "ludere" offers a non-obvious lens. The final sentence "We unify by agreeing to be seen through one another" attempts a resonant answer but leans into abstraction rather than arising from concrete particulars with cost. The ludere insight and the water-as-lens image are strong, yet the ending articulates rather than enacts the theme, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>First-person singular POV is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature ("wanderingly exact," "I stopped counting and offered my attention like a bowl") is consistent and lyric. Diction ("resounding hush," "ant trail of letters," "thin dew of meaning") is controlled and purposeful, with syntactic variety supporting rhythm. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("balances settled not by vote but by trajectory," "History eased around the dais") that feels more philosophical than embodied in the narrator's present urgency, and the lack of on-page dialogue limits voice testing. Distance and tense remain clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally high, with vivid images ("dust into small constellations," "breath on paper," "wind over stone") and purposeful syntax. However, paraphrase loops appear: "resounding hush" recurs five times without functional shift, and the phrase "journeying inward while walking out" is repeated verbatim across beats. Template cadence emerges in the three-circle structure with parallel phrasing ("I walked the first circle," "I paced the second circle," "The third circle asked"). These patterns are taught early and serve the accumulative design, so the penalty remains modest, but the loops dull momentum in the final third. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase/template issues in Q7; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but pervade the final moves, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The spiral-arbitration frame and the dictionary-as-tool offer a fresh synthesis, and the ludere insight transforms the illusion motif. The recursive phrasing ("journeying inward while walking out") and the three-circle structure create a coherent lyric architecture. However, the core premise (lone witness in mystic library performs ritual to unify cosmic fragments) closely matches the template of solitary-mage-solves-abstract-problem, and the emotional and causal particulars do not fully transform it into lived stakes. The transformation test suggests the arc could transpose to other mystic settings with minor edits, capping originality in the mid-6s despite polished execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character "end of history witness" is named in the opening and the protagonist's sworn task frames the journey. Setup present. The character observes, walks circles, consults the dictionary, and speaks the unifying sentence—four distinct beats. However, the witness role is more thematic stance than decision point; the protagonist does not face a live choice where witnessing versus intervening creates cost. Development weak (observation without trade-off). Closure participation present (the witness declares and the arbitration completes). Two gates met; beat involvement adds +0.9; but lack of causal pressure and swappability (could be "arbiter," "mediator") lower the score. Late penalties do not apply. Band 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Object "softcover dictionary" appears in beat one (carried under arm), beat mid-story (opened to "illusion," then to "play"), and beat three (placed on dais, invites chorus to lean over page). Setup, development, closure all present; three gates met. Three distinct beats add +1.4; specificity (dictionary's etymologies matter) adds +0.5; closure linkage (placed on dais, definitions expand) adds +0.7. However, the dictionary enables discovery but does not constrain a choice with cost—it is consulted, not risked or spent. Swappability moderate (could be "grimoire" or "codex" with minor edits). Band 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Core concept "spiral arbitration" is named and explained early ("a place where movement itself decided meaning," "walk, chamber turns, balances settle by trajectory"). Setup strong. The three-circle walk enacts the arbitration across multiple beats, and the dais hums and slows as the protagonist completes the ritual. Development and closure both present; three gates met. Beat involvement (three circles) adds +1.4; causal pressure (the walking structure determines the outcome) adds +0.8; closure linkage (arbitration completes, illusion folds) adds +0.9. Specificity high (the spiral mechanics are unique). Total band 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Attribute "wanderingly exact" is quoted from the mentor early and the narrator self-describes: "my path loops but my aim does not." Setup present. The looping three-circle walk enacts the trait visibly. However, the trait is never tested as a constraint or tradeoff—no moment where wandering endangers precision or vice versa. Development weak (label-only). Closure participation absent (the trait does not charge the final image). One gate met; cap 4.6. Label-only deduction −0.3; swappability (could be "iterative" or "recursive") −0.3. Band 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Action "unify" is the protagonist's sworn task and the story's engine. Setup present (task stated in paragraph two). The protagonist's moves—walking circles, reading etymologies, placing the book, speaking the unifying sentence—trace directly to this action. Development and closure both present; three gates met. Beat involvement (three circles plus final declaration) adds +1.4; causal pressure (the entire arbitration serves this goal) adds +1.0; closure linkage (the unifying sentence lands and the illusion folds) adds +1.0. However, swappability is moderate (could be "harmonize" or "integrate") −0.5. Band 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Method "journeying inward while walking out" is quoted from the mentor and repeated verbatim three times. Setup present. The three-circle walk enacts the method on the page. Development present (the method shapes each circle's progression). Closure participation weak (the phrase recurs but does not charge the final image with new cost). Two gates met; lyric reprise qualifies. Beat involvement +0.9; early signal +0.5; specificity +0.5. However, the method is more thematic label than tactical constraint; no moment where this particular means imposes a cost that another approach would not. Swappability moderate (could be "spiraling" or "circling"). Band 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting "ancient temple library lost in time" is anchored in the opening sentence and sustained throughout. Setup present. The library's spiral aisles, dais, shelves, and window structure the three-circle walk and provide the spatial frame for arbitration. Development present (the architecture guides movement). Closure present (library "listens back," door opens outward). Three gates met. Beat involvement (every circle) adds +1.4; spatial constraint (the spiral determines the path) adds +0.8; closure linkage (library's response completes the ritual) adds +0.9. Specificity high (the "lost in time" and "spiral aisles" details are load-bearing). Band 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "across a universe's hiccup" is named early ("Time had been unsettled") and recurs once mid-story ("Across a universe's hiccup, the entire stage waited"). Setup present. However, the hiccup functions as backstory rather than live clock; no ticking pressure, no deadline that alters tactics. Development absent (time does not narrow options). Closure absent (the hiccup is not resolved or reweighted on the page). One gate met; cap 4.6. Ornamental use −0.7; swappability (could be "temporal fold" or "cosmic pause") −0.4. Band 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to unravel cosmic illusions" is stated as the task in paragraph two and drives the protagonist's journey. Setup present. The dictionary consultation (illusion → play) and the three-circle walk enact the unraveling. Development present (each circle advances the task). Closure present (illusion folds into the definition). Three gates met. Beat involvement +1.4; causal pressure +0.8; closure linkage +0.8. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing want, no cost that tests commitment. The protagonist proceeds without friction, making the motivation functional but not charged. Band 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tone "resounding hush" is named in the opening line, repeated four more times, and sustained through imagery (velvet against ears, dust constellations, breath on paper, wind over stone). Setup present. The tone modulates subtly (hush → chorus → single voice → wind) as pressure accumulates. Development present (tone shifts with each circle). Closure present (the final "resounding hush" recurs as the library listens). Three gates met. Beat involvement +1.4; closure linkage +1.0; coherence through turns +0.6. However, the recurrence is more label than charged reweighting; the final "resounding hush" does not redefine cost. Swappability moderate (could be "sacred silence" or "profound quiet"). Band 6.5.</comment>
