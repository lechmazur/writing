<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser's motivations are clear and rooted in a history of deception and return, with contradictory impulses visible in the confession to the Auditor and the choice to continue teaching luck through marbles. Embodied detail is strong—bent shoulders, patient cane, polishing marbles by breath—but the characterization leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than live micro-choices under pressure. The final stance crystallization (garden knowing him, breathing together) is earned by prior setup but the protagonist's agency is largely attentional and ritualistic rather than decision-driven with visible alternatives foreclosed. No therapy-speak or label-only traits; the change reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost in humility and labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of ritualized attention (marble placement, ceremonial gratitude) that reweights the dominant stake (garden recognition) through density increase and cadence shift. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (garden maze, withered vine dresser, measurable luck). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the doorway, the burning marble, and the garden exhaling together crystallizes the proof of mutual recognition with felt cost (humility, labor, years). One tightening occurs when the Auditor's meters confirm new roots around the markers, validating the "mended deception" and narrowing interpretive options. Cost is legible in the line "I do not smile, because I have learned humility when plants choose their company" and the physical labor of polishing and placement across seasons. No causality breaks; the reflective mode (~40% of text) anchors concretely in present marbles, vines, and the Auditor's visit, meeting BRR expanded allowance without flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden maze constrains choices throughout: marble placement at joints, vine angles, humidity measurement, the doorway that fits the narrator's stoop. Setting detail is filtered through the POV's occupational bias (sensors, meters, trellis posts, clover). Spatial choreography is coherent (center court, hedges leaning, doorway arching) and the maze functions as both physical constraint and proof of recognition. Sensory specificity is strong (moonlight polish, sunlight pooling, meter hum) and the final image of roots gripping earth like old hands charges closure. Meets the 9+ gate: the maze's physical structure and the marble-placement mechanics directly shape the Auditor's loss in the hedges and the protagonist's proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know their gardeners) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Auditor measures humidity and confirms new roots, validating the marble method and narrowing options from fraud to functional technique. Agency is present in marble placement, polishing, and ceremonial practice, but the escalation is attentional and accumulative rather than a sharp reversal with visible alternatives foreclosed. The Auditor's arrival and his loss in the maze provide external pressure, but his departure and the final image do not trade off a live option or enact a decisive loss beyond the already-paid cost of labor. Cost is felt (years of patience, humility) but not newly forfeited at closure; the story rests in Charged Poise rather than a turn with visible price paid in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (elaborate attention teaching recognition; mended deception as graft that holds) emerges organically from marble placement, ceremonial gratitude, and the confession to the Auditor. No thesis statements; the final image of the garden exhaling together offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the hedge's lean, the doorway's selective architecture, and the burning marble as rumor-that-is-finally-true. The contrast between measurable luck (bar code) and lived devotion (patience, ritual) charges the piece without false equivalence. One instance of near-thematic echo: "elaborate gratitude trains the body to recognize when the hedge breathes back" and the final "counting together" feel close but are separated by sufficient dramatization and image work to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: the syntax mirrors deliberate, patient thought ("I polish them by moonlight and by morning light"), and diction remains within the vine dresser's idiom (twine, trellis, sap). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The reflective register is consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("blooming withering") legible at closure. One dialogue exchange with the Auditor carries subtext (aligned to oldest scars vs. latest indices) and advances the proof without filter-verb stacking. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. Minor drift: "commemorating small victories elaborately" and "refuses to shrink" edge toward elevated diction but remain character-plausible given the narrator's self-aware pedagogical stance. No template cadence or convergence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at closure, longer syntactic weaving in reflection). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One minor scaffold pattern: repeated "I + verb" stems across the opening third (seven instances in close succession) create slight cadence monotony but do not obscure causality. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("light shaped by hands is labor," "marbles into tiny constellations") though "blooming withering" as a closing verb phrase is compressed to near-opacity without prior teaching. Clarity remains high; no filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats. Paragraph structure varies. The final line ("The garden knows me, and I know it") is clean and charges prior material without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of measurable luck, ritualized attention, and horticultural graft as proof of recognition feels fresh and specific. The marbles-as-teaching-tools and the doorway-that-fits-the-gardener are memorable particulars. The emotional arc (humility learned through plant choice) avoids generic templates. The Auditor's role as validator rather than antagonist subverts expectation without gimmickry. One proximity concern: the "breadcrumbs that know how to wait" and "light spreads like a rumor" echo fairy-tale and poetic conventions but are transformed through the technical detail of sensor tallies and humidity meters. The core concept (mended deception) is integrated rather than convenient. Risk-taking in the elliptical, accumulative structure and the deliberate withholding of a sharp confrontation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise; the combination of speculative luck-measurement and intimate garden knowledge is non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The withered vine dresser drives key beats: returning to the maze (setup), placing marbles to favor sensors (development), confessing mended deception to the Auditor (middle choice), and polishing the burning marble in the center court (closure participation). Choices alter tactics (marble angles teach vine growth) and the final image depends on the character's presence and labor. Two-gate minimum met; all three gates present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The character's stance crystallization (humility when plants choose) forecloses pride with visible cost. Specificity: the stoop, the cane, and the scars are irreplaceable details.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marbles appear in setup (collection, cracked by frost), development (placement at joints to guide vines, polishing ritual), and closure (burning marble between roots). They constrain tactics (angling to favor sensors) and charge the final image (light spreading as rumor-that-is-finally-true). Three or more beats: opening collection, midpoint confession to Auditor showing the angles, final burning placement. Causal pressure: the marbles enable new root formation and guide vine growth. Closure linkage: the burning marble anchors the doorway and the garden's exhalation. Minor friction: the marbles' cracked state is mentioned but not causally leveraged; smooth marbles could substitute without major structural change, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mended deception is seeded early ("deception was not proud, but I kept the shape of it"), developed in the confession to the Auditor ("like a graft that holds because it learned both trunks"), and shapes the closure (light teaching vines to remember warmth vs. cheating). The concept constrains tactics: the protagonist's marble placement is both honest teaching and angle-favoring, threading the line between fraud and pedagogy. The Auditor's humidity confirmation validates the mended form. The concept is woven through stakes (proving recognition without cheating) and the final image (light spreads, blooming withering). All three gates present; causal pressure and cost (past lies breaking under winter) are legible. Irreplaceability: the "mended" aspect—graft that learned both trunks—is specific and structural.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wisely pragmatic is signaled in the opening ("grip remains wisely pragmatic, like twine knotted just enough to hold") and demonstrated in marble placement (angles to favor sensors, not overreach) and the ceremonial practice (discipline, not mysticism). One visible tradeoff: the protagonist's confession risks Auditor sanction but teaches rather than conceals. The trait enables the mended-deception approach but does not constrain a major choice with felt cost at closure. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is oblique (the burning marble is pragmatic in placement but not explicitly framed as such). Functional but not indispensable; "careful" or "measured" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Polishing appears in setup ("polish them with breath and a memory"), development (repeated ritual by moonlight and morning light), and closure (polishing one marble until it burns). The action drives the mended-deception tactic and charges the final image (burning marble as proof). At least three beats: opening description, midpoint ceremonial practice, final burning placement. Causal pressure: polishing is the means by which marbles hold intention and guide light. Closure linkage: the burning marble anchors the doorway's proof and the garden's exhalation. Specificity: polishing by breath is tactile and particular. Cost connection: years of labor are visible in the act. High integration; removing polishing would break the ritual logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Commemorating small victories elaborately is seeded early ("Each evening I practice commemorating small victories elaborately"), demonstrated in midpoint beats (ribbon on trellis, anthem for beetle, marble constellations), and frames the protagonist's pedagogical stance. The method constrains tactics (elaborate gratitude trains recognition) and differentiates the protagonist's approach from the Auditor's (attention vs. indices). The Auditor's question ("why I celebrate such little things with such noise") dramatizes the method's friction. Closure participation: the method underwrites the final ceremonial placement of the burning marble. All three gates present. Causal pressure: the method teaches the body to recognize the hedge breathing back. Specificity: the ribbon, anthem, and constellations are particular. Minor friction: the method is told and demonstrated but the peak closure beat does not explicitly invoke the celebratory frame, slightly reducing indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden maze pressures choices throughout: marble placement at joints, vine angles, spatial access (Auditor gets lost), and the doorway's selective architecture. Setup, development, and closure gates all met. At least three beats: opening return, midpoint Auditor's traversal and loss, closing doorway that fits the protagonist and rejects the Auditor. Causal pressure: the maze's structure enables the proof of recognition and the vines' selective lean. Closure linkage: the center court doorway and root grip anchor the final image. Specificity: hedges lean toward the protagonist, the doorway fits his stoop, the maze remembers via shadow over clover. Cost connection: years of tending and humility are visible in the maze's response. High irreplaceability; no other setting could deliver the selective architecture and proof.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe (after luck becomes measurable) is seeded in the opening line, frames the world logic (sensors, bar codes, Auditor visit), and contrasts measurable luck with the protagonist's devotional practice. The shift from pre-measurement to post-measurement is implicit in the backstory (lying about yields before sensors) and explicit in the present conflict (Auditor checking indices). Development: the Auditor's arrival and meter readings depend on the measurable-luck frame. Closure participation: the meters' validation and the doorway proof occur within the post-measurement era. Two gates met (setup, development); closure is thematic rather than causally active on the timeframe itself. The timeframe enables the conflict but does not tighten decisions at the ending beat; the story could function in a non-measurement era with minor edits (e.g., skeptical inspector instead of Auditor). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation (to prove that gardens know their gardeners) is seeded early ("I returned to prove that gardens know their gardeners"), dramatized through marble placement and ceremonial practice, and tested by the Auditor's visit. The protagonist's choices (polishing, placement, confession) serve this desire. Friction: the desire conflicts with the risk of Auditor sanction and the humility required when the hedge chooses. Closure: the proof lands in the doorway's selective fit and the garden's exhalation. All three gates present. Causal pressure: the motivation drives the mended-deception tactic and the ritualized attention. Cost: years of labor, humility, and the scars the protagonist invokes. Specificity: the motivation is tied to the protagonist's history (lying, turning away) and cannot be swapped for a generic redemption arc. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Blooming withering as tone is seeded in imagery (vines arching, leaves wither, new roots forming) and lands explicitly in the final phrase ("light spreads like a rumor that is finally true, blooming withering"). The tone modulates: reflective patience in the opening, tension during the Auditor's visit, charged crystallization at closure. The paradox (simultaneous bloom and wither) charges the final image and reconfigures the dominant stake (recognition requires both growth and humility). Setup and closure gates met; development is implicit in the interplay of new roots and withered appearance but not foregrounded as tonal shift. Coherent through turns. The final phrase integrates the tone into the closure image, making it functional rather than ornamental. Minor friction: "blooming withering" as a verb phrase is compressed and slightly opaque without earlier teaching of the grammatical form, though the conceptual pairing is seeded throughout.</comment>
