<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("my secret motive was simple, stubborn, and embarrassingly tender"), with embodied choices like scooping dream dust, kissing envelopes shut, and trading a pin for a twig. Motivation is coherent: the desire to discover what trees witness drives the sextant reconstruction and the rooftop conversation. The final stance—accepting that "some work is finished simply by being carried to the light"—is earned by the accumulated particulars, though the arc leans more toward confirmation than transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers ritual (logging seams, scooping dream dust, measurements) until the rooftop exchange reweights the maintenance work as witness-keeping. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (tower, labyrinth worker, moonlight). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator completes the ritual, receives the trees' answer, and accepts the work's sufficiency without needing declarative proof—"the map would hold" and "some work is finished simply by being carried to the light." Cost is felt as renunciation of conclusive answers in favor of patient continuity. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sextant clicks and the numbers "opened like shutters to wind," shifting quantified sorrow from ledger to conversation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tower, maze corridors, parapet, and encircling forest are vivid and purposeful: moonlight heals hairline regrets, dream dust collects at turns, the storm pauses to consider, trees flash "green radiographs" and hold maps. The sextant's cracked mirrors and rusted arc constrain the method (broken sight still knows how to point), and the rooftop setting enables the trees' answer. Sensory detail—"beaded curtain of patience," "pepper and rain," "leaves rubbed"—is filtered through the narrator's maintenance-worker idiom and supports the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to discover what trees witness. Pressure accumulates through the ritual of dream-mapping and sextant reconstruction, tightening when the narrator asks aloud and the storm pauses. The trees' answer—"they witness our maps… and they hold them until we return to read"—reweights the ledger work and delivers a cost: the narrator must accept indirect, texture-based knowing rather than declarative proof. Agency is clear in the decision to carry measurements to the roof and ask "the clumsiest way." One meaningful deepening (the sextant clicking, numbers opening) and one Charged Poise moment (the final pin falling, "the map would hold") suffice for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: witnessing, patient repair, and sorrow as navigable terrain. The sextant, dream dust, ledger, and trees form a purposeful constellation that charges the closure without overt statement. The final lines—"some work is finished simply by being carried to the light"—offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting maintenance as communion. Subtext operates in gesture (kissing envelopes, trading pin for twig) and the trees' textural reply ("something counted but never concluded"). No thematic echo or moralizing; complexity is sustained without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("mundane miracles," "quantified sorrow," "interior weather") paired with concrete particulars (mops, maps, envelopes, twig). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature—maintenance worker meeting astronomer's tools, moonlight as ledger—shapes every detail. Patterned diction and deliberate elision (e.g., "the numbers gentled into stories") are taught early and serve closure. Minor register drift in phrases like "conceptual repricing" is voice-motivated and fits the narrator's method of quantifying sorrow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The forest ringed the tower, shouldering lightning, nodding through seasons like elders who know names" delivers setting, atmosphere, and the witness theme). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is consistent with voice. A few lines verge on overwriting—"green radiographs," "beaded curtain of patience"—but remain legible and serve the lyric mode. No loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. The final line—"some work is finished simply by being carried to the light"—offers a clean, resonant closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—maintenance worker quantifying sorrow to converse with witness trees—synthesizes familiar materials (labyrinth, healing moonlight, broken instrument) into a fresh, specific vision. The combination of ledger-keeping, dream dust, and sextant reconstruction feels organic to this narrator's idiom and stakes. Emotional truth (stubborn tenderness, patient repair) avoids generic templates. The trees' textural answer and the final twig-for-pin trade offer non-obvious turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The maintenance worker's choices drive key beats: logging seams, scooping dream dust, rebuilding the sextant, carrying measurements to the roof, asking aloud, trading pin for twig, and resuming the sweep. Setup is immediate (line 2). Development constrains middle choices (the ritual dictates method). Closure participation is strong: the final choice to listen for the patient pin and trust the map anchors the ending. The character's occupation and motive are inseparable from the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sextant appears early ("salvaged from a clogged drain of stars"), is handled across multiple beats (planning reconstruction, spreading dreams on its arc, taking parts to the roof, setting the cracked lens against the sky, cooling before dawn), and its broken state—"mirrors spidered with cracks, its arc bitten by rust, it still knew how to point"—shapes the method and charges the closure. The instrument's transformation from astronomer's tool to sorrow meter is essential to the narrator's conversation with the trees.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is signaled early ("a ledger of quantified sorrow, the only language it trusted") and shapes the narrator's method (logging seams, measuring dream dust, "the numbers did not punish; they opened like shutters to wind"). It enables the rooftop conversation when "sorrow numbers" align with moon-burnished bark. The concept constrains tactics (measurement precedes asking) and participates in closure ("the numbers gentled into stories"). While integral, the concept leans more toward thematic frame than a discrete on-page cost mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is established early ("by night the labyrinth heals in moonlight, resealing hairline regrets") and enables the narrator's method: moonlight is the medium for repair and witness-keeping. The attribute appears in closure ("I felt my hands repaired by the moon" and "the moon" charges the final beats). However, the trait does not impose a visible tradeoff or constrain a specific choice under pressure; it functions more as atmospheric logic than a causal lever with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" is central to the plan ("I planned to deconstruct it, rebuild it as a sorrow meter") and the narrator does spread sextant parts on the roof stones. However, the story elides the reconstruction itself; the sextant's use in measuring dream dust and aligning sorrow numbers is shown, but the pivotal act of deconstruction/rebuilding happens off-page. The action is structurally important but not dramatized with on-page cost or a turn that redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By mapping scattered dreams" is signaled early ("my method would be plain as bread and stranger than sleep: by mapping scattered dreams") and executed across multiple beats: scooping dream dust, labeling angles, spreading dreams on the sextant's arc, matching packets to service hatches and footprints. The method shapes the narrator's attempts and enables the measurement that leads to the rooftop conversation. Mechanics matter: the dust's "angles, weights, pale scents" become the quantified sorrow that the trees acknowledge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stormlit tower by moonlight is present from the opening line and shapes choices throughout: the tower hums, its slit window watches, the parapet provides the vantage for asking the trees, and moonlight is the medium of healing and witness. The setting constrains method (corridors collect dream dust, the roof enables conversation) and charges the final image ("the tower dimmed… and the trees resumed their watchfulness"). The location is inseparable from the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe—"at the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor"—is established early ("There is a fragile hour in the maze… At the moment a pin is heard…") and returns at closure ("When it came, a soft star on the stone, I knew the map would hold"). The pin falling becomes a marker of the maze's breath and the narrator's triangulation, shaping the coordinates logged in the ledger. The moment tightens the narrator's listening and participates in the ending as proof the map holds, though it functions more as a symbolic anchor than a live clock that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover what trees witness"—is signaled early as "my secret motive" and drives every major choice: reconstructing the sextant, mapping dreams, carrying measurements to the roof, and asking aloud. Friction is present in the clumsiness of asking and the narrator's acceptance of a textural answer rather than declarative proof. The trees' reply reweights the motive, and the narrator's return to sweeping demonstrates the cost: continuing patient work without needing explicit validation. The desire is dramatized through choices and charged by the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Mundane miracles" is established in line 3 and sustained through the entire piece: mops and maps become tools of witness-keeping, a broken sextant still points, dream dust yields measurements, numbers open like shutters, and the everyday broom leans at closure. Tone is coherent through turns (the storm pausing, the trees' answer, the final sweep) and modulates with pressure without breaking the established register. The final lines—"the everyday one that leaves the broom leaning" and "some work is finished simply by being carried to the light"—charge the closure image with the tone's exact quality.</comment>
