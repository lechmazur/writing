<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("sap on my gloves," the shard cutting the thumb as "reminder not to posture"), with micro-choices under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values. However, the peacekeeper role edges toward archetype without sufficient internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene—most decisions flow smoothly from the mentor's lesson rather than creating visible friction between competing impulses. The envoys' transformation occurs too quickly without sustained resistance, undercutting the cost of their promises. Backstory about the mentor and crystal fragment functions well within BRR allowance, anchoring present choices without flattening momentum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the protagonist standing in the seam between promise and action, holding the globe, about to walk toward the fracture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the globe accepts the envoys' promises contingent on the protagonist's follow-through, reweighting mediation from neutral observation to ankle-deep participation. Cost is legible: "the new gravity that comes after a decision actually costs something" and the walk into slush. Minor causality slip: mirrors "remember" and "oblige" without clear mechanism, but the pattern is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes constrain choice throughout: floes "scraped and parted like arguments," the fracture at Gull Rook becomes the tactical goal, and the lantern's sweep stitches pan to pan in the final image. Micro-setting also functions—mirrors, crates, ladders, globe—as tools that enable action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the peacekeeper's priorities (sap, frost on boots, slush underfoot). The environment evolves causally (ice moves, lantern turns) and the final spatial choreography (standing with globe, light sweeping coat) charges the closure image with clear geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map empathy onto action—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must commit to "acts, not poses" under mirror pressure, then again when the globe's survival depends on walking with each team to ensure words find legs. One reversal: the shard cuts when the protagonist hesitates, teaching that posture breaks the tool. Agency is decision and endurance (the walk into slush) with visible cost. The envoys' promises feel slightly convenient—first and second offers align too neatly—but the protagonist's choice to pocket the fragment "as reminder that humility belongs in every mechanism" forecloses the option of neutral observer status with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as map requiring action—emerges through particulars (ferryman rope, bee warmth, volunteers' bridge) rather than statement, and the globe's refusal to "shatter if we dared varnish blame" enacts the premise. The final image (seam between promised and done, steps steady, heart unafraid) offers non-literal answer. However, "neutrality was not absence but balance" edges toward thesis articulation, and "shadow-laced peacekeeper" recurs as a label without evolving meaning. The orchard's "tart patience" as arbiter feels ornamental rather than tightly braided into the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with stable psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature: "I was calmly intuitive, but intuition needed a device to make itself legible to strangers." Diction remains character-particular ("ankle deep in slush," "weighted breath before reply") and modulates under pressure without register drift. Dialogue is goal-driven and advances plot—envoys' promises are specific, actionable, and subtext-laden (lingering afterward, bowing to orchard not peacekeeper). Minor tic: "I asked" recurs three times in the final third, creating slight template cadence, but does not obscure voice under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Strategic telling compresses transit ("I climbed down to the hamlet") efficiently. Figurative language is mostly controlled ("ice floes…like arguments that had forgotten their beginnings"), though "shadow-laced" and "courageous anomaly" approach stock metaphor without full transformation. Paraphrase loop in final third: "I stood…a quiet seam" restates "In that seam lies the work" within two paragraphs, and template stems ("I asked…I told…I pocketed…I sent…I stood") stack across the resolution sequence. Minor filter-verb clustering ("I felt the heartbeat," "I believed then") in reflective beats. No hard artifacts touch closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes and mediation via reconstructed crystal offer fresh synthesis, and the mirrors-showing-alternate-lives device feels purposeful rather than gimmicky. Emotional specificity (shard cutting thumb, "new gravity") grounds the arc. However, the peacekeeper-mediator archetype and the "wise mentor's broken artifact" premise lean on familiar templates; transformation through occupational detail (what a peacekeeper *does* tactically) remains thin. The globe projecting "remembered efforts" rather than futures is a non-obvious turn that elevates the middle third, but the envoys' symmetrical cooperation edges toward safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shadow-laced peacekeeper drives all major beats: chooses to repair the shard, commits to acts over posture (middle turn), accepts envoys' promises contingent on personal follow-through, and begins the walk to Gull Rook fracture at closure. Early signal in paragraph two, causal pressure throughout (job definition: "map empathy onto action by traveling"), and closure linkage ("steps steady, heart unafraid"). The descriptor "shadow-laced" recurs but remains ornamental; the role itself is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Broken crystal ball fragment appears in five distinct beats: mentor's gift (setup), request to mirrors, healing under protagonist's choices (cuts thumb, accepts facets), becomes globe used with envoys, and pocketed as humility reminder at closure. Causal pressure: intuition needs device, shard teaches "acts not poses," globe survives only if protagonist walks with teams. Closure linkage strong (pocketing fragment reweights tool as ongoing discipline). Only slight swappability—could be another broken divinatory object—but mechanics (vein of light, cuts when posturing) are specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Courageous anomaly appears twice: mid-story label ("globe flared, a courageous anomaly") and implicit in the premise (reconstructing broken tool under pressure). It shapes the stake (device must thrive on pulse of plans, not prediction) and charges the globe's mechanics, but the phrase itself reads ornamental—protagonist never risks courage or confronts anomaly status on the page. Functions as thematic accent rather than constraint on tactics. Partial closure link (globe's survival depends on follow-through), but removing the exact phrase would not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Calmly intuitive establishes method early ("I was calmly intuitive, but intuition needed a device"), enables mirror work (feeling heartbeat under reflections), and constrains finale (intuition alone insufficient; must walk with teams). Trait shapes one key choice (committing to acts when shard cuts) and informs voice throughout. However, "calmly" is told more than shown—no moment where urgency threatens calm with visible cost. Mid-band: functional across beats, partial closure link (calm persistence in final walk), but tradeoff remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reconstitute is the spine: protagonist descends to mirrors to repair shard (beat two), traces ferryman rope and bee warmth onto fragment (beat three, edges knit under pressure), completes globe by dusk (beat four enabling envoy negotiation), and the reconstructed tool survives only through continued action. Early signal, causal in three beats, closure-essential (without reconstructed globe, envoys have no device and protagonist has no means to test promises). Irreplaceable; swapping to "repair" or "rebuild" would not alter integration. Cost visible (cut thumb, requirement to walk).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Via glimpses in vintage store mirrors is method, introduced early (hamlet descent, mirrors "rumored to remember"), occupies full beat (ferryman and beekeeper visions teach protagonist to trace feeling into path), and its mechanics matter—mirrors darken when protagonist hesitates, accept facets only when commitment is real. Method shapes two middle beats and primes closure (learned lesson enables envoy mediation). Could potentially swap to another divinatory surface, but the vintage store's "remembering" and multiple panes offering different lives are specific. No closure cameo, slight cap, but causal necessity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes anchors all action: protagonist keeps watch from lantern gallery (setup), ice movement creates the mediation crisis (people on opposite pans send flares), Gull Rook fracture becomes tactical goal, and lantern's sweep in final image "stitched pan to pan." Early signal, setting pressures choices in three beats, and closure linkage strong (protagonist walks toward fracture, lantern turns). Orchard itself (apples on crates, trees as patient arbiters) is more decorative; the ice and lighthouse do the causal work. High integration but slight ornamental drift on "orchard" lowers from indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>During the weighted breath before reply timeframe is taught in paragraph four ("pause came like snowlight, during the weighted breath before reply between two archrivals"), becomes tactical frame (envoys arrive "while the ice took a slow step"), tightens in mediation ("I asked for silence, and I meant the kind that lasts just during the weighted breath before reply"), and charges closure (standing in seam between promised and dawn). Present in four beats, shapes decision pressure, and ending hinges on the interval before action begins. Irreplaceable—tempo is the stake. Cost implicit (gravity after decision) rather than urgent countdown, slight softness, but causal across arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To map empathy onto action is stated early as job definition, tested when mirrors teach "empathy is a map only when a path follows that feeling," drives protagonist's commit-to-acts choice (shard cuts during hesitation), structures envoy negotiation (globe projects work not winning, protagonist walks with teams), and becomes final stance ("map empathy onto action by traveling ankle deep in slush"). Motivation present in five beats with clear friction (intuition alone insufficient, posture breaks tool, must follow through with body). Closure indispensable. Minor label-reliance but the choices dramatize the conflict between feeling and action with cost.</comment>
