<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The eel herder's motivation is concrete—placing painted stones in mathematical sequences—and embodied through repeated action ("I scoop it with a bowl carved from driftbone"). The precognitive curse adds interior contradiction ("I feel the futures sliding too, a thousand versions of my hands shivering"), but the central relationship with "she" remains abstract; we learn only that a promise was made, not what visceral need drives the repeated attempts beyond the stated desire to "understand sacred patterns." The final choice to let go of the bowl feels earned by the accumulation of ritual, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of ritual repetition (stone arrangements, dust gathering, promise recitation) that intensifies through denser sensory detail and closer convergence with "she." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee, and neither do I"—the final image crystallizes the achieved stasis with the conceptual cost of elusive identity now voluntarily embodied ("I am hidden by the math we asked the sea to speak"). The orientation anchors (eel herder, tidal bluff, post-friction world) arrive early enough, and the accumulative pressure holds through the aurora night sequence to the dawn resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora functions as active setting: the aurora "spills green and violet like pages," triggering the dust fall that the herder must harness; the slope becomes a surface to ride "as if steering a thought." The painted rocks, bowl carved from driftbone, and eel skins tied to feet are micro-setting elements that constrain tactics (the bowl "rings like a bell," the eels' skins enable slope-riding). The final image—"our feet find traction in the thought we made"—charges the setting with the story's conceptual weight, making the unstable shore a direct pressure on every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: fulfill the promise to return with "a breath to hold the shore in place." The accumulative pressure comes through repeated ritual failures implied by "sometimes a future shows me failing" and the escalating complexity of stone patterns (primes → Fibonacci → triangular lattices → her name in base twelve). The final tightening occurs when "she" appears and they hold the bowl together, forcing the herder's agency into collaborative enactment. Cost is conceptual—becoming "hidden by the math"—rather than viscerally dramatized, and the story does not show a prior failure on the page to anchor the stakes' urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: friction's disappearance renders physical law unstable, so pattern (mathematical sequences, linguistic promises) becomes the binding force. The final image—"the answer is only the pattern, a promise rehearsed until the world believes it"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to restore weight and traction) without moralizing. The motif of "elusive" recurs with purpose, shifting from the villagers' label to the herder's self-acceptance ("I am hidden by the math we asked the sea to speak"), reweighting identity as method rather than evasion. The thematic line between sacred pattern and physical law is explored through action (placing stones, humming numbers) rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct lyric-compression style: "The dawn that finds me is borrowed, thin as breath over the sea." Perceptual signature is consistent—mathematical and ritualistic ("I hum the numbers until they taste like salt")—and diction stays within the focalizer's idiom (precise geometric terms, metaphysical phrasing). The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter declaratives at the climax ("I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee, and neither do I"). However, some lines approach self-aware poeticism ("I am held at a slant by the futures that keep arriving early") that risks distance inconsistency, and the villagers' voices are summarized rather than heard directly, missing an opportunity for dialogue distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully ("It is the hour after friction disappears" / "The eels feel it first, threading the sequences like dark needles"), and information density is high (most lines advance ritual, world rules, or stakes). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I am the elusive eel herder" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure, and "the promise" is restated multiple times in adjacent lines ("I promised to return" / "the promise hung" / "To carry it I whisper the promise again"). Figurative density occasionally clouds clarity: "ride the slope as if steering a thought" and "hidden by the math we asked the sea to speak" both blur vehicle and tenor in peak beats. Template stems cluster in the middle third ("I scoop… I whisper… I feel…"), mildly flattening propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-friction physics, mathematical pattern as binding force, and precognitive curse creates a non-obvious premise. The eel herder's occupation and the specific methods (painted rocks in prime spirals, collapsed star dust gathered during aurora, promise repetition as physical anchor) feel particular rather than generic. The emotional core—fulfilling a promise to restore weight—avoids stock templates by grounding it in esoteric ritual rather than conventional love or heroism. However, the "world physics breaking down, protagonist must restore it through arcane knowledge" frame is widely used in speculative fiction, and the story does not fully transform it beyond the mathematical specificity; the herder's precognitive curse, while unusual, operates mostly as flavor rather than driving a non-obvious tactical dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The elusive eel herder is the focalizer whose choices drive every beat: arranging stones in mathematical sequences, humming numbers, scooping dust, reciting the promise, spelling her name in base twelve, and finally letting go of the bowl. The character appears in the opening line, guides all middle ritual attempts, and performs the decisive act at closure. The "elusive" attribute is explored through both villagers' perception and the herder's self-understanding, reweighted at the end as methodological rather than evasive. Two gate tests met (setup, payoff); middle development is present through repeated ritual choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust is introduced in the fourth paragraph ("collapsed star dust that falls in faint drifts"), gathered with the driftbone bowl, and appears again when the eels' skins sing as dust touches them and when "she" and the herder hold the bowl together at closure. It shifts from description ("heavy without weight, ash from a furnace above measure") to tactile use (scooping, carrying via promise recitation) to shared ritual object. However, its specific properties (weight without mass, responsive to patterns) do not constrain a key choice; the dust could be replaced with another scarce, pattern-responsive substance. All three gates met, but causal irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lingering promise is introduced early ("Before the last spring… she whispered that I would find a breath to hold the shore in place. I promised to return with that breath") and shapes every tactic: the herder recites it to stabilize footing ("Each repetition grants me a narrow road"), uses it to carry the dust, and performs the final act by saying "the promise one last time." The promise is not merely thematic backdrop but active constraint and tool. At closure, the promise's fulfillment (or Charged Poise moment of potential fulfillment) anchors the image of shared breath and the dust deepening "from shine to weight." All gates met with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Precognitively cursed is introduced in the second paragraph and explained ("Being precognitively cursed is like walking with wind as a leash, your steps tugged toward what has not yet happened"). It enables the herder to see multiple futures ("Sometimes a future shows me failing… Other times I see the shore knitting itself again") and positions "she" as present in the futures. However, the curse does not force a visible on-page tradeoff or constrain a key choice; the herder's actions proceed as if directed by memory and determination rather than navigating conflicting precognitive visions. The trait adds texture but remains closer to label than dramatized cost. Gates: setup and thematic payoff present; middle constraint weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harness" is introduced in the fourth paragraph ("I try to harness collapsed star dust") and recurs through the scooping, carrying via promise, and final shared moment with the bowl. The action structures the middle sequence: placing stones to attract dust, using the bowl to collect it, reciting the promise to stabilize carriage, and holding the bowl with "she" at closure when "the dust thrums like a pulse" and "deepens from shine to weight." Removing "harness" as the verb and replacing it with "gather" or "collect" would slightly weaken the active constraint framing, but the beats themselves remain intact. All gates met; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences is introduced in the third paragraph ("placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences along the tidal bluff") and elaborated through specific sequences: primes, Fibonacci, triangular lattices, and her name in base twelve. The method directly enables the eel gathering ("The eels feel it first, threading the sequences") and dust pooling ("the dust stirs and pools where the primes meet the triangles"). At closure, "the rocks shine their fragile logic" as the dust gains weight. The method is irreplaceable—substituting verbal chants or drawn symbols would require rewriting the eel response and the geometric lattice logic. All gates met with strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora is introduced in the third paragraph and recurs throughout: the aurora "spills green and violet like pages" triggering the dust fall, the bluff's "lip" and "slope" provide surfaces for stone placement and eel-skin riding, and the "cliff" is where "she" waits. The setting pressures choices by requiring the herder to work within the aurora's timing and the tidal geometry. At closure, "the cliff grips its own seams," embodying the physical result. The aurora's role is functional but could be replaced with another periodic celestial event. All gates met; moderate constraint strength.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After friction disappears" is introduced in the opening line and explained in the second paragraph ("the hour after friction disappears, when everything slides toward prophecy"). The timeframe establishes the world's physics (objects no longer held by nets or friction) and necessitates the pattern-based solution. However, it functions as static backdrop rather than live clock; no on-page ticking urgency or narrowing window pressures the herder's attempts. The dawn framing ("borrowed dawn" at open, "the length of the borrowed dawn" at close) provides lyric echo but does not tighten decisions. Gates: setup and thematic payoff present; middle pressure from time absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand sacred patterns" is stated explicitly in the middle ("it is my need to understand sacred patterns that make and unmake weight") and dramatized through the repeated placement of mathematical sequences and the attempt to "hear the shape of gravity in the numbers." The final line—"the answer is only the pattern"—circles back to this desire. However, the motivation competes with the promise fulfillment as dominant drive; the herder's actions could be explained by either. The understanding is more told than shown to conflict with another want (e.g., rest, safety). Gates: setup, middle action, thematic payoff; friction between wants is weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" appears in the opening line and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("for the length of the borrowed dawn, the path holds"). The tone is consistently lyric-melancholic, balancing ethereal description ("thin as breath over the sea") with concrete ritual detail. However, the tone does not modulate sharply with pressure; the diction remains elevated and contemplative even at the climax. The final reprise of "borrowed" reweights the opening—dawn as temporary loan now extended through pattern—but the tonal arc is more static echo than dramatic shift. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score in mid-6 band for purposeful seed-and-return with moderate reweighting.</comment>
