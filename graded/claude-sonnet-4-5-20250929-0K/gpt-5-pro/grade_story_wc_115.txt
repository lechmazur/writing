<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and well-embodied ("drowsy alertness bloom behind my eyes," the tag in cheek "like a coin against the gum"), with distinct perceptual filters (surveyor's eye, reckless explorer). Internal contradiction operates effectively—skeptical yet following "a kind of liturgy"—and micro-choices (turning the wheel, climbing down, pocketing the tag) reveal hierarchy under pressure. The mother's confession and the narrator's response earn the final stance, forecloses a path of denial, and the ledger discovery lands with visible cost. Minor slip: the father's presence is constructed entirely through objects and inference rather than direct memory or prior scene, which keeps emotional charge slightly abstract at the peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the narrator retrieves physical proof (tag, ledger) that reweights the mother's confession and his own life, and carries it forward with the tag "in my cheek like a coin"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (the truth's weight, the years bent sideways). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through mapped whispers, beaded tokens, and layered sensory detail until the ledger's "column of zeros where a life should be written" reweights all prior material. Orientation is swift (tunnel, mother's confession, narrator alone) and causality is motivated by months of mapping and the mother's paid silence. One small coherence slip: "Factory ghost shift was the phrase that rode the cold air" arrives as established lore but the narrator's prior mapping method (talk-radio psychics) isn't dramatized on the page, only summarized, creating minor causal distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel is anchored early and constrains every move: rails, grease, seam drips, the valve wheel's iron throat, the ballast niche. Micro-setting elements—beaded wheel, lunch pail, ledger—function as charged objects that guide discovery and reweight meaning at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (soap, oil, lye smells; "tired moon" light) and spatial choreography tracks cleanly (wheel → panel → niche → climb back). The tunnel's physicality charges the final image: the narrator walks "straight on water for a while" with the tag as tangible proof. Body and tool (the wheel's beads biting skin) actively shape the turn, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator turns the wheel, a decision that forecloses retreat and opens the niche. The ledger's "column of zeros" and "hush paid" constitute visible cost and reweight the mother's confession with documentary proof. Agency is clear: months of mapping, the choice to follow the hush, the physical turn of the wheel, the descent into the niche. One meaningful deepening occurs (confession → physical evidence → carried burden), sufficient for this length. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible in the final image (tag in cheek, life "click[ing], teeth meeting teeth"). Minor gap: the prior mapping via talk-radio is told rather than dramatized, slightly softening the earned quality of the final discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth's mass, the cost of institutional silence, labor swallowed by capital—emerges through concrete particulars: beaded tokens, the ledger's zeros, "hush paid," the valve wheel. The final image (tag in cheek, drowsy alertness that "lets you walk straight on water") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in every image: beads as souvenir saints for unbelievers, the "invisible crank" of the ghost shift, the narrator's "religiously skeptical" stance. The piece resists tidy resolution—truth is retrieved but the life remains lost, and the narrator's future action is charged yet open. No thematic echo or sermon; motifs (beads, wheel, hush) constrain choice and charge closure rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: compression, sensory metaphor ("warm weight like another hand"), and diction that blends industrial grit with lyric precision ("prayer gulped at daylight," "liturgy made of rust"). POV distance is controlled—first-person interiority remains character-bound, and perceptual signature (surveyor's eye, skeptic's appraisal) filters every image. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming in on the wheel's beads, pulling back to hear the factory ghost shift's "invisible crank"). Brief elision (mother's confession content, the exact nature of prior mapping) serves compression and pays off when the ledger fills in gaps. One minor slip: "They call me a reckless abandoned-mill explorer" reads slightly externalized for a first-person narrator who otherwise inhabits immediate perception, though it establishes character efficiently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic propulsion. Information density is high—most lines do double or triple duty (e.g., "The beads were glass and plastic, wired clumsily...tokens pressed by fingers that needed warmth or luck or grip, souvenir saints for unbelievers like me" advances object description, thematic motif, and character stance simultaneously). Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("silence pressed," "truth like a pill," "tags in my cheek like a coin"). Minor loop: "drowsy alertness" recurs three times with slight variation, and "hush" appears frequently without always adding new pressure. One filter-verb cluster in the middle third ("I heard," "I felt," "I could see") slightly dulls immediacy during the wheel-turn beat. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops, and the final image is sharp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—industrial archeology meets filial grief, mapped via talk-radio psychic calls, resolved through physical evidence rather than spectral encounter—feels fresh and specific. The "factory ghost shift" premise transforms labor horror into a grounded mystery with documentary proof (ledger, tag) rather than supernatural payoff, subverting genre expectation purposefully. Voice and detail (beaded valve wheel, "hush paid" column, drowsy alertness) cohere as singular vision. The narrator's skeptical stance and surveyor's method distinguish this from standard ghost-hunting or family-secret templates. Risk-taking (lyric compression, accumulative structure, refusal of explicit confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a within-band bonus of +0.3. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend entirely on these particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reckless abandoned-mill explorer trait frames expectation early ("I keep coming back to places like this with knuckles split"), drives the decision to follow the hush into the tunnel, and enables the choice to turn the wheel and descend into the niche—two distinct beats with visible risk. The trait shapes the narrator's appraisal method (surveyor's eye, "steady...and a pencil") and charges the final image ("I climbed back...awake in that drowsy alertness"). Specificity is high: the trait is embodied through months of prior exploration, split knuckles, notebook, and the willingness to slide into the void. Causal pressure is strong—without this trait, the narrator would not act on the mother's confession. Closure linkage is present: the trait enables retrieval of the tag and ledger, which constitute the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in setup (described and contextualized as tokens "pressed by fingers that needed warmth or luck"), drives the key turn when the narrator sets palm to it and turns it (opening the sluice and panel), and is implicitly reweighted in the margins of the ledger ("someone had knotted a strand of the same plastic beads"). Three distinct beats; strong causal pressure (turning the wheel is the hinge action that opens access to the niche and evidence); closure linkage (the beads connect the father's labor to the narrator's discovery and reweight the "souvenir saints for unbelievers" motif). Specificity is high: the beads' texture ("biting my skin as if memory had teeth") and their dual function (grip aid and devotional token) make the object irreplaceable. Cost connection is visible: physical pain during the turn, emotional weight in recognizing the father's presence through the beads.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "factory ghost shift" concept is signaled early ("half joke, half dare"), shapes the narrator's months-long mapping effort, and defines the stakes (finding what the shift swallowed). It drives the investigation method (interpreting psychic-show calls as maps) and structures the tunnel's charge ("the factory ghost shift turned its invisible crank"). The concept is not merely thematic—it names the system that killed the father and paid the mother's silence, reweighted by the ledger's "hush paid" column. Two beats: the initial framing and the ledger's documentary confirmation. Causal pressure is moderate: the concept guides but does not mechanically force the narrator's moves. Closure linkage is strong: the shift's "invisible crank" and the ledger's zeros together constitute the "weight of a swallowed truth." Swappability is low; removing "factory ghost shift" would require renaming the entire investigative frame and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "religiously skeptical" trait is signaled early ("no candles in my pockets, no saints in my head") and returns in the valve-wheel beat ("souvenir saints for unbelievers like me"). It constrains the narrator's method: rejecting supernatural explanations, the narrator treats psychic calls as data ("panic smears truth like grease") and seeks physical evidence rather than spiritual encounter. The trait enables the appraisal stance and charges the irony of the beaded wheel (devotional tokens used by a skeptic). One distinct cost: the narrator must engage with belief systems as maps rather than truths, a subtle friction that shapes investigative choices. The trait modulates tone and thematic resonance but does not drive a major plot turn. Closure linkage is oblique: the trait frames the narrator's final stance (carrying physical proof, not seeking a ghost) but is not explicit in the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Appraise" is signaled early (the narrator "learned to appraise their fear the way surveyors weigh slopes") and structures the investigation: months of mapping calls, interpreting rumors as data, and finally appraising "what balance I could restore by carrying this truth." The action drives two beats: the methodical approach that leads to the tunnel and the final appraisal of the ledger's weight. Causal pressure is strong: the surveyor's stance enables the narrator to follow a pattern others dismissed as noise, and the final appraisal forecloses naive hope (the father is confirmed dead, the company confirmed complicit). Closure linkage is present: the narrator's effort to "appraise what balance I could restore" frames the ending's charged poise. Specificity is high: "appraise" is not generic investigation but a particular lens (objective, metric, comparative) that fits the narrator's skeptical and methodical character. Swapping "appraise" for "investigate" or "search" would soften the surveyor's texture and the thematic calculus.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method—interpreting talk-radio psychic calls—is present in setup ("For months I had mapped whispers and clanks by interpreting frantic calls") and shapes the backstory of how the narrator located the tunnel. It constrains method: the narrator does not trust the psychics' explanations but treats the callers' fear as geographic data ("panic smears truth like grease where it first catches"). However, the method is summarized rather than dramatized on the page; we do not witness the narrator listening to calls or plotting coordinates. One beat: the explanation of prior work. Moderate causal pressure: the method justifies why the narrator knows to come to this tunnel, but it does not drive an on-page turn. Closure linkage is absent: the psychic calls are not revisited in the ending. Specificity is high: the choice of talk-radio psychics (not police reports, not archives) is eccentric and character-specific. Swappability is moderate: another investigative method could deliver the narrator to the tunnel with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel anchors the entire story: it is the site of the mother's confession ("in the abandoned train tunnel"), the locus of the factory ghost shift's physical trace, and the container for every narrative move (wheel, niche, ledger discovery, climb back out). The tunnel constrains choice: access to the niche requires navigating rails, ballast, and the valve wheel; the tunnel's dampness and darkness shape sensory perception and urgency. Three distinct beats: entry and orientation, the valve-wheel turn and descent, the retrieval and exit. Strong causal pressure: the tunnel's layout (spur under the river road, stone belly of the bleaching works) is not incidental but structural—it hides the evidence the company buried. Closure linkage is decisive: the final image of walking "straight on water for a while" recharges the tunnel's underworld quality (beneath the river, into the dark, back out with proof). Specificity is absolute: the tunnel is not a generic abandoned space but a mill spur with a valve wheel, a niche, and a history that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"during the hush that follows a sudden confession"—is signaled in the opening line and sustained throughout: the entire story occurs in the pressured silence after the mother's revelation. The hush functions thematically (the company's paid silence, the narrator's internal stillness, the tunnel's held breath) and tonally (drowsy alertness, the wait for what comes next). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with a live clock or urgent deadline; the narrator moves at a deliberate, exploratory pace without time pressure. The hush is more atmospheric than causal. One beat: the opening framing carries through as ambient condition. Moderate thematic pressure: the hush reweights the confession and final image ("the hush gathered tighter") but does not force tactical choices. Closure linkage is present: the hush's release (turning the wheel, gate crying, panel clattering) marks the shift from waiting to action. Swappability is moderate: another contemplative timeframe (e.g., "the night after learning the truth") could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and drives every choice: months of mapping, the descent into the tunnel, turning the wheel, retrieving the ledger and tag. The desire is dramatized through action and carries visible friction: the narrator wants "the mass of what had pressed her tongue for years and bent my life sideways, something that could pull a scale down decisively," not a ghost but physical proof. Two beats: the initial declaration and the ledger's fulfillment (the "column of zeros where a life should be written"). Strong causal pressure: the motivation structures the investigation and justifies risk (sliding into the niche, carrying the tag). Closure linkage is decisive: the final image realizes the motivation—the narrator has the weight, the proof, and now must decide "what balance I could restore by carrying this truth." Cost is visible: the truth's weight is no longer abstract but literal (tag in cheek, life clicking into new alignment), and the narrator's prior years are confirmed as "bent...sideways" by the company's lie.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "drowsy alertness" tone is signaled early ("feeling drowsy alertness bloom behind my eyes, the kind that keeps you still while your thoughts prowl and tally") and sustained through the investigation: the narrator moves deliberately, perceiving intensely yet without panic. The tone modulates subtly with pressure—sharpening when the wheel bites, softening in the niche's discovery, crystallizing in the final image ("awake in that drowsy alertness that lets you walk straight on water for a while"). The tone is not static but charges the closure by framing the narrator's altered state: burdened with proof yet holding it carefully, alert yet dreamlike. Two beats: the initial framing and the final return to the phrase. Moderate causal pressure: the tone reflects the narrator's investigative stance (patient, observant, not rushed) but does not itself force choices. Closure linkage is strong: the final line's return to "drowsy alertness" reweights the opening and encodes the narrator's transformed stance—carrying the truth with paradoxical calm and intensity. Specificity is high: the pairing of drowsy and alert is oxymoronic and particular, matching the narrator's skeptical-yet-committed character.</comment>
