<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's reticence is embodied through observation and quiet action rather than declaration, creating a consistent perceptual signature. The final choice to create "a lantern that would never burn" grows organically from the character's established values and methods. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between wanting to protect feeling and knowing automation will hollow the tower. Minor deduction: the motivation remains somewhat abstract; we see the *what* of protection clearly but the personal cost of losing this role could land harder on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator cannot stop automation but forecloses museum commodification by sealing the letters in an unburnable form, visible cost in "I could not keep the tower from emptying, but I could keep its promise from being put under glass." The accumulative lens holds throughout—gathering letters, stones, sea glass toward a final ritual act. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse supply skipper, Briar Neck, evening run). One meaningful tightening: the threat of archival display forces the protective counter-move. Deduction: the causality between Doyle's rumor and the narrator's specific sealing method feels slightly elliptical; the leap from "archived, cataloged, displayed" to oil-soaked letters in a sealed jar requires inference.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the narrator goes "when the wick guttered," the panes "remember heat," the space "held the dark like warm water." The jar, stones, and sea glass become tactile anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the skipper's professional eye: "seams on a fuel drum," "the way a keeper laced his boots." The setting's emptying (sketches taken down, automation pending) supplies the pressure that drives the protective ritual. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the climb and the floor-level ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protecting the anonymous letter chain's meaning from commodification. The Board's automation and archival threat supply coherent pressure. One meaningful tightening: Doyle's revelation that letters "would be archived, cataloged, displayed behind glass" escalates from abstract automation to concrete theft of intimacy, narrowing options to immediate counter-action. The final ritual—soaking letters in oil, sealing the jar—forecloses museum capture with visible cost (the letters become unreadable, the light bottled but never burned). Agency is renunciation and endurance; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulation: letters as "bottled feeling of safety," stones as messages, sea glass held to light. The piece asks what survives mechanization and answers through the ritual of making "a lantern that would never burn"—a light preserved in form but not function, intimacy saved by rendering it unreadable. No thesis statements; the final image of the jar glowing "with a luminescent ache" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece resists tidy resolution: the tower empties, but "its promise" escapes glass cases. Minor point: "how to keep the ache from going homeless" skirts abstraction but is anchored by the concrete ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "I read the water, the gulls, the seams on a fuel drum." Focalization is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—maritime, reticent, observant—under pressure: "I was the shape of silence a room makes when two men fail to say goodbye." Purposeful compression ("barrels and bread, a wrench, a story") and lyric patterning ("They say lights die like people") are taught early and sustained. The final ritual unfolds through concrete action verbs (unscrewed, poured, pressed, sealed) that anchor reflection. Free indirect narration of the letter-writers ("to bottle the feeling of safety") remains clean. Psychic distance modulates intentionally from close observation to quiet summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, character stance, or the letter-chain logic. Rhythm varies purposefully—long accumulative sentences ("Some letters were instructions, like a way of stacking stones...") alternate with terse beats ("So I went"). No paraphrase loops. Minor issues: "The haunted lantern room waited for me like a lung with a held breath" then "sighed as if it remembered a child"—two lung/breath metaphors in close proximity. "After the lamp flickers out" is frame-quoted three times, borderline template cadence but serves as ritual anchor. Filter verbs ("I wanted to protect") appear sparingly and voice-motivated. One small clarity slip: "the inked mouths of the letters" reads initially unclear until context (oil-soaking) resolves it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—anonymous letter chain, lighthouse automation, ritual counter-archiving—feels specific and non-obvious. The choice to *seal meaning against use* rather than preserve function transforms the preservation trope. Sensory particulars (green sea glass, three flat stones, oil-soaked paper) avoid generic nautical atmosphere. The emotional calculus is fresh: better unreadable intimacy than museum label-copy. Risk: the lyric accumulative structure and quiet ending could flatten in lesser hands, but here the final image earns its charge. Minor deduction: the "haunted lantern room" and "ghosts in the glass" metaphors, while consistent, gesture toward Gothic convention without fully transforming it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout. The skipper's reticence shapes observation (reads water, gulls, boot-lacing) and the decision to act alone after the lamp dies. The final ritual—building the stone message, soaking letters, sealing the jar—is a direct choice that alters what survives. Early signal (first paragraph), middle beats (carrying letters, noticing Doyle's distress), and closure participation (the ritual). Constraint: reticence means no confrontation, only solitary counter-move. Cost: the act forecloses any possibility of the letters being read again, even by keepers.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced mid-story wrapped around a letter: "Hold this to the light...and know it is our ship you hear, not the storm." Returns at closure: "pressed the piece of sea glass into the jar's throat, sealing it with wax" and "the green glass caught the thin moon...the whole thing glowed." Two functional beats (initial receipt, closure seal) with reweighted meaning—from comfort token to seal/lens of the unburnable lantern. High specificity (green, smoothed, glows) makes it irreplaceable. Causal: enables the jar to glow and validates the bottling metaphor. Cost linkage: sealing it makes the promise permanent but inaccessible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup early: "the anonymous letter chain began to drift across my routes." Shapes stakes throughout: letters are instructions, confessions, stacked-stone equivalents. Middle development: the narrator ferries them, learns their logic, internalizes "how to bottle the feeling of safety." Payoff: the threat of archival display (turning "breath...to label copy") drives the entire closure ritual. Causal pressure: without the chain, no stakes; the chain's intimacy versus museum commodification is the dominant conflict. Cost: soaking them in oil renders them unreadable to preserve them from institutional capture. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present as perceptual mode from the start: "I read the water, the gulls, the seams on a fuel drum, and the way a keeper laced his boots." Enables the narrator to notice Doyle's distress ("could not meet my eyes") and to hear "the harbor breathe." Constrains action: observation without confrontation leads to solitary ritual rather than protest. The attribute charges the closure image ("the room listened while I did the slow work of custody, and I listened back"). Tradeoff: warmth without bravery means no direct resistance, only symbolic counter-move. Two gates strong (setup, closure), middle development implicit in the accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Early thematic seed: letters are described as ways "to bottle the feeling of safety." Middle: the narrator internalizes the impulse ("I wanted to protect that feeling as I would a flame"). Closure: the entire ritual enacts protection—building stone messages, soaking letters, sealing the jar, whispering "protect this." The action redefines options: not preservation *for* use but preservation *from* use. Cost: protection here means destruction of legibility. Causally indispensable; the final image ("making a lantern that would never burn") is the action crystallized. Three gates, high causal pressure, closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced mid-story as part of letter content: "Three flat stones meant all is well, two with a wedge meant wait for me, and a single balanced odd-shaped rock meant do not risk the cove." Returns at closure: "I built a message on the floor, three flat stones and two with a wedge, and I balanced the odd one on top." The method supplies the grammar for the narrator's final act—using the stone language to encode a message alongside the sealed jar. Two beats (explanation, enactment). Specificity is high; swapping it for generic semaphore would lose the handmade, local quality. Minor cap: it does not constrain middle tactics, only frames the ending gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup early: "Up on Briar Neck, the haunted lantern room waited for me like a lung with a held breath." Middle: "After the lamp flickers out" signals the ritual window; Doyle directs "go up alone." Closure: the entire final sequence unfolds in the lantern room—darkness, tide sounds, floor ritual, jar sealing. The space constrains (isolation, after-hours access) and supplies resources (brass rung hiding spot, moonlight through panes that makes the jar glow). The room "listened" and "held the dark like warm water," charging the final image. Micro-setting that alters tactics and is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Established early as ritual condition: "I always climbed after the lamp flickers out, for that was when the island spoke truest." Recurs at closure: "After the lamp flickers out, he said, go up alone. So I went when the wick guttered and the last moth had chosen its star." The timeframe supplies permission (off-duty, unsupervised) and symbolic charge (darkness as honesty). Constrains: the act must happen in the interval when no official light burns. Not a live countdown, but a recurring threshold that the narrator uses deliberately. Two gates (setup, closure), causal contribution moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced via the letter-writers: "to bottle the feeling of safety, and then open it when the weather minded to break you." The narrator adopts it: "I wanted to protect that feeling as I would a flame." Closure friction: automation threatens to turn bottled safety into "label copy." The final ritual dramatizes the motivation—seal the jar so the feeling cannot be museumified, even at the cost of making it unreadable. Friction is visible: protecting safety here means *not* opening it again. Cost on the page: "I could not keep the tower from emptying, but I could keep its promise from being put under glass." Three gates, charged by conflict, shapes the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Established in the opening metaphor ("lights die...in a hush that brightens what it leaves behind") and sustained throughout: sea glass "green as old hunger," letters "salted with lullabies," the jar "glowing with a luminescent ache." The tone modulates with pressure—warm observation, quiet farewell, ritual solemnity—without breaking into sentimentality or overstatement. Charges the final image: "the whole thing glowed with a luminescent ache" and the whispered "protect this." Coherent through turns; the ache is both loss (automation, goodbye) and glow (preserved intimacy). Diction and rhythm maintain the tone under stress. Indispensable to the piece's atmosphere and thematic closure.</comment>
