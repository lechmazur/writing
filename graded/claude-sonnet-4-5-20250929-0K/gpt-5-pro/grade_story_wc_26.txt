<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's role as "dusk noticer" is rendered through concrete ritual (shelving dreams, screening footage) with clear interiority around the shadow's yearning. The choice to inscribe the donor's name and bind the book carries visible cost—committing attention and witness—but the action feels more like fulfillment of a cataloging duty than a decision that narrows competing options. Embodied emotion is present ("I feel the weak thrum…") yet occasionally drifts into label-speak ("luminous regret"). The shadow's arc from hunger to "bound to kindness" reads as transformation, though the protagonist's own stakes remain stable throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (blooming library, returning stone, silent reels) and accumulates density through the shadow's gradual remembering. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening lines (library above clouds, dusk, narrator's role). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the shadow settles, the book takes root, and the narrator's posture—"keeper of dusk, smiling with luminous regret that still chooses dawn"—crystallizes a stance with conceptual cost (endurance, witness). The cost is legible in the final image's charged poise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone circuit closes and the shadow pours its yearning; the floor tilts, pressure accumulates, and the resolution reweights hope as "a shelf that flowers…provided someone waters it with memory and witness."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blooming library is rendered through tactile, specific detail: petals that open/close, spines budding flowers, pollen of letters, cloud floor that shifts. The river stone constrains the final choice—its mica and warmth become the circuit that enables the shadow's remembering and the book's inlaying. The western window recurs as spatial anchor and the stone's placement there matters at closure. Sensory detail (paper, ozone, far thunder) is filtered through the narrator's curatorial attention, and the setting's vertical precariousness ("the heights billow and forget the ground") charges the stakes of witness and tether.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving the shape of hope by cataloging an irreplaceable, unreturned dream eaten by shadows. The pressure is situational and accumulative—the shadow's hunger and the narrator's method (comparing footage, offering the stone) tighten when "it pours its yearning into my open hands." Agency is enacted through witness and inscription; the narrator does not merely observe but shelves, inscribes, and splices, foreclosing the shadow's drift. The cost is visible: time, attention, and the risk of the library tilting. One meaningful deepening occurs in the stone-circuit moment; escalation under the accumulative lens is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—hope as a flowering shelf watered by memory and witness—emerges from concrete action (shelving bowls of night, screening reels, inlaying the stone) without thesis statement. The river stone recurs with shifting meaning: tether, address, circuit, and finally root. The final image offers a resonant answer: "this one settles, and the films brighten as if moths decided to become lanterns…smiling with luminous regret that still chooses dawn." Subtext operates in the shadow's flickering memories and the narrator's held breath. The piece resists tidy morals; grief drifts or settles depending on the quality of attention given.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "what the light forgets," shelves with "softly deliberate" steps, and filters setting through curatorial attention (catalog tones, pollen of letters). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("where day loosens its buckle," "gathers courage from my held breath") without register drift. No dialogue; the shadow "wants to speak, but cannot," which fits the atmospheric design. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator infers the shadow's memory through imagery rather than claiming certainty. Minor density in figurative language occasionally stacks (e.g., "gathered glints…dusk…courage" in one line) but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between declarative anchors ("I shelve them") and lyric constructions ("Some say shadows only mimic"). Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character method, or the shadow's arc. Minor template cadence appears in the "gathers…gathers…gathers" triplet and "where day loosens…where the shadow bows" parallelism, but these read as intentional lyric pattern rather than scaffold. One paraphrase loop: "what it wants is not escape; what it wants is to preserve the shape of hope" restates without added pressure. Figurative language is dense in peak beats (stone circuit, pollen of letters, moths/lanterns) but remains coherent. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination—silent film comparison as method, blooming library above clouds, shadow metamorphosis via witness—feels specific and non-obvious. The river stone as tether and circuit, the mica-lit remembering, and the book taking root beside the western window are particular to this narrator and world. The premise (a library that catalogues dreams after they become shareable) is fresh but the story commits fully to its implications: unreturned dreams, shadow hunger, the work of witness. Transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would gut the curatorial logic and the library's vertical precariousness. The ending's image—moths deciding to become lanterns—synthesizes the piece's materials (light, dusk, witness) into a final beat that feels earned rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" is present throughout as the narrator's role and perceptual filter. Setup: opened by the first line. Development: the narrator shelves dreams, screens footage, and lays the stone beside the shadow's memory. Payoff: the final stance—"keeper of dusk, smiling with luminous regret that still chooses dawn"—reprises the role with reweighted meaning. Causal pressure: the narrator's method of witness (screening, inscribing, splicing) enables the shadow's settling. However, the narrator's choices feel more like ritual fulfillment than high-friction decision points; the stakes are situational and accumulative rather than decisively narrowed by competing options. Two beats (screening, inscribing) plus closure participation; the cost is conceptual (endurance, attention) rather than a visible forfeiture of alternatives.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("I keep a river stone there") with specificity (smoothed, mica-marked). Development: the stone is "my weight against departure, my tether"; the shadow eyes it, the narrator lays it beside the footage hand's stone, closing a circuit. Payoff: "I inscribe a new spine…then inlay the river stone into its bark." Three distinct beats; the stone enables the shadow's remembering and anchors the final transformation. Causal pressure: the stone's warmth and mica constrain the shadow's metamorphosis. Cost: the narrator relinquishes the personal tether to root the book. High irreplaceability; the mica and tactile warmth are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "An unreturned dream had been eaten by shadows before exiting the tower" and "The last such shadow comes to watch me." Development: the shadow's hunger, its flickering remembering, and the narrator's soothing method (screening, offering the stone) are shaped by the concept of a shadow unbound. Payoff: "the shadow bows and is finally bound to kindness, not to absence." The concept drives the central stake (cataloging an irreplaceable loss, binding the shadow through witness). Causal pressure: the shadow's unbound state creates the problem; binding it via memory and the stone's circuit resolves it. Two beats plus closure; the cost is the narrator's sustained attention and the library's tilt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "My steps are softly deliberate" appears early. Development: the trait recurs in description ("I answer with my posture, softly deliberate") but does not clearly constrain a tactical choice under pressure. Payoff: the final posture—"keeper of dusk…softly deliberate, my palms still warmed"—reprises the trait with reweighted meaning. The attribute reads as characterization (slow, careful witness) but functions more as tone and voice signature than as a decision-shaping constraint. No visible tradeoff where haste would have yielded a different outcome. Lyric reprise present; one beat involvement (posture answer); closure linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "I have watched them metamorphose when given a cradle of attention." Development: the shadow gathers glints, dusk, courage, and "piece by wandering piece, it remembers a name"; metamorphosis occurs on the page through the narrator's witness and the stone's circuit. Payoff: the shadow "is finally bound to kindness" and the book takes root. The action is central to the ending's transformation and could not be swapped with minor edits; "settles" or "calms" would lack the generative, becoming quality. Two beats plus closure; causal pressure high; the metamorphosis redefines the shadow's state and the narrator's method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "I try to learn who it once was by comparing silent video footage from decades apart." Development: the reels show recurring faces, the girl with the river stone, the trembling hand at the hospital window; the narrator pauses frames and lays the stone beside theirs. Payoff: "I return to the reels and splice a single thread of them into the cataloged dream." The method shapes two beats (screening, splicing) and enables the shadow's remembering. Mechanics are signaled (reels, frames, pause, splice) and matter. However, the method could be replaced with other memory-comparison techniques without breaking the story's core logic; it is specific but not strictly indispensable. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "The blooming library above clouds opened its petals at dawn." Development: the library's vertical precariousness ("the heights billow and forget the ground"), the western window where the stone rests, the catalog's chime, the floor of cloud that shifts, and the library that "tilts" under pressure all constrain the narrator's tether and witness. Payoff: "the clouds lean in, curious how a library can protect the living." The setting supplies resources (shelves, catalog, reels, window) and pressures (altitude, tilt) that affect the narrator's choices. Micro-setting (the stone's placement at the western window) charges the final image. Three beats; causal pressure moderate to high; irreplaceability strong (the cloud-borne verticality matters).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "After dreams become shareable, patrons leave their ringed bowls of night on the returns desk." The timeframe is signaled early and establishes the world logic (dreams as loans, shadow hunger as consequence). Development: the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; the narrator's work unfolds in a single dusk without a live clock that alters moves. Payoff: the concept of shareable dreams frames the closure but does not directly participate in it. The timeframe is more world-building premise than tactical constraint. One beat (setup); closure linkage conceptual; no visible cost tied to time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: implied early ("listen for what the light forgets") and made explicit mid-piece: "What it wants is not escape; what it wants is to preserve the shape of hope." Development: the desire is dramatized through the narrator's shelving, screening, inscribing, and the shadow's pouring of yearning. Payoff: "Hope, here, is a shelf that flowers even in winter, provided someone waters it with memory and witness." The motivation drives the dominant stake and is enacted with visible cost (attention, endurance, the risk of the library tilting). Friction exists between the shadow's hunger (loss) and the narrator's preservation (witness as watering). Three beats; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "the catalog chimed a tone of luminous regret" signals the tone early. Development: the tone modulates through the shadow's flickering, the narrator's held breath, and the "weak thrum" of remembered piano, then lifts slightly as "the films brighten as if moths decided to become lanterns." Payoff: "I…see my own outline…smiling with luminous regret that still chooses dawn." The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image; regret coexists with choice, grounding the accumulative pressure. The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Two distinct beats plus closure; specificity high (luminous + regret + choosing dawn integrates all three); cost felt in the endurance required to hold the stance.</comment>
