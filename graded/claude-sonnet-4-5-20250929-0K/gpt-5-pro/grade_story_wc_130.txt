<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—setting glass eyes on stone, tracing triangles with wire—showing embodied pursuit of an impossible goal. The ambiguous loss of the apprentice drives motivation consistently, and the final stance (grief as practice, counting as touch) is earned through accumulated particulars. However, the apprentice's refractive figure lacks sufficient grounding in prior causality; the appearance reads more as symbolic gift than dramatized consequence of the protagonist's method, weakening the sense that internal contradiction compelled this exact outcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates particulars (drips, reflections, equations, the mosaic stone) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist accepts continuity with the unfinished as "scaffold" rather than solution, a stance crystallized with visible cost (the apprentice remains refraction, not body). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines. The one meaningful deepening occurs when the stalactites slow and the refracted figure appears, reweighting the protagonist's practice from search into sustained co-presence. Cost is legible: the protagonist must hold grief as ongoing practice, not resolved proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly particular—stalactite drips as tempo, mosaic stepping stone as instrument, root-black water—and these details constrain the protagonist's method throughout. The glass eyes' convex reflections and the mosaic's chipped triangles are handled multiple times and charge the final image (chalk-and-salt fruit, dripping calculus). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting functions as micro-environment whose elements (stone, drip, reflection) alter tactics and enable the closure moment, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to understand emotion's arithmetic and thereby touch what remains of the apprentice. Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's repeated tuning actions (placing eyes, tracing wire, counting, humming) until the stalactites slow and the refracted figure appears—a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The cost is visible: the protagonist must relinquish hope of proof and accept "unfinished" as partner. Agency is present (aligning cracks, breathing with drips) but the apprentice's arrival reads more as the orchard's mercy than as consequence of a final choice the protagonist makes under peak pressure, keeping escalation from the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: joy as expansion, sorrow as contraction, love as ratio of breath and waiting. The protagonist's realization—"mathematics of emotion is not a solution but a scaffold"—is earned by the entire sequence of tuning, not stated abstractly. The final image (chalk-and-salt fruit, hands learning to rest) reweights the opening ambiguous loss without moralizing. The orchard's "slow calculus" and the protagonist's theorem-as-lullaby marry grief with method in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric-precise diction ("theorem unfinished," "a line we can carry together"), compression taught early and sustained. POV distance is stable; the protagonist's perceptual signature prioritizes pattern and number without clinical coldness. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives during the tuning sequence, longer cadences at closure. Minor density: some lines ("ambiguous loss, the kind that leaves a chair…") edge toward authorial gloss rather than filtered perception, but the effect remains voice-motivated and does not break focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve image, character, or pressure. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("equations went feral," "theorem unfinished"). A handful of lines repeat concepts across adjacent beats without added pressure: "secretive conjurer, gently inventive by necessity" closely mirrors "I work via the chipped patterns" in function; "I ask the figure to stay, but I ask the orchard to speak" and the subsequent "compromise" restate the same moment. Template cadence appears in the mid-section with repeated "I [verb], I [verb]" constructions. These warrant a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for paraphrase and template patterns, but the closure beat itself remains clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of taxidermy, cave-orchard setting, and emotional mathematics is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "ambiguous loss" into a method (glass eyes as listeners, mosaic as instrument) reads fresh. The lyric-technical register and the choice to render the apprentice as refraction rather than ghost avoid stock resolutions. Risk-taking—dense compression, no conventional dialogue, extended metaphor held across the entire piece—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a +0.3 adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Secretive conjurer is present throughout. The protagonist's choices—placing the eyes, tracing wire, humming to tune the orchard—drive middle beats. The final action (speaking the theorem as lullaby, holding the eyes without blinking) participates in closure. Early signal, two distinct beats, closure linkage present. The trait "secretive" remains more label than constraint; "conjurer" shapes method but could swap for "practitioner" with minor edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass eyes appear early, are placed on the stone, reflect drips and cracks, and are held without blinking at closure—three functionally distinct beats. They enable the protagonist's method (watching reflections, tracing correspondences) and charge the final image. Specificity is strong: taxidermist's glass eyes "catching stalactite drips like fallen stars" and their "convex silence" are irreplaceable details. Causal pressure and closure linkage both present. Cost connection is implicit but legible: the protagonist must trust non-living eyes to "listen."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss frames the entire stake from the opening ("a chair at the table and a phantom heartbeat in the pillow") and drives every beat: collecting instruments, tuning the eyes, tracing patterns to dovetail "what remains of touch with what remains of number." The final realization—"allow the unfinished to remain a partner"—directly addresses and reconfigures the ambiguous loss with visible cost (the apprentice stays refraction, not body). The concept is indispensable; removing it collapses motivation, method, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is signaled early ("gently inventive by necessity, because secrecy softens…") but remains more thematic claim than on-page constraint. The protagonist's actions—setting eyes, tracing wire, humming—read as methodical and patient, consistent with "gentle," but no beat shows the trait enabling or foreclosing a tactical choice with visible cost. The trait colors voice but does not drive a turn. Present in setup, absent in middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears twice: first as aim ("to dovetail what remains of touch with what remains of number"), then as realized action ("dovetailing the drip tempo with memory's inconvenient rhythms" and the final command "dovetail grief with practice"). The action defines the protagonist's method across multiple beats and participates in closure. Swappability test: replacing "dovetail" with "align" or "marry" would preserve function, limiting irreplaceability. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone is introduced early, used as the surface on which the eyes are placed, and its chipped patterns are traced with wire to align cracks with constellations. It appears in at least two beats and enables the protagonist's method. The final image references "the stone reflects the orchard" in tessellations. Setup, middle development, and closure participation all present. Specificity is moderate: the stone's chipped triangles matter, but "mosaic" could swap for "marked" or "inscribed" stone with minor edits, capping score below high band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites is established immediately and dominates every beat: drips provide tempo, stalactites answer the protagonist's hum, root-black water reflects the eyes, the orchard "leans closer" and "gifts" the fruit. The setting constrains method (must be sung for the orchard to accept measurement) and charges closure ("orchard murmurs its slow calculus"). Irreplaceable: no other setting could supply this combination of acoustic resonance, mineral patience, and subterranean enclosure. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and high specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" frames the opening but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time across beats. The timeframe establishes nocturnal mood and signals a ritual window, but no clock pressure alters tactics. The protagonist works without visible deadline; the stalactites "slow their dripping" as response, not timer. Setup present; middle development and closure participation absent. Functional but replaceable with "at night" or "in the quiet hours."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To understand the mathematics of emotion is stated early and dramatized throughout: collecting instruments, reading reflections as equations, tracing correspondences (joy/expansion, sorrow/contraction, longing/oscillation), and finally realizing "mathematics of emotion is not a solution but a scaffold." The desire drives every choice and is tested against the cost of accepting the apprentice as refraction, not proof. Friction between want (to solve, to retrieve) and acceptance (to hold the unfinished) charges closure. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Buried optimism is coherent and modulates with pressure: the protagonist's method is patient and hopeful despite ambiguous loss, grief "softens in the echoing dark," and the final images—chalk-and-salt fruit, "a continuity, a buried optimism, a line we can carry together"—articulate hope embedded in endurance rather than resolution. The tone charges the final image and distinguishes this piece from despair or detachment. It does not shift dramatically but deepens across beats, fitting Accumulative design. Present throughout, purposeful at closure.</comment>
