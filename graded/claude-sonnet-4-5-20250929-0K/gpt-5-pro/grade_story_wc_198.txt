<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The saxophonist's interiority is atmospheric but largely contemplative rather than contradictory; we see a sustained meditative stance shaped by past teaching, but few micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing impulses in scene. The embodied fog-breath metaphor and the weight of the "vested hush" garment are vivid, yet the protagonist enacts a predetermined ritual more than wrestles with live options. Motivation is signaled early (hush the prophecy) and the protagonist's renunciation of sound feels earned by teacher lore, but the choice to return next season reads as acceptance rather than a forfeiture with visible internal cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates fog, drip-code, and negative-space imagery toward a final reconfiguration where the prophecy "stutters" and the protagonist packs the horn, earning a resonant reprieve until next season (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise undertone). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening stanzas; the grotto setting and dawn timeframe are clear. One meaningful deepening occurs when the code "implicates me by name" and the protagonist counters with "absence," narrowing the prophecy's consonants into harmless bubbles. Cost is legible in the vesper-mark line ("work done when no one watched") and the commitment to return, foreclosing applause and ease. No causality breaks; the ritualistic structure fits the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, and atrium prism are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: stalactites tap sequences, droplets adopt the protagonist's tempo, ferns lean as if reading negative beat. These environmental elements constrain the protagonist's tactic (playing silence into the atrium's geometry to trap the code) and charge the final image where "droplets keep my tempo without me." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—fog nests in chest, keys are "moon scales," pads "sealed eyelids"—filtered through a musician's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent, performance, and departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush the prophecy to save town/river/child) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the code climbs stalactites and names the protagonist, forcing the shift from note to "absence" and the whisper-without-tone oval that stutters the prophecy. Agency is renunciation and technical mastery (negative space, vested hush) rather than confrontation; the prophecy "will nap until next season," foreclosing false victory but earning a reprieve with the cost of eternal vigilance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through密ening fog, code resistance, and the atrium's responsive geometry, culminating in the droplets' autonomous continuation of the tempo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-action and refusal-as-protection emerges organically from the teacher's lesson, the protagonist's remembered temptation ("I nearly answered the code and almost lost my name"), and the final image of carrying "the empty frame home." The vesper mark and "work done when no one watched" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to stewardship without applause. Subtext operates in the fog-as-breath metaphor, the "vested hush" garment, and the prophecy's vowels nibbled into bubbles. No overt moralizing; the ending reweights prior material (first lesson, fear of the code) through the image of droplets keeping tempo and the grotto "keeping the rest."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with a stable, poetic register: "I came before dawn, a morning fog saxophonist with breath borrowed from sleeping reeds." Perceptual signature is musician-specific (keys as moon scales, pads as eyelids, playing through negative space). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in peak beats ("the code licks my ears"), wider in reflective passages. Diction remains within the narrator's lyric-technical lexicon; no head-hopping. The extended poetic compression is taught early and sustained, with heightened figurative density that serves atmospheric pressure rather than obscuring causality. Occasional filter verbs ("I feel the vested hush settle") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are vivid and purposeful: "breath borrowed from sleeping reeds," "a throat of stone and light," "oval fits the atrium's prism." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, action, or theme. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating cumulative density that occasionally slows propulsion in the middle third (e.g., "ferns silvered by drip, their filigree trembling with bright caution" stacks metaphor without altering stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor friction: the extended poetic mode risks overwriting in a few beats where a simpler anchor would sharpen clarity, but the closure image ("hear only water remembering how to fall") remains clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of musician-as-ritual-protector, sound-as-danger, and silence-as-weapon is fresh and non-obvious; the "vested hush" concept and playing through negative space are specific to this world and voice. The grotto-as-instrument and the prophecy's vowels becoming fish food are memorable inflections. Risk-taking in sustained poetic register and the choice to enact a quiet, cyclical victory rather than a dramatic confrontation heighten thematic stakes. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact particulars (saxophonist, atrium prism, dewdrop alphabet). No close echoes of famous lines; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The saxophonist protagonist is present throughout and makes key choices: assembling the sax, breathing fog, whispering notes of absence, guiding silence, and packing the horn. These decisions drive the two major beats (answering the code's implication, whisper-without-tone) and shape the ending (departure with the empty frame, commitment to return). Setup is immediate; development constrains middle action (answer with absence); payoff anchors the closure (packing the horn, vesper mark). The character's agency is renunciation and technique rather than confrontation, but the choices redefine options and earn the reprieve. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable voice and perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in multiple beats: it "catches" the first note and splits it into ribbons, the protagonist fits the whisper-oval to the atrium's geometry, and the atrium dims with a blessing beam at the end. Setup is early (paragraph 6); development shows the atrium as a functional constraint (the oval must fit its prism to fold the prophecy); payoff is visual (beam on floor, droplets continuing tempo). However, the atrium is largely passive—a container rather than an active tool. The mist is more causally integral (fog nests in chest, droplets adopt tempo). Swappability is moderate; another resonant enclosure could substitute with edits. Two-beat involvement and closure presence elevate the score, but causal pressure is weaker than for the fog or the horn itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "vested hush" concept is signaled early (teacher's lesson, paragraph 11), operationalized in the middle beats ("I feel the vested hush settle across my shoulders," "the hush is not absence, but a clasp"), and drives the ending where "the hush stays vested" and the grotto keeps the prophecy silent. It shapes tactics: the protagonist wears the hush as a garment that melts the prophecy's teeth, guiding silence rather than playing sound. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Strong causal pressure (the hush is the mechanism that traps the code) and closure linkage (final line). Specificity is high; no near-synonym fits. Cost is tied to the concept: the protagonist carries the burden of return and vigilance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" appears twice: in the opening ("quietly vivid yet careful not to break anything") and near the end ("a quietly vivid ledger of mercy"). The trait describes the dawn's breath and the mercy-ledger, framing the protagonist's restrained, careful approach. It modulates tone but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. Setup is present; thematic echo at closure reweights the opening, but no middle development beat where the trait enables or limits a choice. Lyric reprise pattern is purposeful and charges the final third, yet the attribute functions more as atmospheric descriptor than causal lever. Mid-band fit: shapes mood and thematic resonance without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whispering is the protagonist's primary action: "whisper a note that is mostly air and old memory" (first attempt), "I answer with absence" (second, pivotal beat where absence is voiced), "I whisper once more, but now I whisper without tone, shaping only breath in a careful oval" (climactic move that stutters the prophecy), and the final image where "my whisper will ride the fog back to town." Setup is mid-early (paragraph 18); development shapes two major beats (note of air/memory, then absence, then breath-oval); payoff defines closure (the oval folds the prophecy, whisper rides home). Strong causal pressure: the whisper method is irreplaceable and drives the resolution. Cost is legible in the effort and the vesper mark. High integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through negative space" is taught by the teacher's lesson (paragraph 10: "play through negative space, where shape comes from what you refuse") and operationalized in the climactic beat: "I answer with absence, proving the beat by removing it, turning the groove inside out. What remains is not a song but a frame, a contour where the prophecy cannot settle." The method shapes tactics throughout (guiding silence, creating the frame) and the final image ("I carry the empty frame home"). Setup is early; development constrains the protagonist's approach (must refuse sound to trap the code); payoff is the frame that holds the prophecy at bay. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; the method is the story's mechanical heart. Cost is tied to the discipline and the renunciation of applause.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The radiant grotto in mist is the singular setting, introduced immediately ("path led down into a radiant grotto in mist, a throat of stone and light") and active across all beats. It supplies the atrium prism, stalactites that the code taps, the pool where vowels spill, ferns that lean, and the droplets that adopt the protagonist's tempo. The grotto "listens" and "sighs," functioning as a responsive environment that constrains and enables the protagonist's performance. Setup is immediate; development shows the grotto as a living instrument (stone pores opening, mist becoming cathedral); payoff anchors closure (grotto keeps the rest, protagonist departs). High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage. The grotto is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"As dewdrops form" appears in the opening line and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("I will return then, as dewdrops form"). The timeframe signals dawn and a recurring ritual cycle, framing the protagonist's seasonal vigilance. Setup is immediate; thematic reprise at closure reweights the opening, establishing the cyclical burden. However, no middle beat where the dewdrop clock tightens a choice or alters tactics on the page. The time anchor orients but does not escalate pressure within this single visit. Lyric bracket pattern charges the ending with the cost of return, elevating the score into the mid-6s, but functional involvement remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to hush a prophecy spoken in code" is signaled in the opening ("I came to hush a prophecy spoken in code") and drives every beat: assembling the sax to counter the code, answering its implication with absence, whispering the breath-oval to stutter its consonants, and packing the horn with the knowledge of next season's return. The prophecy's threats (town forgetting its name, river drying, child unmade) establish stakes; the protagonist's remembered temptation ("I nearly answered the code and almost lost my name") adds internal friction. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Strong causal pressure: the motivation shapes all choices and the ending commitment. Cost is visible in the vesper mark and eternal return. High integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Eerie nostalgia" is established early ("Eerie nostalgia lingers here, the memory of my first lesson cut into the rock by silence") and modulates through the piece: eerie in the code's patient licking and the grotto's responsive listening, nostalgic in the teacher's remembered lesson and the protagonist's near-loss of name. The tone coheres through turns (code resistance, whisper-oval climax) and charges the final image ("the grotto keeps the rest," "I remember, too, the night I nearly answered"). Setup is early; development sustains the dual mood under pressure; payoff anchors closure with the memory of work done unseen and the commitment to return. The tone shapes reader experience and thematic weight without explicit statement. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
