<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is coherent (discovering "the texture of time") and drives the choice to pry the halo fragment free and eventually relinquish it. Interiority is often concrete ("I told myself to quit touching the past") and the final renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost (photographs bleach to blankness, the shard disintegrates). However, the character's internal contradiction—building the maze to touch duration "without breaking it" yet also being "retrocognitively trapped"—could be more embodied in micro-choices during peak beats rather than retrospectively narrated. The emotional arc from pretense ("pretending not to remember") to acceptance reads as earned, though some reflection edges toward label-speak ("touch the grain of duration").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (nursery beds, frost lace, ghostly willow) and the closure reconfigures meaning when the halo shard disintegrates into the cambium and the photographs clear to "unmarked snow." The protagonist's agency (prying the fragment, setting it on cambium, speaking the vow) drives the final reconfiguration with visible cost (loss of photographic memory, dust hum). Orientation anchors are delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after "living bridge garden" and "hedge maze designer"—but the pattern is taught and the effect functional. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragment is freed and retrocognition floods the garden, narrowing the protagonist's options to a single ritual path; the closure lands with felt cost (photographs blanch, fragment disintegrates, echo remains).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly specific (roots "thick as torsos," willow chamber "ribbed and furred") and constrains the protagonist's movement across hyperbolic paths that "multiply like coral." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through professional attention (hedge maze designer noting "negative space," "cambium kept slick and new"). The halo fragment and photographs function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image: the fragment's disintegration into cambium and the photographs' bleaching are tactile, present actions that reweight the closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the garden's recursive design, and the setting's breath and pulse embody the story's central stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—touching time's texture without breaking it—is signaled early ("brief asked me to grow a maze that would not end") and tightens once when the protagonist frees the halo fragment, triggering retrocognitive trapping that narrows options to ritual relinquishment. The protagonist's agency (prying, carrying, setting the fragment, vowing aloud) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: photographs fade "faster, as if the garden were reclaiming its own light," and the fragment disintegrates with a hum, leaving only an afterimage. However, the middle section's recursive crossings feel more textural than pressure-increasing, and the final choice (setting the fragment on cambium) arrives with less friction than the setup promises.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the maze's hyperbolic geometry, the disintegrating photographs, the halo fragment's ritual release. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—"not a clock but a felt pattern, an inward weave"—that reweights the brief's "Timeframe: None" without stating a moral. The protagonist's arc (builder seeking to map time → accepting unmappable duration) is inextricable from the thematic question. Subtext operates in image and silence: "I told the maze what I had never said aloud" dramatizes confession without exposition, and the photographs' clearing to "unmarked snow" implies loss-as-opening. Minor slip: "furrow where new knowing could take root" edges toward abstract philosophizing in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "cambium kept slick and new" and "birds nested above and beneath at once," details filtered through professional and temporal obsession. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("quaking reverie," "mylar ghosts," "gill") with voice modulating under pressure (shorter clauses when the fragment pulses, longer when reflecting). One brief register slip: "retrocognitively trapped" feels clinical amid otherwise lyric phrasing, though it recovers quickly. No dialogue is present; focalization remains clean throughout, and the prose rhythm matches emotional intensity (breath-held syntax during the fragment's release, steadier cadence at closure).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot ("frost stenciled lace on the leaves and my breath made tiny planets" does triple duty). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled ("coral," "lung of green shadow," "ink dropped into water"). However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs lower the score: "It used to crown...the bronze body eaten...the circle split" repeats structure without added pressure; "I was retrocognitively trapped, not in a single past but in the garden's entire rehearsal" restates the same idea across clauses. The phrase "quaking reverie" in the middle echoes the tone element without advancing scene work. No grammar errors; clarity remains high despite lyric compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hedge-maze design, hyperbolic geometry, retrocognition, and disintegrating photographs feels specific and non-obvious; the premise (a maze to map time) transforms familiar garden-as-memory tropes through the halo fragment's ritual physics and the photographs' material agency. The protagonist's occupation (maze designer) is integral, not ornamental, shaping the vocabulary and spatial logic. Risk-taking (non-linear time, recursive crossings, lyric compression) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity. One proximity concern: the willow chamber "ribbed and furred, a lung of green shadow" evokes common organic-architecture imagery, though the execution remains fresh. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications (photographs must fade if the garden reclaims light) without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hedge maze designer's professional lens filters all perception (hyperbolic geometry, negative space, cambium), frames the initial problem (brief for an endless maze), and drives key choices: prying the fragment free, consulting fading blueprints, setting the fragment on cambium, and vowing aloud to the maze. Occupation shapes the final insight ("inward weave" rather than "clock") and the protagonist's stance (builder accepting unmappable duration). Early signal in paragraph one, middle beat (freeing the fragment), and closure participation (ritual relinquishment and profession-specific language in the final image). Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability is high (generic roles would not yield this vocabulary or these tactics).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The halo fragment is handled in multiple beats: discovered lodged in bark, pried free (triggering retrocognitive flood), carried as "lodestone" through recursive paths, set on cambium plate, and disintegrates into dust that sinks and leaves a gill-shaped afterimage. Each use narrows options or reweights meaning: freeing it traps the protagonist, carrying it guides navigation, releasing it clears the photographs and steadies the garden's breath. Early signal (paragraph six), middle pressure (lodestone function), and decisive closure participation (disintegration and afterimage). Specificity is high (warmth, pulse, dust hum, steadiness rather than light); cost is visible (fragment's destruction, photographs' blanching).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fading photographs shape stakes and tactics: protagonist consults them for bearings, watches them lose details (shadow, trellis, bootprint) as retrocognition intensifies, and finally sees them clear to unmarked paper at closure. The concept is dramatized on the page (not merely thematic) and its mechanics matter: photographs "fade faster" when the protagonist touches the past, and their final clearing signals the garden's reclaiming of light and the protagonist's acceptance. Early signal (paragraph four), middle constraint (losing navigational aid), and closure participation (clearing to snow). However, the photographs' agency is somewhat passive—they record loss rather than driving a difficult choice—lowering the causal pressure score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is label-introduced but then dramatized: the protagonist crosses bridges that "remembered a different crossing" and each footfall "braided with...another, earlier footfall," forcing navigation through the garden's "entire rehearsal of itself." The trait constrains tactics (protagonist must follow "negative curves" traced by blueprints and use the fragment as lodestone) and the cost is visible (disorientation, accelerated photograph fading). Present in setup (paragraph eight), middle navigation, and indirectly at closure (the garden's "tenderness of echo" remains after release). However, the label itself ("retrocognitively trapped") reads clinical and is not revisited; the dramatization does the work, lowering the score slightly for ornamental labeling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" drives the major turn: the halo fragment disintegrates into dust "so fine it hummed," sinking into cambium and releasing the protagonist from retrocognitive recursion. This action is irreplaceable—no synonym (dissolve, vanish) carries the material specificity of dust and hum. The disintegration redefines options (photographs clear, bridges no longer double, protagonist can walk out "once") and charges the final image (gill-shaped afterimage in bark). Present in the climax paragraph, with visible cost (fragment's destruction, garden's steadying, loss of navigational anchor). Early mention in title concept preparation (photographs "disintegrate like ash") primes the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early ("I tuned my diagrams through hyperbolic geometry, curving hedges into negative space until paths multiplied like coral") and the protagonist later follows "the negative curves my blueprints once traced." The method matters: it creates the maze's recursive structure ("paths multiplied," junctions "refused Euclid") that traps and then releases the protagonist. However, the mechanics are more atmospheric than tactical—no on-page moment shows the protagonist actively using geometric principles to navigate or solve a problem during the retrocognitive crisis. Present in setup and referenced at midpoint, but not leveraged in the peak choice, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden supplies resources (roots as lodestone guides, willow chamber as ritual space, cambium plate as receiving surface), constrains movement (paths multiply, bridges double themselves), and charges the final image (gill afterimage in bark, root-ribbed arch carrying "once"). Micro-setting elements (fragment lodged in bark, cambium "slick and new," birds nesting "above and beneath at once") are tactile and alter tactics. Early signal (paragraph one), middle constraint (recursive crossings), and decisive closure participation (cambium plate, final arch walk). Specificity is high (roots "thick as torsos," chamber "ribbed and furred"); irreplaceability is strong (generic garden would not support this resolution).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Timeframe is specified as "None" in the required elements list.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is dramatized through choices: returning to the garden, prying the fragment free, consulting fading photographs, and finally relinquishing the fragment to "touch the grain of duration without breaking it." The motivation is conflicted—protagonist built the maze to map time yet is trapped by its recursion—and the friction between desire and cost is visible (photographs fade, fragment disintegrates, "mylar ghosts" are surrendered). Early signal (paragraph two: "motive matched my own"), middle pressure (fragment warms and pulses "as if demanding a center"), and closure linkage (vow and release). However, the phrasing edges toward abstraction ("texture," "grain of duration") where more embodied stakes would sharpen the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: lyric and contemplative in setup ("hedges here breathe, braid, and remember"), tightens during retrocognitive crisis (shorter clauses, "quaking reverie," "hammered the leaves"), and softens at closure ("tenderness of echo remained," "carried me once"). The tone charges the final image: "not a clock but a felt pattern, an inward weave" extends the quaking-reverie idiom into resolution. Diction (mylar ghosts, cambium lung, gill afterimage) sustains the tone across beats. One minor slip: "quaking reverie" is named mid-text rather than purely embodied, reading slightly self-aware, though it recovers in the atmospheric work.</comment>
