<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly specific ("tongue heavy, the day I could have said I am sorry and did not") and embodied through ritual with the bonsai and compass. The protagonist demonstrates clear agency—crushing berries, performing cuts, speaking to the tide—in service of reconciliation. Minor deduction: Mara remains a construct of memory without contradiction or flaws that would complicate the narrator's idealizing lens; the severance feels one-sided. The ending crystallizes renunciation and acceptance with visible cost (walking away "slowly," relinquishing control).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through ritual steps (unwrapping compass, crushing berries, cutting juniper, speaking to pool) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the narrator releases words "like seeds" and accepts they "might take root somewhere I would not control"). Orientation is swift (islet, after severance, bonsai tutor). Cost is felt but oblique—the final walk carries regret's weight without a sharp forfeiture. The closure image reweights prior material but stops short of a decisive change in circumstances or a conceptual repricing with undeniable stakes, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The islet setting (breezy, rain-rinsed, tidal pool cupped by black stone) supplies the ritual stage and the compass/lace/juniper function as micro-setting that constrains choices throughout. The pool's glow and the juniper's shift to cerulean physically charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (shore → pool → rock) and sensory detail (indigo berries bleeding, needles answering) is filtered through the tutor's patient craft. The environment directly enables the final act of speaking to the tide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies and voicing regret—is signaled early and pursued through escalating ritual (unwrapping, crushing, cutting, speaking). The pool's glow constitutes one meaningful tightening that narrows options to acceptance. Agency is clear: the narrator performs each step and chooses to release words rather than retrieve Mara. The cost is felt (letting go of control, accepting separation) but remains somewhat abstract; a more visceral trade-off or foreclosed option would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—regret as a way to tend rather than cut—emerges through the ritual of bonsai craft applied to apology, without meta-commentary. The final image ("regret can be a way to tend and not to cut") risks stating the thesis but is grounded in the prior action of pruning and speaking. The compass resting "inward" and seeds carried "somewhere I would not control" offer a non-literal answer with conceptual cost. Minor slip: "cerulean regret" as a phrase borders on decorative in the final line, though it does recharge the prior blue motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV; distance is stable and the voice ("slow-spoken," "rhythmically placid syllables") matches the tutor's craft-centered worldview. Perceptual signature is consistent (tools, tides, craft vocabulary). Figurative density is high but largely coherent ("grief … told to whisper," "apologies have colors"). Minor deduction: "the ache that guided my hands to diffuse what was sharp" introduces therapy-adjacent abstraction in a peak beat, and the phrase "nostalgia had gravity" leans ornamental. Purposeful compression and lyric syntax are taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm modulates well (short declaratives in the pool scene accelerate pressure). However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without clear pattern payoff ("sorrow is tuned correctly," "compass … shut its mouth like a clam," "blade's restraint," "blue … like a mood, not steam but memory"). Mixed metaphor: the pool glows "like a lighthouse … buried in it by grief and told to whisper" stacks vehicles incoherently. Template cadence in the middle third ("It told…," "And beneath…," "The notes said…") and paraphrase loops ("rhythmically placid" appears three times across the text) trigger −0.6. No major clarity breaks, but the density without white space risks fatigue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—bonsai craft as ritual for apology, instructions hidden in lace, a supernatural color as resolution—feels specific and non-obvious. The "tides of remembrance" and chromatic apology avoid prompt-template feel through grounded sensory work (crushing berries, pool glow). Risk is present in the lyric compression and metaphoric density, though the piece does not fully transform the "quest for closure after loss" template. The ending's acceptance ("regret can be a way to tend") earns the insight through prior action, avoiding platitude.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bonsai tutor's choices—crushing berries, cutting the juniper, speaking to the tide—drive all major beats and the closure turn. Early signal (paragraph 2), middle development (cutting "nearly nothing" to "redirect"), and closure participation (repeating the lesson to tree and tide) satisfy all three gates. The slow-spoken trait constrains pacing and voice throughout. Causal pressure is strong; the tutor's patient method enables the ritual and shapes the final release of words.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The compass appears in three beats: unwrapping (beat 1), trembling toward the pool (beat 2), and resting inward at closure (beat 3). Its needle's shift from hunting to resting reweights the stake ("forgiveness were a harbor hidden under the ribs"). However, its mechanics—pointing "toward a clutch of unfinished truths" and later "inward"—remain abstract and do not constrain a tactical choice. The compass is present and thematically charged but not indispensable to the ritual's logic; the lace and pool do more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "tides of remembrance" frame the story (paragraph 5, final third), and the pool's blue glow literalizes the concept. It shapes the narrator's understanding ("the water listens the way an elder prunes") and enables the closure ritual. However, the concept functions more as thematic overlay than a force that alters tactics or choices on the page. The blue color and the tide's "low blue yes" are consequences of the ritual rather than obstacles or constraints. Present across all three gates but lacks strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" is introduced early (paragraph 9: "lessons had always moved in rhythmically placid syllables"), repeated in the pool scene ("Waves sighed past the pool in even breath, rhythmically placid"), and invoked at closure ("In slow measure, rhythmically placid"). It constrains pacing and voice, but the on-page cost is minimal—the trait enables rather than complicates. The phrase borders on ornamental in its third appearance. Present in all three gates but does not force a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears once in the middle third: "I found the ache that guided my hands to diffuse what was sharp." The term gestures toward the pruning action and the broader goal of softening regret, but it is abstract and does not anchor a discrete, irreplaceable beat. The cutting action itself (paragraph 20: "I cut nearly nothing, just enough to redirect") does more causal work. "Diffuse" is functional but easily swappable with "soften," "disperse," or "ease." Lacks strong closure linkage and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lace pattern is introduced early (paragraph 8), elaborated in the middle (paragraphs 13–16: "instructions woven into an antique lace pattern, each eyelet a step, each scallop a hesitation"), and guides the ritual sequence. Its mechanics—eyelets and scallops as instructions—constrain the narrator's steps ("when to open the compass and when to let it shut"). The method shapes at least two beats (unwrapping/reading, performing the pruning) and primes closure. Strong integration; the lace is both map and heirloom, irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "breezy islet after rain" is established in the opening line and supplies the ritual stage throughout. The breeze ("wind admired the patience"), the rain's residue ("bowl of rain," "everything rinsed and awake"), and the tidal pool ("cupped by black stone") enable key beats and charge the closure image. The setting constrains choices (the narrator must carry the juniper to the pool) and the post-rain atmosphere reinforces the theme of cleansing and renewal. Present in setup, middle, and closure; setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"After the severance" frames the entire story and provides causal motivation (Mara's departure, the letter's arrival). It is signaled in the title-line (paragraph 1) and elaborated early (paragraph 11: "everything afterward became known as the severance"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—the ritual unfolds at the narrator's pace with no urgency or deadline. The "after" functions as backstory rather than a pressure device. Present in setup and middle but lacks tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the color of unspoken apologies"—is declared early (paragraph 3) and pursued through every beat: crushing berries for blue, watching the pool glow, speaking to the tide. Friction is present (the day the narrator "could have said I am sorry and did not") and the cost is felt (releasing control, accepting the words may never reach Mara). The desire drives the ritual structure and shapes the closure choice. Strong integration; the motivation is indispensable and conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 28: "winter sky held under"), repeated in the pool glow (paragraph 29: "aching cerulean"), and invoked at closure (paragraph 37: "tinged with cerulean regret"). The tone modulates from loss to acceptance and charges the final image. However, the phrase risks ornamental repetition in the final line rather than earning fresh weight. Coherent across turns and present in the ending, but the closure invocation feels slightly label-like rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
