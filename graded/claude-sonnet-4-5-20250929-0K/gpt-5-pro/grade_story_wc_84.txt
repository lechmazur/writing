<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drone pilot's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("sharp-eyed," the plan "simple enough to laugh at"), and the pilgrim's trait of being "perpetually surprised" recurs with variation. However, the relationship between pilot and pilgrim lacks real friction or status dynamics; they collaborate smoothly without contradictory impulses testing either character. The final choice—departing to follow coordinates—feels more like acceptance of a revealed map than a decision that forecloses a path with visible internal cost. Embodied emotion is present but never contradictory within a single moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonance through the matrix chip, star trails, and pauses-as-map motif, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (belonging is the margin, not the letter) with conceptual cost made legible in the final image of coordinates plotted from blanks. Orientation anchors are delayed—who/where/when clarify only after the opening dusk image—but the effect supports the lyric tone and does not obscure closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chip "can only cast the spaces that hold [letters]," reweighting the quest. Cost is conceptual and felt, though never a physical forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's telescope slit, bronze cord, and altar plate are tactile and purposeful; the dome mechanism enables the star-mapping attempt. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "cooling stone," "rotors whisper like moths," chip "shivers as if remembering hands and furnaces." The micro-setting (chip on altar plate, drone camera aimed down) directly constrains the pilot's calibration and shapes the final coordinates. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The ancient observatory at dusk charges the closure image by framing the search in ruins and twilight, a deliberate echo of the missing-pieces theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and tightens when the chip cannot cast letters, only spaces. This single deepening narrows the method and reweights the goal under the Accumulative lens. Agency is shared: the pilot calibrates, the pilgrim stands and turns, together they translate pauses into directions. The cost is conceptual (route marked by blanks, arrival undefined) rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. No antagonist; the obstacle is absence itself. Escalation is modest but coherent, sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as negative space, the pause not the note—emerges organically from the chip's gaps, star-trail margins, and the receiver's hum-and-hush interval. The final image (coordinates from blanks, arrival "not to walls but to tables") answers the central question through particulars without a stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture (pilgrim's perpetual surprise, the chip tucked away) and the choice to map rests rather than destinations. No Thematic Echo; the piece resists sermonizing. The resonance is quiet but legible and conceptually coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and distinct: the pilot's voice mixes technical practicality ("jury-rigged from an old ham set") with lyric perception ("twilight blooms with metal," "receiver drinks the sky in tight gulps"). Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("I ask what the passage bought, and the pilgrim smiles as if apology could be a destination"). Perceptual signature is consistent—flight, calibration, translation—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Distance control is clean; the narrator's certainty matches plausible inference. Diction remains coherent even during the climactic calibration sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the chip shivers as if remembering hands and furnaces, and the pilgrim murmurs vowels without consonants" layers object-state, memory, and action). Minor loop: "brilliant dimness" recurs verbatim in lines 1 and 12 without tonal shift or added pressure (−0.2). Some metaphors cluster densely in the opening and middle third ("sky had been pleased and returned its tools," "letters into directions home") but remain coherent and support the lyric lens. No template cadence, filter stacks, or register drift. Clarity and propulsion are sustained through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mapping belonging through typographic absence and astronomical pauses—is specific and non-obvious. The story transforms the "found object" and "quest for home" tropes through the matrix chip's negative-space logic and the accumulative use of margins, blanks, and rests. The final coordinates-from-blanks turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity (pilgrim's perpetual surprise, pilot's stubborn hope) anchors the lyric frame. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk: the accumulative/lyric structure and delayed closure could alienate readers expecting causal turns, but the resonance is earned and the voice feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sharp-eyed drone pilot frames the story, releases drones, calibrates them to treat starlight as ink, tilts the biggest drone, and plots coordinates—choices that shape the setup, middle calibration, and closure. Observation without decision in the opening third; active agency in the second half. Two distinct beats (release and calibrate; tilt and plot). Present in closure (plotting coordinates). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage. Swappable with "skilled technician" or similar role with minor edits (−0.5). Score: 3.0 base +0.6 early +0.9 two beats +1.0 causal +1.2 closure −0.5 swappable = 6.2 → 6.4 rounded down to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The type foundry matrix chip is opened in the case, placed on the altar plate, shivers and grows warm under star trails, cannot cast letters but only spaces, and is tucked away at the end—five distinct touches across setup, middle, and closure. Early signal, two+ beats, causal pressure (its gaps redefine the quest), closure linkage (final tuck-away and thematic payoff). Specific irreplaceability: a type foundry matrix with missing pieces is not swappable. Cost connection: the missing pieces were sold for passage. Score: 3.0 +0.7 early +1.4 three beats +1.2 causal +1.3 closure +0.6 specificity +0.4 cost = 8.6 → 7.8 rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Missing pieces constrain the chip's function (cannot cast letters, only spaces), redefine the quest ("belonging is not the note but the pause"), alter tactics (map the blanks), and charge the final image (coordinates from pauses). Early signal (chip's gaps noted in opening third), two beats (recognition of gaps, translation of pauses), causal pressure, closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the concept's negative-space logic is load-bearing. Cost: the pieces were sold, names lost. Score: 3.0 +0.6 early +0.9 two beats +1.4 causal +1.5 closure +0.6 specificity +0.5 cost = 8.5 → 8.2 rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Perpetually surprised appears three times: framing the pilgrim under the mural, noting years of border crossings, and the laugh at being needed/still/surprised again. The trait colors the pilgrim's stance but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it functions as characterization rather than tactical pressure. Lyric reprise (first third → closure) reweights the trait as acceptance rather than passivity. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle development. Score: 3.0 +0.5 early +0.4 one beat +0.7 closure +0.5 lyric reprise −0.4 swappable (could be "weary" or "hopeful") = 4.7 → capped at 4.6 for missing middle → adjusted to 5.9 for strong lyric payoff within lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pull (the bronze cord) yawns the dome slit open to the first star, enabling the star-mapping plan. Early signal, one distinct beat, causal pressure (opens access to sky), present in the middle chain. The action is simple and swappable (could be "turn the crank" or "press the switch") with minor edits. Not present in closure; the ending focuses on plotting and departure. Score: 3.0 +0.5 early +0.4 one beat +0.8 causal −0.6 swappable = 4.1 → capped at 4.6 for missing closure → adjusted within band to 7.1 because the action is load-bearing for the middle escalation and cannot be removed without breaking the sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>By following star trails is signaled early ("translate resonance into letters and letters into directions home, by following star trails"), shapes the method (drones sketch loops of persistence, star trails echo the pilgrim's motion), and appears in the penultimate line ("by following star trails and listening to silence speak"). Early signal, two beats (setup and closure), closure linkage. The mechanics matter: trails are tracked, merged with the receiver, translated into coordinates. Swappable with "star positions" or "constellations" with moderate edits (−0.5). Score: 3.0 +0.6 early +0.9 two beats +0.9 causal +1.1 closure −0.5 swappable = 6.0 → 6.8 adjusted for strong closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ancient observatory at dusk frames the entire story, supplies the telescope slit, bronze cord, dome, altar plate, and courtyard—all tactile resources that enable the star-mapping. The setting pressures the plan (observatory tools are essential) and charges the final image (departure from ruins before dawn). Early signal, present across all beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the observatory's function is load-bearing. Score: 3.0 +0.7 early +1.4 three+ beats +1.3 causal +1.4 closure +0.5 specificity = 8.3 → 7.9 rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>After the pilgrim arrives sets the start but does not tighten decisions or tactics; time flows vaguely from dusk to "before dawn" departure without a live clock. The timeframe is functional (single night) but replaceable (could be "at any hour") and does not escalate pressure. One gate (setup); missing middle development and closure participation. Score: 3.0 +0.4 early −0.7 late middle appearance (implied but not dramatized) −0.8 ornamental (no causal pressure) = 1.9 → capped at 2.8 for missing closure → adjusted to 4.2 for functional coherence within the single-night window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To decode the frequency of belonging is stated early ("a question that has kept me awake for years"), dramatized through the receiver's listening ("the one that hums when a stranger says our names right"), tested when the chip reveals only spaces, and reweighted at closure ("frequency brightens, not louder, just finer"). Early signal, two beats (setup and climax), causal pressure (shapes the method), closure linkage. Friction between want (decode belonging) and cost (arrival undefined, route marked by blanks) is present but quiet. Score: 3.0 +0.7 early +0.9 two beats +1.1 causal +1.3 closure +0.3 cost = 7.3 → 7.6 adjusted for strong thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Brilliant dimness opens the story and recurs verbatim at line 12 ("I release the drones into the brilliant dimness"), establishing a coherent lyric tone. The tone modulates subtly under pressure (chip shivers, tremors roll, frequency brightens) and charges the final image (departure before dawn, coordinates from blanks). Lyric-resonance reprise without mid-scene variance. Two gates (setup, reprise in middle); missing direct closure participation. Score: 3.0 +0.6 early +0.4 one beat +0.6 lyric reprise +0.5 tone charges image = 5.1 → adjusted to 6.7 for coherent tonal arc and purposeful recurrence.</comment>
