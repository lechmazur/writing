<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—translating bird calls, planting pods, speaking dead languages to seeds—and the veteran encounter dramatizes a credible secondary pressure with visible cost ("the scent fells him to quiet tears"). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between memorial duty and forward-looking gardening, shown through micro-choices like crushing dead reef to feed new growth. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak and grounds emotion in physicality ("wheels sainted with pollen," "green knuckles"). Motivation coheres across beats and the final renunciation of battle-noise for garden-signature feels earned by accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line ("After the reef dies, the blooming jetty at twilight becomes my station"). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pattern-taught callbacks (birds, pods, dead languages, jetty) accumulate density and the final image—"the garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise"—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in the submerged concord that "nobody signed" now proven by roots. Escalation reads as cadence shift and thematic deepening rather than causal tightening, consistent with the chosen lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the veteran's grief converts to planting action, altering the dominant stake from solitary ritual to shared restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jetty, birds, seed pods, and dead reef function as micro-setting that constrains choices: tern and gull calls direct planting locations, coral powder becomes fertilizer, the coach's leather seats "cradle seedlings." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("taste of pitch and brine," "scent walks"), and the twilight setting charges the final image by lengthening the jetty "underfoot, ferrying us into tomorrow." Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats. The recurring jetty and reef anchor both the opening and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—letting the garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early and pressure coheres through the veteran's arrival and the ongoing work against salt and failed treaty. The accumulative lens governs: escalation reads as density increase (crushed coral, pods opening, mangrove knuckles gripping) rather than causal reversal. One meaningful deepening occurs when the veteran cracks the pod and plants "where you bled," converting grief into rooted action with visible cost. Agency is renunciation and endurance: the coachman parks the coach, reads the birds, and refuses to let war's "long salt" erase the possibility of peace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—restoration as patient grammar, peace as earned sentence—emerges from particulars: dead languages spoken to pods, birds writing "paragraphs," soil as "stern about declensions." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise," reweighting the submerged concord without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the veteran's tears, the gull's "comic approval") and the piece resists tidy binaries by embedding loss (reef death, unsigned treaty) within the regenerative act. Recurrence of seeds, birds, and dead languages charges the closure without token repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I learned to listen sideways," "narrow vastness," diction saturated in maritime and liturgical registers ("rosaries," "psalm," "bollards"). Purposeful compression ("Etruscan for smoke, Akkadian for floodplain") and patterned parallelism ("Tern says iron here, gull says alkaline there") are taught early and paid off at closure. The veteran's brief dialogue ("asking fares like he once asked orders") carries voice distinction and subtext. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what the coachman can know. Elision of the treaty's literal text serves the conceptual cost at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and thematic weight ("Dead reef to feed the living shore; fallen bone to brace a sprout with remembering"). Minor repetition ("the blooming jetty at twilight" recurs in opening and near-close) is pattern-taught and charges the final image. One paraphrase loop mid-piece: "I speak dead languages to them" and "I speak again, this time in a dead port-argot" restate without added pressure, triggering −0.2. No figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors (grammar, sentence, signature) cohere across the arc. Clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman as gardener, bird-reading as planting method, dead languages as restorative grammar—feels specific and non-obvious. The veteran encounter and the submerged-concord frame resist template plotting. Diction ("gloom-hill," "wheels sainted with pollen," "green knuckles") is particular to this voice. Risk-taking in lyric compression and unconventional escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, qualifying for +0.3 within-band adjustment. The transformation test passes: changing names or setting would collapse the maritime-memorial-linguistic weave. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gloom-hill coachman makes on-page choices in at least three beats: reading bird calls to map planting sites, offering the veteran a pod, and setting pods where terns tap. These decisions alter tactics (fertilizing with crushed coral, planting where the veteran bled) and shape the closure image ("ferrying us into tomorrow"). Early signal (opening line), development (mid-piece veteran encounter), and payoff (final "drive the silence homeward") all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The collection of dried seed pods appears in multiple beats: kept in the old trunk, rattled "like rosaries," spoken to in dead languages, offered to the veteran, set where birds indicate, and opened "like quiet bells." The pods are handled across at least three distinct moments and their meaning reweights from memorial (luggage trunk past) to generative future. Early signal, development through the veteran's cracked pod with visible cost (tears), and closure participation (implicit in the final garden-signature) all present. Specificity (cipher of regiment, husk-breathed vows) strengthens integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Submerged concord is introduced early ("Submerged concord was promised in a treaty nobody signed"), recurs mid-piece ("I ask the jetty to carry this submerged concord"), and the final image implies it will "finally surface" as "wings and oars sharing a pace." The concept shapes the dominant stake (healing the battlefield) and the closure reweights it from failed treaty to rooted proof. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than as a constraint that alters on-page tactics; the coachman's methods (bird-reading, planting) do not explicitly change because of the concord's submersion. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: early seed and final reprise with felt cost place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Speaks dead languages" is signaled early ("I speak dead languages to them"), demonstrated in at least two beats (Etruscan/Akkadian/Latin to seeds, port-argot to the jetty planks), and enables the climactic moment with the veteran (offering a pod "stamped with the cipher of his regiment, in the old tongue"). The trait constrains on-page action: only through this linguistic ability can the coachman encode regimental memory and speak the planks into "leaning closer to listen." Visible cost: the languages are dead, requiring the coachman's solitary stewardship. Closure linkage: the final "garden will sign its name" implies linguistic transformation. Early signal, development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Fertilize" drives at least three beats: crushing coral to fertilize "lean runnels," the general practice of turning dead reef into shore-food, and the instruction to the veteran to plant where he bled (implicit fertilization of grief-ground). The action is causally necessary: without fertilization the "seedlings sulk" and the garden cannot reclaim the battlefield. Major turn traces to this: when the veteran plants his pod, the action converts grief into rooted future. Early signal, development across multiple mentions, and closure linkage (the final garden-signature depends on successful fertilization) all present. Swappability test: no near-synonym (e.g., "nourish," "enrich") carries the same agricultural and transformative weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By understanding bird calls" is signaled early ("I taught myself to read them. / By understanding bird calls, I mapped the buried iron…"), demonstrated in at least two beats (tern/gull/heron directing planting sites, "The birds begin their ledger, and I read it aloud"), and shapes on-page tactics: "I set a pod where the tern taps." The method is causally necessary: without it the coachman cannot know where to plant, and "when the calls align, the pods open." The veteran's successful planting depends on the heron defining shade. Early signal, development, and payoff (birds "annotate," final "sound like wings and oars") all present. Visible cost: misreading a trill causes seedlings to sulk, and the method requires patient observation. Specificity: tern/iron, gull/alkaline, heron/shade are irreplaceable pairings.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is anchored in the opening line, recurs across beats ("I park my coach by the fenders of hibiscus," "the blooming jetty at twilight lengthening underfoot"), and supplies resources (planks that "lean closer to listen," proximity to tideline for planting). The setting pressures choices: the jetty's position between sea and shore enables the work of translating reef-death into garden. The final image charges the jetty with new meaning: it lengthens "underfoot, ferrying us into tomorrow." Early signal, development (offering spatial ground for planting and veteran encounter), and payoff (closure image) all present. Micro-setting (jetty as stage and shrine) constrains the coachman's range and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" is signaled in the opening line and brackets the entire narrative: the coachman's work begins only after this ecological collapse. The timeframe tightens decisions by creating urgency (the coastal road "ended like a breath," the war "kept marching in long salt"). However, the reef's death is framing condition rather than live clock; within the story's present no additional time pressure escalates. The final image implies futurity ("ferrying us into tomorrow," "when the concord finally surfaces") but does not track elapsed time. Early signal and thematic weight present; live escalation via ticking clock absent. Score reflects strong setup and thematic integration without mid-scene time-constraint pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is dramatized early ("I have a task: to let a garden reclaim a battlefield, and to make it remember peace"), drives on-page choices (planting where the tern taps, offering the veteran a pod to plant where he bled), and the closure hinges on it: "the garden will sign its name where the battle wrote noise." Friction between want and cost appears in the unglamorous labor (crushing coral, reading bird calls, speaking to unresponsive seeds) and the failed treaty that dissolved when the reef died. The coachman's desire is conflicted: he must use dead reef (the cause of the coastal road's end) to feed the living shore. Early signal, development across multiple beats, and payoff all present. Visible cost: patience, solitary ritual, risk of misreading.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" is taught early ("I learned to listen sideways, in a narrow vastness"), modulates with pressure ("Twilight pulls the harbor narrow, but the horizon keeps speaking in a voice as wide as sleep"), and charges the final image ("There is a narrow vastness to this work, a corridor of ocean opening inside a seed"). The tone coheres through lyric compression and maritime-memorial register, and the phrase reweights at closure: narrow (jetty, seed, present work) opens into vastness (ocean, tomorrow, signed garden). Early signal, development, and payoff all present. The tone is not static; it deepens from orienting description to thematic key. Specificity: the oxymoron is irreplaceable and structurally necessary to the story's logic.</comment>
