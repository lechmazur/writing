<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear interiority through botanical grammar and careful resourcefulness that constrains choices (trading "calyx for caveats"). The motivation to find the unlearned lessons library drives on-page decisions, though the time traveler's arc feels thinner—his key realization ("never learned to apologize to himself") arrives quickly without embodied struggle. The final choice to trade "right to forget today" shows visible cost and forecloses a path. Minor slip: the traveler's emotional state reads more summarized than lived during his footnote trap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric cadence shifts that reweight the quest. Causality holds through the rescue sequence: researching gaps → finding the traveler → editing silence via apology → door opens. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist renegotiates to retain access, accepts the aching palm imprint, and the traveler's small apology charges the final image with felt cost. One minor seam: the shift from "unheard symphony" guiding feet to footnote trap could be tighter in spatial logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is vividly particular (Atlases of Abandoned Journeys, Stairs of Recanted Promises) and constrains multiple choices: the thread from Palinode, the rain-written contract, the culvert of footnotes as physical trap. The botanical diary functions as both tool and micro-setting anchor, its pressed fern enabling the negotiation. Sensory detail (crushed thyme, erased chalk, moss-stitched margins) is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's arcane-linguist lens. The final image—shelves humming "like beehives of paper"—charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rescue the traveler to reach the unlearned lessons library) is signaled early and escalates through negotiation with the index, the footnote trap discovery, and the apology-as-edit solution. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the wall "remembers sap" and the door opens—options narrow and the protagonist faces the tug of her own refusals. Visible cost appears in the renegotiated contract: trading the right to forget. Agency is strong (protagonist's research and botanical grammar drive the resolution), though the traveler's arc contributes less pressure than the environmental puzzle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the library of unlearned lessons as repository of refusals, the protagonist's "catalogue of carefulness that kept me safe and smaller than purpose," the traveler's inability to apologize to himself. The botanical diary's margin notes (moss and verbs) and the fern imprint becoming a "chord never struck but vibrating" avoid stated morals. The final image—traveler learning "a small apology to the sky"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what we refuse to learn. The unheard symphony motif recurs with purposeful shift: silence as score, rests as negative space, the lifting of rests at the door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinctive perceptual signature: "petal grammar," "storyblood," "negative space, a score of rests." Diction stays character-specific (arcane linguist filtering through botanical and musical metaphor) and modulates under pressure—compressed syntax when the wall shivers, then expands for the final reflection. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at peak beats. Minor slip: a few lines approach therapeutic self-awareness ("a catalogue of carefulness that kept me safe and smaller than purpose") that reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority, though it remains within the established voice's reflective register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("grammar frays when the mountain slopes into memory"). Information density is strong—most lines do multiple jobs. However, runs of similar syntactic stems appear in the middle third ("I touch...I ask...I write...I feel") and a few metaphors stack without full integration ("shelves that hum like beehives of paper" works; "a chord never struck but vibrating" is elegant; together they risk slight overwriting in the final beat). No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks. Propulsion remains steady through the rescue sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore premise is fresh in its synthesis: rescue missions as heartbeat, gaps as method, botanical grammar as negotiation tool. The time traveler caught in "a culvert of footnotes" and freed by an apology pressed into stone is a specific, non-obvious turn. The unheard symphony frame charges multiple beats and the closure without becoming a checklist. Risk-taking in the lyric register and patterned compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The piece avoids template plot and feels singular in voice and premise, though the "library of things we refuse to learn" reads as a recognizable abstraction that the story earns through specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arcane linguist trait is signaled early, drives the botanical-grammar negotiation with the index (middle beat), and enables the apology-edit that frees the traveler (closure beat). The protagonist's linguistic skill constrains method (petal grammar vs. other approaches) and appears in all three gates with visible cost (trading breath, quiet, synonyms, then the right to forget). Specific and causal across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (mother's notes map shelves by leaf-shape), enables the negotiation (pressed fern over rain-written clause), is used again to write and press the apology, and returns at closure (fern imprint stamped into palm). The object is handled in three distinct beats, its properties (moss-stitched margins, pressed fern) matter causally, and the final imprint charges the ending image. Indispensable to method and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rescue missions are signaled as "the mountain's heartbeat" and frame the inciting action (summons to rescue the time traveler). The concept shapes the dominant stake and tactics (track, negotiate, free). However, it functions more as premise container than active constraint—the piece could sustain similar pressure with "retrieval" or "guide missions." Present across gates but somewhat swappable in exact form.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is signaled early ("the stacks reward patience and punish pride") and shown in the negotiation (trading calyx for caveats, breathing/quiet/synonyms as currency) and the renegotiated clause at closure. The trait enables the botanical-grammar solution and the final contract with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; constrains method with modest specificity. Solid integration but slightly generic as a trait label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" drives two major beats: the initial contract with the living index (trading pressed fern and petal grammar) and the final clause trade (right to forget for future access). The action is specific to the method and shapes closure cost. Setup is implicit in the contract Palinode hands over; middle and ending show the action on the page. Causally essential but not fully irreplaceable—"bargain" or "trade" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled early ("I begin, as always, by researching gaps") and operationalized in the footnote-trap beat ("I choose my method by researching gaps in his history"). The method shapes the protagonist's approach (finding what day he skips, what question he dodges) and leads to the apology solution. Present in setup and actively used in the middle rescue; contributes to closure logic. Specific enough to matter but could be rephrased as "finding omissions" without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine mountain bookstore is anchored early, supplies the spatial logic (Atlases, Stairs, cul-de-sac of dictionaries, culvert of footnotes), and constrains movement and negotiation throughout. The setting provides the living index, the thread from Palinode, the wall that "remembers sap," and the shelves that sigh approval at closure. Environment is indispensable—choices and closure depend on this exact architecture. Irreplaceable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the time traveler arrives" is signaled in the inciting beat and frames the rescue stakes. However, time pressure remains loose—no live clock tightens decisions, and the sequence could unfold over minutes or hours without altering tactics. The traveler's temporal confusion colors the trap but does not constrain the protagonist's moves. Present in setup and middle context; contributes to closure framing but does not escalate pressure meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library of unlearned lessons is stated early and dramatized when the protagonist feels "the tug of my own refusals" and chooses not to "leave a burden there." The desire shapes the final renegotiation (trading the right to forget for future access). Friction between wanting the library and the cost of access is visible. Present across gates with modest dramatization; the want drives closure but competes slightly with the rescue-mission frame for dominance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" tone is seeded in the opening line ("an unheard symphony bent into shelves"), recurs as guiding principle ("I listen to the rests"), modulates when the door opens ("a lifting of rests, as if the unheard symphony relearned breath"), and charges the final palm-imprint image ("a chord never struck but vibrating"). Tone is coherent, purposeful, and shifts cadence at closure. The musical metaphor structures perception and stakes across all gates. Nearly indispensable to the piece's texture and final effect.</comment>
