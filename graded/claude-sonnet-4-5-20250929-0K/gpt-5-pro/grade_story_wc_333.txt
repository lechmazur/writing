<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivations remain legible—he performs his craft with patience and precision—but interiority is thin; we witness his actions without access to contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The scholar's desire to free a trapped kindness is established through backstory (the sister's ribbon), yet the peak choice (taking the curl on his tongue) reads more as ritual than a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Embodiment is present in gestures ("brushed it across the keyhole," "knelt, putting his ear to the grain") but emotional conflict is told rather than dramatized through simultaneous competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives promptly (locksmith, village summons, scholar at crossroads). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images and ritual actions rather than because/therefore causality. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the door opens inward, the scholar retrieves the trapped idea, the valley reels—with felt cost visible in the scholar's trembling hands and the recognition that "shame had been scraped away." One meaningful deepening occurs when the star's breathing realigns the valley, and the lock responds to the hair's scent. The cost is legible: years of folded feeling are released, the locksmith keeps the empty box as testament to what has left.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the freestanding door "welded to moonlight," the valley of blackthorn, the "shadowed nexus under starlight" with crickets "like clerks keeping sly records." The star functions as micro-setting—its breathing dissorients the valley into new alignment, directly enabling the door's opening. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the locksmith's craft-focused perception (tumblers, grain, keyhole "as small as the pupil of a startled animal"). The nexus constrains the scholar's choice spatially and atmospherically, and the final image charges the ending as "the valley settled into the dignity of having witnessed a release."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: free the trapped idea/unspoken mercy. Pressure accumulates through ritual actions (the ribboned hair, the locksmith's listening, the star's breath) and the valley's physical response. One meaningful tightening occurs when the locksmith tastes the curl and exhales against the keyhole, narrowing the path to this singular method. Agency is visible in the scholar's choice to summon the locksmith and the locksmith's decision to align rather than force. Cost is felt in "trembling hands," the years of folded feeling, and the locksmith's retention of the empty box as reminder. The escalation is driven by accumulative density rather than causal reversals, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—permission to love without rehearsing every danger, the cost of folding feelings into correctness—emerges organically from the sister's ribbon, the scholar's trapped kindness, and the door that keeps ideas inside. The final image (the valley's dignity, the nexus keeping its shadow, the star its breath) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the locksmith's declaration that "some containers exist only so that something can leave them without apology" and the scholar's realization about the sister who "had given it anyway." The piece resists tidy resolution: the door remains, the star watches, and the locksmith walks home "as if escorted by bright and watchful strangers," sustaining mystery while delivering thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited tracking the locksmith, with clean access to his perceptions ("felt the pull of enveloped secrets") and one brief dip into the scholar's memory ("recognized it as the permission to love"). Distance is largely consistent, though the scholar's interior moment mid-scene creates slight POV leakage. Voice is elevated and lyric throughout ("the bruised blue of distant rain," "oaths that open only when a life admits its longing"), maintaining a distinct texture. However, the register remains uniformly poetic even under peak pressure, without modulation to reflect urgency or stress. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks the compression or rhythmic shift that might heighten closure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is extremely high, with metaphor in nearly every sentence ("keyring that made no sound, as if each tooth remembered a silence," "doors whispered, safes sulked," "memory chests refused their owners with a discretion that verged on contempt," "the ribbon had faded to the bruised blue of distant rain"). In peak beats—the door opening, the scholar's retrieval—elevated diction continues unabated ("improbable longing swelled between them, the way tides push the shore toward itself"), reducing propulsion and clarity. Synonym churn is visible in adjacent descriptions of the scholar's feeling: "kindness they had not dared to articulate," "unspoken mercy," "folded a feeling into neatness." Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repeated "the [noun] [verb] its [noun]" constructions. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, but the overwriting and register consistency across all beats lower momentum. Applying density and coherence penalties (−0.6) and template-cadence artifact (−0.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The locksmith-as-therapist premise (doors that keep ideas inside, freeing trapped emotions) is not wholly fresh, echoing fantasy-therapy templates. The specific synthesis—a freestanding door, a lock of hair as key, a star's breath as catalyst—adds texture, but the emotional arc (permission to love without fear) follows a familiar trajectory. The sister's ribbon and the curl-as-wafer offer concrete anchoring detail. The piece commits fully to its lyric, metaphor-heavy mode, which is a coherent artistic stance, but the transformation test is borderline: swap the locksmith for another facilitator and the core remains unchanged. Risk-taking in sustained elevation and ritual pacing is present but does not obscure clarity. The derivative-premise friction applies moderately (−0.7) for the fantasy-therapy frame without deeper transformation through lived or occupational specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The locksmith appears in the opening line, is summoned by the scholar, walks to the nexus, listens to the door, brushes the hair across the keyhole, tastes the curl, and exhales to open the door—all on-page actions. His choice to "align the past with the present" rather than force the lock is a key turn that enables closure. He keeps the empty box as reminder (closure linkage). Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. His decisions directly alter tactics (listening, using the hair, the wafer moment) with visible costs (kneeling, tasting salt, stepping back to let the scholar pass). Strong causal pressure and closure participation elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lock of hair tied with ribbon appears when the scholar holds it at the crossroads (setup), is brushed across the keyhole to trigger the tumblers (development), and is placed on the locksmith's tongue like a wafer to open the door (payoff). It returns with reweighted meaning when the scholar remembers it was from the sister who "had given it anyway, clipping a curl to say please continue where I stopped." The object's specific properties—scent, salt, the ribbon's "bruised blue"—matter causally. It drives two distinct beats (keyhole brush, wafer moment) and is indispensable to the door's opening. All three gates met, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Enveloped secrets" is established early ("the door kept ideas inside") and frames the dominant stake: freeing the trapped kindness. The concept shapes tactics on the page—the locksmith listens for what is hidden, the scholar explains the childhood idea is trapped, and the door opens inward to reveal "a room where the childhood idea sat waiting with its shoes off." The metaphor is literalized in the freestanding door and the act of opening, and the closure image reweights it: "some containers exist only so that something can leave them without apology." Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate (the concept is the premise, not a tool that narrows options dynamically); closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" is applied as descriptor in the opening ("He was unassumingly bold, moving as though shyness had taught him patience without softening the pressure of his intent") and reprised in the final paragraph ("the locksmith, unassumingly bold, walked home"). The trait is told rather than dramatized through visible tradeoffs. On-page actions (kneeling, listening, exhaling) show patience and intent but do not clearly cost him something or create friction. The attribute does not constrain a choice or enable a move with felt price; it functions as voice texture. Late reprise provides lyric resonance but no causal work. Moderate setup, no development beat, weak payoff. Cap at ~5.8 for label-only use without enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears when the first star's breathing "seemed to disorient the valley into a new alignment." This moment triggers the door's shivering and the locksmith's sensation of "enveloped secrets press against him." It is the pivot that enables the ritual to proceed. Setup occurs when the scholar waits for "a hint given by first star seen at twilight"; the star's arrival and its disorienting effect drive the middle beat; the valley's realignment is felt in the closure image ("the valley settled into the dignity"). One major turn traces to this action. Causal role is moderate (the star's breath is necessary but the locksmith's subsequent choices complete the arc). All three gates met, one strong beat involvement, closure linkage via valley realignment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "hint given by first star seen at twilight" is signaled when the scholar points at the sky and waits. The star arrives, breathes, and disorients the valley—this is the method that unlocks the door's readiness. The mechanics matter: the scholar knows to wait for it, and the locksmith proceeds only after it appears. Setup is present (scholar's waiting), development occurs (star breathes, valley realigns), and payoff is implicit in the door's subsequent opening. The method shapes one attempt (waiting for the star) but does not recur or iterate. Causal pressure is moderate; it is necessary but not iteratively tested. All three gates met, one beat involvement, closure linkage indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is introduced early ("led the locksmith down into a valley of blackthorn, to a shadowed nexus under starlight where crickets murmured"). The setting constrains the ritual: the door is freestanding there, the starlight is necessary for the hint, and the valley's physical response (disorientation, realignment, the crickets' laughter) affects the locksmith's perception and the door's opening. The nexus is not merely backdrop; it pressures the choice by isolating the act and providing the cosmic frame. Setup, development (the valley reels during the ritual), and payoff (the valley "settled into the dignity of having witnessed a release") are all met. Micro-setting via starlight and the door's positioning alters tactics. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" is invoked once as metaphorical timeframe ("he could only align the past with the present, across the hush of cosmic possibility that hung over the valley like a shawl"). Time is vague and untethered to concrete duration or ticking pressure. The phrase appears in the middle third, not setup, and does not constrain decisions or create urgency. No clock tightens choices; the ritual proceeds at lyric pace without time-driven trade-offs. Missing setup and development gates; weak closure participation (the phrase is not reprised or causally active at the end). Ornamental and swappable. Cap at ~4.8 for late, abstract, non-functional use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To free an idea trapped behind fear" is dramatized early when the scholar explains "the door kept ideas inside, and that something urgent had been trapped since their childhood, a kindness they had not dared to articulate." The motivation drives the summoning, the locksmith's ritual, and the scholar's trembling retrieval of the idea. Friction is visible: "Not forgiven for harm, but for every time they had folded a feeling into neatness, choosing correctness when courage would have been tender enough." The scholar's desire conflicts with years of practiced restraint, and the cost (trembling, the ache of "unspoken mercy...like a phantom limb") is embodied. Setup, development (the scholar waits, remembers the sister), and payoff (retrieval with visible cost) are all met. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" is named mid-story ("Improbable longing swelled between them, the way tides push the shore toward itself") and coheres with the story's elevated, yearning register throughout. Tone is consistent—wonder, restraint, ritual solemnity—and modulates subtly as pressure builds (the valley reeling, the scholar trembling). The final image sustains the tone: "the valley settled into the dignity of having witnessed a release," and the locksmith walks "as if escorted by bright and watchful strangers." Tone charges the closure by framing the release as sacred and witnessed. Setup is implicit in the opening's enigma, development occurs in the swelling longing, and payoff is felt in the dignity and escort image. Coherent modulation and closure linkage present, though the single explicit mention mid-story is late for full setup credit.</comment>
