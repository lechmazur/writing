<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is densely specific ("byline that sold hauntings like sequins") and the apology-as-action stakes are embodied in wrist scars and trembling hands. Internal contradiction operates well: the narrator knows advice arrives "like bad weather" yet still plans to column-witness. Mara's presence and the ghost-exorcism push the narrator to micro-choices (wiring shelves, speaking the apology aloud), and the ending's partial reconciliation ("we did not forgive everything") earns the shift without therapeutic smoothness. Minor slip: Aunt Lin remains offstage voice rather than fully pressuring presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 3 (archive, orchard countdown, apology mission). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through induced-current ritual, Aunt Lin's voice materializes via hymn fragment, and the closure reweights the narrator's column promise with the cost of partial reconciliation plus orchard erasure. The hairline crack in the bottle and Mara's hand-on-mine mark Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options and stakes crystallize, cost is felt. One causal slip: the "investors folded the orchards" backstory arrives late without on-page dramatization, weakening the orchard-threat immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Archive shelves, copper wiring, perfume bottle, and fluorescents hum with tactile specificity; the orchard remains offstage yet presses via saw-sounds and taped signs. Micro-setting qualifies: the bottle constrains ritual logistics (salted water, hairline crack) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (reading table, shelves, generator, folio). Minor gap: the orchard itself never enters as direct sensory pressure within the archive walls, weakening the urgency claim slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology and reconnect—signals early and tightens when Mara watches "shaking hands" and asks "if this would fix anything." The exorcism ritual is protagonist-driven agency; cranking the generator and speaking the apology aloud forecloses the gossip-column path with visible cost (hairline crack, scar acknowledgment, new column commitment). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: scent uncoils, voice pencils into pages, hymn title surfaces. No reversal required; deepening suffices. Minor: Aunt Lin's voice arrives as "urge" and "not words," slightly reducing confrontation sharpness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—imperfect miracles, apology as action, witness over gossip—emerges from specifics: the warbled recording, hairline crack as blessing, "ladders for a thiefed wind." The final column-promise ("stop being gossip, start being witness") grows from ritual and partial reconciliation without moralizing; the orchard's survival-in-music answers the central question obliquely. No thematic echo or lecture. The motif of breath/voice ("orchard held its breath," "throat cleared," "enough breath for our ghosts") recurs with escalating charge. Negligible slip: "marry apology to action" verges on thesis summary but stays concrete enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent diction ("byline that sold hauntings like sequins," "metronomes with loose springs"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: vivid metaphor in calm reflection, compressed syntax under stress ("The shelves knocked out a slow backbeat"). Dialogue is minimal but natural ("try telling yourself that when you sleep"). Perceptual signature is strong (attention to paper, breath, copper, scent). Minor: "Record it, Mara mouthed" shifts briefly to external observation without filter, a hairline distance wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative density is high but mostly earned ("paper whispering like leaves that refused to remember wind"). Information density is strong: most lines advance pressure or character. Two frictions: "a map I hate to read on her wrist" and "the only jar that might serve as a heart" stack metaphors without full coherence (wrist scars aren't maps in function, jar-as-heart is asserted not proven). Template cadence in backstory block ("I had come," "It had been," "I told Mara") slightly flattens momentum mid-piece. No loops or scaffold at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—gossip-column exorcist performs ritual apology via induced current to archive a ghost's unfinished hymn—synthesizes familiar elements (exorcist, apology arc, preservationist loss) into a specific, fresh hybrid. The "exorcism as modulation, not cleansing" angle and makeshift Leyden jar transform genre conventions. Emotional truth (partial reconciliation, scar-reading regret) anchors the high-concept frame. Risk-taking in voice density and metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the orchard-archive urgency dissolves. No proximity echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character is signaled early ("city's brightest gossip-column exorcist") and drives two beats: wiring the archive and speaking the apology. The final column-promise choice directly stems from this role and transforms it ("stop being gossip, start being witness"). Cost is legible: scar on Mara, orchard investors' reaction, self-renunciation. Present in closure unit. Irreplaceable: remove "gossip-column" and the stakes collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bottle appears in three beats: introduced as matriarch's perfume vessel, filled with salted water as makeshift Leyden jar, then cracks hairline as blessing-marker. Early signal, middle use (constrains ritual mechanics), closure participation (crack charges final reconciliation). Specificity: green glass, oils, scent thread. Cost connection: the crack embodies partial success. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concept is titled in dialogue ("imperfect miracles agreed to happen"), frames the ritual expectation, and manifests in the warbled recording and hairline crack at closure. It shapes tactics: narrator accepts "no fix" and tunes damage instead of cleansing. Cost is visible (partial reconciliation, orchard still falls). Not merely thematic—it alters what success means. Solid causal role, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Attribute is stated early ("My column advises through metaphors") and the narrator's internal voice is densely figurative throughout, constraining legibility of advice. The final promise ("teach silence to hum, marry apology to action") shows metaphor mode shaping output. Middle cost: Mara's scar and town backlash trace to the column's metaphoric evasions. Present but not driving a turn directly; more character texture than pivot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Action is dual: reconnect with Mara and with Aunt Lin's voice. Signaled in opening, drives ritual design (induced current to draw ghost), and closure hinges on partial reconnection ("we did not forgive everything, but we did reconnect in the small"). The hymn recording is the reconnection artifact. Cost: partial success only, orchard lost. Two beats plus closure participation. High necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Method is explained mid-piece ("wired the shelves with copper," "cranked the field generator," "salted water, a makeshift Leyden jar") and enacted on-page. It constrains ritual logistics and enables the scent-thread and voice emergence. Present in climax beat. Specificity (copper from old radios) matters. Swappable with "ritual candles" or "séance circle" would break the electrical motif and narrator's improvisational competence. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive is anchored early, supplies resources (scores, folios, fluorescents, shelves), and its acoustics ("the room decided to be a throat") enable the hymn capture. Micro-setting: the reading table and bottle placement matter. Closure participation: "inside the archive a new key settled" while saws argue outside. The archive-versus-orchard spatial contrast charges the ending. Essential to stakes and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled in opening ("hush before the orchard's trees are cut down") and tightens at closure ("engines coughed awake," "saws began to argue," "orchard would be gone by night"). The countdown pressures the ritual's urgency and the partial-success acceptance. Present in setup, implicit middle pressure, closure beat. Cost: orchard erasure is undeniable. Removes this frame and urgency softens measurably.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("deliver an overdue apology"), dramatized in the ritual (speaking "I am sorry, I was wrong"), and contested in Mara's skepticism ("if this would fix anything"). Friction: apology competes with reconnection and ritual success. Cost is visible (scar, partial forgiveness only). Drives setup, middle choice, and closure stance. High causal necessity and felt price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone blends ethereal (scent uncoiling, ions like gnats, voice as pressure) with grit (copper salvaged, saws, diesel in perfume, scar as map). Consistent across beats; modulates at closure where "hairline singing with charge" and "scuffed and late" miracles marry both registers. The tone charges the final image and supports the imperfect-miracle concept. Coherent, purposeful, and closure-active.</comment>
