<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly embodied ("I powder the black until it listens") and their professional stance (drawing fast, weaving truth carefully) drives micro-choices throughout. Soren's contradictory presentation—holding the mask, telling stories that "do not meet in the middle," flinching then nodding—shows authentic ambivalence without therapy-speak. The final choice to leave the mask and name is earned by the prior pressure, though Soren's agency remains somewhat passive. Strong perceptual signature and embodied emotion lift the score, with minor penalty for limited on-page struggle in Soren's arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of ash-scattering ritual early and pays it off at closure when the ash is scattered into the mask's cracks, reweighting "safety" as a shared mirage carried in broken things. Orientation anchors (narrator, gallery, tonight) land by line 1; the rocking chair provides a tactile clock. One meaningful deepening occurs when the drawing becomes ash and is folded into the porcelain—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost (ephemeral image destroyed, grief internalized in the broken object) is legible. The accumulative pressure coheres through the ritual frame without requiring causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rocking chair constrains the drawing session, its slowing rhythm ("groaning like a ship turning in shallow water") charges the closure beat, and the brass bowl on the floor provides the ash-burning site—micro-setting that shapes the ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful: "air tastes like slate," porcelain "veins under glass," and the ash making "a weather all its own" filter through the narrator's professional perceptual lens. Spatial choreography (Soren seated, mask in lap, portrait held up, kneeling at the bowl) remains clear throughout. The gallery as "house of somber marvel" is established early but remains somewhat abstract; deeper occupational texture (other clients, prior rituals) is omitted but acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the drawing-to-ash ritual can convert Soren's unspoken grief into something bearable. The narrator's agency drives the sequence: choosing what to draw ("the way she waited for him to tell her the last truth"), tearing the portrait, lighting it, and scattering the ash into the mask's seams. One meaningful tightening occurs when Soren asks to take the drawing and the narrator refuses—"here the end is always ash"—forcing the ephemeral path and its cost (no keepsake, only internalized weather). The cost is legible: the image is destroyed, Soren flinches, and the gray "looks like a thought that will not heal yet." Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the mirage of safety with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ash as impermanence made portable, safety as a "mirage we share so we can walk across the heat together," and the mother's adage that "truth is a basket you carry over running water." The final image—ash in the porcelain cracks, making "a weather all its own"—offers a non-literal answer to whether forgiveness can be carried without declaring itself. No thematic echo or moralizing; the narrator's stance ("I say safety is only the mirage") functions as character voice rather than thesis. The ash-scattering recurs with shifted meaning (first abstract concept, then tactile closure act), and the story resists tidy resolution: the thought "will not heal yet" holds complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I powder the black until it listens," "the first shape opens like a lid," "the graphite sighs against the paper." Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction remains character-particular (professional artist idiom with poetic compression) and modulates under pressure without losing texture. Soren's dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("He asks if he can take the drawing"), and the narrator's voice carries subtext in every directive ("it belongs inside the broken thing now"). Purposeful elision (what broke them, whether forgiveness landed before or after) is taught early and paid off as the narrator fills "the blanks with shadow and breath." Rhythm heightens at the ash-scattering beat without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("the mirage of safety looks most real when we are thirstiest," "the gallery holds its breath") charges key beats without muddle. Minor issues: "I hear what they omit and shade what they fear, and the rest emerges as if the paper remembers for them" leans slightly abstract; "the sad light" and "soft room scrape against the bones of memory" edge toward stock phrasing. A brief paraphrase loop: "I tell them I can hold their storm long enough to crystallize a fleeting emotion, and then let it go" restates the narrator's method without added pressure. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image ("the mask catches the light, its shards holding tiny sunsets, and the ash makes a weather all its own") is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—charcoal portraitist who burns each drawing and scatters the ash—transforms the therapist-as-artist trope through specific ritual mechanics and the narrator's lens-based metaphors. The mask made from porcelain shards and the mother's "elegant breakages" collection offer fresh, non-obvious particulars. The emotional calculus (safety as shared mirage, forgiveness without knowing the offense) avoids generic abstraction. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression, ritual frame, elided causality) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the Accumulative lens holds. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. The story commits fully to its premise and resists the safety middle, earning +0.3 within band for coherent risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's choices create every turn: seating Soren, drawing the eyes "not exactly" his mother but "the way she waited," refusing to let him take the drawing, tearing it, burning it, and scattering the ash into the mask. Present in setup (opening line), shapes all middle beats (drawing, refusal, ash ritual), and drives closure. Specific cost: the drawing is destroyed, the ephemeral made permanent only as "weather." High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mask is handled in multiple beats: Soren holds it in his lap, fingertips find the seams, he lifts it to study the portrait, kneels with it at the bowl, and the ash is scattered into its cracks. It returns at closure with reweighted meaning: the ash "belongs inside the broken thing now" and makes "a weather all its own." Early signal (paragraph 9), beat involvement (three distinct touches), closure linkage strong, and irreplaceable (the shards' seams receive the ash).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"The mirage of safety" is named twice and shapes the narrator's final speech to Soren: "safety is only the mirage we share so we can walk across the heat together." It reweights the stakes—Soren came for safety, leaves with internalized grief—and the cost (no keepsake, only the mirage of carried ash) is legible. Present in setup (line 5 implies it), developed in dialogue, and charges closure. Modest causal pressure; could be rephrased without breaking the arc, but the exact metaphor anchors the theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears in the opening and governs the narrator's method: "I hear what they omit and shade what they fear, and the rest emerges as if the paper remembers for them." It constrains the drawing process (filling blanks with shadow, not interrogating Soren's gaps) and enables the ash ritual. Present in setup, informs one middle beat (the drawing), lyric reprise in the mother's adage about truth and baskets. Cost is oblique; the constraint is more conceptual than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Powder" recurs as the signature action: "I powder the black until it listens" (drawing), "I powder it with a fingertip, hush it to a fine hush" (ash preparation), and the ash is scattered into the mask. It drives two major beats (drawing initiation, ash transformation) and is indispensable to closure—without powdering the ash, it cannot be scattered into the seams. Early signal, high specificity, irreplaceable mechanics, and shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through incomplete information" is signaled early: "No one asks how I do it, or they ask and look away when I say I work through incomplete information." The method governs the middle beat: the narrator fills "the blanks with shadow and breath" because Soren "leaves out what broke them." It shapes the drawing's content (the mother's eyes as waiting, not forgiving) and is present at closure as the ash "looks like a thought that will not heal yet." Two-gate involvement (setup, middle), modest causal pressure, and charges the thematic layer.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The gallery is named in the opening line and provides the brass bowl, the rocking chair (which measures breath and slows to mark closure), and the spatial frame for the ritual. It pressures the narrator's refusal: "here the end is always ash" is a house rule. Present in setup, supplies key tools, and the location's permanence (a place "where lines bend toward a vanishing point and then disappear") charges the theme. Modest causal work; the specific venue matters less than the ritual it houses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rocking chair's rhythm measures the session: "The old rocking chair in the back keeps schedule for my hands," "the rocking chair slows, groaning like a ship," and "As the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop, I sign the margin." Its stopping marks the drawing's completion and triggers the closure sequence (signing, tearing, burning, scattering). Present in setup, tracks middle beats, and its halt is the temporal hinge for closure. Strong temporal constraint and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To crystallize a fleeting emotion" is declared early: "I tell them I can hold their storm long enough to crystallize a fleeting emotion, and then let it go." It drives the narrator's goal (draw the mother's forgiveness) and shapes the ritual (the drawing must be ephemeral, the ash permanent). Friction appears when Soren asks to keep it and the narrator refuses—cost is the ephemeral made ash. Present in setup, tested in middle refusal, and paid off at closure. The desire is dramatized through the drawing and burning sequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is established in the opening ("We are a house of somber marvel") and sustained throughout: the ritual is grave but wondrous, the prose lyric yet restrained. Tone modulates under pressure—quiet at the drawing, tense at the refusal, reverent at the burning—and charges the final image: "the mask catches the light, its shards holding tiny sunsets, and the ash makes a weather all its own." Coherent across turns, no tonal breaks, and the ending's marvel (ash as weather, tiny sunsets) holds the somber cost (unforgiven thought, flinch).</comment>
