<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost-wax caster's motivation is embodied through sensory particulars (breath sparking like tin shavings, bronze running in channels) and the technical skill directly shapes the climactic action. Internal contradiction surfaces in the guilt-versus-purpose dynamic, and the final choice to stay feels earned by the forgiveness frame. Minor deduction: the teacher and market trauma remain largely told rather than dramatized in micro-choices that test present options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The opening establishes forgiveness-as-threshold; pressure builds through braided imagery (punched card → rope → organ) that converges at the moment the protagonist unlays the braid and feeds the card into the copper guide. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist stays to tend the bellows, forecloses wandering, with cost visible in "shoulders ached" and the commitment to "keep the bellows awake when storms came." Orientation anchors are present early (sanctum, aurora, ice). Cost is legible and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, whale-oil lamp, rope curtain, and organ bellows constrain the protagonist's actions throughout. The punched card scrap's singed edges and the scar on the index finger both charge the final casting sequence. Spatial choreography (chamber behind knotted curtain, pipes drinking air, sluice of flame and wax) remains clear and the ice-as-listener image recurs meaningfully at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve forgotten names before winter erases them. The protagonist's agency drives escalation—forgiveness enables entry, technical skill unlays the braid, and feeding the card triggers the organ's awakening. The tightening occurs when "I nodded to no one and aligned the last crossing," a choice that forecloses retreat. Cost: physical exhaustion and the open-ended commitment to stay. One meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens; no multi-reversal required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as embodied artifact versus ephemeral speech—emerges through particulars: "paper remembers where our tongues cannot, and the card scratched its own small oath." The final image, bronze castings pressed against pipe mouths to return names as sound, offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The scar reweighted from accusation to lodestar deepens the reconfiguration. No prompt-echo intrusions; the work-as-brightness line avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV stability throughout. Diction—"technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor," "ledger I had studied in childhood and betrayed by absence"—is voice-particular and purposeful. Perceptual signature filters setting through craft idiom (lost wax, bronze, molds, wax tongues). Under peak stress, compression remains controlled ("The organ inhaled, the ropes held, and the room opened like a lung"). No head-hopping; focalization is tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; figurative language (aurora as spectral brass, ice tinkling like bells, organ opening like a lung) generally serves pressure without overwriting. Minor deductions: a few adjacent lines risk paraphrase loops ("The sanctum did not demand penance anymore; it asked only..." echoes the structure of "after forgiving yourself the world does not vanish; it brightens"). Filter-verb usage ("I had thought that scar an accusation") is light. Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost-wax casting + street-organ punched cards + ceremonial rope braids as a multi-modal memory engine—feels specific and non-obvious. The risk of lyric density is managed; metaphors cohere (braids, holes, names as tensions). Transformation test: swapping sanctum for archive or bronze for recording would flatten the tactile pressure and the closure image. A fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars without template echo.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lost-wax caster frames the opening, unlays the braid at the climax, and shapes bronze tongues at closure. Decisions alter tactics: the choice to compare card holes to rope crossings, to slip the card into the copper guide, and to stay all derive from craft identity. Cost: physical labor, shoulders aching, commitment to tend bellows. Irreplaceable; the technical skill enables the method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Punched card scrap appears in the opening (pocket, edges singed), maps to rope braids in the middle chamber, and is fed into the copper guide at the climax. Its constellation of holes becomes the key that unlocks the organ and mirrors the bronze-tongue patterns. Reweighted from memorial of failure to active instrument. Early signal, causal pressure across three beats, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transcribed memory shapes stakes from the opening ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") through the method (wax tongues pricked with holes) to closure (names returned as sound, instruments sturdy as winter). The concept differentiates oral/paper/metal memory and drives the protagonist's choice to cast rather than record. Causally active; cost tied to it (labor, commitment). Present in closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears early ("my hands are technically gentle even when carrying fire"), constrains the braid-unlaying ("So I unlaid one braid... threading the memory"), and enables the delicate casting work at closure. The trait is shown through action (adjusting crossings, pricking wax) rather than label-only. Minor friction: could be more explicitly tested under stress with a visible tradeoff. Causal role across two beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the major turn: lighting the whale-oil lamp allows the protagonist to compare card holes to rope crossings, the method becomes visible, and the sanctum floor shivers in response. The action is signaled by the teacher's instruction and redefines options. Without this exact action, the mapping remains hidden and the organ silent. Early setup, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the braids is signaled by the teacher's instruction, the protagonist studies the rope in childhood, and the method is enacted beat-by-beat (unlaying one braid, crossing under two, aligning the last crossing). Mechanics matter: each adjustment triggers a pipe note and syllable. The method is indispensable; swapping for a key or password would collapse the tactile, craft-driven escalation. Setup, development across multiple beats, closure participation, irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum constrains entry (forgiveness gate), supplies resources (whale-oil lamp, rope curtain, buried bellows, ice walls that listen), and shapes the protagonist's tactics (breath sparking in cold, molds in sluice of flame, quenching castings in snowmelt). Aurora provides light for the mapping. The setting's properties are causally active across setup, escalation, and closure. Micro-setting (ice, lamp, rope) alters tactics. Irreplaceable environment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" frames the opening, enables sanctum admission, and recurs at closure ("after forgiving yourself the world does not vanish; it brightens for work"). The timeframe is more threshold than ticking clock; it reweights the protagonist's stance from guilt to purpose. Present in two beats (setup and closure reprise), charges the final image, but does not tighten tactics mid-scene. Lyric resonance; causal setup and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Preserving forgotten names is signaled early ("I had come to preserve the sound of forgotten names before winter erased them again"), tested through the physical labor of casting ("I worked until the lamp burned low and my shoulders ached"), and fulfilled at closure (names returned as sound, protagonist stays to keep bellows awake). Friction: the market trauma that motivates the desire remains largely told. Motivation drives all three beats and the final commitment; cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears at the climactic turn ("I breathed out, and snowmelt ardor rushed through my chest, bright as the lamp and the sky together") and charges the final image ("it brightens for work"). The phrase synthesizes cold/warmth, thaw/purpose, and modulates from grief to resolve. Tone coheres across turns and supports pressure. Minor friction: could modulate more visibly under the peak physical strain. Present in escalation and closure; reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
