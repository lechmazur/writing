<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The locksmith remains abstract throughout—"reflective," "peripherally focused"—but these traits function as lyric assertions rather than dramatized contradictions under pressure. Interior experience consists of metaphorical claims ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") that never fracture into competing impulses when stakes tighten. The harvesting task proceeds without genuine struggle or cost that alters the character's stance; competence is declared but never tested by failure or miscalculation that compounds on the page. Embodied emotion is absent; no physical reaction, hesitation, or sensory overwhelm disrupts the measured voice even at the mechanism's repair or the season's entry into the cave.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and impressionistic: "marble cavern," "wounded season," and a workshop are named but spatial and temporal anchors remain vague past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (harvesting echoes, calibrating the mechanism through lyric density), yet closure lacks a decisive turn or reconfiguration with visible cost—the timer "begins," the locksmith leaves with labeled jars, but no option is foreclosed and no stance crystallizes with felt price. The piece teaches a patterned compression early (daisy of marks, chime-and-echo beats), but the ending delivers completion rather than reweighting or closure cost, reducing the final effect to summary. Causality is present in the repair sequence but does not tighten or deepen meaningfully after midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is sensorially vivid—cool breath, veined light, drip intervals—and the chime-and-reed setup offers tactile specificity. The cave's acoustic properties (echo return, reflection angles) constrain the locksmith's method and supply the tempo for the gear train, satisfying the micro-setting criterion for choice constraint. However, spatial choreography remains abstract (no clear layout or movement through zones), and the "daisy of marks" and angle measurements are gestured at rather than tracked in a way that alters tactics beat by beat. The wounded season functions as atmospheric frame but does not pressure decisions or evolve causally across the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repair the broken timer by harvesting cave echoes—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the escapement reveals "misaligned teeth" and the locksmith must file a new gear train keyed to echo intervals, narrowing method. Yet the process unfolds without complication, reversal, or visible cost: every echo returns as needed, the mechanism consents to "breathe," and the cave "approves" without resistance. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced; the locksmith's agency reads as skilled execution rather than decision under pressure. The lack of a second beat that tests or transforms the first caps escalation in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—wonder, humility, mercy learned from stone—emerges through recurring images (cellar of reason, peripheries, echoes as pauses) rather than overt statement, and the final "winter-humility, measured by marble" jar reweights the locksmith's vow with quiet specificity. The piece resists a stated moral and invites reflection on craft, patience, and indirect knowledge. However, the thematic question never faces genuine friction: the locksmith's philosophy is affirmed rather than tested, and no counter-pressure (a failed harvest, a misread angle, a cost to storing wonder) complicates the resolution. The lack of dramatized cost or earned insight—only enacted skill—limits resonance to atmosphere rather than change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature ("peripherally focused," "echo-length stand in for seconds the way wind stands in for breath") that reflects the locksmith's idiom. Distance is stable first-person past, and POV modesty holds—inferences are marked as such. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("congruence, a yes that used no vowels," "signed treaty between stone and air") that reads ornamental rather than voice-rooted, especially under the story's working-task pressure. Figurative density pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure, triggering overwriting penalties. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not judged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—"grazing along my hearing," "echoes gathered like shy animals," "a click fluttered out, like a bird that had learned to imitate chains"—without a taught pattern or closure payoff, applying the density overwriting penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "store wonder in the cellar of reason" is repeated nearly verbatim across paragraphs 4, 29, and 34, and "peripherally focused" recurs in paragraphs 7 and 21 without added pressure (−0.4 for loops). Mixed metaphor: "the season itself had limped in, leaking weather" mixes injury and fluid without coherent vehicle logic (−0.4 for coherence). Template cadence runs: "I came… I chalked… I filed… I set… I noted… I remembered… I went…" stack first-person declaratives across eight paragraphs without variation (−0.5). Cumulative artifact total: −1.9 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Sentence rhythm is uniform; no propulsive variation under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith-as-echo-harvester and timer repair keyed to cave acoustics offers a fresh angle on craft and measurement. The "peripherally focused" stance and "cellar of reason" metaphor are specific to this voice and avoid stock metaphors. However, the emotional arc and premise—patient artisan learns humility from nature, returns transformed—follow a familiar template without meaningful subversion or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece does not take structural or perspectival risk; the lyric density reads as ornament rather than necessity, and removing the elaborate metaphors would leave the repair sequence intact. Transformation test: swapping "locksmith" for another solitary craftsperson and "cave" for another natural space would preserve the arc, signaling insufficient grounding in irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The reflective locksmith is present throughout and makes decisions (chalk marks, filing the gear train, placing the chime), but these are skilled tasks rather than choices that create key turns or face costs. The character's agency reads as observation and execution; no reversal or stance shift results from a decision under pressure. Setup and development are present, but closure participation is descriptive—"I would seal the cellar"—rather than active or transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism is introduced early (paragraph 5), handled in at least three beats (discovery, opening the escapement, filing the gear train and setting harvested echoes), and reappears at closure when "the mechanism turned with the colors of the wounded season." Its repair structures the plot and enables the ending image. However, the mechanism is more a goal object than an agent that constrains choice—the locksmith's method is already known, and the timer does not resist or surprise in a way that alters tactics mid-sequence. Irreplaceability is moderate; a different device could serve a similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Harvest of echoes is signaled early and frames the entire task: the locksmith brings "sacks woven from patience," sets the chime to bait echoes, notes return angles, and installs the harvested echoes into the escapement. The concept shapes method and occupies at least three beats (paragraphs 9, 20, 24–26). It participates in closure when the mechanism's "tick like a cave drip made civic" and the locksmith stores the beats. However, the harvesting proceeds without complication or cost—every echo returns as needed—so the concept does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Specificity is high, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is named in paragraphs 7 and 21 and described as a habit, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The locksmith's observations (chime placement, angle marking) could proceed identically without this trait; it functions as a voice marker rather than a tactical choice that alters the outcome. No beat demonstrates a trade-off or failure tied to peripheral versus direct focus. Label-only mention without dramatized consequence trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Reverse-engineer is named as the locksmith's purpose (paragraph 10) and executed through opening the mechanism, reading echo patterns to infer the teeth's original order, and filing a new gear train. The action occupies the middle third and enables the repair. However, the process unfolds as skilled application rather than a major turn—no failed hypothesis, no pivot when reverse-engineering reveals a surprise. The action is swappable with "repair" or "reconstruct" without altering structure. Present in setup and development, but not causally active at closure; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is named in paragraph 10 and enacted when the locksmith chalks angle marks, notes incidence and retreat, and tracks beats as the skylight thread changes color (paragraphs 12, 23, 31). The method appears in at least two beats and shapes the harvest technique. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no specific angle measurement alters a tactic or fails to yield an echo—so the method is present but not pressure-bearing. Functional but replaceable with "measuring echo timing" or similar phrasing; reaches mid-band on involvement but lacks causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is present throughout, sensorially detailed, and supplies the acoustic resources (echo intervals, drip tempo) that the locksmith harvests to calibrate the timer. The cave's properties constrain method—the locksmith must place the chime, mark angles, and wait for returns—and the "skylight narrowed to a blue thread" tracks time's passage, affecting observation. The cavern's "hum" at closure charges the final image. However, spatial layout remains vague (no zones or movement that force navigation choices), and the cave does not resist or surprise in a way that alters the plan mid-sequence. Essential across beats and ending, but not fully indispensable; another resonant natural space could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the lull of a wounded season" is named in paragraph 3 and echoed at closure ("carrying its hush like a watermark," "winter-humility"). The timeframe provides atmospheric frame and a loose temporal anchor (streams hush, birds fewer), but it does not tighten decisions—no countdown, no seasonal event that forces urgency. The locksmith's task proceeds at an untracked pace; elapsed time within the cave is inferred from drip intervals and skylight color shifts but does not constrain or rush choices. Present in setup and reprise, but swappable with "during winter" or another season without structural impact; ornamental temporal frame rather than tactical clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated in paragraph 4 and repeated in paragraphs 29 and 34, framing the locksmith's purpose. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no moment where storing wonder competes with speed, safety, or another goal. The locksmith pursues the task smoothly; no friction between "wonder" and "reason" surfaces in a choice. The motivation provides thematic coherence and closure echo but does not drive a turn or force a trade-off. Label-only with lyric reprise; functional but not pressure-bearing.</comment>
