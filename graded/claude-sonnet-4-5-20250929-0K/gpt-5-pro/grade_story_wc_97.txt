<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pianist's interiority is distinctly rendered through concrete perceptual filters (the station's "compasses in its bones," the arbor's "bench of salt-bleached wood shaped to my back and to her absence"). Internal conflict manifests in the tension between pride that caused the quarrel and the longing that drives the musical pursuit, though the reconciliation moment lacks sufficient embodied cost—Mara's return and their laughter feel too easily won given the stakes established. The protagonist's agency is present but the final beats don't fully dramatize what is surrendered or risked to achieve reunion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring motifs (clock, compasses, arbor, film reel) layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where color returns to Mara and the couple sits together while "compasses, now still, lay down like tired swallows." Closure lands on the page with felt cost (the clock ticks only four beats, the arbor opens "a path back"), though the cost feels somewhat muted—what the protagonist or Mara gave up to achieve this reunion remains oblique. Orientation is clear early (station, pianist, broken clock, Mara's absence), and the tightening is legible as the film reel opens hidden passages that lead to retrieval.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure: its "bench of salt-bleached wood shaped to my back and to her absence" becomes the site where the prelude is finished and Mara steps back into warmth. The station's ceiling fans as "flickering compasses" and the film projector's mechanics are integrated into action. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the shift from station to arbor and back, and the sensory palette (tide sounds, vapor, salt-bleached wood) is filtered through the pianist's perception without becoming a catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reuniting with Mara after the quarrel and her train's disappearance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through discovery (the film reel, the minute hand), passage into the arbor, and the protagonist's act of playing the unfinished prelude. The arbor scene tightens options (the compasses steady, the corridor opens) and the final winding of the broken clock forecloses a path with modest cost (four beats of ticking, then silence). However, the escalation feels more lyrical than urgent; the protagonist's agency in the arbor is somewhat passive (playing, asking, sitting) and the visible price paid for Mara's return is under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the materials: time (the stopped clock, the minute hand, four beats), art as door (film as passage, music as retune), and the question of whether a "strategically creative" mapping of grief can alter fate. The final image—returning "through hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel, as if surf could learn to speak in cinders"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries (blame as "a timetable we no longer had to read") and the protagonist's refusal to ask the corridor's price honors complexity. The prelude's unfinished state and its completion in the arbor tie character arc to thematic question without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>First-person voice is sustained with a distinct lyric register ("time that refuses to keep me," "darkness signs the staff where memory breathes") and perceptual signature (compasses, arbor, the grain of wood as sound source). Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for real-time narration ("strategically creative, the way I map mornings as if they were chords waiting for resolve" reads more like retrospective gloss than live thought). Figurative density is high throughout, which suits the lyric mode, but a few constructions feel labored ("the horizon invites night" appears twice, threading into formula).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and often propulsive ("I slipped the reel over the projector's old jaw, and the ceiling unscrolled into a tidal arbor above the clouds"), with strong sensory specificity and minimal filter verbs. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I play until the horizon invites night" recurs verbatim, and adjacent sentences in the arbor sequence restate the music's emergence without added detail. Template cadence: multiple mid-story paragraphs open with "I [verb]" in close succession, creating a drumbeat. Figurative language is dense (crazed glass dome, centipede leader, moths, trapped lark) and occasionally mixed (surf as arbor, then surf learning to speak in cinders). These patterns accumulate to −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7, preventing entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of film projection, musical closure, and metaphysical passage through a tidal arbor feels fresh and specific to this narrator's dual artist identity (pianist/projectionist's partner). The central conceit—hidden frames between frames as passages—is non-obvious and rooted in the characters' shared history. The piece commits fully to its lyric-metaphysical premise without retreating into realism. However, the emotional stakes (quarrel, pride, departure) rest on familiar romantic-regret architecture, and the arbor's mechanics remain somewhat ornamental rather than constrained by internal logic. The risk-taking in structure and imagery elevates the piece within its band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wistful station pianist is the focalizer and agent throughout. Setup: present from the first line. Development: discovers the reel, sets the minute hand into the projector, travels to the arbor, plays the unfinished prelude—each choice alters tactics. Payoff: holds out the broken clock to Mara, winds it to notch the night, returns through the hidden sections. The character's choices create the key turns (slipping the reel, playing the prelude, winding the clock). Causal pressure is present across at least three beats; the final winding directly shapes the closure. Strong integration; the exact identity (pianist, station-bound, wistful) is indispensable to the music/film/passage logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in the opening (beside the coin jar, stopped when Mara's train did not arrive), recurs as the source of the minute hand filed thin and set into the projector, and returns in the arbor when the protagonist holds it out and winds it for four beats that open the path back. Three distinct functional beats; causal involvement (the minute hand enables the film's revelation and vibrates to produce sound in the arbor); closure participation (winding persuades the arbor to open the return path). The clock's brokenness and the four-beat limitation supply visible constraint and cost. High irreplaceability: the anniversary frame ties to Mara and the specific temporal failure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Flickering compasses appear early (ceiling fans "click like flickering compasses, pointing nowhere and everywhere") and return in the arbor ("The flickering compasses gathered like moths, their needles stuttering, quivering toward a point beyond north"). Setup present; development: the compasses steady when the protagonist plays the prelude, signaling the corridor's opening; payoff: they "lay down like tired swallows" after the reunion. The concept shapes two beats (steadying as passage marker, lying down as closure image) and contributes thematic resonance (navigation, lost routes, eventual rest). However, the compasses do not constrain a protagonist choice or alter tactics under pressure; their role is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causal. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is named once in the protagonist's self-description ("Call it strategically creative, the way I map mornings as if they were chords waiting for resolve. / That habit saved me when the reel arrived"). The trait is claimed to have enabled discovery of the reel's significance, but the on-page action (opening the canister, recognizing the minute hand, setting it into the sprockets) does not dramatize a strategic choice with visible cost or tradeoff. No development beat where the trait constrains options; closure does not hinge on this attribute. Label-only mention trends low; the "saved me" claim is told, not shown through a difficult choice. Missing middle and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Taking refuge appears in the arbor: "I took refuge upon it the way seabirds tuck their faces under wing when storms gnash the horizon. / But I was not there to sleep; I was there to tune the air to a promise neither of us had kept." Setup in middle third; the refuge beat frames the protagonist's purpose (not escape but repair). Development: the act of sitting and playing in the arbor opens the corridor and steadies the compasses. Payoff: the refuge site becomes the reunion location where the protagonist and Mara sit together. The action shapes two beats and contributes to closure, though it is somewhat passive (sitting, playing) rather than a high-agency verb. Swappability: "sought shelter" or "rested" could replace with minor edits. Moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hidden sections in the film reel are signaled in the first third ("Inside the canister lay strips of black-and-white...something small and brass. / It was the minute hand...I set it into the sprockets...and the film showed me what the station concealed"). Development: the film's mechanics (sprockets, projection, frames between frames) enable the passage to the arbor and later the return corridor. Payoff: the final line ("We returned through hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel, as if surf could learn to speak in cinders") directly names the method as the closure vehicle. The method shapes three beats (discovery, passage in, passage out) and its mechanical specificity (film reel, black-and-white, hidden frames) is irreplaceable. Strong causal and closure involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal arbor above the clouds is revealed in the middle third when the ceiling unscrolls. Setup slightly late but vivid; development: the arbor provides the bench shaped to absence, the space where the prelude can be played, and the sway that allows Mara to step into warmth. Payoff: the arbor leans to send a surge, opens the return path, and frames the final winding of the clock. The setting constrains action (the bench, the arbor's sway and lean) and charges the closure (the path back). Spatial particulars (bowers of surf, salt-bleached wood, platform ghosts) are integrated into the protagonist's choices. Strong closure participation and causal shaping across two to three beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" appears twice as a temporal marker: the protagonist plays until this threshold, and in the arbor scene the phrase recurs ("I played until the horizon invited night again"). Setup: the timeframe is signaled early as a constraint (the day's duration). Development: the repetition in the arbor suggests elapsed time and links the two playing sessions. Payoff: the final winding of the clock to "notch the night" ties the timeframe to closure action. The phrase creates a rhythmic bracket and contributes to tone, but the timeframe does not actively tighten decisions—the protagonist is not racing a clock. Moderate thematic resonance; modest causal pressure. Lyric reprise elevates but does not reach high integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to surprise fate with an unplanned encore is named explicitly ("I am not fool enough to crush causality under song, but I have always wanted to surprise fate with an unplanned encore"). Setup in the middle third; development: this motivation drives the protagonist to play the unfinished prelude in the arbor, attempting to "retune the hour." Payoff: the winding of the clock and the four beats are the enacted encore, and the return path opens. The motivation is tied to at least two on-page choices (playing in the arbor, winding the clock) and shapes the closure action. However, the motivation is stated rather than fully dramatized through friction between want and cost—the protagonist's risk or sacrifice in pursuing the encore is under-specified. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage; some tell-vs-show friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steely longing is established early ("Since then, I practice a steely longing, neither brittle nor yielding, carved into each diminuendo") and sustained through diction, syntax, and image across the piece. The tone modulates with pressure: controlled restraint in the station, lyric intensity in the arbor, quiet resolution in the return. The final image ("we laughed the way lost things laugh when remembered" followed by the refusal to ask the corridor's price) balances longing with acceptance, charging the closure without sentimentality. Coherent through turns; the "steely" quality (disciplined, neither brittle nor yielding) is enacted in the protagonist's choices. Strong tonal integration and closure contribution.</comment>
