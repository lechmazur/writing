<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The newsprint heiress POV is consistently realized through embodied perception ("history pricks your palm," "orbits of regret") and her micro-choices under pressure—declining coffee, placing the pen nib, drafting the statement—all flow from her devotion to truth with her father's shadow as credible friction. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between royal metaphor ("headline princess") and janitor humility, and her final choice to draft a confession forecloses the easier path of silence with felt cost. Minor slip: the technician and Kline blur slightly in the catwalk sequence, and the outreach coordinator/intern blame-shift reads more as evasion catalog than dramatized mistake, reducing the antagonist's dimensionality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two sentences; the drive lens is Causal with proof-by-contradiction linkages narrowing Kline's options twice (calibration lamp, histogram analysis), and closure lands on-page when the statement is drafted and the journalist called back—Decisive Change with visible cost (donor anger, reduced institutional shine). The because/therefore chain holds: journalist's tip → confrontation → logical traps → technician's surrender → confession. One meaningful tightening occurs when the technician moves to delete logs, crystallizing the ethical stakes and forcing the protagonist's stair-climb intervention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory's echoing dome, humming floor, and shutter "like a slow eyelid" are filtered through the heiress's newsprint idiom and constrain action—she climbs stairs, places the pen nib beside a keyboard, uses the catwalk's verticality to dramatize intervention. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: graphs "look back like children," wind "hisses through lashes," the rosewood tin "smells like inked thunder." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (floor → mirror → catwalk → stairs) and the micro-setting (keyboard, cursor blinking "like a fuse") charges the peak choice. The pen nib as tactile anchor and the dome's acoustic properties ("echoes dislike evasions") make the environment a participant in the ethical confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the paper from printing a fraudulent sky and preserve institutional credibility—is signaled early and coheres under causal pressure. One meaningful escalation: Kline's evasions are refuted by on-page proof (calibration lamp in logs, histogram "top hat"), then the technician's cursor moves toward deletion, forcing the protagonist's stair-climb and second round of proof-by-contradiction with visible cost (the logs stay, the donor loses, anger "burns clean"). Agency is clear: her logical arguments and the symbolic weight of the pen nib drive both surrenders. No coincidence resolves; the cost (reputational friction, donor displeasure) is legible in "the anger burns clean" and "slightly of pen and contrition."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—integrity versus expedience, truth's price in institutions built on patronage—emerges through the calibration-lamp proof, the technician's surrender, and the final image of a city tasting "pen and contrition" without knowing. The rosewood nib returns with reweighted meaning (strike-and-truce spear becomes ethical prod), and "orbits of regret widen" when the sun loses weight supplies a non-literal answer to whether sacrifice lightens or isolates. Minor slip: "to discover hidden truths" in direct speech risks thematic echo, and the final paragraph's "stars keep their counsel and still appear generous" borders on a stated moral rather than earned resonance through image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinctive perceptual signature: newsprint metaphors ("floor hums like a printing press," "sky were a hollow cello"), embodied history (grandmother's pen nib), and a syntax that fuses journalistic precision with poetic compression ("solemn playfulness in every comma"). The dialogue—Kline's coffee offer, the protagonist's requests for raw logs, the technician exchange—is spare and goal-driven with subtext in the pen nib's symbolic placement. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the climax, wider at dawn). Minor friction: the long sentences in high-pressure beats occasionally delay momentum, and a few phrases ("possessed of the steady, cruel patience") drift toward elevated register that edges past immediate crisis idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high (most lines advance character, proof, or image), and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "history pricks your palm," "graphs look back like children," "cursor blinks like a fuse." However, the frequency of metaphor in nearly every sentence ("wind hisses through lashes," "echoes thank you in a tongue we can finally print," "dawn flips clouds into coins") risks overwriting, particularly in the final two paragraphs where three consecutive images (clouds/coins, coffee/contrition, stars/counsel) compress without clear escalation. The calibration-lamp and histogram proofs are lucid, but the surrounding ornament occasionally competes with clarity. Apply −0.6 for density and minor register drift in peak beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—newsprint dynasty, astronomical fraud, proof-by-contradiction as moral method—feels specific and non-obvious; the rosewood pen nib as heirloom-turned-ethical-instrument and the observatory's acoustic complicity avoid stock tropes. The dual proof structure (assume innocence, refute via logs; assume honesty, refute via histogram) is a fresh dramatization of logical rigor under institutional pressure. Risk-taking in the solemn-playful voice and lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Minor deduction: the "orbits of regret" and father's mountaintop love are invoked but not fully integrated into the final choice mechanics, reading slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The newsprint heiress frames expectation in the opening, makes the key interventions (declining coffee, requesting logs, climbing to the technician, drafting the statement, calling the journalist), and her devotion to truth with familial friction drives every turn. Present in setup, middle (proof confrontations), and closure (statement draft, journalist callback). Causal pressure is high; her choices narrow Kline's and the technician's options with visible cost. Irreplaceable: the newsprint legacy and "history pricks your palm" motive are essential to the ethical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: carried as a tactile relic ("smells like inked thunder"), placed beside the keyboard as symbolic spear, and used to draft the statement ("nib scratching the paper's skin"). Its function evolves from heirloom anchor to ethical prod to instrument of confession, and its presence constrains the technician's choice and charges the closure. Early signal, middle use, closure participation all met. Minor deduction: the "strike and truce" backstory is efficient but slightly told rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is signaled early, applied to the protagonist's father and the repeated pull of almosts, and returns at the climax ("orbits of regret widen, the way a planet moves outward when a sun loses weight") to reweight the cost of institutional honesty. It shapes the thematic stakes and charges the final image but does not directly constrain on-page tactical choices—Kline and the technician surrender due to proof, not orbital metaphor. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance earns mid-band score; lack of causal pressure in middle beats prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is demonstrated through the protagonist's request for raw logs, her reading of the calibration-lamp timestamp and histogram anomaly, and her attention to the technician's cursor. The trait enables the proof-by-contradiction turns and is signaled early ("devotedly observant and already composing questions"). It constrains her path (she cannot ignore the data) and drives two key beats. Minor deduction: the trait is more shown than named, which is strong, but the on-page cost is implicit (relational friction, institutional risk) rather than a visible sacrifice tied specifically to observation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Intervene" is the hinge action: the protagonist climbs the catwalk stairs to stop the log deletion, deploying the pen nib and proof-by-contradiction to secure the technician's surrender. The intervention is prepared by prior proof confrontations and redefines the story's outcome—without it, the logs vanish and the fraud succeeds. Present in setup (call prompts climb), development (confrontation with Kline), peak (technician stair-climb), and closure (statement draft). Causal, irreplaceable, and tied to visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is named, taught, and executed twice on-page: assume donor innocence, reveal calibration lamp; assume palette honesty, reveal histogram distortion; then deployed again with the technician (assume erasure, project scandal; assume transparency, project clean burn). The method shapes the protagonist's tactics, structures the confrontation beats, and is reused at the climax with the pen nib as symbolic anchor. Early signal, middle and peak use, closure-adjacent. Minor deduction: the second technician proof is compressed and less vivid than the Kline sequence, slightly reducing mechanical distinctness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" anchors every beat: the humming floor, the dome that "exhales echoes," the shutter's slow eyelid, the catwalk verticality that stages the climax. The setting's acoustic properties dramatize evasion ("echoes dislike evasions") and the final dawn image ("clouds into coins") charges the resolution. Environment constrains action (climb to confront technician) and supplies the ethical atmosphere. Present in setup, middle, and closure; irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the journalist calls" establishes urgency and a live deadline (article publishes tonight), tightening the protagonist's decision window. The timeframe is invoked at the opening and again when she calls the journalist back at dawn, bracketing the confrontation. It adds pressure but is not actively tracked beat-to-beat; the calibration-lamp discovery and technician surrender unfold without explicit clock references. Lyric closure reprise (dawn) reweights the urgency but does not constrain middle tactics with visible cost. Mid-band for setup and closure participation without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is stated once in direct speech but dramatized throughout: requesting raw logs, parsing the calibration-lamp timestamp, confronting Kline's evasions, stopping the deletion. The motive conflicts with institutional expedience (donor relationship, celebratory article) and drives visible costs (anger, reputational friction). Present in setup, middle (proofs), and closure (statement draft, journalist callback). Minor deduction: the direct statement "my motive is simple: to discover hidden truths" risks thematic echo, slightly reducing subtlety; score remains high due to strong dramatization and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is sustained through diction choices ("devotedly observant," "giddy with fear," "solemn playfulness in every comma"), the narrator's self-description as "janitor, broomed by duty," and the wind that is "playful but solemn about its ancient obligations." Tone modulates under pressure—lightness at the opening, gravity during proof confrontations, quiet satisfaction at dawn—without flattening. The final image ("stars keep their counsel and still appear generous") charges the resolution with tonal coherence. Minor deduction: density of ornament in the closing paragraphs occasionally competes with tonal clarity, and the playful register in peak beats (technician confrontation) is less distinct than in framing paragraphs.</comment>
