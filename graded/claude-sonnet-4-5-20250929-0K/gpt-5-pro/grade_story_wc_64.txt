<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rowan's interior life is richly textured with embodied contradictions—"unanswered questions" in his pocket, gardening grief to keep moss from hardening—but the motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" remains abstract and never crystallizes into a visible cost or choice that forecloses a path. The chess tutor's final game is handled with care, yet Rowan himself never faces a genuine dilemma or trade-off; he performs a ritual of understanding without any risk or change in his own stance. The renunciation or endurance needed for Earned Stasis is gestured toward but not dramatized with felt pressure. Minor penalty for diagnostic phrasing: "the question of why the living linger" reads like prompt scaffolding rather than lived thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening: Rowan, cemetery, night ritual. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density and pattern accumulation reweight the stakes—but the closure unit is faint: Rowan runs the chess clock and exits, leaving "uncharted echoes thinned, not vanished." This reads as a minor cadence shift rather than a decisive reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost. The final image ("velveteen gloom suits certain truths") is thematically resonant but does not reweigh prior material with visible or felt cost on the page. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence at the ending beat shows Rowan paying a price or foreclosing an option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, tapestry, and pocket chessboard ground the ritual convincingly, and sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("dew were made of old silk"). The silo's architecture and the tapestry's physical presence constrain Rowan's ritual—he must climb, align, listen—and the sovereign case's heft recurs with purpose. However, the environment does not decisively charge the final image; Rowan's exit is atmospherically strong but the setting does not alter his closing choice or crystallize the cost, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of intentions"—is signaled early and pursued through the ritual, but pressure never escalates into a genuine turn or trade-off. Rowan learns the chess tutor's intention and performs a symbolic correction (running the clock), yet this act is unopposed and costs him nothing visible on the page. The uncharted echoes "thinned, not vanished," which suggests continuation rather than closure, and no live option is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening or deepening required is missing; the ritual completes but does not reweigh options or knowledge with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: grief as soil, intentions as cartography, listening as mending. The final image—"velveteen gloom suits certain truths, because softness can carry a weight sharp brightness only shatters"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the thematic statement is overt and arrives as summary rather than being earned solely through the chess-clock ritual. The piece rewards reflection and resists tidy binaries, but the closing beat risks over-articulation ("gardening grief the way he gardened earth") that edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited on Rowan, with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices moss, pebbles, thimble shadows, and "tender pressure toward one square never reached." Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout—"velveteen gloom," "choirboy precision," "needy knots"—and the narrative distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. One register slip: "aerating it, watering it" in the penultimate beat reads slightly mechanical. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. The voice is lyric but remains legible and internally consistent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and often dense ("a coil of thread, and a torn scrap of tapestry border"), but several beats carry paraphrase loops: the opening establishes "tenderly organized" in line 2, then restates it with "minute, choirboy precision"; the penultimate paragraph recycles "tenderly organized breaths" and "checking names, touching cracks, squaring offerings" without adding pressure. Filter-verb reliance is moderate but noticeable ("He believed moss would hold better," "He read direction"). Template-cadence runs appear mid-story: "He set… He pressed… He returned… He walked" across consecutive beats. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in reflective beats, total −0.9, keeping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardener, cartographer of intentions, and tapestry-echoes is fresh and specific, with Rowan's occupation and tools organically serving the theme. The chess tutor's unfinished game and the sovereign case's provenance are evocative particulars. However, the core frame—sensitive caretaker mediating the unfinished business of the dead—is a recognizable template, and the story does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or high-stakes choice. The velveteen-gloom tone and micro-setting elevate, but the lack of genuine risk or cost at closure limits ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rowan is present throughout and his choices (climbing the silo, opening the case, setting up the chessboard, running the clock) advance the ritual beats. However, these are procedural rather than turning; no choice narrows options or imposes a visible cost. He is the sole on-page character, and his renunciation or endurance is not dramatized with felt pressure. The character shapes all beats but does not create a key turn with cost. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure minimal +0.2, closure linkage weak +0.4, cost absent −0.6, swappability (another sensitive mediator) −0.4. Base ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sovereign case is introduced early ("antique sovereign case, dented, warm"), used in the silo ritual (opened, aligned like a sextant), and returned to its bed at the end. It appears in three distinct beats with evolving function: container, alignment tool, closure gesture. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; Rowan's ritual would function similarly with another weighted object. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.8, closure linkage (reprise) +0.7, specificity moderate +0.4, cost absent −0.5, swappability (weighted token) −0.5. Base ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" are described early ("the silo thrummed with uncharted echoes"), appear in the ritual ("untangle murmurs from their needy knots"), and are mentioned at closure ("the uncharted echoes thinned"). The concept frames the atmosphere and stakes but never materially alters Rowan's tactics or options; it remains thematic rather than causal. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure low +0.3, closure linkage (status report) +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability (ghosts, whispers) −0.6. Base ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" is established early ("the blithe cemetery gardener… Rowan kept the graves tenderly organized") and reprised at closure ("tenderly organized breaths"). It colors action (pruning moss, aligning pebbles, checking names) but does not constrain or enable a single on-page choice with cost; it is a trait-label that describes manner rather than imposing a trade-off. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure absent +0.1, closure linkage (reprise) +0.5, label-only −0.7, swappability (meticulous, gentle) −0.6. Base ~3.8, capped at 3.8 per swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Untangle" appears mid-story ("Rowan began to untangle murmurs from their needy knots") and drives the central ritual beat, shaping how Rowan processes the echoes. However, the action itself is interchangeable with decode, parse, or interpret without structural loss, and no major turn traces to the untangling specifically—the chess-clock gesture is the visible closure act. Early signal moderate (second third) −0.3, one key beat +0.4, causal pressure moderate +0.7, closure linkage indirect +0.5, swappability −0.6. Base ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is seeded early ("decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border, coaxing pattern from ruin") and demonstrated in the silo ritual: "Rowan held the antique sovereign case like a sextant, aligning its dinged rim with constellations of loose knots. He read direction in how the strands resisted and yielded." The mechanics matter—Rowan uses the tapestry border and scrap to guide his listening—and the method shapes the middle beat and primes the closure gesture. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6, cost indirect +0.3, swappability (reading omens, divining) −0.5. Base ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is introduced early ("Beyond the yews stood a cobalt silo under stars"), used across three beats (climbing, ritual, exit), and reprised at closure ("The cobalt silo under stars held its breath as he closed the hatch"). It provides the spatial frame for the ritual and houses the tapestry, but does not pressure a choice—Rowan's actions would proceed similarly in any elevated, enclosed ritual space. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure low +0.4, closure linkage (reprise) +0.8, swappability (tower, observatory) −0.7. Base ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the chess clock runs down" is signaled early and literal closure involves running the pocket clock "to nothing." However, time is not tracked or tightened during the ritual; the phrase functions as a symbolic marker rather than a live constraint that alters Rowan's decisions. Early signal +0.6, two beats (frame + closure) +0.9, causal pressure low +0.3, closure linkage (clock gesture) +0.8, specificity +0.4, time not tracked as constraint −0.9. Base ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To discover the shape of intentions" is named early ("Rowan came here to discover the shape of intentions") and pursued throughout, shaping the ritual's goal. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in friction or cost; Rowan succeeds without opposition or trade-off, and the motivation does not evolve or face competing wants. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.6, closure linkage +0.6, told-only −0.9, no friction −0.7. Base ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" opens and closes the piece, establishing a coherent, soft-darkness tone that modulates subtly with the ritual's intensity and releases into the final affirming line. The tone charges the final image ("velveteen gloom suits certain truths, because softness can carry a weight sharp brightness only shatters") and remains stable through turns without flattening. Early signal +0.8, present across all beats +1.4, coherence +0.9, closure charge +1.2, modulation under pressure +0.6. Base ~7.6.</comment>
