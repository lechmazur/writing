<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong and specific: her professional skills as copyist translate directly into action (copying phrases, annotating margins, calibrating powder), and her choices visibly alter the room's reality. The "secretly luminous" hands and inherited phosphor from outlawed scores ground her competence in embodied detail. Internal conflict appears in "refusing to cloak her answer" versus earlier caution, and the final choice to "cloak nothing" forecloses safety with visible cost. Minor: the gathering neighbors and stranger's violin introduce secondary figures whose interiority remains sketch-level, but they function as pressures rather than full agents, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered actions (tuning radio → copying phrases → raising dust figures → keying reply → teaching seams), culminating in a final cadence shift: "kept the dial tuned, cloaked nothing, and let the songs teach what silence forgot." Closure reads as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: Mara's refusal to hide the broadcast forecloses personal safety and opens community exposure, reweighting the dominant stake (resistance to story famine) with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clear by the second sentence (Mara, copyist, wintered valley, ember alcove). One tightening occurs when the signal falters and she answers openly, narrowing her options and raising stakes for the gathered community. Cost is legible in "cloak nothing" and the implication that "the hills would carry it farther than any bell"—exposure is now inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove functions as micro-setting, constraining action (shallow dish, coals for light and warmth) and charging the final image ("embers reposed," "thistled calm"). The dust, chalk, ash mixture and the radio's dial glow supply concrete tools that shape each beat. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional bias: "bleached staves," "metronome symbols," "E at the edge of hearing." The moss-walled ridge, far orchard, and shutters anchor spatial choreography during the searchlight warning. Minor: the "wintered valley" and "story famine" remain slightly abstract backdrops; more tactile consequence of the famine on daily routines would push this higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: resistance to "story famine" through dust-story transmission. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara keys a reply naming the ridge, which escalates from passive reception to active broadcast and draws boots past the door—coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The warning in the reed-ladder melody forces a tactical shift (cutting lamps, audience breathing on count). Cost is visible: exposure replaces concealment. However, the escalation is smooth rather than abrupt; no sharp reversal that narrows options dramatically mid-scene. The boots "faded" feels slightly convenient, softening the peak danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: teaching dust to remember, translating pirate lyrics into visible community, the copyist's skill as resistance. The final image ("dust would not need her; until then she kept the dial tuned, cloaked nothing") offers a resonant answer to the central question of how stories survive suppression—by training others and refusing concealment, with the conceptual cost of obsolescence and exposure both acknowledged. No overt moralizing; subtext operates in the powder's "gullible" quality, the "thistled calm," and the announcer's anonymity. The ember-and-phosphor motif recurs purposefully, each mention reweighting the stakes. Minor: "the taste of words" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstraction but recovers in the concrete final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: spare, lyric syntax with purposeful compression ("Their breath turned to vowels that mapped intervals"). POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction matches a literate, musically trained focalizer without register drift. Purposeful elision (the nature of the famine, the regime's specifics) charges the setting without clarity loss. Dialogue is absent, appropriate for the broadcast's one-way transmission. Minor: some constructions edge toward the poetic at the expense of immediacy ("the air itself remembering"), and a few filter verbs ("she noticed," "she recognized") could sharpen, but they do not dull peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths modulate with pressure. Information density is high: "She collected ash from the stove, chalk from broken rehearsal slates, and mildew-soft paper, stirring a gullible powder that remembered fingertips" does triple duty (action, world-building, metaphor). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor artifacts: "The boy turned, the boat slid, and the outlines held" uses comma-splice rhythm that recurs in a few other beats, creating slight monotony. "Secretly luminous" appears twice in identical phrasing (first and late), which feels like a deliberate callback but could vary slightly for texture. One filter-verb cluster in the middle third ("she recognized," "she marked," "she cut") slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure. Overall propulsion is strong.</comment>

<question>9</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates high originality through synthesis: the copyist's notation skill becomes direct resistance tool, and the dust-figure transmission merges archival labor with pirate radio in a fresh frame. The "secretly luminous" hands and phosphor inheritance avoid stock magic-realism by tying the effect to outlawed scores and professional practice. Emotional specificity (the "thistled calm," the powder's "gullible" quality) resists generic uplift. The transformation test passes: swap the copyist for another archetype and the mechanics collapse. Risk is present in the refusal to explain the regime or famine directly, trusting atmosphere and implication. Minor: the pirate-broadcast-as-resistance and dust-as-memory are individually familiar tropes; their combination and execution through music notation elevate but do not reach the rarest band of conceptual surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession as diligent orchestra copyist is signaled in the second sentence, shapes every major beat (copying phrases, annotating margins, marking bars, noticing "where pages wanted ink heavier"), and charges the closure: "Because she was a diligent orchestra copyist, she noticed where pages wanted ink..." The final line's "copied the night's last line" directly uses her skill. The attribute constrains tactics (only a copyist would annotate lullabies, recognize reed-ladder notation) and enables the dust-raising. Present in setup, middle (copying while broadcast plays), and closure (teaching seams, final copying). Cost: her expertise makes her indispensable and exposed. Three gates clear; causal pressure and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in the third sentence ("dial glow salted the mist") and recurs when Mara "kept the dial tuned" in the final line. It provides concrete light source during searchlight warning ("left only the embers") and is handled physically (cloaked with velvet shawl, palms pressed to case). However, the "glow" itself does not constrain a choice or shift meaning beyond atmosphere; the radio's function matters more than the glow's specific quality. Two touches (early, final) with modest causal work; lyric resonance is present but the glow remains somewhat ornamental compared to the radio's content.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is introduced in the fourth sentence, drives every beat (tuning, copying, answering, teaching), and shapes the entire stake: transmission of forbidden stories. It narrows options when the signal falters, forcing Mara to reply openly and thus escalate exposure. The final line's "kept the dial tuned, cloaked nothing" directly ties closure to the broadcast's presence. Without it, the story's logic collapses; no other element could replace it. Present in setup (fourth sentence), middle (every beat), and closure (final line). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are maximal; cost (exposure, community risk) is tied directly to broadcast participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is introduced early (hands, eighth sentence) and recurs late (dust figures, twentieth sentence), bracketing the narrative. It enables the dust-raising by implying inherited phosphor from outlawed scores, grounding the fantastical element in professional history. However, the luminosity itself does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost; it functions more as a marker of her capacity than as a tradeoff. Two mentions, thematic consistency, modest causal work (enables dust but does not narrow options). Lyric reprise reweights the attribute by transferring it to the dust, but the pressure remains oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears explicitly twice: cloaking the radio during patrol winds (mid-narrative) and "refusing to cloak her answer" / "cloaked nothing" at the climax and closure. The action defines the tactical shift from concealment to exposure, directly altering the story's stakes and charging the final image. However, the word "cloak" itself could be replaced by "hide" or "cover" with minimal edit; the concept of concealment matters more than the exact verb. Present in middle and closure, drives the turn, but moderate irreplaceability lowers the score slightly below the indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Instructions via elusive song lyrics are introduced in the fifth sentence, shape Mara's method throughout (copying phrases, annotating lullabies, recognizing reed-ladder notation as breath control and warning), and constrain her choices (only a copyist can decode them). The lyrics' mechanics matter on the page: they hide names, encode warnings, and teach the gathered community their parts. Present in setup, drive multiple middle beats (copying, interpreting warning), and implicitly continue in the closure ("let the songs teach what silence forgot"). High causal pressure; swapping lyrics for another transmission form would require structural overhaul. Three gates clear; irreplaceability and beat involvement are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove in mist is named in the first sentence and anchors the setting throughout: she "kept the scores safe as if warming seeds" there, sets the shallow dish there, and "the embers reposed" in the final third. The embers supply light when lamps are cut (tactical resource during searchlight warning) and the alcove's intimacy enables the gathered audience. The mist salted by dial glow charges atmosphere. However, the alcove does not impose a unique constraint; another warm, dim space could serve. Present in setup, middle (tactical use), and closure (embers repose); moderate causal pressure and modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is named in the second sentence and recurs in the final third ("It was after the story famine, and still the hunger was near"). The timeframe sets stakes (maps burned, floodgates closed a decade prior) and explains Mara's mission (restoration). However, "after" remains vague; no live clock tightens decisions on the page, and the famine functions more as backstory than as temporal pressure. Present in setup and thematically reinforced late, but does not constrain tactics beat-by-beat. Modest thematic integration; limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is stated in the sixth sentence ("their purpose matched the one she had hidden in her bones") and dramatized in every subsequent beat: stirring powder, raising figures, teaching neighbors to hum their parts, ensuring "the dust would not need her." The motivation drives Mara's choices (answering the broadcast, cutting lamps to protect the gathering, copying the final line) and charges the closure with visible cost (exposure, obsolescence). Friction appears in the risk of discovery versus the need to transmit. Present in setup, shapes middle beats, and anchors closure. High causal pressure and strong cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is named in the second sentence ("the wintered valley wore a thistled calm that felt earned") and recurs in the resolution ("the room kept a thistled calm"). The tone modulates coherently: quiet attention during tuning and copying, compressed urgency when boots approach, return to calm after. The oxymoron (thistled = prickly, calm = still) captures the story's tension between threat and stillness, and the final reprise reweights the opening by showing the calm as taught rather than merely atmospheric. Coherent through turns, charges the final image. Two explicit mentions with tonal consistency throughout; strong lyric payoff.</comment>
