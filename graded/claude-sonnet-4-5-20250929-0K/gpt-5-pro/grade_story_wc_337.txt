<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The restorer's motivation is established early (grounding restless spirits) and the work with the daughter shows purposeful micro-choices. Interiority is concrete in moments like "my secret is that I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones," grounding the character's investment. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; key decisions (what to do with the coffer, how to work the net) feel procedural rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The daughter's arc is clearer—she trembles, holds the knot, repeats the name—but the restorer's internal stakes never sharpen into a felt dilemma that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density, ritual action, and the net's gradual unmaking. Orientation is established early (coastal town, prism sanctuary, mask restorer at work). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the father is moored, the daughter is freed from his pull, and the restorer accepts "lucid unrest" as ongoing work. Cost is legible in the coffer's re-burial and the sack exchanged as "a new promise." One meaningful deepening occurs when the final knot releases the coffer, shifting the daughter's relationship to her father's memory. Causality is present but soft; the net's mechanics are more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered—"glass ribs arc above me, refracting the moon into patient geometry"—and the setting actively shapes the ritual: "the sanctuary listens, and what it gathers becomes gravity." The coffer "under the quartz floor" and the net "like a topographical cloud" supply tactile anchors that constrain the restorer's method. The final image—"the stars lean closer to the prisms"—charges the closure with environmental collaboration. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's function as silent witness elevates the tone without becoming postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: grounding the fisherman's restless spirit by unmooring him from the net. The pressure is ritualistic and accumulative rather than causal; each knot undone deepens the atmosphere and the daughter's tremor provides emotional tightening. The final knot's release and the coffer's emergence constitute one meaningful turn, and the cost is visible when the restorer asks for the sack "because every binding wants a new promise." However, escalation is more tonal than decision-driven; the protagonist never faces a moment where the ritual might fail or demand a trade-off, so the stakes remain declared rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: mourning as a knot that must be undone with patience, and the cost of tending others' grief. The tapestry needle as heirloom ("mending was a kind of map") and the fisherman's net as archive of a life are particular and purposeful. The final image—"the interlaced hush turns a page we have earned"—reconfigures the opening's "lucid unrest" into ongoing labor without moralizing. The secret exchange ("Her secret is a fear that he left angry; mine is that I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones") deepens the thematic question without over-explaining it. No thematic echo penalty; the piece resists summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and the voice is distinct: lyric diction ("kelp and coins," "topographical cloud," "precise unease") with a ritualist's purposeful cadence. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—attending to hush, gravity, silence as material—is consistent. The daughter's brief dialogue ("thank you") feels natural and weighted. However, runs of parallel syntactic structures ("I keep," "I tell," "I place," "I lift," "I press") and elevated register in high-pressure beats ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") risk template cadence and slight distance drift. Filter verbs ("I tell," "I ask") are frequent but voice-motivated, so no major penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and largely coherent ("nets you cannot see until your hands are already snagged," "silence accumulates the way a shore accumulates shells"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. However, template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems across the middle third ("I keep," "I tell," "I place," "I lift," "I press"), and some lines loop concepts without adding pressure: "Its light accumulates silence the way a shore accumulates shells, shaping and shaped by the tide" closely echoes "At night I work inside a prism sanctuary under starlight, where even breath accumulates silence." Apply −0.6 for template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. No clarity break at closure, so non-closure accumulation cap limits total deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration, net archaeology, and mourning ritual is specific and non-obvious. The prism sanctuary and the tapestry needle as navigational tools offer fresh angles on grief work. However, the emotional arc—daughter fears father left angry, restorer helps lay him to rest—follows a familiar template for cathartic closure. The piece transforms through sensory particularity and voice, but the core plot (helping a spirit move on) is widely used in magical-realist shorts. No derivative penalty severe enough to drop below 7.0, as the execution and lyric texture elevate the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken mask restorer is present throughout and drives the ritual action: touching the net with the needle, lifting the coffer, pressing the compass into silt, speaking the hidden name. Setup is immediate, development includes multiple beats (unraveling knots, fitting the shard), and the character shapes the closure by re-burying the coffer and accepting the sack. However, the choices are procedural rather than dilemma-driven; the restorer executes a known method without visible friction or cost that would make the character indispensable. The role could be performed by another specialist with minor edits, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears early ("I keep a tapestry needle in a case of rain-dark wood") and is used in two beats: touching the net ("When I touch it with the needle, the threads cool as if remembering winter") and passing it through a knot held by the daughter ("I pass the needle through"). It closes the case at the end. Setup and development are present, and closure participation is gestural. The needle's heirloom status and its metaphorical role ("mending was a kind of map") add specificity, but its mechanical function is minimal; the knots could be untied by hand. The object is purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "interlaced hush" appears early ("whispering through the interlaced hush") and recurs in the middle ("With each unfastened knot the interlaced hush grows") and at closure ("the interlaced hush turns a page we have earned"). It functions as both atmosphere and thematic anchor, signaling the sanctuary's active silence that shapes the ritual. The concept constrains the restorer's method—speaking softly because "the sanctuary listens"—and charges the final image. However, its causal pressure is soft; it could be rephrased as "sacred quiet" without breaking plot logic. Lyric resonance is strong, landing it in mid-6s for setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is established in the opening ("where even breath accumulates silence") and reappears in key beats: "Its light accumulates silence the way a shore accumulates shells" and "The sanctuary accumulates silence again" after the daughter leaves. It shapes the restorer's tactic of working "slowly, not to wake what should rise in a hush." Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. The attribute functions as both rule and constraint, charging the atmosphere and the final reconfiguration. However, it is more descriptive than causally binding; the ritual's success does not hinge on this exact phrasing, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Exhume" is named explicitly ("We are exhuming him without a shovel, without a spade") and drives the core action: lifting the coffer from beneath the quartz floor. The verb reframes the net-unraveling as archaeological recovery, linking the restorer's method to the stakes (freeing the father's spirit by retrieving and then re-burying the coffer). Setup is early (the coffer is introduced before the midpoint), development includes the net's unmaking, and closure hinges on the coffer's emergence and re-burial. The action is specific, causally active, and shapes the ending's cost (the sack exchange). High integration, but the mechanical role of exhumation could be replaced by "retrieve" or "unearth" with minor edits, so not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The centuries-old fisherman's net is introduced early, hanging "above the coffer like a topographical cloud." Its knots function as coordinates holding the father's life ("Every knot holds a grain of his life"). The method—unraveling knots—is performed across multiple beats: touching with the needle, loosening each loop, the daughter holding a knot steady, the final knot releasing the coffer. The net's mechanics matter: "each knot a coordinate," "the threads cool as if remembering winter." Closure depends on the net's complete unraveling, which enables the coffer's rise and the father's grounding. Setup, development, payoff, causal pressure, and specificity are all strong. Irreplaceability is high; the story's logic and imagery collapse without this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly established in the opening and recurs throughout: "Glass ribs arc above me," "the sanctuary listens," "the sanctuary, satisfied, lets its silence shift into gravity again." It constrains the restorer's method (speaking softly, working slowly) and charges the closure ("The stars lean closer to the prisms"). The setting is not merely descriptive; it functions as an active participant whose attention and silence shape the ritual's success. Setup, development, and payoff are all present, and the sanctuary's specific architecture (prisms, quartz floor, glass bones) is indispensable to the story's sensory logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "across sharing a secret" is mentioned once in the middle: "The daughter stands at the threshold, and we mark our time across sharing a secret." It establishes a brief pause for intimacy but does not shape the pacing or constrain decisions; the ritual proceeds at its own measured tempo without a ticking clock. The phrase is lyric and thematically resonant (secrecy deepens the bond), but it is ornamental rather than structural. No setup in the opening, minimal development, and no closure participation. The timeframe could be replaced with "while we work" or omitted entirely without altering tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to ground restless spirits" is stated early ("I was hired, if that is the word, to ground restless spirits who forget they no longer drown") and drives every beat: diagnosing the father's unmoored state, unraveling the net, speaking his name, re-burying the coffer. The restorer's work is not abstract; each action serves this goal, and the closure delivers on it: "He will not drag at her sleep anymore; he can rest where the tides and stone agree." The motivation is tested through the daughter's fear and the restorer's own recognition ("I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones"). Setup, development, payoff, and causal pressure are all strong. The motivation is specific and indispensable, though the restorer's internal friction is light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" appears in the opening ("refracting the moon into patient geometry and lucid unrest") and returns at the end ("Lucid unrest remains, a clear ripple under the skin of night"). The tone is coherent throughout: calm, deliberate, yet charged with the weight of unfinished mourning. It modulates with pressure—hush deepening as knots loosen, the sanctuary tilting to listen—and charges the final image without tipping into chaos or false resolution. Setup and closure participation are strong, and the tone shapes the reader's experience of the ritual's gravity. Development is consistent but subtle; the tone does not shift dramatically mid-story, so causal pressure is moderate. Irreplaceability is high; "lucid unrest" captures the specific emotional texture that another phrase would not.</comment>
