<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking the library through measured presence. Interior experience is specific ("cautious exuberance," "heart tame and wild at once") and contradictory impulses appear in scene. However, the final choice to write the second letter feels under-earned; the protagonist's agency at closure reads more as following a revealed pattern than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward poetic abstraction in peak moments rather than visceral particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: cipher instructions build through propagation delays, fog imagery recurs with shifting weight, and the protagonist's careful documentation accumulates toward the final paradox loop. Orientation anchors arrive by ~120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the second letter already present, written by the protagonist's own hand via temporal loop) with conceptual cost visible in the stitched-seal ledger and the paradox of self-authorship. One meaningful deepening occurs when the veiled dreamer realizes responsibility for the second letter. Minor causal friction: the mechanism by which writing "invisible rhythms" produces a physical letter on the desk remains abstract, slightly weakening closure legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch constrains multiple choices: its reversed cycle teaches patience, produces pulses the fog translates, and times the propagation delays that unlock the door. The mist and glowing library micro-setting charge the final image (the library sighs, relieved to return to silence). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the dreamer's veil-mediated perception. Spatial choreography across harbor, marsh, and library remains coherent. The watch and fog function as micro-setting elements that constrain tactics and reweight the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening: the plaque's requirement to answer "in the language of unspoken words" forces the protagonist to translate intent into timed pulses, narrowing options. The cost at closure (taking responsibility for the second letter, looping through time) is conceptual and felt but lacks a sharp trade-off or foreclosed path. Escalation reads as accumulation of cipher steps rather than a decisive turn that raises price. Agency is present but leans toward obedience to instructions more than protagonist-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—speaking by waiting, writing by listening, navigating by delays—emerges organically from the cipher mechanics and the library's requirement for measured presence. The protagonist's act of writing the second letter in "invisible rhythms" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the vapor door, the sewn volumes, and the stitched veil in the ledger. Minor slip: the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("I had learned to speak by waiting…") that slightly over-articulates rather than letting the image carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV maintained throughout with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the veil filters certainty, the watch rhythm structures perception, and the dreamer's cautious exuberance colors every observation. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific ("cautious exuberance," "measured presence," "confidence man's watch"). No dialogue present; interiority is purposeful. Purposeful compression in phrases like "the unfolding cipher used distance and waiting as its ink" is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor register elevation in a few phrases ("propagation delays," "ledger bound in mist") but stays within the dreamer's contemplative idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in multiple beats: "I [verb], and…" stems recur across paragraphs ("I obeyed, and the path revealed," "I stepped closer… and the glowing library took shape," "I smiled, then veiled my smile, and began"). Paraphrase loop in the closure sequence: the paragraph beginning "Between those letters" restates the thematic summary without adding pressure. Minor figurative muddle: "handwriting erased and rewritten" metaphor for fog movement reads strained. These artifacts lower propulsion in non-closure beats. Clarity and concision otherwise strong; no grammar or pronoun issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of temporal loop, propagation-delay cipher, and library-of-unspoken-words premise feels specific and internally coherent. The confidence man's watch with cyclically reversed seconds is a fresh inflection that drives multiple beats. However, the core frame—mystical library accessed via symbolic puzzle, protagonist discovers they authored the guiding message—leans on recognizable templates (circular time-loop, self-fulfilling paradox). Transformation is present through the propagation-delay mechanics and the veil's function, lifting the piece above generic execution. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and invisible-rhythm resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer appears in every beat, frames the quest, executes the cipher steps, and writes the second letter at closure. Key choice: writing the message in invisible rhythms rather than ink. However, many beats read as observation and obedience to instructions rather than decisions that create reversals. Present in setup, middle cipher execution, and closure; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal moderate +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, cost visible +0.4; starting 3.0 → 7.4, then observation-over-decision pattern −1.2 → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in at least four beats: traded backstory, teaches patience on the path, tapped to produce pulses at the door, used as metronome to write the second letter, and referenced in the final letter's advice. Its cyclically reversed property constrains tactics (timing propagation delays, unlocking the door). Present in setup, middle development, and closure. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure active +1.4, irreplaceable +0.6, cost +0.4; starting 3.0 → 8.7, minor swappability (any reversible timepiece could serve) −0.9 → 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher shapes every beat: drives the protagonist to the harbor, dictates the propagation-delay method, unlocks the library door, and structures the final letter-writing. The cipher's use of "distance and waiting as its ink" and propagation-delay mechanics are specific and irreplaceable. Present in setup (first letter encloses it), middle (protagonist obeys instructions), and closure (used to write the second letter). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure high +1.5, closure active +1.6, irreplaceable +0.7, cost +0.5; starting 3.0 → 9.5, rounds to 9.5; however, minor abstraction in "invisible rhythms" keeps mechanics slightly opaque −1.9 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "cyclically reversed" property of the watch is introduced early, enables the propagation-delay timing at the door, and is referenced in the final letter's advice. It constrains the method for unlocking the vapor door (outbound and inbound pulses meet on the reversed tick). Present in setup, middle unlock, and closure advice. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal moderate +0.9, closure reference +0.9, cost visible +0.4; starting 3.0 → 6.7, rounds to 6.7; slight abstraction in mechanics and mild swappability (any reversible mechanism might serve) −0.0 to round conservatively → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The protagonist documents the procedure at every pause, filling a notebook with times, distances, and drawings. At closure, the ledger waits and the protagonist documents the next morning, certain the library will endure. Documentation appears in at least three beats: during the cipher walk, sketching rhythms in the library without betrayal, and the final morning resolve. It constrains tactics (the protagonist fears forgetting and imposing speech) and charges the theme of unspoken words. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal moderate +0.8, closure present +1.0, cost visible +0.4; starting 3.0 → 7.2, minor swappability (observation or memory could replace) −0.1 → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Propagation delays are signaled early in the cipher instructions ("count the echo arriving late"), shape the protagonist's path-finding method (listening for bell echoes, timing wrist pulses), and unlock the vapor door (outbound/inbound pulse timing). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and drives the central mechanics of the quest. Present in setup (cipher letter), middle (path navigation and door unlock), and closure (metronome timing for the second letter). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal high +1.4, closure active +1.5, irreplaceable +0.8, cost +0.5; starting 3.0 → 9.4, minor abstraction in final letter-writing ("invisible rhythms") slightly reduces mechanical clarity −1.3 → 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glowing library appears as the goal, its vapor door with rotating runes constrains entry (requires answering in unspoken words), shelves offer "answers in arrangements of dust motes," and the ledger on the pedestal holds the second letter. The library's requirement for measured presence shapes the protagonist's tactics and the closure image (library sighs, relieved). Present in setup (promised in first letter), middle development (door challenge), and closure (ledger and departure). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal moderate +1.0, closure strong +1.4, cost visible +0.4; starting 3.0 → 7.9, postcard description in early approach without immediate tactical constraint −0.6 → 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "between two fateful letters" is named in the opening line, realized at the midpoint ("everything happening to me was between two fateful letters"), and closed when the second letter arrives on the desk. The frame structures the narrative arc and the temporal loop paradox. Present in setup, middle realization, and closure arrival. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal moderate +0.8, closure active +1.3, cost visible +0.4; starting 3.0 → 7.1, the timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat (no live clock pressure) −0.7 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library is dramatized in the opening (accepts the invitation "with cautious exuberance"), drives every cipher step, and is confirmed at closure ("my motive had been true all along"). The protagonist's fear of "imposing speech where silence held the structure" creates friction with the desire to document. Present in setup, middle choices (obeying cipher, careful documentation), and closure reflection. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal moderate +1.0, closure confirmation +1.1, friction visible +0.5; starting 3.0 → 7.7, motivation is told more than tested by a competing want −0.3 → 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named twice (opening acceptance, closing departure), colors the protagonist's approach (heart "tame and wild at once"), and modulates the tone of discovery beats ("with careful delight"). The tone remains coherent through pressure and charges the final image ("cautious exuberance renewed"). Present in setup, middle modulation, and closure reprise. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal light +0.6, closure charge +1.2, irreplaceable +0.5; starting 3.0 → 6.9, rounds to 6.9; tone is consistent but static rather than dynamically shifting under pressure +0.1 → 7.0.</comment>
