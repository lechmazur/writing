<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transition from aromatherapist to clock-repair apprentice is earned through the backstory anchor ("He found me the day I could no longer swallow the oils I used to worship"), and the final choice to preserve the screw with a felt washer demonstrates micro-agency with embodied cost. Interiority is specific ("I map emotional terrain by rhythm and pause") and the reading of the midwife's emotional state through sound is well-embodied. The therapy-speak risk ("maps emotional terrain") is mitigated by concrete dramatization in the drip-reading scene, though it hovers near label territory in one or two spots.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through layered sensory attention and metaphoric density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Conceptual Repricing) where the screw remains as shrine and the clock's "forgiveness that remembers the work ahead" reweights time as "quilt, stitched by the hands that need to count." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure image—"tiny applause shaped like water meeting time and finding mercy"—lands with conceptual cost (the midwife's implicit loss is honored rather than erased) and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wire adjustment becomes an act of commemoration rather than pure repair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock shop grounds the action through tactile micro-setting: the fogged dome, the thin wire, the felt washer, and the bone pin drawer all constrain repair choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is maintained (protagonist notices rhythm and condensation rather than scent), and the "rain script" breath-fog notation functions as workspace logic. Spatial choreography remains clear across the bench work. The screw's physical placement against the bone pin creates a material constraint that shapes the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting, though one or two figurative descriptions ("careful hands" air) edge toward stock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring history while restoring function—is signaled early and tightens when the midwife asks "if a birth went wrong this week." The protagonist's agency (warming hands, naming sounds, easing the screw "just a fraction") drives the resolution with visible cost: the convenience of full removal is foreclosed in favor of the shrine. The tightening is quiet but decisive, and the midwife's "breath that could have been a name" marks a felt release. No antagonist is required; the clock's stutter and the midwife's held-back grief supply sufficient pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—time as witness to human labor and loss—emerges through concrete particulars: the birthing clamp screw, the uneven drip, the quilt metaphor. The ending offers a non-literal answer ("water meeting time and finding mercy") without moralizing, and the protagonist's shift from scent-mapping to rhythm-mapping provides thematic through-line. The "unveil ordinary miracles" frame risks abstraction but is anchored by the on-page work of breath-fogging and wire-easing. Subtext operates cleanly in the midwife's jaw-set and the protagonist's refusal to "make confessions."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person voice is stable and distinct: the protagonist's perceptual signature (listening over smelling, reading pauses, exhaling to fog glass) is consistent and filters all observation. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Time for a first cry," "the screw is special"). One vulnerability: the final Master Isidor paragraph shifts briefly toward summary omniscience ("He hears it too"), a micro-distance slip that does not break focalization but loosens control. Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon, though "occluded views" in one line feels slightly elevated for the moment's urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (short declaratives during the repair, longer reflection in the opening). Two distinct issues lower the score: moderate figurative density in the opening third ("air moves like careful hands," "stories pool if someone waits beside them," "rain learning to speak") lacks pattern-teaching and risks overwriting, triggering −0.6; and one paraphrase loop near midpoint ("I do not argue... He saved me... He found me... He said") adds scaffold without pressure, triggering −0.2. The artifacts do not touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits the combined penalty to −0.8, but the spread across multiple paragraphs prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—clock repair as emotional archaeology, loss of one sense enabling another form of attention—feels specific and non-obvious. The birthing clamp screw as historical artifact embedded in functional machinery offers fresh transformation of the "repair as metaphor" trope. Risk-taking (lyric compression, Accumulative structure, quiet ending) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. The protagonist's refusal to remove the screw is a bold, non-default choice that commits fully to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-without-smell is seeded in the opening paragraph, drives the listening-based diagnosis in the repair beat, and shapes the closure choice (preserving history over convenience). The character's specific deficit enables the plot's central tactic. Two beats of involvement (diagnosis, wire adjustment) and closure linkage support mid-7s, but swappability (another sensory-loss profession could function similarly) and lack of on-page cost tied uniquely to *this* profession cap the score near 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The screw is introduced early (midwife's confession), examined mid-scene (lodged at the exit), and preserved at closure with the felt washer shrine. Three beats and closure participation clear all gates. The screw's dual identity—birthing tool and clock pivot—creates irreplaceability: removing it would break both the repair logic and the thematic charge. Visible cost (the convenience of extraction is foreclosed) and specificity (a birthing clamp screw, not generic hardware) push this into the 7.9 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is seeded in the protagonist's self-description ("my work is reading between lines"), enacted through the drip-diagnosis ("I hear apology, pride, fatigue"), and charged at closure when Master Isidor writes the ledger and the protagonist "read[s] between lines of his pen." The concept shapes the protagonist's tactic (listening for emotional subtext) and reappears in the final image. Three beats, closure participation, and causal pressure support 7+, though the phrase itself risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is claimed early and demonstrated when the protagonist asks "if a birth went wrong this week" after reading the ragged drip. The trait enables the midwife's unspoken confession and the repair's emotional dimension. Two beats (diagnosis, closure reading) and mid-scene constraint qualify, but the phrasing hovers near therapy-speak label territory and the trait could be paraphrased as "empathy" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Closure linkage (reading Isidor's ledger subtext) lifts it past 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Humanize" is announced as method ("To humanize this machine, I begin by warming my hands and naming its sounds"), enacted through the wire adjustment and felt washer addition, and charged at closure when the clock "sound[s] like forgiveness." The action drives the repair's emotional logic and distinguishes it from mere technical fix. Three beats, closure participation, and causal pressure (the warming/naming sets up the shrine choice) support high-7s. Swappability is low: "repair" alone would not carry the same emotional weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is seeded early ("work through occluded views and shallow angles"), enacted when the protagonist exhales to fog the dome and draw "rain script" notations, and implicit at closure when the condensation becomes part of the reading method. Two beats and mid-scene constraint qualify, but the method is mentioned more than it visibly alters tactics—breath-fogging is clever but does not dramatically narrow options. Closure linkage is indirect (the "trembling calm" and final reading echo the fogged-dome moment), limiting the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is anchored in the opening line, supplies the work bench and tools (glass throats, thin wire, bone pin drawer, felt washer), and its "place for unveiling ordinary miracles" becomes the thematic frame at closure. The setting provides the resources that shape the repair (condensation on the dome, the drawer's bone pin) and the spatial choreography (protagonist and midwife leaning over the bench) remains clear. Three beats, closure participation, and causal pressure (the shop's inventory constrains the solution) support 7+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" opens the story and sets tone, but the timeframe does not constrain decisions or create urgency. The fog returns as simile ("the midwife... her coat is damp") and the morning context implies the shop's opening routine, but no clock tightens tactics. Two touches (opening, midwife's damp coat) and atmospheric coherence reach mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure or closure participation caps the score. The timeframe is more tonal than structural.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is announced as motivation ("This is why I come each dawn") and drives the protagonist's acceptance of the screw-shrine choice rather than a purely technical fix. The desire is dramatized through the warming-hands ritual and the refusal to "make confessions," and it charges the closure image ("tiny applause shaped like water meeting time and finding mercy"). Two beats, closure linkage, and mild friction (the convenience of removal vs. the reverence of preservation) support high-6s, though the phrasing risks abstraction and the friction is quiet rather than agonized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is established in the opening ("the air moves like careful hands"), embodied when the protagonist and midwife "share the trembling calm of people who refuse despair," modulated under pressure (the midwife's "voice trembles into calm," her jaw "set... like someone holding back a hillside"), and charged at closure when the drops "speak in minutes... like forgiveness that remembers the work ahead." The tone coheres through all turns without flattening into static mood, and the final image synthesizes both tremor and steadiness. Strong closure participation and rhythmic control across beats support high-7s.</comment>
