<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is richly embodied through nerve regeneration imagery and the piano bench bolt as physical-emotional anchor. The decision to reverse the bolt pitch demonstrates contradictory impulses—need for safety versus ethical refusal—acting simultaneously in scene. The bellhop is handled with care: his gestures and tremor show constraint under duty, though his arc remains observational rather than decisively transformative. Minor: the final choice feels slightly over-articulated ("safety which murders testimony") where embodied action already conveyed the stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (fortress, nerve regeneration, bellhop) land by paragraph four; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a late Situational crystallization when the bolt is reversed. The closure achieves Charged Poise: reversing the bolt's pitch creates a hinge for future sound, foreclosing complicity and reconfiguring the fortress's balance with visible cost (the protagonist must now "stand with those whose hands kept the fortress breathing"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bellhop reveals the engine's function and the protagonist sees the ledger of "voices held in escrow." Cost is legible in the protagonist's spoken refusal and the bellhop's tremor, though the final image's conceptual weight slightly outpaces its dramatic immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, and the hushing engine supply vivid spatial grounding; the piano bench bolt and the engine's missing bolt create micro-setting pressure by charging the protagonist's choice. Sensory detail is dense but occasionally ornamental ("snow steamed from travelers," "rugs hushed every footfall") without altering tactics. The bolt threading and reversal sequence grounds the climax in tactile action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object constrain choice. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the path from vestibule to grand stair to blue door to lobby compresses slightly without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to bless safety with complicity or refuse and invite storms—is signaled early via the protagonist's stated search for "an answer" and "the cost of safety." One meaningful tightening occurs when the bellhop shows the missing bolt and the protagonist must choose; reversing the pitch rather than sealing the hush narrows options with visible cost (remaining to "stand with those whose hands kept the fortress breathing"). The bellhop's tremor and unshaped syllable provide a secondary pressure point. Agency is clear: the protagonist's decision to reverse the bolt forecloses complicity and charges the ending image with "a choir breathing in, getting ready."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of unpardonable silence versus safety emerges through the piano bench bolt (a fragment from "a cage we mistook for mercy"), the choir's muted labor, and the protagonist's refusal to seal the hush. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: reversing the bolt creates "a permission engineered into refusal" and the fortress "sounded like a choir breathing in, getting ready," reweighting the premise without stating a moral. The bolt's recurrence across setup, middle choice, and closure charges the final image. Minor: the phrase "safety which murders testimony is an unpardonable silence" borders on thematic statement, though the bolt action grounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; psychic distance is intimate and controlled throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("snow steamed," "velvet," "frostbitten hope thawing") that reflects the protagonist's heightened perceptual state during nerve regeneration. Diction remains within the narrator's register, though elevated phrasing ("seraphically mundane," "parliament of sensation") occasionally drifts toward the literary-essay register under peak pressure. The bellhop's silent communication via gesture and the protagonist's whispered and spoken lines are purposeful and goal-driven. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I saw," "I told him") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("bruise pressed against the horizon," "nerve regeneration that burned like starlight," "engine of shutters and baffles"), though some vehicles strain legibility ("a parliament of sensation debating," "frostbitten hope thawing just enough to prove it lived"). Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Minor loops: "seraphically mundane" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" recurs verbatim as a teaching moment but reads slightly mechanical. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. The bolt-threading sequence is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—a protagonist with trauma-induced noise sensitivity choosing whether to reinforce a fortress's enforced quiet—is specific and non-obvious. The piano bench bolt as both memory and tool avoids symbolic convenience by appearing early and driving the climax. The bellhop's silent communication and the hushing engine transform the "sanctuary under siege" trope through the moral calculus of testimony versus safety. The bolt's reversal ("a permission engineered into refusal") feels fresh and earned. Minor: the fortress's color and some sensory details ("twilight tea," "seraphically mundane") occasionally ornament without deepening stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The silent-choir bellhop is introduced early (paragraph four), guides the protagonist to the engine (middle beat), and witnesses the bolt reversal with a tremor and unshaped syllable (closure beat). His gestured question "why" and the throat-to-steel gesture create two distinct pressure points. His choices enable rather than drive the protagonist's decision, meeting the two-gate threshold with solid causal involvement. The bellhop's small rebellion (placing the bell and refusing to ring it) adds closure linkage but remains observational. Meets setup, development, and payoff gates; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but secondary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt appears in paragraph eleven as "a small steel memory," is turned "like a rosary" (beat one), recognized as kin to the blue door's handle (beat two), threaded and reversed in the engine (beat three, closure). The bolt's thread pattern creates causal pressure by enabling the hinge choice, and its reversed pitch directly shapes the ending image ("a choir breathing in, getting ready"). Early signal (+0.6), three distinct beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (+0.6). No frictions. Meets all three gates with strong irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unpardonable silence is named once near the end but operates throughout: the choir wards, the hushing engine, the bellhop's forbidden mouth, and the protagonist's refusal to "bless safety with complicity" all dramatize the concept on the page. The concept shapes the protagonist's central question ("whether the choir ever sang") and the bolt reversal (creating "a permission engineered into refusal"). Setup is implicit but clear by paragraph six; development occurs when the bellhop shows the engine's function; payoff is the reversed bolt and the choir "breathing in." The phrase "unpardonable silence" itself arrives late (paragraph twenty-six), lowering early-signal credit. Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Seraphically mundane describes the bellhop's tasks in paragraph five and reappears in paragraph twenty-nine to frame his rebellion. The trait characterizes the bellhop's demeanor but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost; it remains descriptive. The rebellion (placing the bell and refusing to ring it) is "seraphically mundane and perfectly brave," charging the final lobby beat with thematic resonance. Lyric reprise reweights the phrase, meeting setup and payoff gates but not middle development. Early signal (+0.5), lyric reprise (+0.4), ornamental use (−0.6), swappability (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Remain is stated as intention in paragraph twenty-seven ("I would remain long enough to speak when needed") and enacted in the final beats (standing with those who keep the fortress breathing, walking back with the bellhop). The action resolves the dominant stake: the protagonist chooses neither full departure nor passive shelter, but active presence with the hinge-bolt as permission. Setup is implicit in the opening search; development is the bolt reversal; payoff is the commitment to remain and the choir's preparatory breath. The action redefines options (active stance versus complicity or flight) and charges the ending. Moderate causal pressure; strong closure linkage; slight swappability (stay/witness could substitute with minor edits, −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase appears in paragraph eight, teaching the safe path past choir wards, and recurs verbatim in paragraph twenty-eight as the protagonist and bellhop retrace "not to hide but to remember the map of compromise." The method signals early and returns with reweighted meaning (from evasion to remembrance), meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the discoloration does not constrain the middle choice (the bolt decision) or alter tactics at closure; it provides atmospheric detail and thematic echo. Lyric reprise (+0.4), early signal (+0.4), ornamental middle use (−0.7), summary mention in closure (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow frames the opening and closing images, supplies the hushing engine as the site of choice, and creates the social pressure (fear-driven quiet, choir wards) that the protagonist must navigate. The fortress's color, snow, and internal spaces (vestibule, grand stair, blue door, lobby) are vividly described and constrain movement. The engine chamber is the locus of the climactic bolt decision. Setup is immediate; development occurs when the bellhop leads the protagonist through chambers to the engine; payoff is the fortress "sounded like a choir breathing in" after the bolt reversal. Causal pressure is moderate (the fortress enables rather than forces the choice); closure linkage is strong. Early signal (+0.7), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.2), some ornamental description (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Nerve regeneration appears in paragraph two, recurs as sensory detail throughout ("nerves sparked like snowfall," "numbness receded another grain," "lightning under my skin with patient ink"), and subtly tightens pressure by embodying the protagonist's vulnerability and hyper-awareness. The timeframe does not impose a live clock or deadline; instead it charges perception and grounds the protagonist's sensitivity to noise and quiet. Setup is early; development is consistent sensory layering; payoff is the receding numbness in paragraph twenty-four as the choice crystallizes. The frame is more atmospheric than tactical. Early signal (+0.5), consistent presence (+0.6), closure linkage moderate (+0.4), no visible deadline (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To understand the cost of safety is stated in paragraph three and dramatized through the protagonist's search, the bellhop's gestured question "why," the engine revelation, and the bolt decision. The motivation is conflicted: the protagonist seeks safety (borrowed crutches, need for shelter) yet refuses complicity ("I could not borrow its shelter without paying with my breath"). Friction between wants (rest, quiet) and costs (testimony, ethical stance) drives the middle and ending beats. Setup is early; development is the engine ledger ("voices held in escrow to pay for safety"); payoff is the spoken refusal and the bolt reversal. Early signal (+0.7), causal pressure (+1.3), closure linkage (+1.4), high specificity (+0.6).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Frostbitten hope is explicit in paragraph twenty-six ("a frostbitten hope thawing just enough to prove it lived") and implicit throughout: the protagonist's search despite trauma, the bellhop's tremor, the reversed bolt as permission rather than seal. Tone is cold, formal, and cautiously expectant, modulating from the bruised opening to the choir "breathing in, getting ready" at closure. The phrase itself arrives late, lowering early-signal credit, but the tonal current is consistent. Coherent through turns (+0.8), modulates with pressure (+0.6), charges final image (+1.0), late explicit naming (−0.5), slight abstraction (−0.3).</comment>
