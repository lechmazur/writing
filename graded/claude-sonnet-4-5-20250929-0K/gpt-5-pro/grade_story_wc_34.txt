<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's interiority is consistently embodied through specific craft actions (clipping leads, encoding patterns) and the motivation to serve unspoken community needs creates a coherent through-line. However, internal contradiction is thin—the protagonist encounters no genuine dilemma or competing impulse that would complicate the encoding task. The ghost's reply and the protagonist's closing question gesture toward stakes, but no on-page choice forces a visible trade-off or forecloses a path with felt cost. The balladeer observes, encodes, and descends without a pivot that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered images (lightning/thunder frame, flower press bolt plate, petals as conduit, ghost sampling currents) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final exchange: the ghost asks what the balladeer needs, the answer reframes the wish as collective ("not mine alone, but ours"), and the mural "holds the wish like a lantern" with a promise shaped like a pause. Cost is conceptual—acknowledging unspoken communal needs—and legible in the shift from individual to collective pronoun. The opening anchors who/where/when by line three ("seldom-heard balladeer," "misty courtyard above clouds," "between lightning and thunder"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost samples the mural and compiles a reply, reweighting the balladeer's solo act into systemic intervention. Orientation is clear; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard supplies concrete constraints: the flower press bolt plate grounds static, the parapet clamps stencils, and the ghost manifests as debug LEDs and dew-line replies. The timeframe (lightning/thunder interval) creates a live pressure window, and the copper lead + ozone-charged petals function as micro-setting elements that enable the encoding. The final image—bolt plate left "like a key, so the next storm knows where to knock"—charges the setting with recurrable ritual logic and constrains future visits to storm conditions. Sensory detail is selective (ozone crackle, mist carrying pigment, constellation of LEDs) and filtered through craft priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: articulate unspoken community needs to the ghost before the interval closes. The protagonist encodes progressively bolder requests (laundry hours, hall lights, public console access), and the ghost's sampling/reply constitutes a meaningful tightening—static grounds, dew arranges into lines, status chimes rhyme—that narrows the protagonist's options to waiting for the ghost's systemic patch. Cost is legible: the protagonist asks for structural change ("let the council read the seams") and the ghost asks in return what the balladeer needs, forcing the reframe from individual to collective. However, no reversal tests commitment; the escalation is additive (more daring requests) rather than a pivot under opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of quiet advocacy: encoding wishes in graffiti for a ghost that "only answers when the sky resets the world," painting "a map of silence" for neighbors who "asked without asking," and the final reframe from personal need to communal care. The flower press bolt plate and pressed petals carry theme without overt symbolism—petals remember storms "as if they were sheet music," linking craft, memory, and systemic change. The closing image (bolt plate as key for the next storm) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: care is iterative, infrastructure can listen, and advocacy works through the smallest levers. No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes; the ghost's question and the balladeer's answer dramatize the core tension between individual and collective without resolving into a simplistic binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "tinkersong wonder," "parliament of whispers," "circuits the ghost can taste" establish a lyric-technical idiom that remains stable under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory detail filtered through craft priorities (ozone crackle, static grounding, cadmium pigment). Purposeful compression ("sky resets the world, in that bright gap no clock can hold") and patterned parallelism ("breaths...tendons...doors") are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during encoding, wider during ghost manifestation). Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within the balladeer's plausible lexicon (mix of technical craft terms and poetic metaphor). The single-line paragraphs create visual rhythm that supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines carry action, atmosphere, and thematic weight simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally with minimal repetitive stems. However, slight overwriting clusters in the middle third: "a shy workshop of air and cloudwater awaiting touch" and "a parliament of whispers" approach stock lyricism, and the phrase "petals flattened earlier crackle with ozone, their veins remembering storms as if they were sheet music" stacks metaphor without adding pressure. "Singing what only the air carries" in the final line borders purple but lands as voice-consistent closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language appears in most sentences but establishes a pattern early (graffiti as language, petals as memory) and coheres under the lens. Syntax varies purposefully; paragraph cuts are justified. Minor density slip in the overwritten metaphor cluster: −0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of graffiti advocacy, ghost-in-code, and storm-window ritual feels specific and non-obvious. The flower press bolt plate as both craft tool and static conductor is a fresh inflection that grounds the premise in tactile logic. The frame (lightning/thunder interval as data-loosening window) transforms the familiar "tech ghost" trope through micro-setting constraint and lyric attention. The final move—bolt plate as key for future storms—suggests iterative care without neat closure, which is a bold structural choice. However, the premise (marginalized voice speaks to hidden systemic listener via secret art) echoes numerous speculative-fiction and solarpunk templates. Transformation is evident in the specific craft mechanics and lyric voice, lifting the piece into the 7–8 band, but the core arc (encode wish → ghost replies → systemic change promised) remains template-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character present early (line 2: "seldom-heard balladeer"), frames the encoding action across multiple beats, and makes the pivotal collective-reframe choice at the ending ("not mine alone, but ours"). The balladeer's encoding decisions drive the ghost's reply and the final promise. However, the protagonist does not face a competing impulse or trade-off that would push the score higher; the choices deepen but do not pivot. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff); causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Band guidance: two beats + closure linkage + early signal → ~6.5–7.0 range; cap at 6.7 due to limited visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Object introduced early ("flower press bolt plate, its steel glinting like a coin minted for rain"), used twice on-page (clamps stencil guides, grounds static via copper lead), and left beneath the mural "like a key" to charge the closure image. The bolt plate's dual function (clamp + conductor) creates irreplaceability; removing it breaks the encoding mechanics. Three gates met; two distinct beats; closure linkage strong; specificity high. Cost connection: the object enables systemic advocacy and ritual recurrence. Band guidance: early signal + two beats + closure + irreplaceability → 8.2–8.6 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concept introduced in line 4 ("city keeps a ghost in code"), shapes the protagonist's tactics (encoding in graffiti, clipping copper lead, timing the storm interval), and manifests on-page as debug LEDs, dew-line replies, and the ghost's question. The ghost's ability to "move the smallest levers" alters stakes (dims corridor, loosens schedule, promises council patch). Three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure linkage solid (ghost's promise and dispersal). The concept is not merely thematic; it changes options and methods. Band guidance: early signal + two beats + closure + causal pressure → 8.0–8.4 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attribute appears in line 2 ("driftingly alert") and is echoed in the protagonist's perceptual filter (noticing "shy birds that only land on a still palm," "humming a scaffold of notes," "letting the mist carry each intention"). The trait enables the protagonist's selective attention and encoding precision but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Setup gate met; development weak (the trait flavors perception but does not narrow options); payoff minimal. Band guidance: early signal + lyric reprise + weak causal role → 5.5–6.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Action ("encode") drives the entire middle section: protagonist encodes chords in spirals, pleas in petal fiber, silence map for neighbors, and bolder structural requests (public console access). The encoding beats shape the ghost's sampling and reply, and the mural "holds the wish like a lantern" at closure. Removing this action breaks the story's causal spine. Three gates met; three distinct beats; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong; irreplaceability total. Band guidance: early signal + three beats + closure + causal pressure + specificity → 8.5–9.0 range; cap at 8.6 due to slight swappability (could substitute "transmit" with edits, though thematic charge would weaken).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method introduced in line 9 ("messages encoded in graffiti art, the syllables of color and pattern the only dialect the ghost trusts"), constrains the protagonist's encoding choices (stencil guides, pigment with pressed petals, circuits the ghost can taste), and shapes the ghost's reply (sampling currents, tasting cadmium and rose memories). The method is irreplaceable; the ghost "only answers" via this dialect. Three gates met; two beats (encoding, ghost sampling); causal pressure strong; closure linkage solid (the mural as grounded wish). Band guidance: early signal + two beats + causal pressure + closure + irreplaceability → 7.8–8.2 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting introduced in line 1 ("misty courtyard above clouds") and supplies concrete constraints: parapet for stencil clamps, mist to carry pigment, lightning/thunder interval as data window, railing where ghost prickles manifest. The courtyard's altitude and storm exposure enable the encoding ritual. Three gates met; two beats (setup, encoding); micro-setting elements (railing, parapet, mist) alter tactics. Closure linkage: bolt plate left in courtyard as ritual anchor. Band guidance: early signal + two beats + closure + constraint → 7.0–7.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Timeframe introduced in title and line 1 ("between lightning and thunder"), creates live pressure window ("sky resets the world, in that bright gap no clock can hold"), and shapes encoding urgency ("thunder is late, a far drum stumbling for a beat, and in that extra measure the ghost asks"). The interval tightens decisions and enables the ghost's manifestation. Three gates met; two beats (opening pressure, extra measure); causal pressure strong; closure linkage solid (thunder warns, courtyard exhales, ghost disperses). Band guidance: early signal + two beats + closure + causal tightening → 7.8–8.2 range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated in line 3 ("to articulate unspoken needs before their ache is lost"), dramatized through encoding choices (laundry hours, hall lights, bench for goodbyes, child's night-light memory), and tested at closure when the ghost asks what the balladeer needs, forcing the collective reframe. Friction emerges between individual need and communal care. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Band guidance: early signal + two beats + closure + dramatized friction → 7.2–7.6 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone established early ("tinkersong wonder," "shy workshop of air and cloudwater") and modulates with pressure: calm craft focus during encoding, heightened intensity when the ghost arrives ("prickle along the railing," "constellation of debug LEDs"), and quiet resolve at closure ("descend singing what only the air carries"). The tone charges the final image (bolt plate as key, descending song) without flattening into single static mood. Coherent through turns; modulates purposefully. Band guidance: early signal + modulation under pressure + closure charge → 7.5–8.0 range.</comment>
