<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular ("root-bound visionary," "purposefully curious"), and embodied emotion operates throughout ("anxious elation," "trembling joy paced by fear"). However, the internal arc relies heavily on abstract self-description and symbolic merging rather than contradictory impulses creating visible friction in concrete choices. The covenant's completion reads more as mystical fulfillment than a choice that forecloses a path with legible emotional cost, and the girl's sudden appearance lacks sufficient grounding to create relational pressure that tests the narrator's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who: root-bound narrator; where: cobalt glade; when: dusk after premature future) arrive by the third paragraph. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric compression, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the covenant aligns, the glade and maze agree, and the pair steps into shared wind. Cost is gestured at ("roots loosen enough to allow breath," "ribs ring") but remains largely metaphorical rather than concretely felt as forfeiture or trade-off on the page, keeping the closure from higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection ("blue hush," "murmuring loam," "storm milk quartz"). The maze clipping functions as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's action when pressed to the wrist to create a map, and the setting's "paths wake under the grass" directly alters the final convergence. Spatial choreography between narrator and girl remains coherent despite the abstract nature of their joining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finishing the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the maze map welts, the girl's arrival, and the convergence toward the crosswind center. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the density increase and pattern acceleration (sap memories, bell rings in marrow, moths into geometry) provide one meaningful tightening. However, protagonist agency is diffuse: the narrator waits, listens, and is guided by the covenant and maze more than making choices that narrow options, and the cost of alignment remains largely symbolic rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—covenant, readiness, the cost of becoming what one is promised—emerges organically from the maze imagery, the premature future, and the joining through scars. The final image of stepping "into the shared wind without taking a step" and the covenant shining from within offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor an obligation when time has been violated. No overt moralizing, and the anxious elation charges the ending without simplifying the complexity of the transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices through a lens of roots, covenants, and mystical architecture ("scars the way bark knits after lightning"). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("storm milk," "marrow of the air," "ferrying the futures"), matching the visionary stance. However, the register holds one high lyric pitch throughout without modulation under peak pressure, and the girl's brief dialogue ("if I am the door or the person who stands before it") feels slightly more grounded than the surrounding narration, creating minor voice tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is lyric and propulsive with varied sentence openings and strong imagery. However, the piece suffers from density saturation: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight ("root-bound," "heart pinned to murmuring loam," "eclipse yields," "bell has finally become home"), creating ornamental accumulation rather than selective purpose. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated parallel constructions ("I feel," "I am," "We are"). Paraphrase loops occur ("The girl squeezes my hand, and roots loosen enough to allow breath" restates release already implied by the shared opening). These artifacts cluster in the closure approach, lowering the band and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of covenant, maze topiary as living map, and linking through scars offers a specific, non-obvious symbolic architecture. The "futures that arrived too soon" conceit and the room of sleep where unrealized evenings meet is fresh. However, the emotional core—mystical alignment through shared wounds—trends toward familiar visionary-quest templates without sufficient lived detail or moral calculus to transform the archetype. The piece commits fully to its premise but risks abstraction over grounded particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary frames the narrator's identity and anchors their immobility throughout. The character's decision to press the maze into the wrist and link scars with the girl drives two key beats. However, much of the arc is passive—waiting, listening, heeding—and the final "becoming what we were promised" reads as fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path. The visionary role shapes perception but does not create visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping appears early, is handled twice (tracing veins, pressing into wrist), and returns with reweighted meaning as the welts create a map that guides the convergence. Its properties—remembering "every wall it ever became"—directly enable the final linking. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, but it does not appear in the final image itself, limiting closure linkage credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is seeded in paragraph seven, structures the dominant stake (finishing what sun and shadow began), and shapes the climax when the pair "say yes with our wounds" and the covenant "slides into alignment." It constrains tactics (must link through scars, must wait for the crosswind center) and charges the final image ("the covenant shines from within"). Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated in paragraph four ("My mind is purposefully curious, not wandering by accident but seeking with a chosen hunger") and colors the narrator's stance of waiting and seeking. However, it remains largely a label rather than enabling or constraining a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait does not demonstrably shape a choice that another trait would not equally support.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Heed" appears three times: heeding the tremor of old agreements, heeding the trembling map, and the general posture of listening to sap and covenant. It frames the narrator's receptive stance and the final submission to the map's guidance. However, the action is passive observation rather than a decisive turn; it could be replaced with "follow" or "obey" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is seeded early ("movement here is...a seam, linking through scars"), taught as the mechanism when the narrator presses the maze into the wrist to create welts, and executed at the climax when the narrator and girl "lean together, linking through scars so our histories strike sparks." The method's mechanics—scars as braille map, convergence points ringing bells—directly enable the covenant's completion. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk anchors every beat, and its properties—paths waking under grass, the crosswind center—constrain the pair's convergence. The dusk timing ("the hour that should never come") creates urgency and the glade "shifts as though remembering its blueprint" in response to the maze clipping. The setting's response alters tactics and participates in closure, though the effect is atmospheric rather than providing tangible resources or obstacles.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the future arrives early" opens the piece and establishes temporal displacement, and "the shadow cheated time" explains the covenant's premature activation. The timeframe shapes the narrator's wait for "an hour that should never come" and charges the urgency of the final alignment. However, the timeframe remains conceptual rather than creating a live clock that alters tactics beat-by-beat; the narrator's wait is patient rather than pressured by diminishing time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find the intersection of dreams, where all sleeping roads cross and choose a single spark" is stated in paragraph thirteen and frames the narrator's goal. The motivation drives the movement toward the crosswind center and the final entry into "a room of sleep where all directions intersect." However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through friction or competing costs; the narrator's path is fulfillment without visible sacrifice of an alternate want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is named once ("I feel anxious elation, a trembling joy paced by fear") and embodied throughout the piece in the tension between waiting/binding and opening/becoming. The tone modulates from patient receptivity ("I listen to sap") through mounting intensity ("moths shiver into geometry," "bell rings in the marrow") to the climactic release ("we step into the shared wind"). The girl's tears and laughter and the narrator's trembling sustain the dual affect through the final image, charging closure effectively.</comment>
