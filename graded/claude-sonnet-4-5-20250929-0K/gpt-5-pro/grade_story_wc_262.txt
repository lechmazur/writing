<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystal gazer's motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is poetically framed but remains abstract; the character executes a psychometry reading with embodied gestures ("cradle it between my palms the way a bird might incubate an egg"), yet the interiority is largely observational rather than driven by contradictory impulses or visible internal cost. The manager trembles and watches but functions as audience more than pressure source. The ending choice to harvest clear leader and thread it through the projector is legible but feels predetermined by the premise rather than earned through on-page struggle or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—images and motifs layer toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (projection booth, crystal gazer, theater manager) arrive early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final threading of blank leader "glow[s] like mercy," reweighting unused love as transparent beginnings with undeniable pressure; the cost is conceptual (goodbye letters practicing vowels, a promise waiting) and felt in the image. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gazer moves from sensing to harvesting, narrowing options under the inferred lens. The causal through-line is soft—psychometry reading yields insight, harvest follows—but the accumulative design and charged final image hold the closure effect legibly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "projector purrs like hushed thunder," "carpet smells of heat and ghosted popcorn," "ceiling sheds glitter that used to be part of applause." The film strip as micro-setting ("perforations pulsing," "gutters between frames," "clear head of the reel") constrains the psychometry reading and charges the final image when blank leader is threaded and glows. Sensory selection reflects the gazer's spatially imaginative lens, anchoring reflection in concrete stimuli. The setting is indispensable to the closure unit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to locate where unused love is stored. The gazer's agency is observational and interpretive rather than contested; no on-page reversal complicates the search, and the manager's trembling does not escalate into opposition. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gazer identifies the clear leader and splice tape, narrowing from general sensing to specific harvest. The final act (threading blank leader, labeling the archive) reconfigures meaning but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path—cost is conceptual (letters "breathing together") rather than tactical. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and cadence shift, sufficient for mid-7s but not the tight escalation that would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unused love stored in transparent seconds theaters discard, goodbye letters shortened to fit time, adhesive holding what cannot be adjacent. The final image—blank leader glowing "like mercy," letters "breathing together, practicing vowels in the dark"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture and implication ("Hand me your oldest scissors... because the room is filling with letters that never learned to arrive"). The piece resists tidy closure, embracing quiet complexity. Minor slip: "gentle hands" in the final line tilts slightly toward thematic echo, but the image work absorbs it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "spatially imaginative," mapmaker idiom ("topography made of sprocket holes and splice tape"), sensory filtering through the psychometry frame. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though elevated throughout ("domesticated storm chained to gears," "sentences begging for boats"). Under peak pressure (the psychometry reading itself), syntax compresses slightly but voice texture remains consistent. The manager's direct speech is brief and functional; the gazer's idiom is singular. Minor density concern: stacked figurative constructions in most sentences risk overwriting, but coherence holds and the effect reads intentional for lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "projector purrs like hushed thunder," "alphabet of silver," "stairwells of kisses, emergency exits of regret." Clarity holds through layered images. Minor overwriting concern: near-adjacent metaphors occasionally crowd ("river," "boats," "ink trying to find its river") without adding pressure, and some lines paraphrase earlier content ("unused love resists ink" restates the prior image of smeared words). Template cadence appears in a few mid-section lines ("I feel... I search... I listen...") but does not dominate. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat. Information density is high; momentum builds toward the final threading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, film archival, and goodbye letters as stored emotion is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar trope (letters left behind) by literalizing emotional storage in clear leader and splice tape—particulars that constrain the closure. The gazer's spatially imaginative lens and the projection booth as crucible feel inevitable in hindsight. Lyric register and metaphor density risk proximity to poetic convention, but the occupational detail (sprocket holes, leader, shutter, adhesive) grounds the voice. The ending resists safety and commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crystal gazer present throughout; frames expectation early, performs psychometry reading mid-story, harvests leader and threads projector at closure. Agency is interpretive—observing, translating, instructing—rather than contested by opposition. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); middle development is observational but does constrain the harvest choice. Causal pressure moderate; the role is integral but the character's internal conflict is minimal. Closure linkage strong (threads blank leader, labels archive). Swappability low (the psychometry idiom is specific). Cost connection weak (conceptual rather than personal tradeoff on the page).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Film strip handled in multiple beats: brought by manager, cradled for psychometry, walked mentally as architecture, harvested (clear leader and splice tape), threaded through projector at closure. Setup early, development active (psychometry reading depends on it), payoff decisive (blank leader glows, charges final image). Causal pressure strong: the strip's perforations, emulsion, and clear leader enable the core action. Closure linkage high. Specificity high (sprocket holes, splice tape, leader, shutter). Cost connection moderate (emotional rather than tactical). Irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters shape the dominant stake: the gazer searches for unused love, identifies it in letters "shortened to fit time," and the envelope "fills with letters that never learned to arrive." Setup immediate ("People leave goodbye letters in all sorts of places"), development active (scenes on film strip are "goodbye letters written to the camera"), payoff clear (letters "breathing together, practicing vowels" in the harvested archive). Causal pressure moderate; the concept frames tactics but does not narrow options mid-story. Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate (letters as emotion rather than physical prop).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Spatially imaginative signaled early ("more mapmaker than mystic, spatially imaginative when hearts refuse to draw lines"), enables one on-page action (opening a map "made of sprocket holes and splice tape," measuring "distances with breaths"), and colors perception throughout. Two gates met (setup, middle development); payoff is thematic echo rather than decisive constraint at closure. Causal pressure moderate; the trait enables the psychometry method but does not impose a visible tradeoff. Swappability moderate (could be "visually intuitive" with minor edits). Cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Incubate appears literally ("cradle it between my palms the way a bird might incubate an egg") and metaphorically (unused love "incubates, patient and warm"). Setup early, development moderate (the gazer's handling of the strip sustains the image), payoff thematic (letters "breathing together"). One beat with embodied pressure; middle and closure use is figurative. Causal pressure low; the action could be "hold," "examine," "sense" with similar effect. Closure linkage moderate (metaphor sustains tone but does not drive final move). Swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Psychometry reading signaled early ("I perform a psychometry reading, not from crystal, but from emulsion"), drives the central beat (translating "alphabet of silver into halls and doorways," walking "those rooms in my mind"), and enables the harvest decision. Setup clear, development active (mechanics shape the search), payoff indirect (harvest follows from insight gained). Causal pressure strong; the method is the means. Closure linkage moderate (the reading completes before the final threading). Specificity high (emulsion, fingertips, frames as architecture). Swappability low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Projection booth present throughout as the exclusive location: projector, rewinder, film strip, sprocket holes, splice tape, shutter, clear leader all constrain and enable the gazer's work. Setup immediate, development continuous (booth supplies the resources for psychometry and harvest), payoff decisive (projector threads blank leader, booth "hums with hushed thunder"). Causal pressure high; the setting is indispensable to method and closure. Closure linkage strong. Specificity and irreplaceability very high. Cost connection moderate (conceptual rather than tactical constraint).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "while forgotten lyrics search for tune across the city" appears once mid-story as a lyric aside and returns in the ending ("forgotten lyrics might finally find their tune"). Setup mid-story (late signal, −0.3), no middle development, payoff is thematic reprise. No causal pressure; does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Swappability high (could be "while the city sleeps," "at twilight"). Closure linkage weak (cameo mention). Lyric-resonance allowance applies but modest (5.5–6.3 range), further reduced by late signal and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to find where unused love is stored declared early ("I tell him my motivation plainly"), drives the search (psychometry reading, identifying clear leader and splice tape), and resolves at closure (harvest, threading, archiving with "careful kindness"). Setup clear, development active (goal shapes all tactics), payoff on-page. Causal pressure strong. Closure linkage decisive. Friction moderate: the desire is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; no on-page obstacle tests commitment. Cost connection moderate (conceptual fulfillment rather than visible tradeoff). Irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hushed thunder established early ("projector purrs like hushed thunder"), recurs ("listen to the hushed thunder of the machine"), and charges closure ("booth hums with hushed thunder that no longer feels chained"). Tone coherent through accumulative layering: restraint, reverence, quiet intensity. Modulates with pressure (peak psychometry beat intensifies imagery, ending softens to "mercy"). Setup strong, development continuous, payoff decisive (tone shift from "chained" to liberated hum reweights the final image). Causal pressure moderate; tone supports rather than constrains. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high.</comment>
