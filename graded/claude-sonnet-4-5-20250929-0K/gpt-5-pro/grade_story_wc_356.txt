<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her herbalist skills are demonstrated through concrete choices (placing the flower on the swaying platform, positioning cedar baskets). Her interior access is consistent and olfactory focus creates a distinct perceptual signature. However, the character's journey lacks meaningful internal contradiction—she remains steadfast throughout without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the ending delivers serenity without visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mara achieves her goal of teaching stillness within motion, and the village learns to breathe through the stench. The escalation is legible (seed → vigil → bloom → ceremony), and the final image reweights prior material ("her own motion rested"). Cost is implied but not sharply visible: what path was foreclosed, what price paid? The piece holds its accumulative lens cleanly but the cost-proof test reveals only diffuse communal change rather than a single on-page sacrifice or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The treetop village is vivid and purposeful—rope bridges, swaying platforms, and the chosen "platform that swayed hardest" directly constrain Mara's choice and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong (olfactory filter dominates), and micro-setting (the swaying platform, cedar baskets) functions as setting at this length. The piece meets the 9+ gate by having environment constrain a choice and shape the closure, but scattered phrases ("wildflower hush," "tide's thought") occasionally drift into poetic abstraction without grounding in concrete spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: cultivate serenity within motion by teaching the village to endure the corpse flower's stench. One meaningful tightening occurs (bud swells, bloom bursts, crowd breathes together), and the protagonist's choices drive it. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or live option foreclosed—Mara succeeds without apparent cost, and no reversal tests her commitment. Thepiece meets baseline pressure under an Accumulative lens but does not reach the 8.0+ band's requirement of a felt price that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events: serenity as learned rhythm, not escape; stench divided into navigable parts; ambition as seed needing trellis. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer (motion resting, held by braided hands) without moralizing. However, some phrases ("undercurrent of wisdom," "tide of thought") risk abstraction, and the ending's communal satisfaction trends slightly tidy—no sharp counter-reading lingers. The piece resists platitudes and earns its insights through Mara's vigil and the ceremony, landing solidly in the strong band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (olfactory focus, herbalist lexicon). Voice carries distinct texture through purposeful compression ("matte as ash and light as a lie") and rhythmic control. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with immediate scene pressure ("cathedral of odor," "tide's thought"), and some metaphoric constructions risk opacity ("turning of the tide's thought" appears twice without clear anchoring). The piece teaches its lyric register early and maintains it, but the patterned abstraction slightly dulls urgency in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (journalizing calms her; doodles let thinking breathe). However, the piece carries template-cadence artifacts: runs of "she + [verb]" structures, and several paraphrase loops ("motion rested, as if held" echoes "serenity within motion" without added pressure). Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats (the bloom, the ceremony) without clear pattern payoff, triggering density and register-drift penalties. The final third remains legible but the metaphoric density ("tide's thought," "braided hands," "reed flute") slightly blurs propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—teaching stillness through controlled exposure to a corpse flower's stench in a treetop village—offers a fresh synthesis of herbalist expertise, olfactory sensitivity, and communal learning. Mara's use of cedar baskets to tune scent flow and her positioning of the flower on the swaying platform are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (patient herbalist succeeds without significant cost) follows a familiar teaching-story template, and the ending's communal harmony trends toward the safety middle. The piece avoids cliché through sensory specificity but does not take bold structural or moral risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's choices create multiple key turns: planting the seed on the swaying platform (setup), keeping vigil and guiding neighbors through storms (development), and positioning cedar baskets to tune the bloom (closure). Her ambition is dramatized through concrete herbalist actions rather than observation alone. All three gates met; causal pressure and beat involvement are strong. However, the final turn lacks a sharp cost tied to her ambition—she achieves serenity without visible forfeiture—which limits the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed appears in three distinct beats: Mara opens the cedar box and feels the seed warming her palm (setup, ~6% mark), she plants it and keeps vigil (middle development), and the bloom's burst drives the ceremony and closure (payoff). The seed's properties (rankness teaching stillness) shape Mara's tactics (swaying platform choice, cedar basket positioning) and charge the final image. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability push the score into the 7+ band; the seed is essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "undercurrent of wisdom" appears five times, framing Mara's listening practice and appearing in the final paragraph to signal closure. However, it functions more as thematic echo than on-page constraint—it does not narrow options or enable a specific tactic under stress. The concept shapes stakes abstractly (learning rhythm versus stilling sway) but remains label-level; if "patience" or "insight" replaced it with minor edits, the plot would hold. Early signal and lyric reprise earn mid-band placement, but swappability and lack of causal pressure cap the score near 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's olfactory sensitivity enables on-page actions with visible cost: she reads weather and caution by scent (setup), guides neighbors to inhale through willow masks during the bloom (middle tactic), and listens inside the stench to find "pepper, yeast, figs" (closure participation). The trait constrains her choice of profession and platform, and her perceptual signature (scent hierarchy) shapes the narrative voice throughout. All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, pushing the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in three beats: Mara journals her plan early, her journal grows thick with wrapping-paper maps across seasons, and she journals again after the ceremony to sketch patience as a spiral. The action enables her reflection and planning but does not drive a major turn—if she simply "planned" or "reflected," the plot would hold with minor edits. The action is present and purposeful but swappable; it supports rather than redefines options. Lyric reprise (early and final mention) and beat involvement earn mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The doodling custom appears in setup (grandmother's teaching, "breath was a bridge"), middle development (Mara sketches the flowering tower, maps wind and scent routes), and payoff (she sketches again on emptied wrapping after the ceremony). The method enables her planning and tuning of the bloom (cedar basket positions predicted by maps) but remains replaceable—notes on any surface would serve. Two-gate involvement (setup and development strong; closure mention is summary) and functional but swappable mechanics place the score in the mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The treetop setting pressures choices throughout: Mara chooses "a platform that swayed hardest" to prove the lesson (middle turn), rope bridges channel panic during storms (development), and the swaying platform charges the final image ("her own motion rested"). The village's constant motion motivates Mara's goal (cultivate serenity within motion) and constrains her tactics (she cannot create stillness, only teach rhythm). All three gates met; causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are strong. The setting is essential to the story's logic and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought" bookends the piece (Mara opens the seed box, then the ceremony occurs), and "Seasons braided" signals elapsed time. However, the timeframe remains abstract and does not tighten decisions—no live clock alters Mara's moves, and the bloom could have occurred at any point without changing tactics. Setup and closure mention earn two-gate credit, but lack of causal pressure (the turn does not narrow options) and high swappability cap the score near mid-band. The phrase functions more as lyric motif than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara's desire to cultivate serenity within motion is dramatized through her choice of the swaying platform and her teaching methods (masks, breathing rhythms). The motivation is signaled early, shapes middle tactics, and is echoed in the closure ("her own motion rested"). However, the motivation lacks friction—Mara does not face a trade-off between wants and costs, and no conflicting impulse complicates her serenity goal. Lyric reprise and beat involvement earn mid-band placement, but absence of on-page conflict between desire and price limits the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "wildflower hush" tone is established in the opening line and maintained through lyric phrasing, elevated metaphor, and sensory restraint. Tone modulates appropriately during the bloom (rank stench described, then parsed into components) and returns to quiet resonance in the final image. Coherence is strong and the tone charges the ending. However, the static mood (patient, contemplative) does not shift sharply under pressure—the ceremony remains serene rather than urgent—which limits dynamic range. Strong setup, coherent modulation, and closure linkage place the score in the upper 6-band.</comment>
