<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's face blindness creates a coherent perceptual filter—they misplace people but never boundaries—and drives the choice to paint sky-maps as a way to hold what they cannot recognize in faces. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between not saving the building yet giving it a knowable face. The father memory ("I never saw my father's face after the accident; it became a blank noon") feels slightly inserted rather than woven through pressure, but the vow to mirror sky for strangers grows organically from that loss. Micro-choices (whispering names, fixing gold dust where the rubbing directs) are present but carry minimal visible cost until the final note is left.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (condemned building, tree-trunk library, face-blind artist) land clearly within the first ~15% and hold. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered acts of discovery and painting, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the room births itself into "a portrait of days before faces" and the note offers horizon where none was expected). Cost is conceptual and felt—the artist gives the room a face they can know, foreclosing the option to flee before demolition. One micro-turn (finding the coin, pressing the rubbing, translating it to wall coordinates) tightens without requiring multiple reversals, fitting the lens and length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the coin map cross sits "where the trunk widens, where the guild carved its first shelf," and the wood is "warm despite the cold," agreeing to remember one more sky. Sensory hierarchy reflects the artist's priorities (dust like pollen, ceilings that breathe, plaster folds over human faces). The spatially specific coin-to-wall translation (each spiral points toward beam, hinge, seam) charges the final image. Spatial choreography (chemistry shelves, botanical index spine, nested tin, wall orientations) tracks cleanly across all beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the final work before demolition sirens break stillness—is signaled in the opening and sustained. Pressure tightens through the coin-map discovery, rubbing translation, and racing against the crane's cough; each act narrows options (find safe → decode → paint before the siren completes its test). The artist's agency (choosing to quicken without haste, whispering names, leaving the note) forecloses the path of simple escape with visible cost: they give the room a knowable face rather than fleeing. One meaningful deepening when the rubbing reveals coordinates and the sky becomes layered/folded "within" rather than "above."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—discovering limits as solace and compass, the sky folded within rather than above—emerges from the coin pattern echoing growth rings and strangled streets, and from the artist's inability to hold people but capacity to hold "rooms and weather and ash." The child's drawing ("Dad") and the father memory anchor the vow in specific loss without stating a moral. The final note ("The sky is not far, and it will not forget you") offers resonant answer without preaching. Minor slip: "discovering limits is my craft and curse" risks overt theme statement, though it is quickly embodied in subsequent wall-painting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I never remember who has eyes like rain; I remember the way ceilings breathe." Diction remains elevated and rhythmic ("dust drifts like pollen," "graphite dust blooms like night") but coheres as the artist's interior lexicon under contemplative pressure. No dialogue; single POV with stable focalization. Psychic distance is close and consistent. Minor rhythm risk: several sentence stems open with "I [verb]" in succession mid-piece, but the cadence modulates enough to avoid template monotony. Free indirect thought is clean; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer action, image, and interiority. Rhythm varies with pressure (short bursts at "I quicken without hurriedness" shift to longer breaths in the final paragraph). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor overwriting in mid-section: several adjacent lines deploy extended metaphors ("Graphite dust blooms like night," "lines emerge fractally precise," "pattern echoes growth rings") without break, risking density saturation. One template echo: repeated "I [verb]" stems cluster briefly around the painting sequence. Closure beat is clean and propulsive; artifacts do not touch it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist who paints skies inside walls offers a fresh synthesis; the coin-rubbing method and tree-library setting feel particular rather than stock. Emotional specificity (father's face as "blank noon") lifts the premise beyond quirk. The turn—sky is within, not above—grows from the coin map and feels earned in hindsight. Risk is present in the lyric accumulation and quiet ending. Minor conventionality: the condemned-building ticking-clock frame and the "secret safe disguised as book" trope are familiar, though transformed by the protagonist's sensory priorities and the tree-memory motif.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Face blindness is signaled early, shapes perception throughout (ceilings over faces, boundaries over people), and drives the choice to paint skies as knowable portraits. The trait constrains twice: it motivates the entire project and informs the method (listening for limits in stone, never misplacing a boundary's fade). Visible cost: the artist cannot hold people, only rooms. Appears in setup, middle choices, and closure note. Slightly shy of indispensability because the core plot (decode coin, paint room) could proceed with a different perceptual filter, but the emotional resonance and thematic weight depend heavily on this exact disability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The secret book safe (disguised as botanical moss index) is found mid-beat, releases the nested tin and coin, and reappears at closure when it "lies open like a mouth that has finally finished a letter." Two distinct touches with evolving meaning. The safe enables the coin discovery but does not itself constrain further choices; the coin and rubbing do the causal work. Closure reprise reweights it as metaphor (finished letter) rather than causal lever. Solid integration across setup, middle, and payoff, but the safe is more portal than pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" shapes stakes and tactics on every page: the artist's craft is finding the pulse and fade of boundaries, the coin map reveals limits (beams, hinges, seams where sky leaks), and the final image offers a ceiling that "tells you where you are." The concept drives the rubbing method (finding coordinates in recursive coils), constrains the painting (listening for limits inside stone), and charges closure ("The sky is not far" = limits collapsed). Appears early, recurs with escalating specificity, and is indispensable to both emotional arc and thematic resolution. Visible cost: the artist's solace is also their curse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is used twice: graphite lines "emerge fractally precise" and "fractally precise, the last lines lace corners with tiny migrating birds." The trait constrains method (the rubbing must capture recursive detail) and charges closure (each bird a life, each life a limit). It enables the coin-to-wall translation and shapes the final aesthetic. Cost is implicit in the time and attention required. Present in setup hint (pattern echoes growth rings), active in middle rubbing beat, and reprised at closure. Solid integration; not quite indispensable because "precise" alone might suffice, but the fractal recursion ties coin/tree/streets into a coherent visual logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crafting (painting the walls) is the protagonist's goal from line one and occupies the majority of beats: mixing lime/indigo/gray, painting east/west walls, fixing gold dust, lacing corners with birds. The act drives all choices (find coin to decode map, decode map to know where to paint, paint to finish before sirens). Closure depends on completion: "the room births itself" and the note is left only after the craft is done. Visible cost: racing the crane, quickening without haste to avoid fracturing scale. Indispensable; remove craft and the entire narrative collapses.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method (rubbing faint indentations on the coin) is signaled early when the guild whispers "the map can be read through faint indentations," executed on-page ("I press paper and graphite over it"), and its output (the rubbing pinned to the wall) reveals coordinates that shape all subsequent painting choices. The method enables the translation from coin to wall and charges the final sky-map. Two beats: discovery of coin + method statement, then rubbing execution. Cost is the careful attention required. Present in setup, active in middle, and its product (coordinates, constellation) shapes closure. Slightly shy of 8+ because the rubbing itself is not reprised at the end—only its painted output remains.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library hollowed by a scholar's guild anchors every beat: the tree's growth rings echo in the coin pattern, the guild's first shelf marks the coin-map cross, the trunk "widens" and "agrees to remember," the books' spines swell in wet lime. Setting supplies the coin safe, constrains spatial moves (chemistry shelves, carved shelf), and charges closure when "the library is no longer a room but a portrait of days before faces." The tree as living memory-holder is causally and thematically indispensable. Present from the opening image, active across all middle beats, and reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hush before demolition is established in the opening line, tested midway ("the siren tests its throat"), and presses tactics throughout ("I quicken without hurriedness"). The timeframe tightens decisions: the artist must finish before sirens break stillness, and the crane "coughs and stalls" deepens the hush rather than ending it. Cost is the forced tempo and the knowledge that the work will be demolished. The clock is live and legible, shaping every move. Closure lands just as the room "births itself" before the final note is written, implying the margin was narrow. Strong causal pressure and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire "to mirror the sky inside walls" is declared early and drives every choice: finding the code, decoding the coin, painting east/west/ceiling. Friction appears in "I am not saving the building; I am giving it a face I can know"—the artist accepts the building's destruction while still completing the work. Cost is visible: the effort, the racing clock, and the conceptual price of creating beauty for demolition. The motivation is tested when the crane stalls and the siren threatens, yet the artist continues. Present in setup (vow after father's accident), active across all beats, and fulfilled at closure with the note offering horizon.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Heightened stillness is established in the opening ("the city holds its breath," "the air is a held chord") and modulates with pressure: dust drifts, steps map memory, the hush deepens like a held oath. The tone charges the rubbing ("graphite dust blooms like night") and the final painting ("the room learns to exhale"). At closure, stillness reconfigures into breath and horizon. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and inseparable from the accumulative lens—each quiet act layers pressure until the room births itself. Minor risk: a few metaphors approach ornament, but all serve the stillness-as-container motif. The tone shapes every sentence and is indispensable to the final image.</comment>
