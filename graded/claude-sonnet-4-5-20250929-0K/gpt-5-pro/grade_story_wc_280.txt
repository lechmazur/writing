<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost narrator demonstrates consistent interior texture through synesthetic perception and purposeful micro-choices (flipping the coin, coaxing echoes, rehearsing with pears). The motivation to help Rowan is clear and embodied through concrete actions rather than abstract desire. Rowan's arc from despair to renewed agency is earned through the discovery sequence, though her interiority remains thin—we see her tears and cracked hands but little contradictory impulse. The ghost's renunciation (leaving the coin, drifting back) carries visible cost and forecloses direct intervention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning: synesthetic imagery densifies, the tarot coin seed returns reweighted, and the orchard's echo-mechanics accumulate pressure until Rowan's discovery crystallizes possibility. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the blueprint's recovery and Rowan's promise to return with volunteers reconfigures her stance from abandonment to action, with the ghost's whispered "Encore" and the orchard's honey-lime response charging the final image. Orientation anchors (ghost, theater, orchard-maze, after-hours) arrive cleanly within the opening third. The cost is felt—Rowan must risk hope again, the ghost remains bound to facilitation—and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mystic orchard-maze functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the pears chime, plums hum and sour if hearts lie, hedges rearrange in response to the coin flip, revealing the prop shed and blueprint. The synesthetic filtering (tasting lime-light, hearing hammers in plum, seeing pitch of silence) is specific to the ghost's perception and drives navigation. The tarot coin's light-catching blank side and The Star motif charge the closure image when Rowan leaves it on a branch. Spatial choreography remains clear across hedge-corridors, prop shed, and the dawn crew arrival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Rowan's recovery of courage/possibility, signaled early ("she thinks possibility has died"). The ghost's agency—flipping the coin, producing echoes, coaxing the orchard—tightens pressure by making the past accessible, which forces Rowan to confront her abandoned blueprint. The maze's rearrangement and the blueprint's reappearance create a meaningful tightening: Rowan must choose whether to risk hope again. Her promise to return with volunteers and the ghost's pre-dawn rehearsal with the pears to "tune the hedges to a softer path" show earned escalation with visible cost (renewed vulnerability for Rowan, continued facilitation-binding for the ghost). One clean deepening drives the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of possibility rescued from despair emerges organically through the echo-as-seed mechanics, the ghost's encore appetite, and Rowan's recovery arc. The tarot coin's dual faces (The Star / receptive blank) and the orchard's tuning to courage (cinnamon bronze, lime-to-honey) offer resonant, non-literal answers without stating a moral. The final image—"Encore, I whisper, not for me alone, and the orchard answers with lime turned honey, a promise warming the maze"—reconfigures prior material (lime cue, echo-mechanics, the ghost's appetite for repeats) into a collaborative renewal that resists tidy resolution. Subtext operates in the ghost's self-deprecation ("I am no savior") and Rowan's address to the hedges rather than the unseen helper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person ghost POV maintains stable perceptual signature: synesthetic filtering (taste footsteps, hear color, see pitch of silence) remains consistent and purposeful throughout, shaping navigation and perception. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("encore-seeking stage ghost," "cobwebbed spotlights," "rumor of coolness"). Rowan's single line of dialogue ("Please keep the path tomorrow...") carries goal and subtext without over-articulation. Brief compression under peak pressure (coin-flip sequence, hedge rearrangement) stays legible. No head-hopping; the ghost infers Rowan's state through observed action (cracked hands, steady eyes from crying) without claiming her interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (echoes-as-seeds, time-as-thread, light splashing in notes), but several lines layer metaphors without advancing clarity: "time here is a fractured timeline pruned into spirals" and "Dates grow like fruit, futures like blossoms, and the props of discarded scenes dangle as scarecrows to frighten off despair" read ornamental rather than pressure-driving. Paraphrase loop: "The orchard agrees by producing echoes...and the leaves taste like green brass hope" immediately after "the notes I coax sound as violet as summer dusk" restates sensory confirmation without new information. Rhythm varies purposefully in peak beats (coin flip, blueprint discovery), and information density is high in the closure sequence. Minor template cadence in the dawn paragraph ("and Rowan brings...and the hedge-shadows...and the blueprint unfolds") but does not obscure cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic ghost + fractured-timeline orchard + tarot-coin echo-mechanics offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The ghost's role as facilitator rather than savior and the orchard's tuning to courage (plums that sour if hearts lie, lime-to-honey progression) feel particular to this voice and setting. The echo-as-seed causality and the coin's dual-function (light-keeper and path-trigger) avoid template plotting. However, the community-nursery blueprint and gray-budget abandonment echo familiar nonprofit-hope narratives without sharp transformation. The ending's collaborative renewal (ghost + orchard + Rowan + volunteers) feels earned in hindsight but lacks a single bold inflection that redefines prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ghost narrator is present throughout and makes key decisions: flipping the coin at the maze tightening, coaxing the orchard to play Rowan's whisper, rehearsing with pears to soften the path. These choices create turns (maze rearrangement, blueprint discovery, dawn welcome). The ghost's renunciation (leaving the coin, drifting back to facilitator role) shapes the closure. Present in setup, drives middle beats via coin and echo actions, and participates in closure through the whispered "Encore" and final drift. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, but the cost (continued binding to facilitation) is implied rather than sharply foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tarot coin appears early (first third), is flipped at the maze tightening to trigger the path reveal (middle beat), and returns in closure when Rowan leaves it on a branch with The Star side out. Its dual faces (The Star / light-keeping blank) are used purposefully: the blank accepts and keeps light, the flip causes the hedge rearrangement. The coin's reweighted meaning at closure ("some light belongs to places, and this place belongs to beginnings") charges the final image. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (enables maze navigation), and closure linkage. Cost connection is light but present (Rowan relinquishes the talisman to the place).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fractured timeline is introduced early ("time here is a fractured timeline pruned into spirals") and frames the orchard's mechanics: dates/futures as growable items, echoes as seeds that are time. The concept enables the ghost to coax Rowan's earlier whisper and allows the maze to rearrange by "remembering rehearsals." It constrains middle action (the ghost must use echoes to access past moments) and supports the closure (the orchard produces future echoes of hammers and birds). However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the concept is told more than demonstrated through conflicting temporal consequences. Present across beats but swappable with "magic orchard" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced early ("I hear color, I taste footsteps, I see the pitch of silence") and used consistently: the ghost tastes lime-light, hears hammers in plum, sees pitch, feels roses glow orange. The trait enables navigation ("I follow the taste of lime") and orchard-tuning choices. It shapes at least two beats (coin-flip cue via lime, closure via lime-turned-honey) and charges the final sensory image. The cost is implicit (the ghost is "cursed, saved" by it) but not dramatized as a tradeoff on the page. Strong specificity and beat involvement, but the visible cost test is not fully met.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Intertwine" is signaled early as the orchard's method: "time is thread, and thread can intertwine if you hum it steady enough." The ghost uses it to make the fractured timeline relax ("like a harpist correcting a wayward string") and to weave past/future/present into the closure knot ("I watch the future thread through the past, then intertwine with the present"). The action drives the middle turn (Rowan's discovery enabled by timeline relaxation) and is present at closure ("a knot I recognize from a final bow"). However, the mechanics are largely metaphorical; swapping "weave" or "braid" would not break structure. Two beats, causal role, closure participation, but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Producing echoes" is introduced early as the ghost's method ("I do it by producing echoes, coaxing the orchard to play back a tone of her better hours") and used in the middle beat: "The air repeats her whisper, and the orchard answers." The method enables Rowan's recovery by making her past self audible. At closure, the orchard produces future echoes ("echoes not of applause, but of hammers tapping in time with birds"). The mechanics are signaled, constrain tactics (the ghost must coax rather than command), and shape the ending. Two beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; cost is light but present (effort required to "hum it steady").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard-maze is introduced in the first third and provides resources that alter outcome: pears that chime, plums that hum and sour if hearts lie, hedges that rearrange to reveal the hidden prop shed. The setting enables the ghost's echo-production and constrains Rowan's access to the blueprint (she must follow the lime taste and flip the coin). It is present at closure when the ghost rehearses with pears to "tune the hedges to a softer path" and the orchard answers with lime-turned-honey. Three beats, high causal pressure (discovery depends on maze cooperation), and strong closure participation. The hedge-shadows brightening "as if lit from memory outward" charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the business closes" is established early ("After the marquee darkens...I wake to my second life") and frames the ghost's access window. Rowan enters "after midnight," creating a ticking constraint (dawn arrives with the crew). However, the time pressure is loose—no urgency forces faster choices, and the sequence could stretch or compress without altering tactics. The dawn arrival provides closure setting (crew and coffee, ladder, paint) but does not tighten the prior decision. One gate (setup, closure setting) with minimal middle constraint. Functional but not a strong pressure lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" is stated early ("I want an encore for her...a reprise of courage") and dramatized through choices: flipping the coin, coaxing echoes, rehearsing with pears. The friction between the ghost's desire to help and the cost of remaining a facilitator (leaving the coin, drifting back) creates tension. Rowan's discovery and promise to return show the motivation succeeding with visible stakes (renewed vulnerability). The motivation drives two beats (coin/echo middle turn, dawn preparation) and shapes closure. Strong causal linkage and felt cost, though the ghost's internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone of "rising nostalgia" is coherent through diction ("velvet seats," "cobwebbed spotlights," "half-remembered applause," "final curtain") and modulates with pressure: wistful in setup, charged during the coin-flip and blueprint discovery, warming at closure ("lime turned honey, a promise warming the maze"). The ghost's attachment to encores and "final bow" imagery sustains the nostalgic lens. The tone supports the closure image (encore whispered, orchard answering) and reweights the opening's "encore-seeking" frame. However, "rising" is less distinct—nostalgia remains relatively stable rather than intensifying. Present across beats with purposeful modulation, but the escalation curve is gentle.</comment>
