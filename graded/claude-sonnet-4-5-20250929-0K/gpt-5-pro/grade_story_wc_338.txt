<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The map framer's perceptive, methodically curious nature is embodied through specific micro-choices: pressing the salt-warped map, waiting by the panel, counting breaths to match the henge stones. Interior contradictions emerge in the tension between professional distance ("shielded openness") and personal investment in the chapel's discovery. The final choice to leave the panel unsealed rather than secure it demonstrates earned stance crystallization with visible cost—professional protocol sacrificed for the chapel's breathing autonomy. Minor weakness: some reflection tilts abstract ("my reason for this work has always been") without immediate grounding in present stimulus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pressure builds through layered investigation (map → henge → vault → video comparison → chamber revelation) with each beat adding textural density. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the unsealed panel and "scar that told the truth without spectacle" crystallize a stance on preservation versus exposure with felt cost (professional completeness forsaken for the chapel's continued autonomy). The orientation test passes cleanly with anchor by line 4. One meaningful deepening occurs when video comparison unlocks the mechanism, reweighting the dominant stake from restoration to respectful access. Cost is legible in the final restraint and the incomplete disclosure on the farmer's chart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice throughout: the tear's "pale crescent" guides the search, the panel's draft reveals the mechanism, the narrow chamber frames the pollen-and-soot maps as fragile discoveries requiring care. Micro-setting (the handle "like a tongue dried mid word," the ribbon trembling in draft) charges tactical choices. The fresco vault functions as "an ear, cupped to the hill" that teaches the protagonist's approach—whispering rather than forcing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: salt blooms "as if rain had been arguing with the past," lichens "conquered," the hissing hinge "asking whether I would listen first." The final image of wheat-paste stitching and unsealed panel directly reflects setting's influence on closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to interpret and share fragile knowledge without violation) signals early through "shielded openness that soothes without inviting too much confession." Escalation unfolds through accumulative pressure: the tear's mystery → the sealed panel → the choice between forcing and listening → the discovery of breath-pattern maps → the final decision to leave access partial. One meaningful tightening occurs when the video comparison narrows options from brute force to attentive observation. Agency is dramatized through renunciation—the protagonist could secure or fully announce the chamber but chooses partial revelation. Cost is visible: professional closure sacrificed, future visitors must earn access through patience. The restrained ending "some places reopen when you whisper to them" articulates the trade-off with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (attentive care versus intrusive disclosure) emerges from concrete actions: pressing rather than prying, counting breaths, comparing silent footage, leaving the panel unsealed. The whispered-chapel concept integrates fully, teaching that knowledge-spaces require reciprocal gentleness. Subtext operates in silence itself—the videos "without sound," the chapel that "never raised its voice," the final instructions as "invitations" not commands. The ending's non-literal answer ("some places reopen when you whisper to them") reweights the premise without moralizing, transforming the restoration job into a meditation on epistemological humility. The moth-bit note's request and the protagonist's promise to "reopen their doors slowly" layer emotional and ethical resonance. No thematic echo; the insight is earned through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I felt the torn curve like a throat withholding a name," "stones like worn teeth in a careful mouth," "a rusted handle hid under lichens, the shape of a tongue dried mid word." Vocabulary remains consistently craft-specific and metaphorically grounded in embodied observation. POV distance is stable; focalization never leaks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the panel investigation, slightly elevated in the final restoration beat to allow thematic resonance without didacticism. Compression in peak moments (video comparison, panel opening) maintains voice texture. Minor slip: "because my reason for this work has always been to interpret silence with empathy" edges toward articulated mission statement rather than dramatized stance, though the surrounding beats recover through specific action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance situation and character simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer accumulative sentences during investigation, shorter beats at the panel opening. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated: the henge as "worn teeth," the handle as "tongue dried mid word," rain "arguing with the past." Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor density lapse: "I asked for the address and the farmer only pointed, palm cupping a north so general it felt like refusal" is elegant but could compress slightly. Some figurative density in descriptive passages (fresco vault, saints' eyes, tidal stains) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching, though the lyric mode absorbs it. No template cadence, clean syntax, strong propulsion through the investigation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, silent-film investigation, and epistemological restraint feels specific and non-obvious. The use of comparative video analysis to unlock a physical mechanism is fresh and grounded in plausible craft knowledge. Emotional arc (professional detachment → invested care → disciplined restraint) avoids template resolution by ending in partial disclosure rather than triumphant revelation. The whispered-chapel frame transforms the restoration-plot trope through the protagonist's methodical patience and the final choice to preserve mystery. Minor limitation: the "chapel that hears confessions from the wind" and breath-pattern maps edge toward symbolic convenience without full causal grounding in how such maps were made or why they required sealing. Transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would lose the cartographic specificity and silent-archive methodology.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The map framer's perception drives three key beats: recognizing the tear's significance (setup), using video comparison to solve the panel (development), and choosing partial disclosure in the final restoration (payoff). Early signal in paragraph 1. The trait "perceptive" enables the video-comparison tactic and constrains the final choice—professional completeness could demand full documentation, but perceptiveness leads to restraint. Causal pressure is clear: observation narrows options from force to patience. Closure linkage strong: the unsealed panel and invitation-style instructions reflect the character's interpretive stance. Irreplaceable: a less perceptive character would miss the draft-ribbon cue or force the panel.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The henge appears in three beats: the farmer's pointing gesture (setup), spatial landmark during the walk (middle), and the breath-counting ritual before entry (payoff). Its "worn teeth" image recurs with slight reweighting. The protagonist counts breaths "to the number of stones standing in the ancient henge," linking the henge's patient endurance to the approach required for the chapel. However, the henge does not directly constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions more as atmospheric anchor and thematic echo. Swappable with another durable landmark (e.g., old trees, cairns) without breaking causality. Present and purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The whispered-chapel concept shapes stakes from the outset ("a chapel that never raised its voice") and dictates tactics throughout: the protagonist refuses to force the panel because "a whispered chapel does not open for shouting." The concept appears in setup (paragraph 7), constrains the middle investigation (video comparison replaces force), and charges the payoff (unsealed panel, gentle instructions). Causal pressure is strong: the chapel's nature forecloses brute-force options and mandates patience. Closure depends on it—the final stance of "some places reopen when you whisper to them" would collapse without this frame. Irreplaceable: substituting a standard ruin would gut the story's epistemic and ethical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" enables the video-comparison tactic (setup in paragraph 3: "I am methodically curious, the sort who trims ragged edges and asks why the raggedness formed at all") and constrains the closure choice—curiosity drives investigation, but method demands respectful process. The trait is dramatized in the step-by-step video analysis and the decision to wait rather than rush. One visible trade-off: methodical patience costs time and risks failure, yet the protagonist prioritizes process over speed. Present in two beats (investigation and final restoration) with causal weight. Not fully indispensable—"patient" or "careful" could substitute—but the dual valence (curious + methodical) sharpens the tension between discovery drive and procedural restraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the story's central action, signaled early (paragraph 12: "I decided to reopen the sealed panel") and executed in the climax (paragraph 18: "The panel lifted on a hissing hinge"). The action shapes three beats: the decision to reopen (setup), the video-comparison method that enables it (development), and the choice to leave it reopenable rather than secure it (payoff). Causal pressure is maximal: the entire investigation aims at reopening, and the final ethical choice hinges on whether to reopen permanently or conditionally. Closure depends on it—the protagonist's stance "some places reopen when you whisper to them" literalizes the act. Irreplaceable: "unlock" or "access" lack the semantic charge of reversing a prior sealing with ongoing consequences.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (paragraph 12: "by comparing silent video footage from decades apart, trusting patience over strength") and executed across three beats: requesting the footage (setup), analyzing the ribbon and abrasion (development), and using the draft cue to solve the mechanism (payoff). The method's mechanics matter: the ribbon's lift reveals draft direction, the abrasion shows habitual touch, and their combination teaches the opening sequence. Causal necessity is high—without video comparison, the protagonist cannot bypass force. The method also charges the closure by modeling the story's epistemology: silent observation over intrusive intervention. Minor weakness: the mechanics of how pressing "there and then to the right" follows from the video cues could be slightly more explicit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault appears in setup (paragraph 8), supplies atmospheric pressure (the saints' "shy gray" eyes "followed everything"), and indirectly shapes the protagonist's reverent approach. The vault's acoustics and moisture ("damp air breathed through the seam") teach that the space is alive and responsive. The sealed panel within the vault is the proximate object of investigation, and the vault's "ear, cupped to the hill" metaphor reinforces the listening stance required. Present in two beats (discovery and investigation) with thematic weight. Not fully indispensable—another enclosed space could serve—but the fresco's weathered fragility and the vault-as-ear image charge the protagonist's tactical choice to wait and listen.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" functions as conceptual anchor rather than temporal constraint. It appears in setup (paragraph 5: "At the spot where a map tears... the parchment had buckled into a pale crescent") and recurs in the video-analysis beat (paragraph 16: "The abrasion drew a low moon exactly where the map had torn"). The tear guides spatial investigation and charges the final image of stitching "a scar that told the truth without spectacle." However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the protagonist's investigation proceeds without time pressure. Present in two beats, thematically resonant, but replaceable with another spatial marker without breaking causality. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to interpret silence with empathy" is stated in paragraph 6 and dramatized across four beats: the initial map investigation, the refusal to force the panel, the video-comparison method, and the final choice to leave partial access. Friction between the desire to know and the cost of intrusion drives the entire arc. The protagonist's professional identity ("hired as much for my ears as for my steady hands") ties the motivation to livelihood, adding stakes. The ending explicitly returns to "shielded openness, offering care without prying," closing the motivational loop. One weakness: the paragraph-6 articulation ("because my reason for this work has always been") edges toward tell rather than embodied discovery. Nonetheless, the motivation constrains choices with visible cost and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tone of "shielded openness" is established in paragraph 2 ("I keep a shielded openness that soothes without inviting too much confession") and maintained through descriptive restraint, careful sensory selection, and syntactic patience. The tone modulates with pressure: tighter, more embodied during the panel investigation; slightly elevated and lyrical in the final restoration beat. The ending's "offering care without prying at thresholds and borders" directly reprises the opening tone, reweighting it with earned experience. The whisper motif and silence of the video footage reinforce tonal coherence. The tone charges the final image by making restraint feel generous rather than withholding. No register breaks or tonal incongruities; the shielded-yet-receptive stance remains consistent across all beats.</comment>
