<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief, guilt, and desire to reconnect with her brother are embodied and drive micro-choices throughout—her pocket chrysalis, her decision to build the bridge, her apology. Internal contradiction appears when she intellectualizes relationships as reactions to filter, then recognizes the error on the page. The brother remains underdeveloped; his thumbs-up icon and single scene limit relational pressure. Motivation coheres and the final choice—catching his elbow, releasing the chrysalis—feels earned, though the brother's forgiveness arrives quickly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (polymer chemist, ravine, grief over brother) land by ~100 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the bridge-test, shared laughter, and chrysalis release reweight separation into nascent connection with visible cost (her acknowledgment of error, his willingness to step onto fragile filaments). The ravine-as-rehearsal-room motif accumulates density and the final image—"loosened grief became something that could breathe, bend, and, given time, rejoin the human chorus"—reconfigures the dominant stake. One persistent constraint (the polymer's need for mutual weight) shapes the ending. Cost is legible in Mira's continued practice of atonement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine constrains Mira's bridge design (filaments respond to current, require mutual step) and charges the final image (streams braiding pressures into one mouth mirrors the sibling reconciliation). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: froth patterns, hissing water, blue hour frogs. The chrysalis functions as micro-setting/recurring object, tied to her wrist and released at closure. Spatial choreography is clean during the bridge-crossing. Minor: the field spectrometer and adhesive-sketching remain tools without pressing choice-impact; they add occupational color but don't alter tactics in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection with brother) is signaled early and tightens through the message, his delayed thumbs-up, and the bridge test. Agency is present: Mira's decision to build the polymer bridge, her on-page apology, and their shared crossing narrow options and foreclose the path of separation. One meaningful deepening occurs when he slips and she catches him—shared vulnerability crystallizes the shift. The brother's arc is compressed; his acceptance arrives in one scene without visible struggle, slightly softening the earned trade-off. Cost is legible: Mira's acknowledgment of wrongness and the promise of ongoing practice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (separation, connection, atonement) emerges from particulars—polymer braiding, ravine eddies, chrysalis departure—without thesis-statement. The final image (loosened grief that can "breathe, bend, and rejoin") answers the question obliquely through action and metaphor. Mira's insight ("treat people like controllable reactions" was wrong) is earned by the bridge-building and river-listening. Minor slip: "As the pieces fall into place…not a click but a chord" nearly edges into overt metaphor-declaration, though it stops short of moralizing. Subtext operates in the thumbs-up icon, the brother's "maybe we both shed something," and the chrysalis release. No forced recurrence; motifs accumulate and resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; perceptual signature (symphonic listening, molecular metaphor) is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext: "maybe we both shed something" and the brother's silence until evening. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("symphonically minded," "translating separation into connection") but remains within a chemist-narrator's idiom under the accumulative lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during apology, wider during ravine observation). Purposeful compression ("they argued…he had left town, leaving a silence") efficiently anchors backstory without stalling. Minor: "teeter" and "afterquiet" are slightly precious but defensible as voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("streams laced and unlaced like nerves remembering a song," "grief loosen like a knot warmed by breath"). Information density is high. Minor overwriting cluster in the opening third: "zipper of departure," "lengthened like winter," "muted C" stack metaphor without clear pressure. Template-stem run: "She told him…He picked up…She nodded…They stepped" appears in the brother's arrival sequence (~4 adjacent beats, −0.4). No paraphrase loops or major filter-verb stacks. Clarity at closure is clean. Figurative density in early exposition slightly drags momentum but does not obscure cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Premise—polymer chemist applies molecular braiding insight to sibling reconciliation via a responsive bridge—is specific and non-obvious. The ravine as rehearsal room and chrysalis as grief metronome feel fresh and particular to Mira's voice. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the polymer-chemistry lens and river-foam insight. Minor derivative note: "science + estrangement → experimental reconciliation" is a familiar template, though the polymer-filament execution and the mutual-weight constraint elevate it. Emotional specificity (her pocket chrysalis, his thumbs-up delay) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking is moderate; the accumulative/lyric mode succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira drives all key turns: leaving the lab, tracing foam patterns, building the bridge, sending the message, apologizing on-page, catching her brother's elbow, releasing the chrysalis. Present throughout; decisions alter tactics and charge closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chrysalis appears in beat 1 (tucked in pocket), beat 2 (tied near her wrist at bridge construction), beat 3 (brother turns it in light), and beat 4 (released on water at closure). Each touch reweights meaning: from grief metronome to shared symbol of departure to final letting-go. Strong setup, development, and payoff; cost tied to release. Not indispensable—story could substitute another object—but well-integrated across arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Divergent path" is named once early ("Leaving the lab was a divergent path she had not planned") and implied in the brother's "flew in crooked directions." It frames the atonement arc but does not constrain on-page choices; Mira's bridge-building is the active stake. Functional setup and thematic accent; middle development is thin. Lyric reprise at closure (crooked paths reuniting) reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is named once in opening and enables her listening to ravine rhythms and polymer design as score. It colors perception (the "muted C," "rehearsal room," "chord" at closure) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Functional perceptual filter; does not reach causal pressure. Setup clear, closure echo present, but swappable with "pattern-oriented" or similar trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Atone" is the central engine: Mira's motivation from beat 1, her bridge-building as atonement-in-matter, her on-page apology ("I had been wrong"), and her final vow ("practice she would keep playing"). Every major turn traces to this action. Removal would collapse the arc. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost (ongoing practice, no absolution). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>River foam patterns are traced in beat 2 ("an insight gained tracing river foam patterns, a score of white punctuation") and inform the polymer filament design that responds to current. The method shapes the bridge's mechanics (lines take tension from flow) and thus the climactic crossing. Setup by first third, development (filaments learn from flow), payoff (crossing succeeds). Cost indirect but present (design risk). Not irreplaceable—another natural model could serve—but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Braided ravine pressures every beat: three streams teach Mira to braid/unbraid polymers, the channels require a bridge, current shapes filament tension, water hisses during crossing, and the final image mirrors ravine braiding ("pressures into one river mouth"). Setup immediate, development (anchoring lines to roots, testing filaments), payoff (crossing and metaphor). Micro-setting (chrysalis under alder root, frogs, heron) enriches. Environment constrains design and charges closure; removal would break logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"As the pieces fall into place" appears once in the climactic crossing beat. Time markers are vague: "dawn," "evening," "blue hour," "first light" sequence events loosely but do not tighten decisions. No live clock; the brother's delay ("did not answer until evening") is the sole temporal pressure. Present as metaphor at closure but does not constrain tactics. Late signal, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Translate separation into connection, first in matter, then in family" is named early and dramatized throughout: polymer adhesives that refound each other, the bridge requiring mutual step, the apology, shared laughter, chrysalis release. Friction appears in Mira's self-doubt and the brother's silence. Cost is visible (acknowledgment of error, ongoing practice). Setup clear, development across beats, payoff at closure. High causal pressure and specificity; indispensable to arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Loosened grief" is invoked explicitly twice (beat 3: "letting her grief loosen like a knot warmed by breath"; closure: "loosened grief became something that could breathe"). Tone modulates from melancholy/determination (lab departure, ravine listening) to tentative hope (thumbs-up icon "crack open like a seed") to shared vulnerability (laughter, teeter) to charged release (chrysalis sinking, "afterquiet"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image. Strong setup and payoff; middle development present but could be more embodied in gesture.</comment>
