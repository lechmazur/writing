<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The therapist narrator's motivation to "nurture lifelong wonder" and "softly adaptive" method are shown through micro-choices: asking permission, waiting for Felix's response, refusing to "force sound from a throat that needed time." Felix's journey from silence to singing "mama" is earned through the bowl/heel call-and-response sequence. Interior contradiction appears in the narrator's "cautious exuberance," and Lena's whispered dream versus acceptance of slow process shows embodied tension. Minor: the therapist's professional expertise reads as gentle but lacks a visible personal cost or blind spot that complicates the session.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by line 5. The eclipse functions as both structural frame and accumulative pressure device; the bowl-singing/Felix-tapping exchange deepens incrementally, culminating in Felix singing "mama" during totality—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the word, tears held "like stars at dawn," and the eclipse's return to light reweight prior silence with undeniable felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when Felix moves from heel-tap to touching the curl to the bowl, narrowing his resistance. Cost is visible: Lena's held tears, the plan for "simple steps," and Felix's "path we could trace later" all signal ongoing work rather than a cure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is anchored early with crushed sage, dust, juniper, and spatial position ("lower, near the roots") that contrasts the town uphill. The setting constrains choice: staying "lower" to avoid spectacle, the tree's "lacework shadows" marking time, and the ground that "records and returns." The bowl and curl function as micro-setting objects that charge the final beat when Felix touches curl to rim. Sensory hierarchy reflects the therapist's professional filter: tone, breath, rhythm dominate over visual tourism. The eclipse's progression (crescent, blue dimming, corona, return) provides concrete time markers that tighten the ceremony's window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bringing Felix's voice back without force, explicitly framed early ("not to force sound"). Escalation is textural/accumulative: hum → bowl hum → Felix whisper-pitch → heel tap → curl-to-bowl tap → "mama" → "small, sturdy vowels." Each step narrows Felix's resistance and raises emotional cost. Agency belongs to Felix (his nod, his tap, his touch, his word) and the therapist (her adaptive waiting). The eclipse coincidence complicates timing but does not resolve; resolution comes from Felix's choice to sing. Cost is legible: Lena's "tears that did not fall," the acknowledgment of "not a cure, but a beginning," and the plan for ongoing practice all signal the path ahead requires sustained work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—voice as presence that "never leaves, only changes addresses"—emerges from the curl (memory), the bowl (resonance), and the eclipse (cyclical return). "Ordinary magic" operates through attention rather than spectacle; the piece refuses tidy resolution ("not a song yet, but a path"). The curl's return with reweighted meaning (first haircut innocence → present mother's held hope) and Felix singing "mama" during totality offer a non-literal answer: connection remade through ritual and patience. Subtext operates in Lena's whispered dream, Felix's thumbnail tapping "a rhythm he did not yet trust," and the quiet "large enough for wonder to grow." No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph; the image of Felix's hand in Lena's and carrying "the quiet like a seed" resonates without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and voice-particular: "I travel light and listen heavy," "attention shaped like tone," "voices never leave, they only change addresses." Perceptual signature is professional-sensory (sound, breath, rhythm dominate). Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—slightly poetic but grounded in therapeutic idiom. Minor slips: "tears that did not fall, held like stars at dawn" edges toward elevated register in a high-pressure beat, and a few filter verbs ("I felt the pulse") soften immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Lena's whispered lines and the therapist's assurances carry subtext. No mid-paragraph tense or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("lacework shadows," "tears...held like stars," "quiet like a seed"). Minor overwriting: "shadows sharpened like careful pencil lines" and "a silence so clean it felt rinsed" cluster metaphor in adjacent lines. One paraphrase-loop candidate: "We waited for the first bite of shadow" / "When the light thinned" restates the eclipse's onset. Stock metaphor: "tucked like a heartbeat" in the opening. No template cadence or major scaffold. Propulsion is steady; no loops obscure the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The eclipse-as-ceremony frame is familiar but executed with specificity: the curl as memory anchor, the bowl call-and-response, and the "lower, near the roots" positioning offer a non-obvious angle on voice recovery. The therapist's "cautious exuberance" and refusal to chase the voice distinguish the approach from generic healing narratives. Risk is modest: the accumulative design and quiet closure rely on lyric resonance rather than plot surprise. The story commits fully to its premise and avoids safety-middle hedging, but the core setup—therapeutic breakthrough during a natural event—echoes writing-prompt templates. Transformation is present in the specificity of sage, juniper, and the curl's tactile use, lifting the piece above derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The therapist's choices create key turns: asking permission, initiating the bowl, proposing call-and-response, holding the curl, and designing the post-session plan. Present in setup (arrival with bowl), middle development (adaptive method choices), and closure (handing back the curl, writing the plan). Causal pressure: the therapist's refusal to force sound enables Felix's voluntary participation. The "softly adaptive" trait constrains tactics (waiting, not chasing). Cost is mostly relational/professional satisfaction rather than personal sacrifice, but the decisions are irreplaceable and shape the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The curl appears in setup (Lena places it by the bowl), middle (therapist asks to hold it, Felix touches it to the rim), and closure (handed back, pressed to Lena's lips). Functionally different beats: memory anchor → ritual object → returned keepsake with reweighted meaning. Causal role: linking "the feel of that first haircut" to present sound enables Felix's breakthrough. The curl's tactile use (touching the bowl) triggers the "bell so round it seemed to bow" and Felix's "mama." Specificity: baby hair curl is irreplaceable; a generic memento would lack the sensory and temporal link. Cost: Lena's tears and the curl's return signal ongoing need, not closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named in the opening and closing, framing the piece thematically. Middle dramatization: "ordinary magic rides on quiet details," the bowl making air "curious," Felix's whisper, the shared silence "so clean it felt rinsed." The concept shapes stakes (wonder over cure) and tactics (attention, not spectacle). It does not introduce a new ability or constrain a physical choice, so causal pressure is thematic rather than plot-mechanical. Present in setup (named), development (illustrated through small attentions), and closure ("ordinary magic of attention" thanked). Swappability: "quiet presence" or "mindful attention" could replace with minor edits, indicating mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is labeled in the opening and shown on-page: "like water finding a cup," asking permission, waiting for Felix's nod, proposing call-and-response, and adjusting to his heel-tap instead of vocal reply. The trait constrains tactics (no forcing) and enables Felix's voluntary participation. Present in setup (declared), middle development (demonstrated through waiting and invitation), and closure (the written plan is "softly adaptive" with "simple steps"). Causal pressure: the method's flexibility allows Felix to choose his entry point (heel tap), which leads to the bowl touch and singing. Cost: patience over speed, process over cure. One swappability note: "gentle" or "flexible" could substitute with edits, but the specific phrase recurs and unifies the method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Link" drives the action: the therapist's stated intention to "link breath to rhythm," the explicit instruction to "link the feel of that first haircut...with the sound we made," and the final "link" settling when Felix takes Lena's hand. Present in setup (goal stated), middle development (linking curl memory to bowl sound), and closure (the hand-hold link and plan to "link breath to rhythm each morning"). Causal pressure: the linking instruction enables Felix's touch-and-tap that produces "mama." The action is irreplaceable; removing "link" would require rewriting the therapeutic method and the closure image. Cost: the link is "not a cure, but a beginning," signaling ongoing work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in setup ("the town was waiting"), frames the middle action ("We waited for the first bite," crescent, totality, "the sun slipped free"), and structures closure (Felix's singing during totality, light's return marking transition to the plan). The eclipse's mechanics matter: it provides the ceremonial window, the "blue of old photographs" dimming, the corona as witness, and the two-minute breath that the world "listened with us." Causal pressure: the eclipse creates urgency (a time-bound window for the shared moment) and symbolic charge (cycles, return, re-emergence). Specificity: another natural event would lack the cultural weight and precise timing. Cost: the eclipse's rarity underscores the ceremony's significance and Felix's breakthrough as non-repeatable in that form.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is present in setup (title, "crushed sage and dust"), development (spatial contrast with "the town gathered uphill, but we stayed lower, near the roots"), and closure (hiking "the slope toward the noise"). The setting supplies resources: the juniper's shade and "lacework shadows," the ground that "records and returns," and the positioning "lower" that enables privacy for the ceremony. Causal pressure: staying away from the crowd allows the intimate ritual; the tree and ground anchor the sensory frame. Swappability: another quiet natural site could serve with edits, but "sage" ties to the regional idiom and the Ridge's naming. Cost: choosing the lower site over the town spectacle reflects the therapist's values (intimacy over display).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears in setup but does not function as a timeframe; it reads as a spatial/atmospheric descriptor. The actual time-pressure comes from the eclipse progression: "We waited for the first bite," "When the light thinned," "When totality neared," "for two minutes," "When the sun slipped free." The eclipse provides a live clock that tightens decisions (the ceremony must fit within totality's window). The phrase "dreaming roots" recurs subtly ("near the roots" at closure) but does not track time or constrain tactics. Treating the eclipse as the functional timeframe: present in setup (anticipated), middle (marks beats), closure (ends, transitions to plan). The poetic phrase is ornamental; the eclipse mechanics do the structural work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To nurture lifelong wonder" is stated early and dramatized through choices: refusing to force sound, inviting Felix to play, linking memory to sound, and designing a practice plan "to keep wonder awake without scaring it back into the woods." Friction: the therapist's goal (wonder) tensions against Lena's stated desire ("bringing his voice back"), creating a values contrast (process vs. outcome). Present in setup (declared intention), middle (enacted through adaptive method), and closure (the plan and "a beginning large enough for wonder to grow"). Causal pressure: prioritizing wonder over cure enables the non-coercive approach that Felix accepts. Cost: wonder requires patience and yields "not a song yet, but a path," not immediate satisfaction. The motivation shapes every tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named in the opening ("tucked like a heartbeat in my coat") and modulates with pressure: cautious waiting and asking permission in the setup, restrained hope during the bowl/heel exchange ("I felt the pulse...that steadied my cautious exuberance"), and exuberance tempered by realism at closure ("not a cure, but a beginning large enough for wonder to grow"). Tone coherence: the prose maintains lyric restraint (no forced celebration) while allowing moments of beauty ("tears...held like stars," "carrying the quiet like a seed"). The tone charges the final image by balancing hope with acknowledged cost. Minor: the phrase "cautious exuberance" is stated rather than enacted in the opening; later beats earn it through the narrator's restrained joy and professional boundaries.</comment>
