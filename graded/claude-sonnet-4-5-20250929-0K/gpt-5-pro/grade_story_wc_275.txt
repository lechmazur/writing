<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator demonstrates clear interiority with embodied contradiction—she is "senselessly perceptive" and her choices consistently foreground restraint over action, creating genuine tension when her father returns demanding participation in violence. Her micro-choices (pouring dust between them, sheathing his knife, splitting the sandbag to repair the dome) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The father's arc from bounty hunter to student of her patience is earned through on-page choices during the storm, not summary. Minor weakness: some interiority leans slightly abstract ("engraved quiet") but remains anchored in perception and action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through density increase (survivors gathering, father returning, storm arriving) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the father sheathes his knife permanently, strangers leave with rose slips, and the narrator's continuity-weaving method expands outward. The closure carries conceptual and relational cost: the father's identity shift is irreversible, the engraved quiet becomes a shared script, and the protagonist's vulnerability to fifty strangers creates risk. Orientation anchors (narrator, dome, post-tower world) are present by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm forces the father to adopt her method, reweighting his relationship to violence and her garden's role as sanctuary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass dome constrains every major choice: it must not crack during the storm, its fractures require the sandbag strips, and it hums as the physical container for her philosophy. The desert environment (sand, heat, wells, wind) pressures tactics throughout—water is scarce, dust threatens, the storm tests structure. Micro-setting is vivid and functional: the peg where the sheath hangs, the cistern where strangers crouch, the seam-crossing where new cuttings are planted. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (turbine smoke, gritty eyelids, petals like coins), and spatial choreography remains clear through the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: weaving continuity versus trimming with vengeance. The father's return narrows options by demanding her participation in violence; her refusal and counter-offer ("Stay") creates immediate pressure. The storm provides a second tightening that forces the father to adopt her method, and the visible cost is his identity shift (looping the sheath over the peg, burning his map). Agency is clear: she pours the dust line, sheathes his knife, repairs the dome, and teaches him her method. The resolution is protagonist-driven, earned by her sustained demonstration under pressure, and the cost—expanded vulnerability to fifty strangers, the father's renunciation—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the sandbag scrap (ballast from destruction repurposed for repair), roses taught restraint, "engraved quiet" that shifts from scar to script. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—"we water the dust into possibility"—that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the knife placed in its sheath, the father's shoulders loosening, petals gathered like coins) and the piece invites reflection on violence, patience, and inheritance without abstraction. The father's arc from "the world is a knife that cannot sheathe" to "your way has heat, it just does not burn" is earned through specific experience, not epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and controlled: perceptual signature filters through patience and micro-attention ("I notice pain even before it speaks," "their buds promising difficult patience"). Diction remains stable and voice-motivated even under pressure (the storm sequence maintains the narrator's textured cadence). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the father's lines pursue goals and carry subtext, and his final "your way has heat" crystallizes his shift without over-articulation. Minor slip: occasional elevated phrasing ("inculcating plants with values") brushes against the narrator's otherwise grounded idiom, though it reads as her learned vocabulary rather than register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion; sentences do multiple jobs (the sandbag passage establishes object, father's absence, and current use in three beats). Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line recharges prior material. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("engraved quiet," "blazing gently," "sheathing thunder"). However, metaphoric density approaches overwriting in the final third—multiple figurative constructions per sentence without clear pattern-teaching ("continuity is a loom," "a man sheathing thunder," "water the dust into possibility") create slight opacity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and information density is high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with patient horticulture and the bounty-hunter/pacifist-daughter inheritance conflict feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the airship sandbag from weapon-system artifact to repair tool and seed-carrier provides fresh thematic recursion. The premise avoids template plot (no revenge quest, no tidy reconciliation) and commits fully to its implication: patience as resistance requires sustained demonstration under existential pressure. Risk-taking is evident in the accumulative structure and the narrator's highly stylized voice, both of which heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's transformation—engraved quiet from scar to script—is earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's choices create every major turn: she refuses her father's demand, pours the dust line as boundary, repairs the dome during the storm, and teaches him her method. Her pacifism is not passive observation but active demonstration that alters his trajectory. The contradiction (bounty hunter's daughter who gardens) generates the central conflict and resolution. Present in setup, middle choice (storm repair), and payoff (father's sheath-looping). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in four distinct beats: introduced with father's absence, used for well-wicks and tarps, split into strips to repair the dome (causal pressure under the storm), and its seams become planting sites for new cuttings at closure. Early signal, middle causal use, and closure reweighting all present. Its transformation from weapon ballast to repair material charges the thematic question. Irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" shapes stakes: it's the survivors' condition, wraps the father like a shawl, and transforms from scar to script by the ending. It constrains the narrator's approach (she takes in people carrying this silence) and the resolution explicitly reprices it as legible pattern. Present in setup (survivors), middle (father's return), and payoff (read aloud to travelers). Strong thematic integration with clear closure participation, though its causal pressure on tactics is less direct than the sandbag or dome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" enables the narrator to notice pain before it speaks, justifying why she takes in survivors and recognizes her father's doubt. It appears in setup and at the storm turning point when the father becomes "senselessly perceptive at last." However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it facilitates her method but does not force a trade-off. Present with modest causal role; good thematic callback but lacks the friction needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Sheathe" drives two major turns: the narrator sheathes her father's knife mid-confrontation (defusing the demand for violence), and he later sheathes it permanently by looping it over the peg (closure choice). The action redefines options at both beats—first preventing escalation, then marking irreversible renunciation. Early signal (knife kept cleaned for pruning), middle use, and payoff. The thematic recursion (roses that "sheathe" their thorns, "a man sheathing thunder") charges the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("I tell the roses about restraint"), dramatized in the middle ("I continue inculcating plants with values, telling them to shelter these frightened pollinators"), and expanded at closure when the narrator and father "begin teaching names to seedlings, teaching steadiness to wrists." It shapes her father's transformation and the resolution's mechanics (travelers leave with instructions to speak values). Present across all three gates with clear causal work. The method's specificity—speaking until voice grows roots—is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dome is the story's spatial and causal anchor: it must not crack (stakes), its hum establishes tone, and its fractures force the protagonist to use the sandbag strips (middle causal pressure). The desert environment (sand, heat, wind) pressures every tactic. At closure the dome "breathes with wider, kinder lungs," and new cuttings are planted where seams cross—setting participates directly in the resolution's image. Early signal, middle constraint, and payoff. Indispensable to logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" establishes urgency (survivors come, the father returns after years, the storm threatens). The timeframe shapes the stakes—this is a post-collapse moment when continuity must be woven—but the story does not track a live clock that alters moves beat-by-beat. The ninth day of the father's return and the storm's arrival provide structure, but time does not tighten decisions in real-time. Present with thematic weight; modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized from the opening ("I root patience into sand") through the confrontation ("I am trying to weave continuity through chaos, not trim it with vengeance") to closure ("continuity is a loom on which the future chooses thread"). Every choice—refusing the father, repairing the dome, teaching strangers—enacts this desire with visible cost (vulnerability, effort, expanded responsibility). Friction is clear: her father represents the opposing method. Present across all gates with strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is coherent through the narrator's controlled intensity: the dome "hums a tranquil blaze," she is "blazing gently," and the heat metaphor recurs ("your way has heat, it just does not burn"). Tone modulates with pressure—the storm sequence tightens cadence while maintaining the textured calm—and charges the final image (watering dust into possibility). The oxymoron is sustained and purposeful, shaping perception and the thematic resolution. Present throughout with strong closure linkage.</comment>
