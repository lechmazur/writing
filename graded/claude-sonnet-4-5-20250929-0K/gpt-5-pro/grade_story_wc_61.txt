<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is consistent and carries concrete interiority ("old ache that makes me an otherworldly sentimentalist at last useful"), but the stranger remains largely opaque—her motivation to learn is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice to pledge teaching feels more thematic echo than earned tension; we don't see her struggle between escape tradition and staying. Embodied emotion appears sporadically but the peak beat lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (gears, light, petals) and deepens through the stranger's arrival and the orrery rebuild, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the interval between them becomes wide enough to plant trust"). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (nebula garden, narrator role, helium flowers). Cost is felt—"escape had become their only tradition" reweights prior material—but the final pledge and departure read more as thematic resolution than a choice that narrows options with visible friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly particular: "terraces of vapor, domes of slow lightning, corridors of suspended pollen." Setting constrains method (sonar for navigation, no fire) and charges the closure (orrery placed "in a cloth of starlike moss for the next caretaker"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Micro-setting (the orrery, gears, moss cloth) functions as tactile anchor and recurs with reweighted meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: sharing light gently, teaching without burning. The stranger's arrival and desire to learn intensify pressure, and the orrery rebuild narrows tactics, but the escalation remains textural accumulation rather than a choice that trades off live options. The stranger's epiphany ("maybe escape had become their only tradition") is asserted, not dramatized through a visible fork. Cost is felt but not foregrounded at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—transmission as kindness, inheritance as evolution rather than repetition—emerges organically from the orrery rebuild and the two-gear mesh without overt statement. The final image ("transmission rather than repetition") reweights prior material and offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the stranger's "troubling serenity" and the moth-whale script "that repeats but never duplicates." No moralizing; complexity is sustained through "even comfort can be perilous if never questioned."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, lyric, and stable: "grief were pollen to be saved," "numbers becoming weather." Distance remains consistent; the narrator's perceptual signature (sonar, mineral lattices, echo-cartography) is specific and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext ("asks whether I can teach her how to give light gently"). Under peak pressure, diction remains textured but occasionally tilts into elevated abstraction ("choreography of shadows that teaches seedlings to bear brightness without learning pain") that risks distancing the reader from immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often luminous ("her expression fractures into rain and then reforms"), but the accretion can dull momentum: nearly every sentence metaphorizes, and some vehicles contradict (petals fall "like snow but never touch ground at once" vs. "soft applause across the quiet sigh of falling petals"—unclear if they land or not). Paraphrase loop: "approximates infinity" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence in paragraph structure (many begin with setting description). Information density is strong, but rhythm flatlines under the weight of consistent elevation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—nebula garden, sonar navigation, orrery as teaching tool, generational gears—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "calculating machine gear" from relic to collaborative instrument feels earned. Risk-taking in lyric compression and unconventional imagery ("transit not for astronomy alone but for hearts") heightens thematic resonance. However, the emotional arc (lonely caretaker meets kindred stranger, they build trust) follows a familiar template; the freshness resides in execution rather than premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Narrator is present throughout, signals early ("otherworldly sentimentalist"), and their choice to teach and co-build the orrery drives the middle and ending. However, the protagonist's agency is largely reactive (the stranger arrives; they respond); the decision to teach feels inevitable rather than conflicted. Cost is implied but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gear is introduced early (paragraph 4), handled in at least three beats (neck pendant, stranger's chewed gear, orrery rebuild), and its properties (teeth, mesh, "low arithmetic" sound) constrain the rebuild. It charges the final image ("two gears in a cloth of starlike moss"). Causal pressure is strong; removing the gear would break the orrery mechanics and the inheritance motif. Could score higher if the gear's chewed teeth created a visible obstacle rather than merely a keepsake detail.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Generational patterns frame the piece early ("ancestors grew flowers by," "trace the generational patterns") and shape the middle choice (rebuilding the orrery around two family gears). The concept charges the closure ("inheritance can mean transmission rather than repetition"). It appears in setup, middle, and payoff, and its mechanics (gears meshing, vows tuned) alter tactics. Slightly less indispensable than the gear itself; the story could pivot to "teaching" alone with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" appears twice as description of the bloom-cloud's spiral orbit, providing a visual signature but not constraining a choice. It's present in setup (implicit in terraces and veils) and closure (final terraces image), but the phrase functions as lyric color rather than a tactical limit or enabler. Paraphrase repetition lowers integration score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Transit" seeds early (paragraph 1 transit implied; explicit by paragraph 10), shapes the orrery mechanics (calculating orbit for dust petals), and returns in the pledge ("teaching transit as kindness"). It's thematically central and present at closure, but the term itself is broad; "light-sharing" or "passage" could substitute with minor edits. The action is more conceptual anchor than irreplaceable verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced by paragraph 8, used to map the garden (moth-whales, seed-pods, stranger's approach), structures the corridor navigation (paragraph 16), and fades to heartbeat tempo at closure. It constrains method (how they navigate the veils) and its return ("fades to a heartbeat tempo") charges the ending. Two distinct beats plus closure participation; mechanics matter. Slight swappability (echolocation, another sensor) caps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nebula garden is present from the opening line, its properties (helium flowers, star-silt, no fire) constrain all tactics, sonar navigation depends on dense gas, and the terraces/domes provide spatial choreography. The setting enables the orrery placement and charges the final image ("long arcades of light approximate infinity again"). Essential across setup, middle, and closure; removing it collapses the premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears as a lyric phrase in two paragraphs (7, 22) but does not function as a clock that tightens decisions. Time moves "differently" (paragraph 7), but elapsed duration remains vague. The phrase is atmospheric rather than a live constraint; no choice is narrowed by petal-fall tempo. Present in setup and closure but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("share light without using fire") is stated early (paragraph 3), dramatized through the mineral lattice and sung-glow methods (paragraph 15), tested in the orrery rebuild (paragraphs 17–18), and reaffirmed in the pledge (paragraph 28). It drives at least three beats and shapes the ending. The stranger's parallel desire to learn creates friction ("pilots teach children to outrun fires, but never to share light"). Cost is felt but not a stark fork; slightly lower irreplaceability because "teach gently" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" is introduced with the stranger (paragraph 12: "like a lullaby sung at the edge of a crater") and modulates through her "expression fractures into rain" (paragraph 21) and final smile (paragraph 25). Tone is present and purposeful, coherent through turns, but the phrase itself appears once; its effect is more character-specific than a pervasive atmospheric layer. It charges one key beat and subtly informs the ending hush.</comment>
