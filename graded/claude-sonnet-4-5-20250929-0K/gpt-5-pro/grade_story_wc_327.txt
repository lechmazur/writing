<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller has a distinct conceptual texture but lacks moment-to-moment embodied choice under pressure. Internal contradiction appears only as poetic declaration ("one hand for the bones, one for the birds, one for my heart") rather than simultaneous conflicting impulses dramatized in scene. The curse's appetite and the giving-away of private names register as told symbolic cost rather than foregrounded micro-choices with visible consequences that alter later tactics. Interiority often describes states in elevated diction ("the promise had settled in me like a quiet bruise") without grounding them in physical sensation or on-page micro-decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph; when is implied (dusk, last speakers gone) but remains soft. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator becomes "an instrument more than a mouth," carrying the language forward), and cost is legible in the surrender of personal names and the copper drawn from veins. However, the tightening or deepening across the middle is largely atmospheric—textures accumulate, birds guide, the diamond warms—without a single sharp reversal or choice that narrows options on the page before the final transformation. The ending image reconfigures the narrator's identity with felt cost, meeting the closure requirement, but escalation coheres through density increase rather than a decisive pressure point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon rim, and tunnel of echoes supply vivid, purposeful anchors that constrain the protagonist's movements and method. Spatial choreography remains clear: dusk entry, deeper progression guided by bird-patterns, wire-and-diamond tethering to bone. The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting (a tool whose warmth and thirst shape the narrator's choices), and the final image of copper seeping into bone charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's attentive idiom, though some descriptions ("a canyon of endless echoes") edge toward generic lyricism without fresh particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to translate texture into sound before silence seals it) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the diamond's curse asks for names, the birds veer, the tunnel braids echoes. However, there is no single on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options mid-scene; instead, the protagonist proceeds through a sequence of guided steps (palm, diamond press, wire-drawing, name-surrender) that accumulate cost without visible constraint or trade-off. The ending shows agency (surrender of names, transformation into instrument) with legible cost, meeting the baseline, but escalation reads as density increase rather than a forced decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the cliff language's death, the diamond's flaw as library, copper veins as currency, the canyon's demand for quietness. The final image—speaking as instrument, canyon answering, language carried forward—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stated moral. Subtext operates in the diamond's appetite (malice versus necessity), the birds' grammar, and the narrator's trade of private for public names. Minor slip: "Cracks are libraries, I told myself" edges toward overt thematic statement, though it remains anchored in the narrator's voice and the diamond's use.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person, and the narrator's perceptual signature (attention to texture, patience, quiet articulation) is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, with metaphoric compression ("a grammar of turns and hesitations whose commas were wings catching silence") that reads voice-motivated and pattern-taught. However, under peak pressure—curse flexing, names surrendering—the register does not modulate; syntax remains ornate and meditative rather than tightening. The prose maintains coherence but sacrifices immediate embodied urgency for sustained textural density. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, and information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or symbolic progression. However, multiple figurative constructions appear in most sentences without clear pattern payoff, and some metaphors stretch coherence: "meanings veer," "nouns that had gone feral," "grief had twelve small names" accumulate poetic texture but occasionally blur sense. Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly articulate" recurs in paragraph 1 and later as canyon echo ("I am quietly articulate, the canyon seemed to say") without added pressure. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "I" + past-tense verb, creating subtle drumbeat. No catastrophic artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cliff language translation, bird-pattern grammar, and the flawed-diamond-as-cost is specific and non-obvious; the transformation of personal names into fuel for preserving public language offers fresh moral calculus. The ending image (copper vines fixing the diamond, narrator as instrument) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in sustained lyric mode and unconventional escalation (accumulative rather than causal) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "last speakers gone, language dying" frame is widely used; the piece transforms it through the diamond's curse and the bird-guided method, but the core template remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout and drives all beats: enters towers, reads bird-patterns, presses diamond, draws wire from veins, surrenders names, transforms into instrument. Setup in opening line; development across middle beats (laying palm, pressing diamond, winding wire); payoff in final transformation. Causal pressure is moderate—choices follow bird cues and canyon demands rather than internal conflict—but the character's renunciation of private names shapes the closure image. Specificity (copper veins, quiet articulation) matters, though decisions feel guided by external pattern more than internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in paragraph 1 (setup), is pressed and slid along bone (paragraph 10–12, development), grows warm and thirsty mid-scene (paragraph 19), asks for names (paragraph 20, 24), and is fixed in bone by copper at closure (paragraph 25). Used across at least four distinct beats. Its "chipped heart glittering like a stutter" and thirst-as-appetite enable the curse mechanics and the name-trade that funds the translation. Closure linkage is strong (diamond fixed in gentle bite). Swappability is low; the flaw-as-library concept and the curse's appetite are specific. Cost is tied to the diamond's demand. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced in paragraph 3 (setup), braids the voice back upon itself (paragraph 13), and remains the active spatial constraint throughout. It tightens the world "into a single attentive breath," rewinds sounds to "first trembling intention," and repays name-surrender with feral nouns (paragraph 21). The tunnel shapes stakes (translate before silence seals) and tactics (reading air, following birds, using diamond). Payoff: the canyon answers at closure, and together they carry the language forward. Indispensable to both the spatial logic and the translation method; removing it breaks the story's core mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is labeled in paragraph 2 and echoed by the canyon (paragraph 14: "I am quietly articulate...but you must be quieter still"), but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute describes the narrator's stance without forcing a tradeoff or enabling a specific tactic that another trait would not. Setup and thematic reprise are present, but development (a choice shaped by this trait with cost) is missing. Label-only use; swappable with "patient" or "attentive" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Harness" appears in paragraph 7 ("a way...to harness the canyon without letting it harness you") and frames the method: reading air, following bird-patterns, using diamond, drawing wire. The act of harnessing drives the middle beats (paragraphs 10–24) and culminates in copper fixing the diamond and the narrator becoming instrument (paragraph 25). Setup, development across multiple beats, and payoff all present. However, the term itself is generic; the specific harnessing method (bird-guided translation) does the causal work. Swappability is moderate; "engage" or "channel" could replace "harness" with minor edits, though the reciprocal risk ("without letting it harness you") adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bird-patterns are signaled in paragraph 8 ("grammar of turns and hesitations whose commas were wings"), guide placement of hand and diamond (paragraph 10), split into three ribbons to teach the three-hand task (paragraph 22), and write a final circle at closure (paragraph 25). Setup, development (shapes at least two key beats), and payoff all present. Mechanics matter: veering directs palm, knife-straight directs diamond press, fracture into ribbons splits the task. Specificity is high; the flock's collective curve and shadows on bone are irreplaceable. Cost is indirect (following birds enables the curse to ask for names) but legible. Strong integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The towers of bone in the canyon supply the spatial anchor (paragraph 1), the tactile surface for diamond-reading (paragraphs 10–12), and the material into which copper seeps at closure (paragraph 25). The canyon's rim provides the vantage for reading bird-patterns (paragraph 7–9), and the tunnel tightens the world and braids echoes (paragraph 3, 13). Setup immediate, development across multiple beats (textures gathered, diamond slid, wire wound into bone), and payoff indispensable (copper fixing diamond in bone, canyon answering). Removing the bone towers breaks the translation method and the final image. Irreplaceability and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" frames the urgency (paragraph 4–6: "last speakers gone," "birds...forget their cues," "promise...to carry meaning across the death") and bookends the closure (paragraph 26: "across the death of a language, into whoever listens next"). Setup and thematic payoff are clear. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions—no visible clock forces the narrator to hurry, and the middle beats unfold in meditative sequence without temporal pressure. The death of the language motivates the quest but does not constrain tactics within the scene. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure, reaching mid-band, but lack of middle development caps score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation (translate texture into sound) is stated in paragraph 4, dramatized through every beat (reading textures, pressing diamond, gathering friction-voice, winding wire, surrendering names), and fulfilled at closure (speaking as instrument, carrying language forward). Setup immediate, development across the entire middle (each action pursues the translation), and payoff explicit. Friction between the goal and its cost (curse asks for names, copper drawn from scars) is visible and charges the final image. The desire is embodied in choices—laying palm, pressing diamond, answering with hum—not merely declared. High causal pressure and specificity; irreplaceability strong.</comment>
