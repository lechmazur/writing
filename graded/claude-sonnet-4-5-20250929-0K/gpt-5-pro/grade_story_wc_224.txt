<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's journey toward "understanding the shape of home" is consistent, but interiority remains abstract and metaphor-heavy rather than embodied. The seer's choices are observation-driven rather than pressure-driven; the protagonist's agency reads as guided acceptance more than active contradiction. The final realization that "buried talents are not skills but permissions" arrives as stated epiphany rather than dramatized reversal, and the cost—offering breath, leaving with a feather—feels symbolic rather than viscerally foreclosing a path. Backstory and reflection dominate without anchoring in micro-choices that alter present options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Accumulative/Textural lens taught early through layered metaphor and cadence, and the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where "home is not an address but a practice"—reweights the dominant stake. However, orientation anchors (who the protagonist is, concrete grounding in time/place) remain elusive past 120 words; the "labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain" is vivid but spatial choreography inside is vague. Cost at closure is felt conceptually (releasing breath, receiving permission) but the choice does not foreclose a live path dramatized earlier. The closure reconfigures meaning via accumulation, satisfying the chosen lens, but the lack of a concrete before/after choice limits closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bookstore mountain is evocatively rendered with consistent metaphoric texture: "aisles smell of glue, ash, and rain," "floor is an atlas made of unreadable skin." Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's search for belonging, and the feather as micro-object charges the final image by enabling the stone's grammar. Spatial choreography within the labyrinth is impressionistic rather than clear—distances, turns, and room transitions remain abstract—but the rotunda and cloche anchor the climax. The recurring objects (stone, feather, cloche) constrain the protagonist's approach and the final act, lifting setting above decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the shape of home"—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through texture and metaphor rather than causal tightening: the protagonist moves from gate to rotunda, but each beat deepens theme more than narrowing options. The seer warns "meaning bites" and the protagonist offers breath, but these moments read as ritual steps rather than reversals that foreclose paths. The closure deepens understanding and grants permission, satisfying the Accumulative lens, but agency is acceptance rather than choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (breath, threshold promises) rather than a visible trade-off that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from recurring images: keys, addresses, shelters versus hiding, the difference between enclosure and unfolding. The lost language stone's grammar—"rooms as climates, corridors as migrating birds"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "the shape of home" without moralizing. "Buried talents are not skills but permissions" risks abstraction but is earned by the feather-stone interaction. The final image of seeding thresholds with welcome reweights prior material and invites reflection. Subtext operates in the seer's "mercury-glass" reflections and the mountain's "hidden thunder," though the density of metaphor occasionally obscures rather than sharpens the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled metaphoric density: "memory grows teeth," "staircases loop like handwriting." POV remains stable third-person limited with a perceptual signature focused on sensing and interpreting abstractions. The prose's rhythmic modulation supports the Accumulative lens, but the lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("pavements of sensation," "hatching tiny pavements") that feels more authorial than character-bound. Dialogue is absent; the seer's statements blend into the narrator's voice without distinct idiom. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery are taught early and sustained, though filter verbs ("I realize," "I ask") appear frequently without undermining immediacy given the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He says the map I carry is wrong, and that maps are only apologies for rooms we have not yet claimed" followed by "He substitutes reality nightly, he confides, trading aisles like constellations" reads as synonym churn without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("He teaches me," "He tells me," "He says," "He guides my hand") stacks similar stems across four beats. Mixed metaphor: "letters lift as temperature, syntax as wind" then "geometry of pulse, edges as breathing, rooftops as skins" layers vehicles without clear coherence. The artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third, triggering −0.6 for template runs and −0.3 for paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—reading a stone via feather texture to learn a lost grammar of home—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of sensory translation, permission versus skill, and shelter versus hiding feels fresh. However, the execution leans on elevated metaphor ("mercury-glass seer," "buried talents," "hidden thunder") that risks aesthetic familiarity in lyric mode. The emotional arc—acceptance of belonging as practice—is earned through particulars (feather, breath, stone) rather than generic realization. The piece commits fully to its lyric logic without retreat, but the dense figurative texture and guided protagonist reduce risk; a bolder move would dramatize rather than narrate the protagonist's internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer appears early, guides the protagonist through the bookstore, teaches listening, warns of the stone's bite, and requests the breath offering. He shapes multiple beats (gate, instruction, rotunda) and enables the closure by producing the feather and guiding the protagonist's hand. However, his choices are expository and facilitative rather than creating reversals; he observes and instructs but does not face his own pressure or cost. His reflection—learning to substitute reality because "mercury glass raised him on reflections"—is backstory rather than a choice that alters present tactics. He participates in closure but as enabler, not agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone is introduced in the first third as the quest object, appears physically under the cloche in the rotunda, and is read via the feather in the climax. It shapes the protagonist's goal ("only its grammar can describe a house without burning its thresholds"), constrains approach (cannot be touched, must be read via texture), and delivers the thematic payload ("rooms as climates, corridors as migrating birds"). Its properties—dark, veined with storms, speaking via temperature and wind—are specific and irreplaceable. It drives at least three beats (quest framing, arrival, reading) and participates directly in closure. The protagonist does not touch it, slightly reducing tactile integration, but its grammar reweights the entire journey.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Buried talents are introduced mid-story when the seer teaches the protagonist "to listen for buried talents, the quiet instruments I smothered with busyness, grief, and borrowed weather." The concept reappears at closure: "I realize my buried talents are not skills but permissions, the right to arrive, to make a chair, to bless a stair." However, the element is never dramatized as a constraint or choice; it remains thematic commentary rather than shaping tactics or options. The protagonist does not name, demonstrate, or struggle with a specific buried talent on the page. The element is ornamental, present in two beats as reflection without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is introduced in the first third when the seer confides he "substitutes reality nightly…trading aisles like constellations, curating time as though it were a shelf of spines." It reappears when the protagonist asks where he learned this, and he answers that mercury glass raised him. The attribute explains the bookstore's shifting nature and implicitly licenses the surreal logic, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action by the protagonist or the seer. It is backstory and world flavor rather than a trait that shapes a choice with cost. The attribute could be removed without altering the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Seed" appears in three distinct beats: the seer instructs the protagonist to "seed the journey with promises I can keep," they "seed the shelves with whispers," and the protagonist leaves "promising to seed every threshold with welcome until doors forget how to stay afraid." The action shapes the middle beat (planting maybes to form a path) and charges the final image (a practice of welcome), but it does not create a major turn; the protagonist could complete the journey without seeding. The action is purposeful and recurs with reweighted meaning, but it is one tactic among several rather than the hinge of the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The feather is introduced when the seer produces it from "the sleeve of a twilight he wears," just before the climax. He explains "we will read via the texture of a feather…because the stone mistrusts eyes and only trusts what brushes without hunger." The feather is then used in the reading: "He guides my hand, and the vane greets the surface like rain remembering a drought, hatching tiny pavements of sensation." Its specific property—texture without hunger—is irreplaceable and enables the stone's grammar. The feather shapes the closure beat and the protagonist leaves carrying it, sealing the method's integration. Late introduction (final third) applies −0.3, but causal necessity and closure linkage lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is established in the opening and frames the entire journey. It supplies atmospheric pressure ("corridors braid and unbraid, staircases loop like handwriting") and the rotunda where the stone rests. The mountain "shivers like an animal learning trust" at closure, participating in the final reconfiguration. However, the setting's specific properties—aisles, stairs, rooms—do not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics; the journey is guided by the seer rather than navigated by the protagonist's spatial problem-solving. The setting charges mood and frames the quest but does not pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is the opening phrase and establishes the protagonist's motivation to seek the bookstore. The timeframe is lyric rather than linear; no clock or urgency tightens decisions. The phrase reappears obliquely when the seer says "the price is the difference between shelter and hiding, and that I have paid it for years without receipt," linking past pain to present cost. The timeframe establishes the emotional before-state and frames the quest but does not pressure tactics or choices on the page. It is backstory anchor rather than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is stated in the second sentence and drives every beat: the climb, the seer's map correction, the search for the lost language stone, the feather reading, and the final realization that "home is not an address but a practice." The motivation is consistent and culminates in the closure image. However, it is told and reiterated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; the protagonist pursues this goal without visible internal friction or competing desires. The cost (offering key, address, breath) is symbolic rather than a trade-off between wants and needs. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears in the third sentence ("The air weeps with hidden thunder, as if the rocks are full of distant storms learning my name") and returns near closure ("Hidden thunder dialogs under the floor, not warning us but urging, and the mountain shivers like an animal learning trust"). The tone is established early as portentous, liminal, and urgent-without-panic. It modulates subtly: early lines carry foreboding, middle beats soften into teaching, and the final reprise shifts to encouragement. The recurring image charges the closure by transforming threat into support. The tone is coherent through turns and tied to the mountain-as-setting, lifting it above static mood.</comment>
