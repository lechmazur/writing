<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The winder's internal conflict is embodied through the physical act of adjusting pendulum weights while reading inscriptions. The father's drowning and the protagonist's guilt are grounded in concrete detail (misread sky, broken rake handle), and the final choice to adjust weights and visit the ridge carries visible cost. Some interiority edges toward elevated register ("searing reverie," "hollowness I can breathe") that slightly exceeds the character's established voice under peak stress, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (tower ritual, pause-creates-vision, father's death, inscribed handle) and lands Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the protagonist adjusts the bob, promises to "count even the kindnesses that hurt," and the town will "forgive by inches." Orientation anchors appear by line 8 (tower, winder, tide ritual). Cost is legible in the protagonist's refusal of self-absolution and the tactile ritual of pellet removal. One transition from present ritual to memory and back is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pendulum bob, tower cavity, and tidal obsidian ridge constrain choices on the page: the bob's weight cavity enables the pellet ritual, the pause creates the vision window, and the ridge anchors memory and the final pilgrimage promise. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt air, brass sound, wet basalt—and filtered through the winder's occupational attention. The bob's physical properties (round, heavy, filled with shot) directly shape the protagonist's adjustment tactics and the story's closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: restore shared balance through ethical clock adjustment. Pressure tightens when the protagonist reads their own name on the handle and must decide whether to remove pellets tied to personal guilt. The pellet-by-pellet decision ("If the harm was repented and mended, the pellet goes in a jar; if not, it stays to drag us") narrows options and charges the closure. Agency is clear: the winder replaces three shots, removes two, and promises future action. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—incremental absolution versus convenient forgiveness—emerges through the pellet ritual and carved inscriptions without meta-commentary. The handle's directive "Forgive by increments" and the final promise to "forgive by inches instead of lies" offer a resonant answer grounded in concrete action. The ridge, pause, and pendulum form a non-ornamental pattern that reweights the opening image of "hours still limp[ing] across our lives." Minor slip: "ethically diligent for years" edges toward prompt-language in the opening, slightly dulling thematic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the winder's attention moves through mechanical detail (cap, cavity, shot), carved text, and tidal rhythm. Diction modulates effectively under pressure ("The ridge flashes like a cut"). However, register occasionally lifts into elevated phrasing ("searing reverie," "phosphor," "swallowed secret," "coves at low tide") that sits at the edge of the character's established idiom, particularly in peak beats. Purposeful compression is taught and paid off, so no elision penalty applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance ritual, memory, or decision. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled (pendulum as heart/moon, ridge as cut/mirror). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third: "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems repeat across six lines without escalation. One paraphrase loop: "To restore shared balance" (line 26) closely echoes the opening stake. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so penalties remain light.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock-tower ritual, carved confession ledger, and pellet-weight adjustment as literal/metaphorical absolution mechanism is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with tactile particulars (notches, pellets, bob cavity). Risk-taking in the lyric-dense accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse with different objects or setting. The combination of occupational detail and moral calculus feels earned rather than assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, the winder's role frames every beat. Choices drive key turns: stopping the weight to create the pause-vision, reading the handle inscriptions, deciding pellet-by-pellet which harms warrant continued drag, adjusting the bob (three in, two out), and promising the ridge pilgrimage. The occupation constrains tactics (climb timing, oil/cloth, pendulum mechanics) and enables the absolution method. Removing this character would collapse story logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pendulum bob appears in setup (line 9, "heart is the clock tower pendulum bob"), development (stopping it to create the pause, opening its cavity to access shot), and payoff (adjusting weight, fastening the cap, setting it back to arc). Its physical properties—weight, cavity of shot, swing—constrain the protagonist's ritual and charge the closure image ("the bob feels nearer to the tide's patience"). The bob is irreplaceable; no other object could serve this exact causal and symbolic function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Incremental absolution shapes stakes and tactics on every page: the handle's carved "Forgive by increments" directive, the pellet-by-pellet decision protocol, the weight adjustments ("replace three shots and remove two"), and the closure promise to "forgive by inches instead of lies." The concept constrains the protagonist's choices (cannot remove all pellets for self; must measure each mercy) and articulates the story's central conflict. Removing this concept would strip the narrative of its ethical calculus and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ethically diligent for years" appears in line 4 and is dramatized through the pellet decision protocol and the protagonist's refusal of self-absolution despite the town's forgiveness. The trait enables the meticulous ritual and constrains the final choice (no pellet removed for self "not yet, not before I listen"). However, the phrase itself reads slightly like prompt-label and the trait could be inferred from action without the direct statement, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Emerge" seeds in the opening conflict (town lurching, hours limping) and pays off in the penultimate paragraph: "We will emerge from our separate hours as if from coves at low tide." The emergence reweights the opening dysfunction and ties to the adjusted pendulum's "slimmer sound" and doors opening "onto streets like sea lanes." Swapping "emerge" for a near-synonym would weaken the tidal/cove image pattern, but the action itself (town members reconnecting) could be phrased otherwise with moderate edits, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The broken rake handle with tiny inscriptions is signaled early (line 17, "broken handle came back to me") and mechanics matter throughout: the protagonist reads carved names, moon heights, harms, and the "Forgive by increments" clause; uses these inscriptions to guide pellet decisions; and presses the handle to heart at closure. The handle's dual function—father's tool and guilt ledger—is irreplaceable. Removing it would eliminate the decision protocol, the earned link to the father's drowning, and the closure directive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge appears in setup (line 14, framed in the tower window during the pause), anchors the father's kelp-raking lesson and death, and shapes the closure promise ("visit the ridge when the moon is soft, lay the handle down"). The ridge constrains memory (father "cut the rake on basalt") and supplies the final pilgrimage destination, altering the protagonist's future tactics. Its tidal nature ties to the pendulum rhythm and the town's dependence on tide-timed departures, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"During the pause in a pendulum's swing" is signaled in line 12 and the mechanics shape every beat: the protagonist must stop the weight to create the pause, the pause opens "a different sea" and reveals the ridge vision, and the pause's end ("The pause exhales") triggers the bob's return to motion and the town's re-synchronization. The timeframe tightens decision pressure (the protagonist must complete the pellet ritual within the pause) and is indispensable to the story's temporal and metaphysical logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is declared in line 26 and dramatized through conflicted choices: the protagonist's guilt over the father's death, the town's quick forgiveness versus the protagonist's self-denial, and the pellet protocol that weighs "each mercy against what the water can bear." The motivation drives the weight adjustment (three in, two out) and the final promise to "hold to the ethic that steadies the wave." Friction between personal guilt and communal need is visible on the page, and the cost (self-absolution deferred) charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is declared in line 7 and the tone modulates across the piece: elevated lyric texture in the pause-vision beats ("a skin I can lift," "phosphor," "clauses carved along a broken rake handle"), grounded mechanical detail in the ritual (cavity, pellets, nut), and elegiac restraint in the father's memory and closure promise. The tone charges the final image ("slimmer sound," "salvage toward the common") and remains coherent through turns. Minor register lift in peak beats slightly exceeds the winder's established idiom, preventing higher scoring.</comment>
