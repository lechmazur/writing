<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dock worker narrator possesses a distinct perceptual signature—"argue with the sea the way you scold a beloved child"—and embodied choices (pushing off, planting the scrimshaw). However, interiority leans heavily on declarative, therapy-adjacent phrasing: "I want to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" reads as stated thesis rather than lived contradiction. The final transformation ("I hear my true name answered") is asserted more than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the stakes around identity feel abstract rather than viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure gathers through repeated whale calls, island appearances, and the scrimshaw's resonance, culminating in a collective softening ("the pier loosens its bolts like kind wrists"). Orientation anchors late—"sublittoral fringe" and "harbor" are named early, but the who/when remain atmospheric rather than concrete past the 120-word mark (−0.3). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community joins the narrator in surrender, reweighting the opening premise "after violence becomes impossible." The cost is conceptual—the relinquishing of control—legible in "we detach our fears from fear itself," though the felt price for the protagonist individually could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe operates as micro-setting throughout: eelgrass combs the hull, kelp forests rise like cathedrals, tidepool placement of the scrimshaw unlocks island secrets. Sensory hierarchy is strong—wet rope, moon jellies' cursive, whale vibrations—filtered through the protagonist's maritime expertise. The disappearing island as woven raft of reef and driftwood constrains the protagonist's approach and charges the ending when it "rises to meet us with ropes of light." Idiom is consistent and the spatial choreography across skiff, pier, and island remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding freedom by embracing true nature—is signaled early and tightens through the journey: pushing off (detachment), planting the scrimshaw (relinquishing), returning to teach others (alteration of role). The whale's call and island's refusal of ownership provide external pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the island speaks its exhaustion and the protagonist realizes performance must end. Cost is legible in the shift from solitary dock worker to communal ferryman, though the escalation reads more as accumulation than a single high-pressure reversal that narrows options with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—surrender as skill, mercy as labor after violence ends—emerges through images: carved apologies, island that detaches from clutching hands, pier loosening bolts. The scrimshaw's evolution from wronged whale to mercy-object enacts the premise without overtly stating it. However, phrases like "to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" and "demanding we practice surrender like skill rather than shame" veer toward thematic echo, summarizing the question rather than letting the particulars speak. The ending's collective transformation offers resonance, yet the explicitness in "love is not a harbor chain but a tide" states theme where image could have carried it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a maritime-inflected perceptual signature: "moon jellies write their slow cursive," "wet rope pulled through a cleat," "argument with the sea." Diction remains controlled and idiomatically consistent. The old pirate's dialogue—"Fight the tide gently, and let it win"—carries subtext and distinct rhythm. Purposeful lyric compression (mosaic structure with repeated refrains) is taught early and paid off at closure. Brief register elevation in philosophical turns ("combative tenderness," "detach from habits of hauling and blaming") feels voice-motivated rather than imposed, though the pattern's density in reflective beats occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "nerve bright current," "barnacles loose like old poetry," "kelp forests rise like cathedrals." Repeated scaffold phrases ("after violence becomes impossible" opens twice; "sublittoral fringe" recurs six times; "by the call of a whale from the deep" appears four times) create rhythmic anchoring but border on template cadence (−0.5). Some mixed vehicles: "the island's lights wink like distant hearths" follows "island...vanishes by the call of a whale," conflating visual and auditory logic. Paraphrase loop: "I want to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is restated in "to find freedom...I must walk away from performance" without added pressure (−0.2). Information density is moderate; propulsion sags in the middle reflection beats where multiple lines restate the detachment thesis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-violence world, whale-summoned island, scrimshaw that unlocks hearts, communal surrender—feels purposeful and non-obvious. The pirate's carved apologies and the island's refusal of ownership offer fresh inflections on redemption and autonomy. However, the frame reads близко to familiar "journey to magical place teaches lesson" templates, and the emotional arc (solitary seeker → community teacher) follows a well-worn path. Transformation is present—specificity in maritime detail and the scrimshaw's maternal backstory—but the moral calculus (surrender good, clutching bad) resolves into a clear binary without the ambiguity that sustained tension might have provided. Risk-taking in lyric structure and mosaic repetition elevates within band (+0.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The graceful dock worker is present throughout and makes key decisions: takes the skiff, plants the scrimshaw, returns to teach the harbor. Two beats involve clear agency (departure, return with songs), and the ending reconfigures their role from "listening" to "answering." However, "graceful" as attribute is mentioned once without on-page demonstration through movement or choice under pressure; the trait reads more as label than constraint. Setup early, development in middle journey, payoff at closure (all three gates). Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present. Swappability moderate—could be "patient fisher" or "watchful sailor" with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, late-label friction −0.3, swappability −0.8 → 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pirate's whalebone scrimshaw appears in five distinct beats: inheritance, held against chest in skiff, hums and unlocks harbor hearts, old pirate's confession of its origin, planted in tidepool to unlock island, passed palm-to-palm at ending. Setup early (paragraph 2), development (skiff scene, confession), payoff (tidepool planting, communal passing). Specificity high—carved from wronged mother whale, material and backstory irreplaceable. Closure linkage strong in final communal moment. Causal pressure: planting it unlocks island secrets, enabling the protagonist's transformation. Cost tied to it: the pirate's long apology, the protagonist's act of relinquishing it. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5, minus ornamental first mention −0.3 → 7.8 (round down).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The disappearing island is signaled early (paragraph 3), appears and vanishes by whale call (mechanics matter), and the protagonist steps ashore mid-story where it speaks and sets a condition ("argue with your fear until kindness outlasts it"). Ending shows it rising "to meet us with ropes of light." Setup early, development (landfall and dialogue), payoff (collective meeting). Causal pressure: island's refusal of ownership shapes protagonist's realization about performance and detachment. Closure linkage: final image includes it. Specificity: woven raft of reef distinguishes it. Cost: protagonist must ferry others, altering role. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5, minus summary-only quality in ending (recounted not enacted) −0.5 → 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is attributed to the scrimshaw in three mentions: when held it unlocks including narrator's own, when it hums onshore the harbor watch weeps, when planted it releases island whispers, when passed it breaks out songs. Setup paragraph 2, development in skiff and tidepool, payoff in communal passing. Mechanics: possession or proximity triggers emotional opening. Constraint/cost: the scrimshaw must be physically placed or held; planting it in tidepool costs the narrator their exclusive hold on it. Causal pressure moderate—enables the collective transformation. Closure linkage present. Swappability moderate—could be "soothes troubled minds" with edits. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal +0.8, closure +1.0, cost +0.4, swappability −0.9 → 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Detach" recurs as concept and action: training hands to detach, detaching from the pier, island detaches from clutching hands, we detach our fears. Setup early (paragraph 5), development (push-off, island's lesson), payoff (collective detachment at end). The verb shapes two key turns: leaving the pier and the communal surrender. Specificity moderate—the same verb applies across physical, emotional, and metaphorical registers, which creates thematic coherence but reduces irreplaceability. Causal pressure: detaching enables journey and final transformation. Closure linkage strong. Swappability: "release" or "let go" could substitute with thematic adjustment. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.3, swappability −0.9 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early (paragraph 3), mechanically explained (low note that summons the island), drives the protagonist's departure (paragraph 6), and recurs at the ending when "the whale calls again" and the pier loosens. Setup early, development (departure timing), payoff (collective召唤). Mechanics matter: the call is auditory cue and causal trigger for island appearance. Causal pressure: without the call, no journey or collective meeting. Closure linkage: final call enables communal transformation. Specificity high—"low note that rakes the water like a giant oar" is vivid and plot-functional. Cost: timing is not chosen, protagonist must wait for and respond to external rhythm. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.4, closure +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4, minus passive-summoning quality −0.5 → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named six times, grounding all water travel: "where I work," skiff passage with eelgrass and jellies, whale beneath shaping paths, kelp cathedrals. Setup immediate (title-like first line), development (skiff navigation), payoff (whale lifts beneath in final third). Micro-setting: eelgrass and kelp constrain/texture the hull's path, moon jellies provide sensory landmarks. Causal pressure light—the zone is stage more than constraint, though the whale's presence there matters. Closure linkage: environment part of final collective image but not decisively charged. Specificity strong—tidal zone with professional precision. Score: setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.5, specificity +0.7, causal lightness −0.6, postcard-description tendency −0.5 → 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible" frames the opening and closing, establishing a post-conflict era. Setup immediate, payoff at end as bookend refrain. Development absent—no middle beat where the timeframe tightens a decision or alters tactics; it remains thematic backdrop. The phrase sets tone and premise but does not constrain choices on the page (the protagonist's journey would proceed identically if violence were still possible). Cost unclear—no on-page moment where the non-violent constraint costs the protagonist an option. Lyric reprise reweights the opening line with communal "the work remains," which adds resonance. Score: setup +0.7, closure reprise +0.6, thematic coherence +0.3, missing middle development −0.8, no causal constraint −1.0 → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is stated explicitly (paragraph 5) and dramatized through choices: training hands, pushing off, island dialogue demanding the protagonist "walk away from performance," final name-loosening. Setup mid-early (paragraph 5), development (island encounter and realization), payoff (collective teaching and name answered). Friction: want versus cost is present (must relinquish performance, ferry others). However, the motivation is more told than shown in contradictory impulses—"I want to find freedom" reads as thesis statement. Causal pressure moderate: desire drives journey and return. Closure linkage: final line "I hear my true name answered" enacts the premise. Score: setup +0.4 (late explicit), two beats +0.9, causal +0.7, closure +1.2, cost +0.4, told-dominant −0.7 → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named once (paragraph 4) and enacted throughout: arguing with the sea "the way you scold a beloved child," the old pirate's simultaneous steadying and release, the protagonist's demand that the harbor "practice surrender," speaking with "combative tenderness" at dawn. Setup early, development (pirate interaction, island dialogue), payoff (dawn speech). Tone coherent and modulates with pressure—softens at tidepool, sharpens at return. The oxymoron charges images: "Fight the tide gently," "demanding we practice surrender." Specificity high and irreplaceable. Closure linkage: final collective transformation enacts the paradox. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, coherence +0.8, closure +1.4, specificity +0.8, label-reliance (single direct mention) −0.4 → 6.6.</comment>
