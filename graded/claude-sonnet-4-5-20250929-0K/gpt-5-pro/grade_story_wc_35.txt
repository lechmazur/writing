<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chef-protagonist possesses a distinctive perceptual signature (tasting memories) that filters choices and embodied experience throughout. Interiority remains concrete and particular—"my jaw clenched to keep it contained," "gratitude is a river that floods the banks at touch"—with emotion consistently embodied rather than labeled. The arc from isolation ("I wrapped my hands") to communal touch without storm is earned through the broth-making choice and visible cost (absorbing the city's grief). Minor deduction: secondary characters (boy, castellan) apply pressure but remain functional rather than fully individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise): the city's grief is subsumed, hands meet without storm, and the recipe becomes a standing invitation—"Bring what you cannot say, and we will eat until it stops cutting." The accumulative/textural lens coheres: pooled rain → coral pavilion discovery → broth preparation → communal reintegration, with each beat reweighting the dominant stake (managing stored remorse). Orientation anchors (desert fortress, chef, rain) arrive within the first 50 words. One deduction: the castellan's final appearance introduces a new character late, though it does not break causality and the closure image ("kiln-breath quiet") returns to the fortress walls established in the opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains multiple choices: rain pools guide the chef east, the coral pavilion's ice provides the ingredient, the brazier and copper bowls are tactile tools that shape the cooking ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"petrichor," "slick filigrees," "cathedral of ribs and hollows whispering frost"—filtered through the chef's professional and sensory priorities. The micro-setting (body, brazier, bowls) charges the closure by grounding the ritual physically. Minor slip: the transition from dunes to pavilion compresses spatial choreography slightly, though it remains legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to sandpaper rough memories without losing their grain) is signaled early by the castellan's charge and drives all beats. Pressure tightens causally: pools point east → pavilion found → ice harvested → broth simmered → city steadied. The chef's agency is decisive at each node—choosing to cook, to warn the boy not to touch, to pour one bowl for coral—and the visible cost (absorbing contagious grief, risking contamination) narrows tactics throughout. Escalation accumulates texturally through mounting specificity: siege ash, truce stickiness, mason's silence all enter the broth, and the resolution (hands meet without storm) forecloses the old pattern with felt relief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (grief as shared weight, memory as nourishment) emerges from particulars—ice shards taste siege and truce, the broth becomes stamina—without meta-commentary. The final image answers the central question non-literally: stored remorse can be subsumed and served back as communal resilience, "we will eat until it stops cutting." The recipe with "room for silence between measures" and the castellan's acknowledgment that the chef "listened to its hidden organs" ground the theme in concrete acts. Subtext operates in gesture (boy's hands tucked, no storm leaping when hands meet) and the recurring wall-tone ("sturdy brittle") reweights at closure when it "stayed."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and clean, with a distinctive perceptual signature rooted in the chef's synesthetic gift: "my tongue already ached," "my mouth began to flood," tasting siege and truce. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"sorrow climbed my skin like ivy seeking eaves," "debt are plural"—with purposeful compression and elevated register that remains consistent. The chef's attention hierarchy (culinary, tactile, memorial) filters all detail. One minor slip: "sturdy brittle music" and "hoarfrosted" risk slight overwriting in the opening, though they serve atmospheric setup and the voice recovers momentum quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance character, world, and pressure simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; openings vary and syntax modulates with scene needs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "little mirrors someone could drown inside without water," "coral rose out, pale and frozen as if remembering winter." Deductions: two or three metaphors approach opacity under pressure ("ribs of a leviathan" for dunes, "hollows whispering frost") and occasional elevated diction ("heresy of ocean trapped in thirst") slightly exceeds the POV's working register in peak beats, risking a −0.5 cumulative artifact penalty in high-pressure lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—chef who tastes memories meets coral pavilion holding frozen grief—is non-obvious and specific, grounded in desert-fortress locale and the tactile mechanics of broth-making. The emotional contagion constraint and the choice to pour a bowl for the coral add fresh inflection. The ending (recipe as standing invitation, hands without storm) feels earned in hindsight. Minor limitation: the core frame (artisan processes collective trauma through ritual craft) echoes familiar genre templates; transformation arises from the synesthetic particulars and desert-coral juxtaposition rather than a radically new moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chef present from line one; the memory-tasting trait drives beat choices (kneeling to analyze pools, tasting ice shards to decode siege and truce, stirring broth to subsume grief). The chef's decision to cook and the warnings to the boy alter tactics under pressure, and the final recipe ("Bring what you cannot say") directly extends the character's gift. Appears in closure (castellan's acknowledgment, kiln-breath quiet return). Cost is visible: absorbing contagious sorrow, wrapping hands, speaking through tongues not theirs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coral pavilion seeded early (line 14 "old maps called it"), discovered mid-story as cathedral of ribs with ice, and used causally: ice shards are harvested, broth poured over coral ribs at closure. The object shapes two distinct beats (discovery, offering) and charges the ending when "the pavilion drank, and the ice hummed." Irreplaceable: only this frozen-coral-in-desert holds the grief-ice that the chef needs. Cost linkage: pouring the second bowl for coral honors debt and completes the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stored remorse is signaled in line 7 ("every pattern swarmed with stored remorse") and frames the castellan's charge. The concept shapes the dominant stake and recurs in the ice shards (siege, truce, mason's silence) that the chef must subsume. It appears implicitly in closure when grief "fit" rather than vanished. Does not constrain a specific mid-scene choice as directly as the chef or pavilion, remaining more thematic scaffold than tactical tool, but it reweights the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious touch is seeded early (line 8, line 19 "sorrow climbed my skin"), shapes the chef's tactic of wrapping hands (line 16) to avoid contamination, and constrains the warning to the boy (line 35 "I told him not to touch"). The closure pays off when "hands met hands, and no storm leaped"—the contagion is neutralized. Visible cost: isolation and caution throughout. Two beats (wrapping, warning) plus closure participation earn mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Subsume is introduced at line 33 ("I would subsume the fortress's grief into a broth") and defines the climactic cooking ritual: the chef melts ice, stirs in date sourness, tastes the mason's silence resolved, and serves the broth. The action drives the resolution and is irreplaceable—no other verb or tactic would capture the absorption-and-transformation mechanic. Appears in closure when the city "felt less breakable" and grief "fit." High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations appears in line 5 and recurs in line 13 when pools "drew arrows in silt, pointing east." The method enables the discovery of the pavilion (one causal beat) and primes the chef's attention to pattern and memory. Does not return at closure or shape the cooking ritual directly, limiting upper range. Functional early setup that guides one key turn but does not recharge at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain anchors the opening ("Walls exhaled grit and petrichor"), provides the rain pools that guide the quest, and supplies the micro-setting (courtyards, gate, kitchen, brazier) that grounds every beat. The dunes and coral pavilion extend the setting's pressure. Closure returns to the fortress ("the kiln-breath quiet returned, and the tone of the walls stayed sturdy brittle"), charging the final image. Environment constrains tactics (walking beyond the gate, using copper bowls and brazier) and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" opens the piece but remains abstract and unexplored; no subsequent beat clarifies what dream closed or how it pressures the chef's choices. The phrase sets a liminal tone but does not function as a ticking clock or temporal constraint. Time passes (walking, cooking, returning) but is not tracked or urgent. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To sandpaper rough memories is signaled at line 11 (the castellan's charge) and drives every beat: analyzing pools, harvesting ice, cooking broth, serving it. The chef dramatizes this desire through concrete acts (whispering "Stay," stirring until bitterness loosened, pouring bowls). Friction appears in the warning not to touch and the visible cost of absorbing grief. Closure fulfills the motivation when the city's grief "fit" and the recipe invites ongoing work. Desire is embodied, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sturdy brittle appears in line 2 ("sturdy brittle music beneath my ribs") and returns in the final line ("the tone of the walls stayed sturdy brittle"). The tone modulates across beats: brittle fragility (mirrors that drown, ice chiming) and sturdy endurance (walls exhaling, copper bowls, hearthstone warmth). Coherent through turns and charges the closure by bookending the arc. The juxtaposition holds emotional complexity without flattening into single static mood.</comment>
