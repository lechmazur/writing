<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glazier's interior is rendered through concrete particulars—glass dust in cuffs, breath warming panes—and micro-choices under pressure (tilting the fractured pane to create rainbows, choosing whom to face via pond-reading). Motivation coheres around illuminating mundane value through patient craft. The harbor master's shift from skepticism to willingness feels earned by the visible beauty demonstration rather than argument, though his conversion arrives quickly. Minor: the glazier's voice remains consistent but could show more internal friction or cost when facing demolition threat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: glazier, prism atrium, Pearl Bay dawn. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through pond ritual, glass repair, light demonstration, harbor master encounter—culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the master promises to bring the council and the glazier reads affirming pond rings. The cost is conceptual and felt: the atrium's survival remains uncertain ("plans could bend"), the glazier's method proven but not secured, living "the moment before everything shifts." One meaningful deepening occurs when light touches the ledger and the harbor master sees the net mender's name, reweighting his stance. The final image crystallizes options without yet paying the full price, meeting RR/Charged Poise standards.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is richly textured—fog, oars, crane cables, bait sheds, lily pond—and the atrium itself constrains the protagonist's tactic: rather than petition verbally, he uses the structure's own light-refracting properties to argue. The cracked pane becomes a tool that directs the demonstration. Sensory detail is filtered through craft perspective: "glass greenhouse full of unplanted mornings," "star crack, as if some constellation fell and could not swim." The pond and atrium together form a micro-setting constellation that charges the final image when the harbor master agrees to bring the council.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: save the atrium from demolition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the glazier chooses demonstration over petition, tilts the pane to spill colors across the harbor master's ledger, and the spectrum underlines the net mender's name—one meaningful tightening that narrows the master's options. The harbor master's shift from skeptical to open ("plans could bend") is earned by visible beauty and the net mender's pause in healing light. Cost is present but subtle: the atrium's fate remains unresolved, the glazier's ritual method has proven itself but carries no guarantee, and the phrase "before everything shifts" leaves the outcome charged rather than secured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: value hides in seams, breakage learns to belong, glass makes mercy visible. The pond-reading ritual and light-refracting repair work dramatize "illuminate value in the mundane" without stating a thesis. The final image—overlapping rings "like smiling lips" and living "the moment before everything shifts"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation is fragile, grace is provisional, and attention itself is an act of care. The atrium's reflection of boats "as if choosing them gently" and the net mender's healing pause embody the theme through concrete beats rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable single-perspective throughout; perceptual signature is craft-specific and consistent—"grammar the mouth forgets while the eyes remember," "reads between lines most people call seams." Diction stays character-particular: "putty than petitions," "concentricities intersect," "seam where breakage learns to belong." The glazier's sparse dialogue contrasts with the master's bureaucratic concerns, and the silence itself ("I said nothing, only tipped the fractured sun") carries subtext and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. Minor: a few phrases verge on elevated register ("noctilucent reckonings," "translating wind, worry, and chance") but remain voice-motivated by the glazier's meditative, artisan idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is densely imagistic and rhythmically controlled: "fog trumpet slowly up the ribs of the frame," "beam leapt into rainbows that wandered the interior, sampling ropes, fish scales, and boots." Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or pressure. However, several metaphors stack heavily in succession without breathing room—"glass greenhouse full of unplanted mornings," "star crack, as if some constellation fell and could not swim," "noctilucent reckonings rise over the bay like ledger columns glowing blue"—creating mild register drift and occasional opacity in the first third. The phrase "concentricities intersect, then travel, translating wind, worry, and chance into a legible ripple script" verges on overwriting. No loops or scaffold detected, and the ending image is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of glazier-as-mediator, pond divination, and light-as-argument offers a fresh angle on preservation-vs-development conflict. The pond ritual ("commune through the patterns in the rings") and prism-light demonstration are specific, non-obvious methods that grow organically from the glazier's craft rather than convenience. The choice to let the atrium "show itself" rather than petition verbally feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth—patient craft confronting bureaucratic erasure—anchors originality in human stakes. Risk: the lyric, accumulative structure and elliptical pond-reading could obscure, but the piece teaches its pattern early and holds coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glazier present throughout; makes key on-page choices: cleans fractured pane, tilts it to direct light, asks harbor master to stand in colored bands, shows him pond-writing, replaces pane with beveled twin. These decisions create the demonstration that shifts the harbor master's stance and enable the closure moment. Early signal (first line), multiple beats (repair, light direction, pond teaching), causal pressure (demonstration method depends on glazier's craft), closure linkage (final pond-reading affirms the outcome). The glazier's agency drives escalation and closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prism atrium introduced early ("The prism atrium in mist hunched over the quay"), handled across multiple beats: cracked pane discovered, cleaned, tilted to create rainbows, demonstration staged inside it, harbor master lingers there, council will return to see it. The atrium's light-refracting properties enable the protagonist's tactic (demonstrate rather than petition) and constrain the method. Final beat: harbor master says "plans could bend, like glass when fired just right," directly linking atrium's material to closure stance. Irreplaceable: the atrium's specific function (refracting light to reveal value) drives the plot and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Noctilucent reckonings appear once in exposition: "When the town sleeps, noctilucent reckonings rise over the bay like ledger columns glowing blue. / Debts of care, promises unmet, the cost of tossing a bottle, the price of mending it." This thematically enriches the glazier's accounting metaphor and the harbor master's ledger moment, but the concept does not directly shape an on-page choice or tactic. Present by first third, thematic resonance with closure, but no middle beat where it constrains action. Functional but replaceable with a simpler "moral ledger" image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" signaled early ("I am the one who reads between lines most people call seams") and dramatized repeatedly: pond rings translate wind/worry/chance, colors "read between lines of posted debts and favors," spectrum underlines the net mender's name in the ledger. The trait enables the protagonist's method (pond divination, light-as-revelation) and constrains tactics (he must show rather than argue). Closure linkage: final pond-reading confirms the outcome. The attribute is indispensable to the glazier's agency and the story's core logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Commune action introduced early (ritual by lily pond, "I commune through the patterns in the rings"), repeated in middle (harbor master observes, "You commune with it, he said"), and shapes closure (final stone toss, rings "overlapping like smiling lips" confirm the moment). The ritual constrains tactics: it determines where the glazier starts each day and validates his demonstration's success at the end. Removing commune would break the story's divination logic and the final affirmation beat. Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives escalation and closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pond-ring method introduced early ("I commune through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown"), mechanics detailed ("Concentricities intersect, then travel, translating wind, worry, and chance into a legible ripple script"), used twice (opening ritual predicts "argument softened by grace," closing ritual confirms overlapping rings). The method shapes the glazier's daily choices and provides the closure confirmation. Specific, irreplaceable ritual that coheres with the "reads between lines" attribute and charges the final image. Present in all three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage evident.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn anchors orientation immediately, provides sensory texture (fog, oars, crane cables, bait sheds, lily pond), and the bay's dawn light enables the prism demonstration ("When the first gull cried, I tilted the pane so a beam could rake the floor"). The setting supplies the resource (morning light) that the protagonist's tactic depends on. Harbor geography (quay, pond behind bait sheds, atrium over quay) tracks clearly. Closure moment references the bay accepting the "patient argument." Early signal, causal enabler, closure resonance. The dawn timeframe and bay location are essential to the light-demonstration logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" appears in opening and closing, framing the narrative as a liminal moment before council decision. The timeframe creates urgency (atrium slated for demolition, council meeting tomorrow) and the glazier arrives "before everything shifts" to stage his demonstration. However, the clock does not visibly tighten on-page choices beat by beat; the pacing feels contemplative rather than time-pressured. Present in setup and payoff with thematic resonance, but the middle does not show time narrowing options. Causal role is modest; the phrase charges the ending more than it constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("My motive is simple and stubborn, to illuminate value in the mundane before it disappears") and dramatized repeatedly: choosing demonstration over petition, cleaning the pane "until it became a modest sun," staging light to reveal beauty, telling the harbor master "value hides in holding, in joining, in the seam where breakage learns to belong." The desire drives every on-page choice and conflicts with the town's plan to "chrome the harbor, polish it into a brochure." Closure directly tests this motive: the harbor master's willingness to bring the council affirms the glazier's method, though the outcome remains uncertain. Friction between the glazier's patient craft and bureaucratic erasure shapes escalation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone established early as meditative, precise, layered: "clear complexity to mornings here, a grammar the mouth forgets while the eyes remember." The prose maintains coherent lyricism through repair, demonstration, and negotiation beats, modulating slightly when the harbor master speaks (bureaucratic "proposals, investors, timelines") but returning to the glazier's contemplative idiom. The tone charges the final image: "overlapping like smiling lips" and "living the moment before everything shifts" marry clarity (concrete pond rings, confirmed outcome) with complexity (provisional grace, unresolved fate). Tone does not shift dramatically but deepens pressure through accumulation, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
