<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority shows authentic texture through lucid-dream chronicler vocabulary ("midnight solace," "breath letter") and embodied grief work. Micro-choices appear—opening the ledger, asking Mara to describe the stone—but the peak emotional moment ("I told her that witnessing did not pin her to the past, it braided her breath with mine for the climb") reads as diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. Mara's arc from silence to speech is earned, though her brother's death arrives through exposition rather than dramatized memory that alters present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through charged callbacks (daylily, breath, variable stars) that reweight the dominant stake (decoding grief into language). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration when the telegram's petals "loosened their held breath" and the narrator presses the flower into the ledger, crystallizing shared burdens with felt cost (the letting-go after the radio transmission). Orientation anchors cleanly by line ~60 words (observatory, narrator, Mara, Orla's telegram). One tightening deepens when Mara finally speaks about the stone's sound, altering the algorithm and unlocking the translation—cost is legible in her jaw unclenching and the team's cathartic response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory dome, telescope console, and daylily-pressed telegram function as micro-setting that charges multiple beats. The telegram's copper-scented petals constrain the narrator's method (align glyphs with R Lyrae amplitudes), and the monitor's glow illuminates the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear (narrator, Mara, console, dome), though the desert temple itself stays abstract—no tactile detail of stone texture or chisel marks that would ground the inscriptions' physical discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inscriptions to restore language to grief) is signaled early and tightens when Mara's silence breaks, allowing the algorithm rewrite. The narrator's agency—asking Mara to describe the collapse sound—narrows options and enables the translation breakthrough with visible cost: Mara's throat "bruised" by silence is healed, and the narrator "finally let go" after the radio transmission. One meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens: the deepening from ornamental mention of variable stars to their use as the decryption key, which forecloses the path of solitary witnessing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (shared burdens lift; witnessing as communal rather than solitary) emerges through the variable-star mechanics and the inscriptions' vow to "carry the weight of water as a village." The final image—telegram pressed in ledger "a compass for the next dark crossing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The conceptual repricing is clean: the story reweights grief from individual heroism to collective breath. Minor slip: "You do not carry less by being alone, only colder" borders on thesis statement but remains grounded in the altar inscription's voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: lucid-dream chronicler lexicon ("fast falling," "breath letter," "wet stone turning into wheat") shapes every observation. Dialogue is minimal and goal-driven—Mara's "The inscriptions describe a ritual of attention" and the narrator's response advance the decoding work. Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure, though "bruised her throat" and "shoulders lower as if untied" rely on embodied metaphor that occasionally drifts toward poetic convenience rather than character-specific sensation. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I watched," "I felt") are voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or stakes. Runs of similar syntactic patterns appear: "She said / I said / We tested / We phoned" creates template cadence in the second half without taught pattern payoff, triggering −0.4. Figurative density clusters in several beats ("the dome breathed like a sleeping whale," "ledger of the sky," "wet stone turning into wheat") without mid-scene grounding action to anchor them, risking overwriting in peak moments. Two paraphrase loops: lines 7–8 restate that words "carry others" and "carry shared burdens" without added pressure; lines 15–16 echo Orla's instructions in narrator summary then quote. Propulsion remains strong through the translation sequence, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mechanics (variable stars as cipher key) with grief work and temple inscriptions feels fresh and non-obvious. The telegram-as-compass and amplitude-petal correspondence offer specific, verifiable grounding. Risk is present in the lyric accumulation structure and the scientific method applied to emotional recovery. Slight derivative pressure: the mentor-vanishes-leaving-cryptic-message frame and the healing-through-witnessing arc echo therapeutic-journey templates, though the variable-star mechanics and the radio-transmission catharsis transform them enough to avoid mid-band drift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present early (line 3: "I am a lucid dream chronicler") and frames the narrator's witnessing method. Two distinct beats: opening the ledger to copy Orla's instructions and asking Mara to describe the collapse sound—both micro-choices that alter tactics. Participates in closure when the narrator presses the flower into the ledger as a compass. The role constrains perception (breath letters, midnight solace vocabulary) but does not create a turn that would fail without this exact occupation; a different witness-role could substitute with minor edits. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.8, ornamental mention of "lucid dream" without on-page dream work −0.3. Band: functional, shapes beats but not indispensable. 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Object present in opening (line 1: "daylily-pressed telegram") and handled across multiple beats: narrator sets it on console, reads Orla's instructions, notes the petals' copper scent and amplitude correspondence, and in closure presses it into the ledger. The telegram's daylily petals encode the variable-star amplitudes, creating causal pressure—without this cipher the decoding method would not exist. Closure participation is strong: the petals "loosened their held breath" in the resolution image. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity (amplitude-petal map) +0.6, cost connection (letting go) +0.4. Minor deduction for the telegram functioning partly as symbolic comfort object rather than pure tool −0.2. 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Concept signaled early (line 7: "certain words...carry shared burdens") and shapes the dominant stake: decoding must restore communal language to grief. The inscriptions' final vow—"Shared burdens...are the only kind that lift"—articulates the concept explicitly, and the radio transmission enacts it when the team cries together. The concept changes options: the narrator must involve Mara's memory to succeed, foreclosing solitary decoding. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats (Orla's teaching, altar inscription) +0.9, causal pressure (requires collaboration) +1.0, closure linkage (vow and radio moment) +1.3, cost connection (narrator lets go) +0.4. Deductions: the altar inscription states the concept too directly, risking label-only theme rather than embodied particulars −0.5; late explicit articulation in second half reduces irreplaceability −0.3. 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute signaled early (line 17: "my work heals with words when hands cannot") and frames the narrator's stake. Two beats: the narrator copies Orla's instructions and speaks the witnessing line to Mara, which prompts her jaw to unclench. The healing occurs on the page when Mara answers and the translation succeeds, altering tactics from solo work to collaborative model. Cost appears in the narrator's shaking hands and the final letting-go. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (collaboration required) +0.8, closure linkage (radio transmission as communal healing) +0.9. Deductions: the attribute is told more than dramatized through specific word choices that visibly heal −0.5; "heals with words" reads as label rather than showing distinct therapeutic language on the page −0.4. 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Action present throughout: the narrator witnesses by listening to Mara, recording in the ledger, whispering names of the lost, and observing the team's response. Line 24: "My work as a writer had always been to witness." The action enables the algorithm rewrite when Mara's description is incorporated. Major turn traces to witnessing: asking Mara to speak about the stone's sound unlocks the translation. Closure participation strong: the narrator witnesses the radio-transmission catharsis and presses the telegram as final witness act. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4. Deductions: "witness" overlaps heavily with "lucid dream chronicler" and "heals with words," creating redundancy across elements −0.6; swappable with "listen" or "record" in several beats −0.4. 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method signaled early (line 16: "Align the glyphs with the rise and fall of R Lyrae") and mechanics explained: chart variable star periods, match them to frieze chisel marks, rewrite algorithm weights. The method shapes two key attempts: initial charting and the algorithm rewrite using Mara's grief memory. Without variable stars as cipher, the translation would fail—high irreplaceability. Closure participation: the final clause maps "exactly onto the altar inscription" via the star-period method. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (unique decryption key) +1.4, closure linkage (final mapping) +1.5, specificity (amplitude periods as grammar) +0.7, cost connection (narrator must align glyphs and body/breath per line 28) +0.5. Minor late-development penalty (mechanics detailed mid-story) −0.3. Very strong integration. 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting present from line 1 ("celestial mapping observatory") and anchors who/where. The dome, telescope, console, and light-curve array supply the tools needed for decoding (exposures, monitor). Two beats: adjusting the telescope focus and running the array to chart variable stars. The setting enables the method but does not itself constrain a choice—any research facility with telescopes could substitute. Closure participation weak: the dome "humming like a shell" during the radio call is atmospheric but not causal. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (provides necessary tools) +0.7, specificity (observatory fits variable-star method) +0.4. Deductions: setting functions as backdrop more than crucible; no micro-setting constraint that alters tactics −0.8; swappable with generic research station −0.5. Postcard risk mitigated by tool integration. 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled in tone phrase (line 2: "midnight") and thematic line (line 32: "when understanding dawns, or their hearts will not widen"). The story enacts the dawn metaphor: the narrator arrives at night, works through exposures, and achieves breakthrough when Mara speaks. Time does not tighten decisions—no countdown or missed deadline pressure. The "when understanding dawns" functions as thematic echo rather than stake constraint. Score: thematic presence +0.3, one beat (night-to-dawn arc implicit in structure) +0.4, closure linkage (dawn metaphor in telegram's "copper dawn" petals and final letting-go) +0.7. Deductions: timeframe is told/metaphorical, not tracked on the page −0.7; does not alter tactics or create urgency −0.8; swappable with any contemplative duration −0.6. Present but ornamental. 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation signaled early (line 4: "They asked me to decode temple inscriptions") and shapes the dominant stake throughout. Two beats: copying Orla's instructions to begin decoding and asking Mara for the collapse memory to complete it. The desire is conflicted: the narrator seeks both linguistic solution and emotional healing for Mara, creating friction when the two must converge. Cost visible: shaking hands, the need to involve Mara's trauma, and the final letting-go after success. Closure participation strong: the decoded vow ("carry the weight of water as a village") answers the motivation with communal logic. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (drives collaboration choice) +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5. Minor deduction: motivation stated more than dramatized through failed attempts that would reveal urgency −0.5. 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone signaled early (line 2: "midnight solace") and sustained through diction: "breath letter," "daylily edge shone like a small star," "wet stone turning into wheat." The tone modulates under pressure—solace deepens into communal catharsis when the team cries over the radio. The final image ("a compass for the next dark crossing") recharges the solace with cost: comfort is earned, not given. Score: early signal +0.6, modulation across beats (quiet work to shared release) +0.8, closure linkage (solace becomes active compass) +1.3, coherence through turns +0.7. Deductions: "midnight solace" as phrase is beautiful but borders on ornamental label; the tone does not constrain a choice or shift tactics −0.5; occasional figurative density risks drifting into static lyricism without on-page pressure anchor −0.3. Strong but not indispensable. 6.6.</comment>
