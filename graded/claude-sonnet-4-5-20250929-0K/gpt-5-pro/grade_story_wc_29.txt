<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's professional interiority (charts, synthesis rack, frequency knowledge) is specific and embodied through repeated micro-choices—opening the gate valve, recruiting allies, patching the bay—each foreclosing options under pressure. Internal conflict registers in "cautiously hopeful" balanced against cosmic manipulation, and the final choice to hand the provost headphones shows contradiction (nodding to power while subverting it). However, the tricksters remain abstract antagonists without individual traits, and secondary cast (bass player, acoustics grad, custodian) lack distinct voices or conflicting agendas; they function as textured extensions of the narrator's will. Emotional progression reads as steady resolve rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, capping upward movement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered details (charts, scaffold pulses, community division) and reaches a pattern break when the subsonic scaffold forces the provost to "remember that radios are bridges, not guns," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant: the final hour hums with healing slower than harm, options reweighted). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 6 (narrator, studio, midnight shift); causality coheres under accumulative logic (tricksters feed on attention → narrator shapes form not silence → subsonic interference → squeal and vacancy). Cost is legible: the tower shakes, breakers trip, campus police arrive, and the narrator accepts administration scrutiny to keep the bridge singing. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scaffold turns brittle laughter into "many small denials braided into a rope that snaps." Minor slip: the climax sequencing (breakers trip, provost listens, breakers thrown back, dawn node caught) compresses multiple moves into summary cadence without clear elapsed time or spatial choreography during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The studio micro-setting constrains choices throughout: grimed charts guide when to open the gate valve, the synthesis rack shapes the reply, tuned couches and milk-crate labyrinths become resonant tools, and the tower hum/vibration is felt "in our bones" during the subsonic scaffold deployment. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (dust/coffee/solder, breath fogging the mixer, bass string moaning like weather). The quad vigils and barricades outside the glass provide spatial contrast that pressures the narrator's bridge-versus-gun stance at closure. Specificity is high (turntable bearing grease, patch bay, node over valley), and the final image—sun sliding up the tower as charts are folded—recharges the opening anchor. Choreography remains clear across moves despite the compressed climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop tricksters' division-amplifying riddles) is signaled early and tightens when "students turn against professors, professors against administrators" and rumors threaten license sale or booth occupation. One meaningful escalation: the narrator's subsonic scaffold provokes a "sudden wave of dissonance that shakes the tower and trips the breakers," forcing a confrontation with campus police and the provost—agency-driven choice (handing headphones) narrows options by risking shutdown to convert authority. Cost is visible (studio dark, administration scrutiny, community barricades), and the resolution (tricksters' squeal snaps, vacancy fills with breath, barricades loosen) is earned by the protagonist's tactical patience and coalition-building. However, the tricksters' final "promise shaped like applause" evaporates without on-page resistance or price paid by the narrator beyond another hour of scaffold humming, softening the climactic trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (listening builds leverage; interference through form not silence; bridges versus weapons) emerges from concrete particulars—charts mapping signal drift, subsonic scaffold aimed where laughter turns brittle, provost's pulse slowing under headphones—without overt thesis. The astronomical charts function as a recurring motif that shifts meaning: first grimed tools of prediction, then greasy-starred guides for the dawn node, finally folded artifacts of ethereal grit. The ending image ("bridges singing even during storms") resonates as a non-literal answer to the opening question of what tricksters are, reweighting the community's power-play divisions as habitat to be transformed rather than enemies to defeat. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (the nod to the provost, listeners calling and crying without words). Minor slip: "ethereal grit" in the closing line risks thematic echo by naming the stance rather than letting the final image (folded charts, cautious hope, return of tricksters expected) complete the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent professional diction (signal interpreter, gate valve, ionosphere thieves, synthesis rack) and a perceptual signature that filters environment through radio metaphor ("antenna tower hums like a spine," "riddles that sound like meteor scatter"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate interiority during chart-reading and patching, then pulls back to observe the quad's campsite certainty. Sentence rhythm accelerates during the climax ("I click the patch bay, feed the subsonic scaffold under a hymn of static, and breathe with it") and slows at closure ("healing is slower than harm and tastes stranger"). However, several beats display template cadence and filter-verb stacks: "They probe…then whisper…Students turn…professors against…administrators against…donors against" (list paralysis); "rumors say…another rumor says" (synonym loop). The final paragraph's "That is my ethic, ethereal grit" risks breaking the established voice with a tidy self-summary, though the phrase ties to prior imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("tricksters wearing vacuum for boots," "voices arrive as thin frost across the noise floor," "power plays multiply like mold in the vents"), charging the liminal atmosphere. Information load is strong: most lines advance character knowledge (charts predict nodes), world detail (subsonic frequencies felt in ribs/teeth), or pressure (provost's eyes "two shutters"). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and technical terminology (patch bay, synthesis rack, ionosphere, node) reads plausible and character-specific. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence recur: "Some claim angels, some claim criminals, some claim pranksters" (list); "Students turn against professors, professors against administrators, administrators against the station, donors against everyone" (mechanical parallelism without micro-variation); "The tricksters adore this, because power plays are their habitat" followed immediately by "the bruised fruit where they lay eggs" (metaphor stacked without integration). These patterns appear in mid-story beats and soften propulsion. The closure beat is clean. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.6 for template runs and paraphrase loops across multiple beats, raised to −0.8 because one instance ("rumors say…another rumor says") touches a high-pressure moment (administration threat).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic tricksters + college radio station + subsonic interference + astronomical charts as tactical map offers a non-obvious premise that commits fully to its logic (ionosphere thieves, signal impurities, charts grimed with turntable grease). The narrator's ethic—"interfere not with silence but with form"—provides a fresh angle on resistance narratives, and the decision to make the provost listen rather than argue inverts expected confrontation. The scaffold-as-breath metaphor and the final image (bridges singing during storms, tricksters returning, cautious hope) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression, subsonic mechanics, no overt antagonist dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the tricksters themselves remain archetypal (laughter, riddles, suggestions) without individuating traits, and the resolution's mechanics (squeal snaps, vacancy fills) lean on metaphor rather than grounded consequence. The piece transforms familiar "community division" and "radio resistance" templates through occupational specificity and the breath-versus-attention inversion, earning solid originality. Within-band bonus (+0.3) for structural risk and thematic synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by line 1 ("celestial signal interpreter"). Development: makes multiple tactical choices (open gate valve, recruit team, tune studio, click patch bay, hand provost headphones) that narrow options under pressure. Payoff: final paragraph declares "That is my ethic" and the choice to fold charts and stay cautiously hopeful shapes closure stance. The role's occupational specificity (charts, synthesis rack, subsonic scaffold knowledge) is irreplaceable—removing "interpreter" would collapse the tactical logic. Causal pressure is strong across three beats (chart-reading, scaffold deployment, provost confrontation) with visible cost (risking shutdown). Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = base 8.6; minor deduction −0.3 for the character functioning more as operator than a personality with internal contradiction that drives mistakes; rounded 7.8 per non-closure friction in Q1 embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 7 ("astronomical charts grimed with fingerprints"). Development: charts "tell me when to open the gate valve, when to hold, when to speak" (prescriptive use, one beat) and later "predict a quiet patch near dawn when the moon skims a node" (second beat enabling the climax). Payoff: "I fold the astronomical charts and wipe grease from my fingers" in the final paragraph, a tactile closure reprise. The charts supply timing logic that shapes two key moves (gate-valve decision, dawn-node timing) and their grimed/greasy physicality distinguishes them from generic star maps. However, mid-story the charts disappear (no handling during the scaffold-building or provost confrontation), reducing presence. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.3 = base 6.9; deduction −0.5 for mid-story absence when other tools (synthesis rack, patch bay) do the tactical lifting; rounded 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: framed line 2 ("the community divides") and elaborated line 12 ("Students turn against professors, professors against administrators, administrators against the station, donors against everyone"). Development: "Power plays multiply like mold in the vents" and "The tricksters adore this, because power plays are their habitat, the bruised fruit where they lay eggs"—the concept shapes both the antagonist's method and the community's vulnerability. Payoff: the provost's arrival ("his eyes two shutters") is a power-play moment that the narrator counters by making him listen, and the final lines acknowledge "tricksters will return" because power plays are cyclical. The concept is indispensable: removing it collapses the tricksters' motive, the community's fracture mechanics, and the narrator's "bridges not guns" resolution. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats (division, trickster habitat, provost standoff) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled line 5 ("I am cautiously hopeful because I remember something old tech people forget"). Development: the trait constrains one choice—recruiting allies and building the scaffold rather than raging or going silent—and the word "cautiously" tempers expectations when the tricksters push back. Payoff: final line "I stay cautiously hopeful, not naive, because tricksters will return." The attribute bookends the piece and charges the ending stance with earned restraint (cost: acknowledgment of cyclical threat). However, the trait functions more as tonal consistency than a tradeoff generator; no on-page moment where hopefulness enables a risk that costs something tangible, or where caution prevents a bolder move. Score: early signal +0.6, one beat (restraint in final stance) +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (acknowledgment of return) +0.3 = base 5.3; lyric-resonance allowance +0.5 for first-paragraph seed → last-line reprise that reweights the stake; rounded 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: announced line 14 ("I use the station's outdated synthesis rack to shape the only reply that might matter") and elaborated line 15 ("If they live on attention, I will interfere not with silence but with form"). Development: interference tactics structure the middle (tuning couches, stacking crates, feeding subsonic scaffold) and the climax (scaffold vibrates bones, squeal snaps). Payoff: "We leave the scaffold humming for another hour, because healing is slower than harm"—the action's consequence persists into closure. The verb "interfere" and its method (form not silence) are irreplaceable; swapping to "respond" or "counter" would flatten the conceptual spine. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats (rack shaping, scaffold deployment, humming aftermath) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = base 8.2; deduction −0.3 for the interference mechanics (subsonic scaffold) arriving somewhat late (line 16) as a tool rather than a struggle the narrator must discover; rounded 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 16 ("Our transmitter can speak through subsonic frequencies, the kind you feel in ribs, soles, and teeth"). Development: the method enables the scaffold's effect ("aim the scaffold at frequencies where their laughter turns brittle") and the climax moment ("The room vibrates in our bones…like finding a river under floorboards"). Payoff: the subsonic scaffold slows the provost's pulse and leaves the scaffold "humming for another hour." The specificity (subsonic = felt not heard, targeting brittle frequencies) distinguishes this from generic "radio signal" or "broadcast," and the method's mechanics matter causally. However, it appears after the midpoint and is not discovered or tested earlier—no failed attempt or calibration beat. Score: two beats (scaffold deployment, provost pulse-slowing) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.3 = base 6.8; deduction −0.4 for late first appearance (second third) and lack of struggle to acquire or tune the method; rounded 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: anchored line 6 ("The antenna tower hums like a spine, and the studio smells of dust, coffee, and solder"). Development: the studio's resources constrain and enable tactics across multiple beats—synthesis rack, turntable bearings, patch bay, couches as dampers, milk crates as resonant labyrinths, the glass separating inside from outside vigils. Payoff: "the custodian opens the door, lets the morning in" and the tower with sun sliding up it frame the ending image. The station's physical and social position (campus radio, administration scrutiny, license-sale threat) is indispensable; relocating to a generic broadcast booth would erase the community-fracture stakes and the coalition-building tactics. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats (resource use, coalition space, confrontation site) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.8, cost connection (shutdown threat) +0.5 = 8.3; no deductions, setting is integral and micro-detailed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: framed line 2 ("The city around campus holds its breath as the community divides") and elaborated throughout (vigils, shouting, whispers, barricades). Development: the division creates dual pressure—external (donors, administration, patriots threatening occupation) and internal (tricksters amplifying fracture)—that forces the narrator's interference choice. The timeframe "as" signals simultaneity: the story unfolds during one graveyard shift while division peaks outside. Payoff: "outside the barricades loosen into conversations" marks the temporal-end closure when morning arrives. The element tightens decisions (dawn node timing, hourly alarm, second hour of graveyard shift) and alters tactics (must act before license sale or occupation). Score: early signal +0.7, three beats (community pressure, timing constraints, loosening at dawn) +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection (fragile window) +0.4 = 8.0; deduction −0.4 for vague elapsed time during climax (breakers trip, provost listens, breakers thrown back—no clock anchors); rounded 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: declared line 19 ("To outwit cosmic tricksters you cannot rage, you must make them notice their own breath"). Development: the motive drives tactical choices (shape form not silence, aim scaffold at brittle frequencies, hand provost headphones to make him remember) and sustains pressure when the tricksters push back with dissonance. Payoff: "tricksters will return, but we have learned to breathe together"—the verb "outwit" is fulfilled not by elimination but by teaching breath-awareness, a transformed win condition with visible cost (cyclical vigilance). The motive's specificity (outwit = notice breath, not destroy or silence) is irreplaceable and generates the entire tactical arc. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats (tactical framing, scaffold aim, post-climax acknowledgment) +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = 8.6; deduction −0.6 for the motive being more operational principle than conflicted desire—no friction between wanting to outwit and cost of patience, or temptation to rage; rounded 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: established early through diction ("thin frost across the noise floor, bright and ruthless and laughing," "tricksters wearing vacuum for boots," "antenna tower hums like a spine") that blends the numinous with worn materiality (dust, grease, pennies-taste coffee). Development: tone modulates under pressure—lyric compression during scaffold-building ("breath fogs the mixer, bass player tunes a string until it moans like weather"), percussive urgency at climax ("squeal scans as many small denials braided into a rope that snaps"), then elegiac patience at closure ("healing is slower than harm and tastes stranger"). Payoff: final image ("keeping bridges singing even during storms") fuses ethereal metaphor (bridges, singing) with gritty acknowledgment (storms, tricksters returning, grease wiped from fingers). The tone is coherent across turns and indispensable—shifting to clinical procedural or high-fantasy register would break the narrator's voice. Score: early signal +0.8, modulation across three pressure levels +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = 7.4; bonus +0.3 for risk (sustained lyric-tech hybrid without clarity loss); rounded 7.7.</comment>
