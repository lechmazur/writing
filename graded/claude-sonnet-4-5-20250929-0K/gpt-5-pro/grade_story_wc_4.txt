<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied ("tremble that travels with devotion"), with micro-choices shaped by professional expertise. However, the protagonist remains observational throughout; Ole and Marta make brief appearances but the archivist never faces a meaningful internal conflict or contradiction that forces a difficult trade-off. The ending choice to close the case "lighter than when I arrived" reads as completion rather than renunciation with visible cost. Competence dominates; struggle remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered image-work (spiral → corridor → wing), and the final span reweights collective memory with quiet resonance. Orientation anchors arrive early (lavender field, factory ruins, dawn). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community stands inside the wing and "footsteps translate fear into a soft percussion"—but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or decision that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: lavender steadies heartbeat, rebar becomes harp strings, the smokestack anchors lines. Sensory detail (scent, wind, rain) is filtered through the archivist's professional lens and modulates with pressure. The corridor's spatial choreography is clear across beats, and the final sycamore-to-smokestack span charges the closure image. The micro-setting (map case, fishing line, clothespins) constrains choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—shaping remembrance that can "breathe on its own"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates as participants add photos and name what they see, and the storm tests the structure without breaking it. However, escalation is largely external (weather, community response); the archivist's own agency remains facilitative rather than decision-driven. The final image reweights collective healing, but no on-page reversal or trade-off forecloses a path with visible cost scaled to individual stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: photographs as "garlands from sorrow," the spiral becoming "a wing half folded for landing," and the declaration that "the masterpiece is not the pictures but the space we made to linger together inside them." The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Ole's bow, Marta shading her eyes) and the piece resists tidy resolution. Minor slip: "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated directly rather than fully earned through prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and purposeful: "subtle puzzle archivist," "earnest whimsy," and "grief dislikes sudden brightness" establish a consistent perceptual signature. Diction remains within the narrator's register (professional but warm) and modulates under pressure without breaking. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext and advances plot (Ole's "why we were making garlands from sorrow" receives a thematic reply that also hands him agency). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable. Minor tic: some metaphors are elevated but remain voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "We curved the lines into a corridor of memory that opened like a shell" advances spatial logic, metaphor, and collective action). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is concentrated but coherent. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrases ("the mirrors stopped being glass and became windows" follows "I saw the town seeing itself" closely) and occasional elevated diction in peak beats ("thrummed like violin strings tuned to rain") that slightly drifts from the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The piece transforms the community-art trope through specific lived detail (rusted factory, oil lamps during blackout, bent whistle) and a non-obvious synthesis of grief work with spatial installation. The spiral-to-wing progression feels earned in hindsight. However, the core frame—archivist facilitates collective healing via photographs—is familiar, and the emotional arc works largely unchanged if the medium or setting shifts. The ending resists abstraction and the perceptual signature is memorable, but the premise does not take a bold enough risk to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist is present throughout, frames the project, marks the spiral, and guides participants. However, observation dominates; decisions (closing the case, anchoring the final strip) are completions rather than turns that narrow options. The character enables others' choices but does not face a personal reversal with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and closure, but swappable with a facilitator archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The map case appears in three beats: arrival (scuffed by doors), mid-installation (someone whispers it looks ready to fly), and closure (closed lighter). The final reprise reweights the burden from heavy to light and charges the ending image. However, the case does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a thematic carrier rather than a causal lever. Lyric resonance is strong but agency link is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collective healing shapes stakes on the page: participants pin photos, name the spiral, and stand inside the wing. The concept drives the project's structure (spiral, corridor, wing) and is dramatized through Ole's bow and Marta's shading. However, it remains facilitated rather than conflicted; no friction between competing visions of healing or cost to achieving it. Present in all three gates but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is asserted early ("I was perceptively calm, not from indifference, but from learning how grief dislikes sudden brightness") and shown through the tremble in the archivist's hands and the measured pacing of the installation. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it colors voice and tactics without forcing a trade-off. Label-heavy; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Linger" is signaled early ("I asked everyone to linger at the center"), recurs throughout ("we linger because we know the puzzle fits only at human speed"), and drives the final realization ("the space we made to linger together inside them"). The action shapes the project's tempo, forces participants to slow and listen, and charges the closure. Essential to the piece's rhythm and thematic claim; removing it would flatten the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (photographs pinned to fishing lines, curved into arcs) and its mechanics matter: the arcs become a corridor, then a wing. The photographs are selected, positioned, and reweighted across beats (Marta's grandmother beside the factory gate, Ole's floor near the school play). The spiral-to-wing progression is causally linked to the method. Present in all three gates and shapes two key beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is anchored immediately (lavender field behind factory ruins) and recurs across beats: lavender steadies heartbeat, rebar becomes harp strings, the smokestack anchors the final strip, vines climb as a temporal marker. The ruins supply materials (rebar, smokestack) that constrain the installation's structure. The setting shapes tactics (where lines are strung) and charges the final image (smokestack to sycamore span). Essential to the piece's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears twice: mid-piece ("As vines climb the broken smokestack, the wind plays a slow tune") and at closure ("As vines climb, we will keep adding loops to the wing"). The phrase marks progression and suggests ongoing growth, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The storm introduces urgency briefly, but "as vines climb" functions as lyric refrain rather than temporal constraint. Poetic but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated directly ("Because we intend to transmute pain into a masterpiece") and dramatized through the archivist's choices: marking the spiral, asking participants to speak when breath grows warm, guiding by naming. However, the desire is never conflicted; no friction between the drive to create and a cost to the archivist or the community. The motivation shapes the project's arc but lacks visible tradeoffs. Present in all three gates but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" is signaled early ("the mood I carried was earnest whimsy") and sustained through voice choices: "garlands from sorrow," photographs that "pinned themselves to light," children naming the spiral "a river, then a rib cage, then a street where the lamps never burn out." The tone modulates under pressure (storm arrival, Ole's question) without breaking and charges the final image with quiet sincerity. Coherent through turns; elevates the closure without forcing sentiment.</comment>
