<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Old Partial's interiority is consistent and embodied through metaphor ("trusted what was missing more than what showed," "worrying puzzles the way waves worry pilings"). Motivation to decode the gesture is clear and drives sustained action across multiple beats. The borrowed-memory device introduces concrete sensory flashes that inform choice, though the mechanism leans slightly toward convenient revelation. The final choice to continue signaling beyond Mira's departure is earned by accumulated particulars and forecloses the need for external validation with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—pattern accumulates through gaps, pauses, and absences that build density toward the recognition scene. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's acknowledgment and the keeper's decision to continue signaling crystallize his role as "lantern and harbor both" with felt cost—he accepts witness-work as perpetual, not transactional. One meaningful deepening occurs when absence spelling becomes legible instruction, narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is visible in the keeper's acceptance of margins and borrowed memories as his permanent station.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, lighthouse lens, and harbor return across beats and constrain action—adjusting the lantern's pauses, pinning the flower inside oilskin, aiming light at the shipping lane. Sensory detail is filtered through the keeper's perceptual idiom ("harbor learns the living by the gestures they do not finish," "mist made the harbor a page erased"). The lighthouse mechanism (lens, waltz timing, pauses) directly enables the message and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear; no prop or distance errors. Minor note: Edelweiss's mountain origin versus sea setting is noted but not fully leveraged as a tactical constraint within the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode and transmit the stranger's message—is signaled early and tightens through investigation beats: observing the salt outline, reading harbor ledger gaps, adjusting the lens pattern. Escalation is textural and situational: density increases as borrowed memories ripen into instructions, then the liner's arrival tests whether the message lands. Agency lies in the keeper's persistent attention and lantern adjustment; the final decision to keep signaling forecloses transactional closure with visible cost (perpetual witness-work). Coincidence (the liner's arrival) complicates but does not resolve; the keeper's prior setup enables recognition, and Mira's gesture completes the exchange.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—witness, absence as communication, and the cost of being a carrier—emerges from concrete particulars: gaps spelling names, borrowed memories, the boutonniere as ferry ticket. The lighthouse's function as both literal and metaphoric lantern anchors the thematic question without statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "some messages are for the carrier as much as the receiver" reweights prior action (the keeper's nightly routine, his placement of the flower in salt) without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture, silence, and the recurring image of the Edelweiss shifting from stranger's memento to shared code to preserved artifact. One brief thematic echo in "I was the eccentric lighthouse keeper they named Old Partial for the way I trusted what was missing" is voice-integrated and primes the central method rather than announcing a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and apt; distance remains consistent with lyric compression throughout. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and voice-particular: "gaps are the letters of the tide," "the seam of the world unthreading," "borrowed memories the way a neighbor lends a cup with a crack." Diction stays within the keeper's plausible lexicon—nautical, observational, metaphorically dense but legible. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (gaps, absences, borrowed) are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor note: density of figurative language is high across many consecutive sentences in the middle third; the pattern is consistent and voice-motivated, so no major penalty, but a brief breath might sharpen peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high—most lines advance character perception, investigation mechanics, or thematic weight. No major loops or paraphrase detected. Clarity holds across the accumulative structure. Minor deductions: some figurative vehicles crowd adjacent lines without breathing space ("mist made the harbor a page erased," "borrowed memories the way a neighbor lends a cup with a crack," "gaps are the letters of the tide" all land within a short span), which slightly dilutes each image's charge. Filter verbs ("I wanted to decode," "I decided to investigate") cluster in early setup but do not dull peak beats. The final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper decodes a dying stranger's message by transmitting light-pauses to a waiting lover—synthesizes familiar elements (lighthouse solitude, coded messages, witness-work) into a specific, non-obvious frame. The method of reading absences (harbor ledger gaps, lantern pauses, borrowed memories) feels character-particular and thematically integrated. Risk-taking in lyric density and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on this keeper's perceptual idiom and this lighthouse's mechanics. No close echoes of famous lines detected. Minor note: the "eccentric lighthouse keeper" framing and the borrowed-memory device carry slight genre convenience, but execution through specific detail elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Old Partial's choices create all key turns: deciding to investigate, adjusting the lantern pattern, aiming it nightly at the shipping lane, and choosing to continue signaling after Mira departs. Present in setup, middle investigation, and ending decision. Causal pressure is high; the keeper's persistence and perceptual idiom enable message transmission. Cost is visible in the final acceptance of perpetual witness-work. "Eccentric" and "softly persistent" traits constrain tactics (worrying puzzles, observing gaps) and shape the final stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss boutonnière appears in at least four beats: pressed into the keeper's palm, pinned inside oilskin, lending borrowed memories, Mira's matching flower, and placed in salt at the end. Its mountain origin versus sea setting is noted and thematically charged ("ferry ticket for a mountain that could not come"). Handles enabling the investigation (borrowed memories) and charges the final image (preservation in salt). Reweighted across beats from stranger's token to shared code to kept artifact. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" is explicitly named and dramatized: the boutonnière lends sensory flashes (hill wedding, child in wool, train tunnel, cabin smoke) that inform the keeper's understanding of the gesture's significance. These glimpses shape the keeper's realization that the message matters to someone waiting and prime the name "Mira." Present in setup (pinning the flower), middle (memories ripen into instructions), and ending (keeper as carrier of borrowed hope). The mechanism is slightly convenient—memories arrive without clear on-page cost or resistance—but they do narrow options and enable the solution. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is implied rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is dramatized through the keeper's repeated nightly return to the dock, adjustment of the lantern, and the metaphor "worrying puzzles the way waves worry pilings." The trait constrains tactics (slow, observational investigation rather than direct inquiry) and enables the solution (patience allows pattern recognition). Present in setup ("I had always been softly persistent"), middle (nightly signaling), and ending (decision to keep signaling). Visible tradeoff: the keeper foregoes quick answers and accepts incremental, marginal work. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait shapes method but does not create a sharp on-page fork.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Investigate" is the keeper's dominant action across beats: observing the salt outline on the shirt, checking the harbor ledger for skipped whistles, adjusting the lens to measure darkness between flashes, and decoding the pattern. Major turns trace to this action—gaps spelling Mira's name, the instruction sequence emerging, the liner's arrival confirming success. Present in setup ("I decided to investigate"), middle (multiple beats of observation and adjustment), and ending (continued signaling as extended investigation). Causal pressure is high; removing this action collapses the plot. Cost is legible in sustained attention and acceptance of witness-work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is the method explicitly named and mechanically demonstrated: gaps in the harbor ledger, absences in light flashes spelling Mira's name, the pattern of pauses the stranger traced. The method is signaled early ("I began by observing gaps, because gaps are the letters of the tide"), drives the middle investigation (measuring darkness between flashes), and enables the ending (pauses thread into Mira's eyes). Mechanics matter—three long silences, two short, one long—and shape the solution. Specificity and causal pressure are high; the method is irreplaceable and charges the thematic frame (absence as language).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist appears in the opening, returns across beats ("I kept returning to the opal dock in mist at the same hour"), and frames the ending ("the mist took back the dock"). The setting provides the vantage for the lighthouse work and the atmospheric condition (mist) that necessitates and dramatizes the light's function. Mist as erasure and readiness for new writing primes the thematic frame. Minor note: the dock itself is more atmospheric anchor than tactical constraint; the lighthouse lens and lantern do more causal work. Still, the dock-and-mist combination charges the final image and is present in setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"At nautical twilight" is named in the opening and returns ("at nautical twilight I listened," "On the fourth evening"). The timeframe provides atmospheric consistency and primes the keeper's routine (lighthouse operation at dusk). It does not tighten decisions with a live clock or create tactical pressure—events unfold across multiple evenings without urgency. Present in setup and implied across middle beats; the ending does not hinge on this specific time. Lyric resonance is moderate; the timeframe supports tone more than escalation. Two gates met (setup, implied middle); closure participation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To decode a stranger's final gesture" is the keeper's explicit motivation, stated early ("I wanted to decode a stranger's final gesture") and dramatized through investigation beats and the final transmission. Friction between the desire to solve the puzzle and the constable's demand for reports creates minor pressure. The motivation drives all major actions and is fulfilled at closure when Mira acknowledges the message. Cost is legible in the keeper's acceptance of perpetual witness-work beyond the single case. Present in setup, middle (all investigation beats), and ending (decision to continue signaling). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout: the keeper as margin-dweller, Mira standing alone on the liner's deck, the stranger's final gesture, the seam of the world unthreading. Tone modulates subtly—from quiet observation at the opening to the charged recognition scene to the keeper's reflective acceptance at the end. The final image ("I would keep signaling") charges the tone with perpetual solitude as vocation. Tone is not static; it deepens as the keeper moves from curiosity to understanding to acceptance. Strong closure linkage—the keeper's isolation is reweighted from circumstance to chosen stance, and the cost (no salute, no wave, only acknowledgment) is undeniable.</comment>
