<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilias is portrayed through consistent action and micro-choices (the plant arrangements, the reed placement), and his colorblindness shapes his perception in specific ways ("trust lives in value, shadow, pulse, and weight"). Mara's muteness and plant-language communication create genuine constraint. However, interiority remains thin—most emotional states are asserted rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure, and the apprentice and traveler function more as conduits than sources of friction. The final "awakenings barter themselves" feels more thematic echo than earned character shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it: the courtyard hush, the cracked phoenix, the mounting exchanges of awakenings build toward the ending's resonant reconfiguration where "practice becomes festival" and the failed bird is reread as home. Orientation anchors (who, where, post-phoenix timeframe) arrive by the opening beats. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—the flawed phoenix reweighted as purposeful, the crack given voice—and the cost is legible in Mara's wreath and the city's shift from "safety" to "practice." One meaningful deepening (the reed insertion and its consequences) tightens the dominant stake. The lens remains coherent, though causality between individual client visits and the final communal understanding is more textural than mechanical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courtyard, kiln, pedestal, and cracked phoenix are concrete and recur with functional pressure: the phoenix's crack becomes the story's hinge object, the plant arrangements serve as communication medium, and the market whispers anchor social context. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("smoke water and milk lime...for texture that teaches air where to travel"). The failed phoenix on the pedestal constrains Ilias's choice and charges the final image when Mara's wreath renames it "home." Spatial choreography is clear across all beats. The setting functions as micro-geography that enables the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming flaw into function, "bartered awakenings"—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through the traveler's request, the apprentice's protest, and the community's skepticism. The reed insertion is a single meaningful tightening driven by Ilias's agency, and the cost is legible: he risks his reputation ("fraud because he sees no colors") and the phoenix's integrity. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening arrives when the phoenix sings and the courtyard's posture shifts. No secondary reversals are required at this length, but the escalation is more textural than confrontational—pressure accrues through client visits rather than a sharpening dilemma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cracked phoenix and Ilias's method: imperfection as voice, "practice" over "safety," the courage of broken light. The final image—"practice becomes festival" and Mara's wreath reading "home"—reweights the opening's "hush between heat and ash" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the plant codes and the traveler's sunken song. The piece resists easy binaries and offers a conceptual answer (cracks as throats, flaws as listening) that feels earned by prior particulars. Minor drift: some phrasing ("only small awakenings that might change the angle of seeing") leans slightly abstract, but the concrete phoenix and reed anchor the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Ilias with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (colorblind trust in "value, shadow, pulse, and weight"). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality. The prose carries a distinct texture ("innocently cunning restraint," "thready rainbows"), and lexicon stays character-appropriate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close on Ilias's micro-choices, wider on the courtyard's collective response). Minor penalty: under peak pressure (the reed insertion), some sentences lean slightly elevated ("seating brass inside the thin arterial fault") when plainness might sharpen immediacy, and the piece occasionally uses filter constructions ("he says little, holding to his motive") that could tighten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is high in the phoenix-transformation sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "bartered awakenings" recurs four times with near-identical phrasing, "communicating through plant arrangements" is restated almost verbatim, and "after the phoenix rises" opens two paragraphs identically. Template cadence in the client-visit beats ("People pass...she asks...he lays out") flattens momentum mid-story. The final image ("he keeps painting the brave cracks") is vivid, but the loops and stock constructions ("innocently cunning" twice, "small awakenings" thrice) accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of colorblind painter, plant-code communication, and singing glasswork is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms familiar "finding beauty in brokenness" material through the concertina reed as literal voice and the plant grammar as operational constraint. The final turn—failed phoenix reread as purposeful—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is modest but coherent: the textural accumulation and lyric compression are purposeful without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids generic templates and commits fully to its premise. Minor cap: the "bartered awakenings" frame, while executed with specificity, echoes craft-fair whimsy tropes without a sharp moral edge to distinguish it further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ilias (colorblind painter) is introduced early, drives the reed-insertion choice at midpoint, and his perception ("value, shadow, pulse, and weight") shapes multiple micro-choices. His colorblindness matters on the page: he paints "not for color but for texture" and the crack becomes legible to him as "a seam of ore." He appears in the final beat painting "brave cracks." Three beats (setup, reed choice, ending) and causal pressure (his method enables the phoenix's song) push this toward 7.0, but his colorblindness does not create visible cost or narrow a high-stakes option—it enables without friction. Slight swappability: a different perceptual filter (hearing-impaired musician, touch-sensitive sculptor) could perform similar work with modest edits. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure presence +0.7, specificity +0.4, minus swappability −0.6 and no tied cost −0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue is introduced early (traveler's arrival), used decisively at the transformation beat (slipped into the phoenix's crack), and its effect (the phoenix sings, traveler hears her sunken song) provides the story's central turn and charges the closure. Three distinct beats with high causal pressure and closure linkage. The reed's brass materiality and function as vibrating voice are irreplaceable—no generic object could substitute. Minor friction: it does not create a problem earlier that it later solves; it arrives as solution. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, minus late-problem solve −0.6 and ornamental traveler intro −0.2 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is named early (sign on the plank table), frames all client interactions, and the ending explicitly declares "awakenings barter themselves into the day." However, the mechanics remain abstract: what is traded for what, and at what cost, is never dramatized in a high-pressure choice. The traveler "payment is complete within the law" is told, not shown. The concept operates more as thematic label than constraint that narrows options. It shapes atmosphere but not tactics. Score: early signal +0.6, present across beats +0.4, thematic closure echo +0.4, minus abstraction/told-only −0.8 and swappability (could be "traded repairs" or "gifted songs") −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is applied to Ilias's hands early and repeated once ("innocently cunning restraint"). The trait is asserted but never enacted in a visible tradeoff: we do not see cunning enabling a choice or innocence imposing a cost. His actions (plant arrangements, reed insertion) read as skilled and gentle, not as a tension between guile and naivety. Label-only mention without on-page friction. Score: setup +0.3, label repeated +0.2, minus label-only −0.8 and no cost tie −0.5 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Awaken" is the verb at the story's core: Ilias promises "small awakenings," the traveler asks to "awaken her music," and the final line references "awakenings barter themselves." The phoenix's song is the dramatized awakening, and the child's laughter with "rainbows...broken yet generous" is a second instance. However, the action itself is passive-coded—things are awakened by Ilias rather than Ilias performing a distinct, high-cost act of awakening. The verb shapes multiple beats but remains somewhat diffuse. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal link to outcome +0.8, closure presence +0.7, minus passivity and swappability (could be "restore," "transform") −0.6 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plant-arrangement communication is introduced early (fennel, rosemary, stems angled), used in at least four distinct beats (Ilias to Mara, Mara's reply via apprentice, proposal for the phoenix, Mara's gratitude wreath), and its mechanics matter: angles and species carry legible meaning translated by the apprentice. The method constrains Ilias's communication and shapes his plan. The final wreath ("nettle and chamomile...reads home") charges the closure image. Minor friction: the grammar is told more than tested under pressure—no miscommunication or cost from misreading. Score: early +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure +1.2, specificity +0.6, minus told-mechanics −0.5 and no error-cost −0.3 = ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is named early, anchors all action, and supplies the kiln, pedestal, and failed phoenix that drive the plot. The setting enables Ilias's work and provides the social space where "the courtyard watches" and "the city understands." The courtyard's post-phoenix hush and the pedestal's cracked bird are concrete constraints. The setting participates in the closure (wreath by the kiln door). Score: setup +0.7, present across beats +1.0, supplies key object (phoenix) +0.8, closure link +0.9, minus some postcard description ("plank table," "bricks") −0.4 and partial replaceability (any artisan's yard) −0.2 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" is the opening timeframe and recurs twice, establishing that the failed phoenix "was blown yesterday" and the year's safety ritual has just occurred. This context motivates Mara's impulse to discard the bird and the city's shift from fear to practice. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures Ilias, and the "after" is atmospheric rather than tactical. It sets mood but does not escalate. Score: setup +0.6, thematic link to closure (safety→practice) +0.5, minus vague duration and no tactical pressure −0.8 and replaceability (could be "after the storm," "after the fire") −0.5 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To find beauty in imperfection" is stated early as Ilias's motive and demonstrated through his study of the cracked phoenix ("only the cracked vessels tell him where light leans"). The motive drives his choice to repair rather than discard and aligns with the story's thematic arc. The ending—"he keeps painting the brave cracks"—reinforces it. However, the motive is never conflicted or tested by a competing desire; no scene shows Ilias tempted to pursue perfect work or an easier path. The desire shapes choices but lacks friction. Score: setup +0.7, drives key choice +1.0, closure link +0.9, minus told-rather-than-conflicted −0.6 and no visible cost/want tension −0.4 = ~6.6.</comment>
