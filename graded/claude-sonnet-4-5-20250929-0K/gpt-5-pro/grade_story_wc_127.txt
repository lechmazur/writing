<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy without drowning in either") is embodied through consistent professional detachment and the static-sensing method. Liora's arc from grief-paralyzed to steadied is earned through the calibrated accord and her micro-choices (offering the petal, nodding despite fear, reaching for the slate to steady herself). The dealer's final reflection on "affectionate detachment" and feeling "briefly clean, then uncarved again" completes a coherent internal contradiction. Minor deduction: the dealer's backstory and professional practice are told more than tested by on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory metaphors, the grotto's hum matching Liora's pulse, and the final image of "leftover possibilities" reweights the dealer's ongoing cycle. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora gains enough courage to continue her work without "embalming herself," and the dealer accepts the transient nature of their craft with visible cost (the petal archived, the grotto dimming, the dealer left "uncarved again"). Cost is legible in the final paragraph's image of dissipating charges and the dealer's solitary stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as micro-setting throughout: its resinous hum provides the dealer's diagnostic tool, the "cool glow" houses the precompounded moods, and the dimming at the end marks closure. Sensory selection is purposeful (static prickling, labdanum scent, salt and vetiver tears) and filtered through the dealer's professional POV. The slate, electrodes, and cabinet of accords constrain the dealer's method and charge the final image when the grotto "dimmed like a patient closing their eyes."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Liora's need for courage to finish the memorial perfume without succumbing to grief—is signaled immediately and escalates through her confession ("she had perfected molecules to avoid imperfect mourning"). The dealer's calibration of "amperage, scent memory, and the rhythm of her breath" tightens pressure until "the exact instant when belief kissed doubt and decided to go steady." Agency is shared but clear: Liora offers the petal, the dealer wires it and threads the accord, and Liora's final reach for the slate (to steady, not clutch) earns the transformation. Cost is visible: the dealer gives away what they cannot keep, and Liora's tears mark the price of re-engagement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: half-truths as "the bones of bridges, not destinations," and the dealer's stance of affectionate detachment as shelter rather than connection. The ending image—"humming with leftover possibilities, already listening for the next trembling current"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how one channels emotion without drowning. Liora's line "thanked the bridge without mistaking it for the shore" crystallizes the theme without moralizing. The blotter petal's archival and the grotto's dimming charge the closure with the cost of transience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the dealer; perceptual signature is distinct (sensing via static, "fish hear riverbeds," "jeweler's loupe for invisible lies"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("courage is the child of fear and knowledge, and I sell adoption papers, never offspring"). Diction is controlled and idiosyncratic throughout, with purposeful compression ("phloxless book," "limestone consonants fusing with amber vowels"). Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("I felt her lab bench," "I felt the exact instant") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, though they remain voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor deductions: "affectionate detachment" appears three times (opening, midpoint, near-end), creating mild synonym churn around the central concept; "the grotto warmed as if a hearth had breathed" and "the grotto dimmed like a patient closing their eyes" are vivid but slightly strained metaphors given the amber-stone setting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and figurative language serves voice rather than obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of counterfeit-emotion dealing, fragrance chemistry, and static-electricity sensing is specific and non-obvious; the concept of "half-truths as alloys that hold" transforms the familiar trope of emotional surrogacy. The dealer's tools (electrodes, slate, precompounded moods) and Liora's blotter petal ground the premise in tactile particulars. The ending's recursive structure—dealer ready to repeat the cycle—feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids the explain-everything trap. Risk-taking in diction and metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Counterfeit emotion dealer: present from the opening line, drives the inciting exchange (Liora's request), shapes the middle beat (calibration and threading the accord), and charges the ending reflection on transient connection. The dealer's choices—to calibrate carefully, to thread Liora's confession without absolving, to archive the petal—create key turns and embody the story's thematic question.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fragrance chemist's blotter petal: introduced early (Liora carries it "like a pressed oath"), handled in the calibration beat (wired as a wick, absorbing notes), and returns with reweighted meaning in the ending (archived as "a pressed witness in a phloxless book"). Its stained petal vein and scent memory constrain the dealer's method and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Half truths: shapes stakes and tactics throughout. The dealer's opening declaration ("half truths are the only alloys that hold") frames the method; the midpoint reminder ("half truths are the bones of bridges, not destinations") guides Liora's choice; and the accord itself is built from "the careful lie of surviving." The concept alters options by making the counterfeit courage functional rather than deceptive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Professionally thorough: signaled early ("professionally thorough, because sloppy fabrications bruise the heart twice"), enacted in the calibration beat ("calibrated amperage, scent memory, and the rhythm of her breath"), and implicit in the ending's careful archival. The trait constrains the dealer's method with visible cost (precision requires detachment, leaving the dealer "briefly clean, then uncarved again").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subsume: appears once in dialogue ("real grief threatened to subsume her work") and is immediately countered ("Subsume nothing, I said; let us channel, not drown"). It frames Liora's fear and the dealer's tactical response but does not drive a major turn independently; the transformation hinges more on the calibration and threading beats. Functional but could be swapped for a near-synonym (overwhelm, consume) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensing through static electricity: signaled early ("Sensing through static electricity is my crooked stethoscope"), demonstrated in the inciting beat ("my fingertips sparked when I took it, the static netting us like spidersilk"), shapes the middle attempt ("my other hand searched her static for dissonance and sincerity"), and charges the ending ("the day's charges dissipated without complaint"). The method is irreplaceable and drives the dealer's diagnostic work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto at dusk: present in the title beat, provides the diagnostic hum that matches Liora's pulse, houses the cabinet of precompounded moods, and charges the closure image ("the grotto dimmed like a patient closing their eyes"). The setting constrains the dealer's method (sensing via the wall's charge) and supplies the cool glow that carries the accord to Liora.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>As the transformation completes: appears once in the penultimate sequence ("As the transformation completes, the counterfeit always finds its limit, and either fractures or ripens"). It marks the closure threshold but does not tighten earlier decisions or tactics; time remains impressionistic throughout. Functional signal of the ending moment but swappable with "when the accord settles" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>To fuse insight with empathy: declared early ("my motivation is simple and treacherous, to fuse insight with empathy without drowning in either"), enacted in the calibration beat (threading Liora's confession without absolving or accusing), and tested in the ending reflection ("a caring that stands a step back from the fire"). The desire is dramatized through the dealer's micro-choices and carries visible cost (the dealer cannot keep what they make for others).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment: established in the opening ("I tuned my trade with affectionate detachment"), reinforced in the greeting ("hello with the kind of warmth that does not cling"), articulated in the ending dialogue and reflection ("a shelter of affectionate detachment"), and charges the final image (the dealer standing alone, "already listening for the next trembling current"). The tone is coherent under pressure and modulates purposefully from professional to reflective.</comment>
