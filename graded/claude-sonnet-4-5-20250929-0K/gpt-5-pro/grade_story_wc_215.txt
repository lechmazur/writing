<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" is established early and her actions—tracing ownership, opening the box, arranging hives, breathing on panes—follow logically. Her interior state ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive") is shown through selective attention and gestures rather than diagnostic labels. However, the protagonist remains observational rather than choosing under meaningful internal conflict; she never faces a credible dilemma that forces competing impulses to act simultaneously. The final gesture (bowing, promising to carry weight) reads as acceptance rather than a costly choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Mara, oasis, post-visibility) and teaches its pattern early: lyric fragments cohere around the covenant and the box. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ghosts lift their veils, Mara bows, and the hives "click yes"—reweighting prior material with felt relational cost (the covenant retied through gesture, not speech). Cost is legible in the image of her carrying the box "like a heart" and the promise to "carry weight, not translate it." One meaningful deepening suffices under the accumulative lens. The ending lands cleanly within the taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, black sand, empty hives, and irrigation channels are vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's attentive gaze. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting and recurring object; its panes, solder seams, and changing state (sealed with new hinge, breathed upon) constrain Mara's gestures and charge the final image. The hives are arranged into parentheses—a purposeful spatial choice that frames the covenant ritual. Sensory detail (air sweetens, dust, temperature, clover scent) modulates with emotional beats. The environment shapes the closure: the covenant is retied through perimeter-walking and the hives' affirmative click.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: preserve unspoken weight and avoid repeating the keepers' breaking of the covenant through speech. The piece tightens when Mara realizes (through contextual clues) that speaking cracked the original vow, raising the cost of her task. She responds by working in "mute eloquence," a meaningful tactical shift that narrows options. Agency is present as renunciation (choosing silence over translation) with visible relational cost at closure (the ghosts draw near, the winds soften). Under the accumulative lens, one deepening suffices. However, no live dilemma forces Mara to weigh competing goods or endure friction; her path is contemplative rather than torn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—that silence and gesture can hold meaning more safely than speech—emerges from the box's "viscous archive of things left unsaid," the keepers' broken vow through fearful speaking, and Mara's climactic choice to "carry weight, not translate it." The stained glass box, recurring with reweighted meaning (archive → heart), anchors theme in particulars. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the covenant retied through breath and footsteps, the hives clicking assent. Subtext operates in every gesture (lifted veils, bowed head, traced ellipse) without overt thesis. The piece resists a moral and invites reflection on what preservation without translation costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices "the hush between sounds," traces "scorch patterns like signatures," reads currents. Diction is elevated and lyric ("mute eloquence," "pliant weight," "viscous archive") but stable and voice-motivated, matching her contemplative stance. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and parallelism ("Through contextual clues" recurs three times) teach a pattern that pays off at closure. Under peak pressure (opening the box, tracing the ellipse) syntax compresses without losing Mara's internal texture. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor: some figurative density approaches the Q7 threshold but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. High information density: most lines do double work (e.g., "stained glass box buried where wild thyme wrestled with ash" conveys object, location, and ecological tension). Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—but remains coherent and legible under the taught lyric mode. However, the phrase "through contextual clues" recurs three times in identical stem position, approaching template cadence; the repetition serves thematic echo but risks monotony. Stock constructions like "a tide of translucence" and "scorch halos" are vivid but border on ornamental. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks at closure. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes rather than accelerates, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-visibility ghosts, silent covenant retied through gesture in a scorched beekeeping oasis—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "beekeeper veils" into ghost garb and "honey" into "voice" is fresh. Emotional truth (patience and sorrow as "the same instrument differently tuned") avoids platitude through sensory anchoring. The covenant's rule (cultivate listening, not sweetness) offers conceptual surprise. However, the frame—lone mystic enters liminal space, deciphers signs, performs ritual, achieves communion—is a familiar template. The piece elevates it through tight lyric execution and the specific logic of silence-as-preservation, but the arc's skeleton remains recognizable. Risk-taking in voice and structure is present but does not fundamentally subvert genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara (astonished recluse) is present throughout, frames the opening and closing, and her choices—opening the box, arranging hives, tracing the ellipse—drive all major beats. Her attribute (recluse, astonished) is shown in her solitary return and her reaction to the ghosts. However, her role is primarily observational and ritual-enacting; she deciphers and responds but does not face a dilemma that alters her tactics under friction. Setup clear, middle and closure beats present, but no costly reversal tied specifically to her reclusive nature or astonishment. Causal role across beats lifts the score above mid-band; lack of internal conflict caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stained glass box introduced early (buried, found), handled in multiple beats (opened, examined, panes breathed upon, sealed with new hinge, carried in final walk), and charged at closure ("bearing the stained glass box like a heart"). Its properties (honey-yellow and thirsty-blue panes, brittle combs, "something that was almost honey and almost voice") are specific and irreplaceable. It enables key turns: opening releases ghosts, breathing on panes traces symbols, sealing retains the covenant. The box is causally active and visually/thematically central to the ending. Strong across all three gates. Slightly shy of indispensability (the covenant could theoretically be retied without this exact vessel, though the cost would be narrative richness).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tangled covenant shapes the story's stakes and tactics on every page. Mara's task is to avoid repeating the breaking (keepers spoke in fear, cracked the vow). The covenant's terms—cultivate listening, not sweetness; tend pause and shadow; winds carry away unbearable weight—constrain her method (mute gestures, traced ellipse). The covenant is discovered through contextual clues (scorch, tag, thumb dents) and retied at closure when "the winds [agree], a softening in the heat shimmer." It drives at least three beats (realization of the original terms, recognition of the breaking, the retying ritual) and determines the ending's meaning. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive is demonstrated through Mara's selective attention ("read meanings others missed by following the hush between sounds"), her decoding of scorch patterns and thumb dents, and her steady gaze teaching "a forgotten grammar." The trait enables her method (contextual clue reading) and constrains her approach (no speech, only observation and gesture). However, the trait is not tested under friction; no moment where tranquility fails or perception misleads with cost. Present across beats and closure-relevant (her calm breath and gaze retie the covenant) but does not produce a visible tradeoff or error. Functional and causal but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gaze appears throughout: Mara "let her gaze grow steady," reads currents, breathes upon panes while maintaining calm attention, and "gaze calm" anchors her mute work. The action shapes her method (observation without speech) and is present at closure (ghosts reflect "tiny squares" in their eyes, mirroring her steady looking). However, gaze is largely interchangeable with "attention" or "perception"; removing this exact verb and replacing it with close synonyms would not break causality. It charges atmosphere and fits thematically but is not mechanically irreplaceable. Present in all three gates, causal in middle beats, but mid-specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method (through contextual clues) is signaled early and repeatedly. Mara traces ownership via "scorch pattern like a signature, a cloth tag stitched with bees, and three thumb dents on the latch." She realizes the covenant's terms and the breaking through the same method: reading what is not spoken. The phrase recurs three times, teaching the pattern. The method shapes her tactics (no asking, no guessing—only reading traces) and is essential to the story's logic: without contextual inference, she cannot avoid repeating the keepers' mistake. The method is irreplaceable and causally central. Present across all beats and determinative at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland grounds every beat. The setting supplies props (hives, smoker pouch, wild thyme and ash) that enable key actions (arranging hives into parentheses, scavenging beeswax for the new hinge). The environment's desolation and post-scorch state embody the broken covenant and pressure Mara's task. The setting is present at closure (the hives click yes, the perimeter walk traces the ellipse). Spatial choreography is clear (cracked irrigation channels, perimeter, center). However, the oasis does not impose a live constraint that alters tactics under friction; it is stage and symbol more than obstacle. Strong presence and thematic charge, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe (after ghosts become visible) opens the story, frames Mara's return ("After the ghosts became visible, Mara returned"), and is restated midpoint ("Now, after ghosts become visible"). The visibility allows the ghosts to gather, watch, lift veils, and match her footsteps—essential to closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a countdown; Mara works at contemplative pace without time pressure. The "after" is a premise and permission rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present in setup and closure, causally relevant (no visible ghosts = no covenant retying), but does not escalate pressure. Functional and irreplaceable as condition, but not as driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation (to preserve the weight of unspoken words before sunlight bleached every syllable from memory) is stated early and dramatized across beats: Mara opens the box to access the "viscous archive," arranges hives to hold the unspoken, traces symbols of "scent and pressure and patience," and promises at closure to "carry weight, not to translate it." The motivation shapes every choice and is tested when she realizes speaking cracked the original vow, raising the cost of her task. Friction is present (the temptation to translate vs. the duty to preserve in silence). The motivation is essential to closure and irreplaceable. Slightly shy of indispensability because the story could theoretically function with a близкий desire (e.g., honor the dead), though thematic richness would suffer.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone (mute eloquence) is established in the opening ("empty hives clicked like loose teeth, a mute eloquence of labor ended yet still resonant") and sustained throughout via lyric diction, gestural restraint, and the absence of dialogue. The tone modulates subtly: the discovery of the box adds wonder, the realization of the breaking adds caution, the retying ritual adds solemnity. At closure, tone charges the final image: "she promised only to carry weight, not to translate it" and "the hives clicked yes" embody mute eloquence as method and theme. The tone is inseparable from the story's logic (speak = break; gesture = mend) and shapes reader experience at every beat. Coherent, purposeful, and indispensable.</comment>
