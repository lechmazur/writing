<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kana's internal journey from numbness to feeling is established, but the interiority relies heavily on metaphoric abstraction ("snowblind calm," "tidal alphabet") rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choices—placing palms on glass, counting until memory settles—are present but read as ritualistic rather than conflicted. The clones remain undifferentiated except for Ori, whose fan kata is elegant but doesn't demonstrate internal tension or individual stakes beyond symbolic opposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through poetic compression and holds it through closure. The ending crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's numbness cracks under trusted responsibility, and the guardianship verdict reweights all prior material with visible cost ("weight had moved into our promises"). Orientation anchors arrive within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brain's testimony shifts the custody question from ownership to direction, forcing the kata response that leads to the shared-guardian resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating dojo and brain-in-jar are vivid and purposeful, constraining the hearing's emotional stakes. The chalk line strike and fan kata use spatial choreography to dramatize opposition. However, the broader setting—torn horizon, sky-as-court—remains largely metaphoric backdrop rather than a resource that alters tactics. The body and jar anchor the closure moment (palms on glass, chimes stilling), meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through the custody hearing—is signaled early and escalates when Kana must "vivify the witness." The brain's testimony ("no one could own a seed after the forest arrives") provides a meaningful tightening that forces the kata response and the shared-guardianship resolution. The cost is legible: numbness cracks "not from violence, but from being asked to carry weight and being trusted to drop it." Under the Accumulative lens, the kata of complementary opposites deepens pressure and narrows the question from legal ownership to communal responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the brain's "direction" testimony, the kata of opposites, and the shift from ownership to guardianship. The ending offers a resonant answer to the custody question without moralizing—"we would be the guardians of each other"—and the final image (carrying the jar, dojo drifting lower, chimes keeping "human beat") reweights the premise with earned complexity. The piece resists tidy binaries (individual vs. collective, law vs. breath) and lets tension between them generate the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is highly stylized, with consistent compression and poetic syntax ("a tidal alphabet, uncertain at first and then spelling my breath"). Perceptual signature is strong—Kana notices numbness, balance, pretense—but the register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels imposed rather than character-generated ("sainthood and prison," "coauthor the next day"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Ori's "law without breath becomes a shrine to absence"). The lyric mode is taught early and held, though some readers may find the density obscures immediate clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("bamboo blade that slices through pretense," "numbness was the quiet court," "parcels of wind"), and several images in peak beats border on mixed metaphor ("seed is not a thing but a direction" works; "clones watched for a signal from me, and even my numbness leaned forward" personifies numbness in a way that slightly muddies agency). Template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "It said" and "The sensei said" openers. Information density is strong, but the metaphoric load in high-pressure beats risks obscuring cause-effect linkage for some readers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The clone-custody premise is transformed through the floating-dojo setting and the complementary-opposites frame, creating a fresh synthesis. The brain-as-witness and the kata resolution avoid stock courtroom mechanics. The final image—carrying the jar together, dojo drifting to let history rest—feels inevitable in hindsight and specific to this narrator's voice. Risk-taking in the lyric compression heightens stakes without collapsing into obscurity, though the metaphoric density may limit accessibility.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kana is present throughout and the ego-death backstory frames the numbness stake. The key choice—placing palms on glass to vivify the witness—drives the climax and earns the emotional crack. However, much of the arc is received rather than actively chosen; Kana responds to the sensei's instruction and the clones' gaze rather than initiating moves. Present in setup, middle, and ending with one causal choice, but agency is somewhat muted by the ritual frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The jar appears early (setup), is handled in the vivification beat (middle choice enables the testimony), and its stilling chimes ratify the verdict at closure. It returns with reweighted meaning: from "duplicate" label to living witness to silent lawful signature. The jar's physical presence (Kana's palms, the trembling, the chimes) constrains action and charges the final image (carried between them, "light at last"). Strong causal and closure linkage with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The custody battle structures the entire narrative: it brings the hearing to the dojo, forces the brain's testimony, and resolves into the shared-guardianship verdict. The concept is not merely thematic; it shapes tactics (the advocates object, Ori initiates the kata, Kana vivifies) and stakes (ownership vs. direction). The final resolution directly answers the custody question with visible cost and communal responsibility, making the concept indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sensei's bamboo blade "slices through pretense with a whisper" appears in the opening and the chalk-line strike silences the advocates. However, the attribute is more metaphoric descriptor than actionable constraint. It enables the sensei's authority but does not directly shape Kana's choices or impose visible cost. Present in setup and one middle beat, but swappable with another authority marker without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivifying the witness is the pivotal action: it unlocks the brain's testimony, which reframes the custody question and enables the kata resolution. The action is seeded early (sensei's instruction), executed at the climax (palms on glass, counting, bringing polarities), and its consequences shape the ending (numbness cracks, guardianship emerges). The mechanics matter—"salt to tongue," "bright to near"—and are specific to this moment. Removing it would collapse the causal chain to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Complementary opposites are introduced early (sensei's teaching), demonstrated in the vivification beat (salt/sweet, bright/dark), and embodied in Ori's fan kata (left opens, right closes, bridge appears). The method is not ornamental; it generates the resolution by making "two hard truths hold hands." The mechanics shape tactics and the closure image. The method is signaled, applied under pressure, and indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The floating dojo is present throughout, frames the hearing ("witnesses could not help but breathe the edge of the sky"), and its final drift anchors the ending image. The setting enables the brain-in-jar's presence and the kata's spatial choreography. However, it functions more as atmospheric constraint than tactical resource; characters do not navigate or exploit its features to solve problems. Present in setup, middle, and closure with thematic resonance, but not causally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "while history rewrites itself" bookends the story (opening and near-closing), but the timeframe remains vague metaphor rather than active pressure. No ticking clock or temporal scarcity alters tactics. The phrase charges tone but does not constrain decisions. Present in setup and ending, but swappable with another thematic marker without changing story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is the explicit motivation from the opening ("single vow beneath it") and drives Kana's fear of "old blankness" before the vivification. The resolution directly addresses it: "numbness cracked, not from violence, but from being asked to carry weight." The desire creates friction (fear of sainthood-prison vs. need to act) and the ending earns the emotional shift with visible cost. Motivation is dramatized in choices, not merely told, and shapes closure.</comment>
