<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is rich and voice-particular ("luminous doubt that guides us toward a fidelity larger than proof"), but motivation remains largely abstract—protecting cultural memory is declared, not tested through contradictory impulses. Micro-choices (lowering the seed, reciting the treaty) advance procedure rather than revealing hierarchy of values under competing pressure. The final bite of the fruit gestures toward acceptance but lacks the embodied cost or internal contradiction that would earn a meaningful change. Competence is high; struggle registers as atmospheric rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual beats—unpacking instruments, harvesting dreams, planting the seed, reciting the treaty—toward a coherent RR (Charged Poise: the sapling's emergence and the narrator's choice to linger). Orientation anchors who, where, and when by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ridge "counts" the villagers and some leave (a micro turn that tests commitment), and closure lands on-page with the sapling fruiting and the narrator tasting "recorded contradictions." Cost is conceptual and felt in the phrase "we have chosen what to keep breathing," but the final image leans heavily on metaphor rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The lens holds, but the tightening is softer than a high-band accumulative design would require.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ridge, shells, saltwater bowl, jacaranda shadows, and cliffside sink are vivid and sensory-specific ("perfumed and quietly mathematical," "water answers with names"). The ridge as setting constrains the planting choice (must be "where the island once decided to be real") and the seed's root "tastes stone and decides," charging the closure image. Sensory selection reflects urgency (thunder, reef clicks, monsoon arrival). Minor penalty: spatial choreography of the group moving from ridge crest to cliffside sink is legible but compressed; the transition feels telescoped rather than tracked step-by-step.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory by planting the seed correctly before monsoon—is signaled early and pursued. Pressure coheres through the timeframe (monsoon approaching), the ridge "counting" the villagers (some leave), and the discovery of the missing reef treaty. One meaningful tightening: learning the treaty and reciting it prevents the tide from "correcting us, sanding our truths smooth." Agency is present (narrator chooses to stay, recites the treaty, marks the audit complete), but the escalation reads procedural—each complication is met with a ritual solution rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. Cost is conceptual ("leaving my instruments," "chose to release") rather than viscerally felt. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at closure is present but soft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—reality as "our most careful fiction," memory as collective and fragile—emerges organically from the narrator's empirically whimsical method and the villagers' participatory rite. The final image (tasting "recorded contradictions, luminous and rough") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Doubt is clarified rather than removed, and the sapling's palimpsest bark encodes ancestor watermarks. Minor slip: "I know reality is our most careful fiction" in the penultimate line edges toward thesis statement, though it's rooted in the narrator's stance. Subtext operates well in silences (some villagers leave "because forgetting would be kinder") and the treaty's tribute of "woven lanterns and crumbs."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person singular POV is stable; narrative distance and perceptual signature are consistent ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt"). Diction is elevated and lyric ("nocturnes," "palimpsest," "pandan"), matching the conceptual frame. Under peak stress (monsoon arriving, final rite), compression is purposeful and the narrator's internal texture holds. Two frictions lower the score: (1) some figurative language feels decorative rather than voice-inevitable ("a library walking," "egrets… settle upon shoulders"), and (2) the villagers' collective voice is referenced but never individuated—they whisper, answer, kneel, but remain interchangeable. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (e.g., "The seed drinks this unity, darkens, and splits; a threadling root tastes stone and decides"). Figurative language is thick throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—without a taught pattern that pays off at closure, triggering a density penalty. Paraphrase loops appear: "I do not promise certainty, only luminous doubt" echoes the final paragraph's "Doubt is not removed; it is clarified." Template cadence in the dream-harvesting section ("The first dream… The second dream… The third…") is functional but mechanical. No grammar or tense errors. Loops and figurative density lower the score by ~0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The conceptual frame—fantasy island reality checker, empirically whimsical method, collective memory verified through interpreted dreams—is distinctive and commits fully to its premise. The synthesis of ritual anthropology, speculative bureaucracy, and lyric texture feels fresh. Execution is uneven: the seed, ridge, and reef treaty are specific to this world, but the emotional arc (narrator arrives, performs rite, lingers) is thin and the turns feel procedural rather than inevitable in hindsight. The piece resists cliché but does not take bold structural or emotional risks that would elevate it further. Transformation test: the plot would largely hold with different trappings, suggesting the freshness is more surface than deep.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The fantasy island reality checker is present throughout and frames the narrator's role. Choices include unpacking instruments, harvesting dreams, planting the seed, reciting the treaty, and choosing to linger. The decision to stay rather than leave (when some villagers depart) and to linger at the end both shape tactics, but neither decisively alters the outcome—the rite proceeds as designed. The character's professional function constrains method but does not force a costly trade-off. Present in closure (lingering, listening for holes) but not causally transformative there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is handled in four distinct beats: carried in a gauze pouch, planted in the stone hollow, drinks unity and splits into a root, bursts into a sapling with a fruit the narrator tastes. Early signal (line 14), middle development (planting and root tasting stone), and closure (fruit tasted, sapling remains). The seed's mechanics matter: it "counts" the villagers, its root "decides," and its fruit encodes "recorded contradictions." Visible cost: the sapling must be tended, and the narrator leaves instruments beside it. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; not quite indispensable (a different ritual object could serve), capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Collective memory is the dominant stake and shapes on-page tactics: villagers form a circle, answer with dream fragments, the narrator parses them into coordinates and harmonics, forming "a net of remembrance." The memory "gathers its scattered limbs and becomes a single body," which the seed drinks. Early signal (line 3), middle development (dreams, names rising, the reef treaty as missing chronicle), and closure (the sapling's leaves as "ink-veins" encoding ancestors). The concept constrains method and enables the seed's transformation, but the mechanics lean metaphorical—memory is invoked more than dramatized as friction or choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is defined early (line 7: "measurements grounded in observation, yet calibrated by listening to myth") and labels the narrator's method. It constrains approach—using shells, saltwater, and interpreted dreams rather than purely empirical tools—but no on-page moment shows a visible trade-off or cost tied specifically to whimsy versus rigor. The attribute is present in voice and frame but remains more descriptor than driver. Setup and development present; closure linkage weak (the final act is ritual, not a whimsy-rigor tension).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Waken" appears three times: the narrator wakens the knowledge fruit seed (line 14), wakens the cliffside sink by speaking the grandmother harbor song (line 33), and mentions wakening again obliquely. The first wakening (seed from gauze pouch) is setup; the second (sink answering with names) is a middle turn that enables the treaty discovery. Neither is the story's hinge—the planting and treaty recitation are equally pivotal. The action shapes two beats but is not the sole mechanism; swappable with "activate" or "invoke" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through interpreted dreams" is signaled early (line 8: "only through interpreted dreams can it reveal motive and lineage") and executed on-page: the narrator harvests three dreams (coastline/grandmother, storm of names, silence tasting pandan), parses fragments into coordinates and harmonics, and learns the reef treaty from "interpreted dreams of fishermen." The method enables the missing chronicle discovery and shapes multiple beats. Mechanics are legible (villagers whisper into ink, narrator interprets) and constrain the narrator's approach. Present in closure indirectly (the sapling encodes the interpreted record). Not indispensable—other mantic methods could serve—but essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "ancient ridge in bloom" is anchored early (line 1) and returns throughout: villagers climb the slope, the ridge hums with bees and ancestral stone, the ridge crest holds the stone hollow, and the ridge "steadies under our feet" after the treaty. The ridge supplies the planting site and pressures the choice ("must be planted where the island once decided to be real"). Jacaranda shadows and the hollow's perfume add sensory charge. The ridge constrains tactics (location matters) and charges the closure (the sapling roots there). Strong setup, development, and closure participation; not quite indispensable (another sacred site could serve).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Before monsoon arrives" is stated in line 2 and tracked on-page: "thunder far out, the first drumbeat of the monsoon" (line 37), "Rain appears on the horizon" (line 40), "The monsoon arrives as agreed" (line 43). The timeframe tightens decisions—the narrator accelerates the rite (line 37), and the seed must be planted before the monsoon or "new histories will root" (line 5). The deadline shapes tactics (compression, urgency) and the closure (monsoon arrives, washing only what was released). Live clock with visible pressure; essential but not transformative (a different deadline would serve as well).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To protect cultural memory" is declared early (line 3) and pursued throughout: the narrator confirms what the island remembers, prevents thinning of stories, plants the seed to anchor lineage. The motivation is tested when the ridge "counts" the villagers and some leave, but the narrator stays. Final choice to linger and listen for "new holes in the weave" dramatizes ongoing commitment. The desire is consistent and shapes all beats, but internal conflict is minimal—no moment where protecting memory conflicts with another want or cost. Told more than dramatized as friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is seeded early ("I do not promise certainty, only luminous doubt," line 10) and returns in the final third ("Doubt is not removed; it is clarified, a lantern whose wick is soaked in tenderness," line 44). Tone is coherent: the narrator balances empirical method with myth, embraces uncertainty, and closes with "reality is our most careful fiction." The tone modulates subtly—calm ritual moves, urgency when monsoon nears, tenderness at closure. It charges the final image (tasting "recorded contradictions, luminous and rough"). Not indispensable (a different tonal throughline could serve), but purposeful and resonant.</comment>
