<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear motivation rooted in mentor's legacy, with embodied choices (building the coupling, aiming the horn). Internal contradiction appears when discarding assumptions while also clinging to mentor's method. The shift from searcher to carrier of beginnings is earned through the tuning sequence and the cave's response. Minor deduction: Sela's interior remains thin, serving primarily as witness rather than applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the city reframed from ruin to receiver, with the instruction "pour the beginnings into the endings" crystallizing a new operational stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds through layered images (star fragment + hush shard, lunar perigee, cave glow) that converge at the bucket's return. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, situation by line 3). One meaningful deepening occurs when aiming between swing and stillness unlocks the hidden signal, altering tactical understanding. Cost is conceptual but legible: accepting the city's new position on the rope implies ongoing labor and risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gorge-suspended city supplies constant physical constraint (catwalk danger, guy-line tension during perigee) and the coupling's materiality (bottle caps, microwave horn) grounds the fantasy practicality. The map traced on railings directly enables the bucket descent, charging the closure. Sensory selection is purposeful: "serenely electric" glow, water that "sounded like lullabies," hush swallowing clatter. Minor gap: the cave's interior and the bucket mechanism remain abstract when tactile detail would sharpen the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find beginnings in endings) is signaled early and tightens through the tuning attempt. The decision to aim "at the space between swing and stillness" narrows options and produces the tone that demands tuning, forcing protagonist and Sela to "let the coupling choose." The bucket retrieval and the tasted instruction constitute a clear pivot with visible cost: the city "sagged, then steadied" under the weight of beginnings, and the protagonists commit to carrying forward. One substantive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the coupling of star (spotlights) and hush (eclipses), the city's missing planks as open gates, the gorge preserving rather than swallowing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—beginnings and endings interpenetrate—without moralizing. The protagonist's vocation (signal interpreter seeking origins) and the city's form (receiver shaped like goodbye) integrate fully. The final instruction reweights all prior material, making the city's swinging a question of courage rather than decay. No thematic echo or label-speak appears in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: "fantasy practicality," "gravity pinches the gorge and widens the air," "a tone that sounded like breath held by a planet." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature (technical + lyric diction). Sela's brief dialogue ("believes the city is alive when it swings") and the mentor's axiom ("clarity is the art of listening to what is not there") carry subtext without exposition. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of descent mechanics, the bucket's return) accelerates to closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates intentionally at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance situation, character memory, or atmospheric constraint. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the tuning sequence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor deduction: "serenely electric" recurs three times without evolving function, and a few lines edge toward stock lyricism ("small seeds wrapped in endings"). The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Figurative language (star/hush argument, gorge as preserver) remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of signal interpretation + suspended city + lunar perigee + discarding assumptions to unlock hidden patterns is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "hollywood star fragment" and "shard of hush" into a functional coupling demonstrates earned ingenuity. The conceptual move—reframing the city from ruin to receiver—feels inevitable in hindsight yet avoids template plotting. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the fantasy practicality tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final instruction (pour beginnings into endings) completes the premise without retreating to safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter's choices (building the coupling, aiming the horn, tasting the water) create all major turns. Observation is always followed by decision (discarding assumptions → aiming between swing and stillness; hearing the tone → letting the coupling choose). Present across setup, middle tuning, and closure instruction. Cost is visible when the protagonist whispers commitment and the city sags under the weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in setup (mentor's pouch), middle (pressed against hush, then bolted into horn), and closure (scatters moonlight into geometry, enabling the signal). Each beat reweights its function: talisman → coupling component → light-focusing mechanism. Swapping it for a generic reflective object would lose the thematic charge (spotlights vs. eclipses). Causal pressure: without it, the horn cannot focus the lunar limb's signal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard of hush constrains the coupling's function (swallows clatter, cuts away everything that does not belong), shapes the middle tactic (guiding moonlight inward), and enables closure (static flees, gossip falls, only the tone remains). Removing it breaks the filtering mechanism that allows beginnings to emerge. Visible cost: the hush's argument with the star creates friction that steadies the protagonist's hands, and the final clearing depends on its presence in the horn's throat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the lunar perigee effect (signals become serenely electric), the final glow from the cave, and the protagonist's method. It modulates tone across beats and charges the closure image (bioluminescent salt). Constraint is implicit: the quality enables signal clarity during perigee but is absent otherwise, altering when the attempt can succeed. Swappable with "calm energy" or similar, limiting the score, but the specific phrase recurs with intent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Tune" drives setup (mentor's method: tune by listening to what is not there), the key middle turn (tuning the horn "a breath to the left" after discarding assumptions about direction), and closure (the signal "asked to be tuned," water "sounded like lullabies"). Removing tuning as the action would eliminate the protagonist's agency and the story's central mechanism. Cost: tuning requires letting the coupling choose, surrendering control. Present across all three gates with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method "by discarding assumptions" is signaled early (mentor's axiom), applied at the critical turn (aiming not at moon or gorge but at the space between), and echoed at closure (discarding the assumption that the gorge swallows rather than preserves). The method's mechanics matter: it directly changes the protagonists' tactic and unlocks the hidden signal. Without this method, they would have aimed conventionally and failed. Visible cost: discarding assumptions requires vulnerability and trust in the coupling's choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city supplies constant physical constraint (catwalks, guy lines tugged by perigee, cables as anchor points), resources (rusted turbines, antennas for parts), and the core metaphor (receiver shaped like goodbye). The map traced on railings enables the bucket descent. Removing the gorge-suspended setting would break spatial logic, risk stakes (mentor's fall, Sela's balancing), and the closure image (city swinging into its next position). Present setup to closure with high causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lunar perigee tightens the window (signals shy at other times, serenely electric now) and motivates the attempt ("tonight we attempt the impossible during lunar perigee"). Sela's scribbled tide times and the moon rising to inspect the work anchor the timeframe. The constraint is live: without perigee, the signal would not arrive. Closure depends on the moon pulling "where it needed." Minor deduction: exact duration and urgency remain abstract; no countdown pressure appears.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is dramatized through the protagonist's vocation (towers hear last messages), the choice to aim between swing and stillness, and the closure realization (beginnings wrapped in endings, pour one into the other). Friction appears when the protagonist hears the mentor's voice (pride and warning), and the cost of carrying beginnings is felt when the city sags. The desire shapes all key choices and charges the final instruction. Slightly abstract in middle beats but crystallizes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is declared early ("the only kind we can afford here") and sustained through every beat: coupling built from bottle caps and prayer, tuning by discarding assumptions, water that sounds like lullabies yet delivers instruction. Tone modulates under pressure (wonder → urgency → solemnity) without breaking coherence. The closure image (pour beginnings into endings, city swinging into next position) charges the tone fully, fusing the fantastical (hush shard, glowing cave) with the practical (haul a bucket, tighten belts). Removing this tonal synthesis would collapse the story's logic.</comment>
