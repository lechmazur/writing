<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious"), with embodied choices around the amber and pilgrimage design. However, the piece operates more as philosophical essay than dramatic character arc; the narrator's stance crystallizes rather than changes through visible cost. The envoys remain abstractions without individuated pressure. Internal contradiction appears in the setup (skeptic who refuses the dark) but doesn't drive on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through sensory and conceptual density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "homecoming is an exchange constant, not a place" crystallizes with the linked-arms descent and deliberate garden formula. The closure reconfigures the journey's meaning with conceptual cost (unruly protocol becomes necessary apparatus). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The ratio discovery (three to five to eight) provides one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, bronze sculptures, and garden path supply vivid, selective anchors. The fly amber functions as micro-setting, constraining the misting choice and charging the final tucking-away moment. Sensory hierarchy reflects scientific attention (resin, rain, pepper of soil). The dusty footprints serve as both navigational constraint and thematic vessel. The ending image—garden "smelled deliberate, like a formula solved by walking"—directly charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding homecoming as measurable chemistry versus secondhand awe. The artificial pilgrimage deepens when "we had said we were just gathering samples, yet the path was steadying us into pilgrims," forcing acknowledgment of the protocol's unruliness. The ratio convergence (three to five to eight) provides one meaningful tightening. Agency appears in the choice to build the pilgrimage and accept its transformation, with the cost legible in "my academically rebellious self had chosen the world as apparatus." Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: homecoming as reaction (catalyst being shared attention) rather than destination. The fly amber's "forever reach" described as "window sealed with grief" seeds the final understanding without stating it. The tower and footprints recur with shifting weight. The ending—"Everything we learned would travel, but always return to converge at this kind of threshold"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates through image (resin mist, bell-rope vials) and the envoys' chords. No overt moralizing; complexity lives in the tension between protocol and pilgrimage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: scientific lexicon blended with poetic compression ("bronze quiet," "clouds combed the river into threads"). POV remains stable first-person. Diction stays character-particular (academically rebellious scientist with lyric bent). Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Grief, I said, is also data"). Compression is purposeful and taught early ("manners can be molecular"). Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated. The prose reflects the narrator's stance—precise yet open to resonance—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve character, atmosphere, and thematic accumulation. Rhythm varies purposefully between compressed observations and expansive sensory beats. Minor scaffold appears in template stems: "We [verb]" pattern runs through the middle third without full payoff. Some figurative language dense-packs ("rain polished its stones until the sky seemed baked inside") but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. Sentence openings vary. The "bronze quiet" motif recurs with purpose. One small clarity slip: "membranes flexing" gestures at alien physiology without grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frame—artificial pilgrimage as scientific protocol—offers a fresh synthesis of empiricism and ritual. The fly amber as pocket fossil and the dusty alien primer provide specific, non-obvious anchor points. The "chemistry of homecoming" concept transforms familiar material through precise execution (ratio discovery, resin misting). The envoys' "ancestral salinity" and "salt math" avoid stock alien tropes. Risk-taking in voice (lyric-scientific hybrid) heightens without obscuring. The piece commits fully to its premise. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc are inseparable from these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout as narrator. Shapes the pilgrimage design choice, the amber-misting tactic, and the bell-rope measurement. The "luminous skeptic" and "academically rebellious" traits enable the unruly protocol and the refusal of "lab bench alone." Appears in closure ("I tucked the fly amber away") with visible stance crystallization. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability high due to voice specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("shard of fly amber, a pocket fossil"). Used in multiple beats: held to light at bronze boar, shaved and dissolved to mist sleeves, shared again on highest landing, tucked away at closure. Each use narrows or enables tactics (misting triggers envoy recognition; final tucking closes the journey). Charged reprise in the ending image. Irreplaceable: the "forever reach" and "window sealed with grief" interpretations directly shape the homecoming thesis. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled in opening paragraph and shapes the entire narrative structure. Drives stakes: "to keep the journey honest, we would converge at the tower only by following evidence." Alters tactics repeatedly (footprint navigation, aromatic vertices, bell-rope measurement). Payoff explicit: "The artificial pilgrimage was not fake; it was a vessel with the right surface area." Closure hinges on it: "homecoming is an exchange constant" emerges directly from the pilgrimage design. Essential across beats and ending; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stated early ("I was academically rebellious"). Enables key choice: "refusing the lab bench alone, my academically rebellious self had chosen the world as apparatus." Constrains method (unruly protocol versus ritual). Payoff in closure stance ("I admitted that my protocol was unruly, and also the only way I trusted knowledge"). Cost visible: accepting messiness over clean lab data. Two-gate presence (setup, development, payoff) with moderate causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Present in title motif and drives structure: "we would converge at the tower only by following evidence." Each sculpture stop is a convergence point. Climax beat: "At the door, we converged, sleeves damp, faces open." Defines the ending action: descent and new convergence. The "exchange constant" realization depends on convergence as shared attention. Irreplaceable: swapping for "gather" or "meet" loses the geometric and relational specificity. Essential to the homecoming thesis and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("We mapped our approach via dusty footprints"). Mechanics matter: "alien primer, carried by the envoys in strings that ignored rain and glowed faintly." Shapes navigation across multiple beats (each sculpture marker). Enables the protocol: "Each print sparked another, a breadcrumb trail for noses, lungs, and handheld spectrometers." Payoff: narrator leaves new prints "to guide those who would question next." Specific constraint that alters tactics; irreplaceable due to alien-primer mechanics and invitation motif.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Anchored immediately ("beneath the rainwashed tower in spring"). Provides sensory constraint ("rain polished its stones until the sky seemed baked inside"). Interior space shapes climax: bell-rope measurement in the stairwell, vials swung through "bronze quiet." The highest landing opens the "ancestral salinity" exchange. Descent completes the pilgrimage arc. Micro-setting (stairwell, landing) alters tactics and charges the final threshold crossing. Essential to closure; removing it breaks the convergence structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stated in opening line. Frames context (first contact already made; this is the aftermath investigation). Shapes stakes: understanding post-contact chemistry versus performing ritual. Does not tighten decisions within the single-day journey; no live clock pressure. Development weak: time functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Lyric reprise at closure (new arrivals will follow) reweights meaning modestly. Functional but largely replaceable with "after the treaty" or similar framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Declared early ("I wanted to understand the chemistry of homecoming, not in poetry but in measurable sighs"). Drives pilgrimage design and measurement tactics. Friction visible: "my protocol was unruly, and also the only way I trusted knowledge" shows cost of method. Payoff crystallizes: "homecoming is an exchange constant, not a place." Dramatized through ratio discovery and linked-arms descent. Strong causal and closure linkage; irreplaceable due to chemistry/measurability specificity that shapes all moves.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced early ("listening for bronze quiet"). Recurs at key beats: bronze boar, "bronze quiet gathered in the stairwell," "that quiet, which was bronze and human." Modulates with pressure: initial listening becomes shared embodiment. Charges final image: "the tower felt newly roofed by arrival." Tone coherent through turns without static repetition. The bronze/human convergence directly supports the homecoming-as-exchange thesis. Strong thematic and closure linkage; irreplaceable for its material-metaphoric fusion.</comment>
