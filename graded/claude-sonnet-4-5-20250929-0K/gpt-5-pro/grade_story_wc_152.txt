<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tamsin's interiority is specific and embodied: her "disguise her listening as idle chatter" trait shapes scene choices, and her method of testing "adjacent possibilities" through stitching offers concrete character-particular perception. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous fear and determination ("she told herself her task was simple"), and micro-choices under pressure—breathing on the flame, stitching the waning moon beside Rauk's name—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final agency is clear: she delays the coup by altering the orrery's timing, an act of renunciation (accepting the coup will still come) that forecloses certainty with felt cost. Minor: Rauk remains functional but one-note, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("hunger and pride are patient engineers") rather than concrete perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Tamsin alters the flame and bells, delaying but not stopping the coup, accepting "futures stitched" as her best outcome. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through pattern (listening → stitching → testing possibilities → altering the flame), culminating in a cadence shift where her act reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when she breathes on the flame and the gears "did not synchronize," narrowing conspirators' options. The cost is legible: "its certainty would fray," and she prepares escape routes knowing torches will run. No causality breaks; the stitched map, synchronized orrery, and flame mechanics cohere under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory's circular rail, orrery gears, eternal candle, and mural room anchor spatial choreography cleanly across moves. Micro-setting (the flame in glass, the cloth held to the dome) constrains Tamsin's key choice: she must align stitches with stars and alter the flame's rhythm to disrupt conspirators' timing. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens—she notices star-metal cracks, thrum of instruments, sugar-traced chart amendments—and the dome's "blue hush" charges the final image when she "let the orrery hum." Autumn timeframe and "cold nights" ground the body in season. Gate met: environment shapes middle choice (orrery alignment) and final image (flame reset). Minor: some diction ("echoed silence," "soft thrum") leans abstract where tactile detail would sharpen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent or delay the coup) is signaled early through "missing names" and "conspiracies." One meaningful tightening occurs when Tamsin realizes the routes converge on the southern gatehouse, forcing her to act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: she shifts stitches, alters the flame, threads a hinge at the gate. Cost is visible on-page: the coup "would still come" because "hunger and pride are patient engineers," but "its clocks would slip and its certainty would fray." No reversals are required for this lens; the deepening comes when she accepts she can only buy time, not victory. Persistent constraint (orrery timing, conspirators' synchronized bells) shapes tactics throughout. Minor: Rauk's single beat of doubt feels functional rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: listening for "unheard stories," moving through "adjacent possibilities," and accepting mercy over certainty. The eternal flame becomes a motif that reweights: first "calibrated to keep the orrery honest," later a tool Tamsin breathes on to introduce doubt, finally reset to "generous rhythm." The ending image—"futures stitched"—answers the central question (can one person change fate?) without moralizing: Tamsin offers misalignments and safe doorways, not prevention. Subtext operates in her "crooked jokes" with Rauk and the city watching "nothing back." No thematic echo or late sermon. Earned wisdom arises from her method of testing possibilities until "time itself sounded less alone." Minor: "hunger and pride are patient engineers" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("threading night into cloth as if mending weather"), purposeful syntax that mirrors Tamsin's accretive method, and perceptual signature (she notices hesitations, pauses, sugar-traced lines). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The single-POV interiority stays anchored in present stimuli (flame flicker, cloth lifted to dome) and micro-choices (breathing on glass, stitching the moon). Dialogue with Rauk is sparse but purposeful: her "crooked jokes" serve subtext (disguising wisdom as foolishness). Diction matches a literate, slightly archaic register appropriate to an observatory embroiderer. Minor: some phrasing ("the language of missing names," "echo became assent") leans toward elevated abstraction that occasionally obscures immediacy, though the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure ("She would shift a star one stitch, and ink would bloom under heat"). Rhythm varies naturally, and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity remains strong across spatial moves (dome → mural room → southern gatehouse → back beneath the dome). Minor deductions for figurative density in non-peak beats: "ghosts graze her patience," "seam picks apart a careless hem," "murmuring flock" cluster without pattern-teaching, and some metaphors strain coherence ("threading night into cloth as if mending weather" mixes vehicle logic). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but accumulate across the middle third, applying −0.4 under the artifact penalty pack. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of galaxy-chart embroidery, orrery mechanics, and conspiracy prevention through "adjacent possibilities" is specific and non-obvious. Tamsin's method—stitching as divination, breath as sabotage—feels inevitable in hindsight and transforms the "lone resistance fighter" template through occupational specificity and a moral calculus that accepts delay over victory. The piece commits fully to its premise: the flame's calibration, the orrery's synchronization, and Tamsin's cloth all cohere as tools of inference and intervention. Risk-taking (lyric compression, extended metaphor of stitching-as-strategy) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional specificity—Tamsin's patient listening, her acceptance of limits—avoids generic heroism. Transformation test passed: plot and arc depend on this exact occupation and setting. No proximity to famous lines or scenes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tamsin's choices create all key turns: she stitches the waning moon beside Rauk's name, aligns cloth with city streets, alters the flame to desynchronize the bells, and threads the gatehouse hinge. Present in setup (opening line), drives middle beats (stitching map, testing orrery), and shapes closure (resetting flame, accepting the coup will come). Removing her would collapse the plot. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; cost is visible (she can only delay, not prevent). Gates: all three met. Positives: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.6. No frictions. Score neighborhood: high 8s for indispensability across all beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The eternal flame is handled in three distinct beats: warming her fingers (early), altering its rhythm by breathing on the glass (middle climax), and resetting it (closure). Its mechanics matter: it calibrates the orrery, and Tamsin's breath introduces "a heartbeat of doubt to the pendulum," causing the bells to toll wrong and disrupting the coup timing. Removing it would break the plot's mechanism. Gates: setup (paragraph 6), development (paragraph 24), payoff (paragraph 27). Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7. No frictions. Score neighborhood: high 8s for mechanical indispensability and charged closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies shapes stakes and tactics on-page: Tamsin hears "hesitations, then as patterns," stitches reveal "secret routes," and her map shows how "bell of Misra would toll one beat late." The concept drives her method (testing adjacent possibilities to find convergence points) and the dominant conflict (delay the coup). Present in setup (paragraph 8–9), constrains middle choices (aligning cloth, breathing on flame), and determines closure outcome (fraying certainty, not stopping the coup). Gates: all three met. Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5. Minor friction: the conspiracy itself remains slightly abstract (we see effects, not conspirators), −0.3. Score neighborhood: solid 7s for sustained causal work with minor abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" enables on-page actions with cost: Tamsin answers Rauk with "crooked jokes that kept his doubts asleep," laughs loudly at her "clumsiness" after fogging the glass, and is called "needle-mystic" while concealing her true purpose. The trait constrains her method (she cannot openly warn or accuse) and shapes closure (the city watches "nothing back" because she remains invisible). Present in setup (paragraph 5), enables middle beat (deflecting Rauk's suspicion), and implicitly charges closure (her success depends on remaining underestimated). Gates: setup and development clear; closure participation is implied rather than explicit. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, cost connection +0.4. Friction: closure linkage is oblique, −0.4. Score neighborhood: mid-7s for consistent constraint with moderate closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Synchronize" drives major turns: Tamsin synchronizes orrery planets to the stitched moon (paragraph 18), observes how conspirators "synchronize bells with proclamations" (paragraph 13), and disrupts synchronization by altering the flame so "gears did not synchronize with perfect obedience" (paragraph 24). The action redefines options: conspirators' plan depends on timing, and Tamsin's counter is to introduce mistiming. Not swappable; "align" or "coordinate" lack the mechanical precision required. Gates: setup (paragraph 7, 13), development (paragraph 18), payoff (paragraph 24–25). Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7. No frictions. Score neighborhood: low-to-mid 8s for strong causal role and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method "through adjacent possibilities" is signaled early ("She would shift a star one stitch...until a path aligned," paragraph 10) and shapes attempts: Tamsin runs her finger "along a different thread, then another, stepping through adjacent possibilities until the map flickered with choices" (paragraph 20). The mechanics matter—she tests variations to find convergent outcomes—and the final image echoes it: "moving through adjacent possibilities until time itself sounded less alone" (paragraph 29). Gates: setup (paragraph 10), development (paragraph 20), payoff (final line). Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Friction: method remains slightly abstract; we see results more than process, −0.4. Score neighborhood: mid-7s for sustained thematic and tactical presence with moderate abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory pressures choices and supplies resources: the orrery's circular rail and gears enable Tamsin's alignment method (paragraph 18), the dome allows her to hold cloth to stars (paragraph 19), and the glass housing the flame is the tool she fogs to alter timing (paragraph 24). "Autumn" and "cold nights" ground the body (paragraph 7). The setting constrains her method (she must work within the observatory's tools) and charges closure (she returns "beneath the dome" to reset the world). Gates: setup (opening), development (orrery and glass beats), payoff (final dome image). Positives: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, micro-setting +0.6. No frictions. Score neighborhood: low 8s for strong constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Before the coup" tightens decisions and tactics: Tamsin knows she is working against a deadline ("the last season before the coup," paragraph 8), and her realization that routes converge forces immediate action (paragraph 19–22). The timeframe shapes her goal (delay, not prevent) and charges closure ("The coup would still come...but now its clocks would slip"). Present in setup (paragraph 8), constrains middle choice (urgency to act when map reveals convergence), and determines closure stakes (accepting she can only fray certainty). Gates: all three met. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.1. Friction: timeframe is declared but not tracked as a live clock; no countdown or urgent pacing, −0.5. Score neighborhood: low-to-mid 7s for consistent stake-setting with moderate urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tamsin's desire "to listen for unheard stories" is dramatized in choices: she comes "each dusk to listen" (paragraph 3), hears "missing names" as "hesitations, then as patterns" (paragraph 9), and collects "what fell between the peals: the sentence cut short, the boot that paused" (paragraph 14). The motivation is conflicted—she tells herself the task is "simple" (paragraph 15) yet accepts the coup will come (paragraph 28)—and shapes closure (she listens "as always" in the final line, having altered what she heard). Gates: setup (paragraph 3), development (paragraphs 9, 14), payoff (final line). Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, friction between want and cost +0.5. No deductions. Score neighborhood: high 7s for sustained dramatization and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is coherent through turns and charges the final image: the dome's "blue hush like a held breath" (opening), "halls built for echoed silence, for whispers that survived their speakers" (paragraph 4), "the echoed silence that followed the wrong bells" (paragraph 25), and the closing "in that hush, futures stitched" (final line). Tone modulates with pressure—early contemplative, tightening when she acts on the flame, resolving to quiet determination—and the final image reweights the dominant stake (silence as both concealment and possibility). Gates: all three met. Positives: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.6, tone-as-constraint +0.6. No frictions. Score neighborhood: low-to-mid 8s for strong coherence and charged closure participation.</comment>
