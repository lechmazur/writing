<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kera's interiority is concrete and embodied ("palms to the trembling panes," "tilt her senses backward as if time were shallow water"), and her retrocognitive ability shapes on-page choices (touching the prism, adjusting the shard). Internal conflict between ritual and proof is present, and the final choice to signal a return is earned through the accumulation of sensory particulars and micro-adjustments. Minor deduction: the boy who traded the shard exists only as backstory prop without on-page pressure, and some phrases ("thistle-blown hope") risk label-speak, but embodied action at closure recovers the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, tool manipulation, and retrocognitive layering until the beacon lights and a flare answers. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kera replies to the flare, calling them home, and the final image reweights prior coincidences into purpose with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by ~120 words ("beacon-tower custodian," "years after collapse," "tower heart"). Cost is felt in the effort, the halted wheel, and the decision to expose her position. One minor slip: the beacon's first failure and restart could have landed with sharper consequence, but the ending's legible cost and coherent lens hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass pavilion hums and guides Kera's tuning; the prism cradle and copper threads are handled tools that constrain the rekindling process; the waterline and cracked highways receive the beam's sweep. Setting is integrated into action rather than described separately, and the spatial choreography (climbing stairs, nesting the prism, turning the wheel) remains clear. The beacon itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when the flare answers. Gate met: environment constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rekindle the beacon to prove coincidences have meaning. Pressure accumulates through concrete actions (cleaning, nesting the prism, threading copper, tracking star paths, turning the wheel) under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening: the wheel halts, forcing Kera to use retrocognition to find the rhythm. The flare's answer and her reply narrow options into commitment. Cost is legible in the effort, the risk of exposure, and the choice to call strangers home. No false reversals; escalation is steady and earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—meaning in coincidence, ritual against forgetting, the alignment of small things into purpose—emerges from concrete particulars: the boy's trade, the wind's pitch, the moon's lateness, the shard's fit. The final image of "thistle-blown hope toughening to rope" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the beam's "swallowed word," the flare's deliberate nod, and Kera's cautious leap. The story resists tidy resolution: she has called them home, but the outcome remains open, charged with possibility and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kera notices trembling panes, apprentice voices in the wind, and old calibrations as syllables. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("a patient conspiracy," "a dance of lenses found its perfect breath"). No head-hopping; single POV held cleanly. Psychic distance modulates intentionally when retrocognition pulls her backward. Minor ding: some figurative constructions in the opening third ("thin music over ruins and salt," "retroactively blessed, cursed, some said") edge toward elevated register, but the prose remains legible and voice-motivated throughout pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, character, or stake. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, minor overwriting appears: "thin music over ruins and salt" and "a river discovering a forgotten braid" stack metaphors without clear vehicles, and the opening third carries slight density surplus ("the beacon-tower custodian Kera" is clean, but "retroactively blessed, cursed, some said" adds modest hedging). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. These slips do not touch closure, capping deduction at −0.4 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of retrocognition as tool, broken prism as puzzle, and post-collapse beacon-keeping synthesizes familiar elements into a specific, non-obvious premise. The flare's arrival and Kera's decision to reply feel inevitable in hindsight, earned by prior particulars rather than convenience. The "shard of hush" and the act of "tracking star paths" add texture without gimmickry. Risk is present in the lyric accumulation and the compressed final moves, and closure remains legible. Transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would require rebuilding the sensory and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kera's choices—cleaning the lensbed, nesting the prism, adjusting the shard with resin and copper, using retrocognition to find rhythm, sweeping the beam, decoding the flare, and replying—create every key turn. She is on the page throughout and her decisions alter tactics under pressure. Setup early; multiple beats; closure participation strong. Gate integrity high; causal pressure and closure linkage undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken crystal prism is handled in setup (described, touched for retrocognitive sense), development (nested in the cradle, aligned with the shard), and closure (the beam flexes through it, enabling the reply). Its missing tooth shapes the problem; its mended state enables the solution. Specificity and irreplaceability high. Two substantial beats plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shard of hush appears in setup (traded for bread, touched for retrocognitive pause), development (canted into the prism with resin and copper thread, used to keep the beam steady), and closure (leaned on to steady the reply). It changes options by enabling the mend and stabilizing the signal. Swappability moderate (another fragment could serve), but the "hush" quality and its retrocognitive charge add specificity. Three beats; closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Retrocognition enables two on-page actions with cost: touching the prism to hear the old engine and using past calibrations to set the wheel's rhythm after the first failure. It constrains her method (must align present to past) and shapes the ending's success. Setup early; development involvement moderate; closure contribution indirect but necessary. Visible tradeoff in the effort and the emotional cost of backward-tilting. Swappability moderate; another diagnostic ability could serve with rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon is the story's spine: setup (Kera decides to make the notes meet), development (cleaning, mending, adjusting, turning the wheel, finding rhythm, sweeping the beam), and closure (the flare answers, she replies, calling them home). Removing it collapses all stakes and tactics. Three or more beats; causal pressure high; closure indispensable. Minor swappability: another repair task could serve a similar frame, but the beacon's navigation function is specific to the post-collapse setting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tracking star paths is signaled in setup ("the old logs said the beacon could rekindle by tracking star paths"), used in development (matching pavilion notes to Orion's slant, pouring new starlight through old scars, decoding the flare's intervals as constellations), and present at closure (the reply depends on the aligned beam). It shapes two attempts and the final exchange. Mechanics matter on the page; not ornamental. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is introduced early ("Wind combed the dunes and made the glass humming pavilion sing"), provides tactile and auditory texture throughout (Kera listens to its notes, matches them to star paths), and its music guides the tuning process. It supplies a resource (the pavilion's note as calibration reference) that affects the outcome. Closure linkage indirect: the pavilion hums "them toward landfall" in the final line, charging the image. Setup strong; development moderate; closure participation metaphorical but present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the collapse of civilization" is established early and shapes setting (ruins, salt, inland sea, cracked highways) and Kera's motivation (ritual against forgetting). It provides backdrop pressure but does not tighten decisions within the story's present-tense window. No live clock; the story unfolds over one night without time-driven urgency. Setup present; development atmospheric; closure participation weak. Functional but replaceable with another post-apocalyptic frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kera's desire to prove coincidences have meaning is stated early ("Kera kept watch to prove that coincidences have meaning") and dramatized in development: she tracks the boy's trade, the wind's pitch, the moon's lateness as alignments, and acts on them by mending the prism and signaling. The final line reweights coincidence into purpose with cost ("It was no coincidence..."). Setup clear; development involves choices shaped by this belief; closure reframes the motivation with pressure. Friction between faith in pattern and the risk of exposure is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates across beats: opening melancholy ("thin music over ruins and salt"), rising tentative hope ("a thistle-blown hope rose in her, light but stubborn"), setback ("the beam died against the night like a swallowed word"), and final resolve ("thistle-blown hope toughening to rope"). The "thistle-blown" image recurs and reweights at closure, charging the final paragraph. Tone supports pressure without flattening into static mood. Setup early; development consistent; closure charged.</comment>
