<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—seeking "the moment before deciding"—is embodied and drives choices throughout. The emotional arc from avoidance to staying is earned through the journey; the splinter-steadied hand and reaching fingers are concrete. However, the brother remains a static object of regret rather than a fully realized second character, and the medium's "fierce tenderness" edges toward therapy-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction. The final choice forecloses the path of escape with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to situational confrontation) and holds it through closure. The orientation is clear by the opening beat: protagonist, mangrove labyrinth, present tense of seeking. The closure—staying instead of smoking, hand reaching—lands on the page as Earned Stasis with felt cost (the "break in me begins to stitch"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the medium evokes the hospital moment and the protagonist must witness rather than revise. Minor loop phrasing ("I am here to find the moment before deciding" appears twice) slightly dulls momentum but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mangrove setting and the houseboat constrain the ritual effectively; the condensation-fogged pane and the splinter in the doorframe both charge key moments. Sensory detail (copper taste, antiseptic and orange peels, tin roof ticking) is selective and purposeful. However, the "singing spirits" remain atmospheric rather than tactile obstacles, and the transition from mangrove to hospital hallway lacks spatial bridging—"the world tilts" gestures at the shift without grounding it. The micro-setting (splinter, doorframe) successfully charges the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the unsent apology and the moment of abandonment—is signaled early and tightens when the medium offers the threshold: "we can step into it if we do not demand to change it." The protagonist's agency drives the turn: choosing to stay rather than smoke forecloses the escape path with visible cost ("the pain steadies me"). The single reversal (from flight to presence) is sufficient for this length. Pressure accumulates through the ritual beats and crystallizes in the hospital doorway; the ache and reaching fingers make the cost felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing rather than revising, the tenderness of staying present—emerges through the ritual structure and the image of moonlight stitching. The apology becomes "unnecessary" through presence, not words, which is a resonant non-literal answer. The final line—"I learn to carry tenderness like a blade"—risks overstating but lands because it reweights the opening "fierce tenderness" through earned cost. The "letters...relieved of work it was not born to do" subtly questions the role of apology itself. No overt moralizing; the particulars (splinter, reaching fingers, tide forgetting) carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-incantatory register with purposeful repetition ("I am here to find the moment before deciding"). However, some lines drift into elevated diction that feels imposed rather than voice-rooted: "evoke it, and I do, calling up my hunger" reads more prompt-echo than character thought. The medium's dialogue ("tomorrow is not the moment before deciding") carries subtext but occasionally tips into aphorism. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (tide, roots, moon as structuring images) is consistent, though a few filter verbs ("I feel the ache in him") dull immediacy at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose carries strong rhythmic control and vivid images: "his fingers curl toward mine like roots," "the break in me begins to stitch." However, template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "She says...she says...She says" in the final third creates a drumbeat that flattens momentum. Minor paraphrase loop: "I am here to find the moment before deciding" recurs verbatim without reweighting. The phrase "fierce tenderness" appears three times, twice as a label rather than embodied perception. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "apology gathers...like clouded glass" works, though "language our throats never learned" edges toward abstraction. No major artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mangrove as labyrinth, condensation messages as evocation tool, staying as the revision—feels specific and earned rather than template. The "moment before deciding" as a physical threshold is a fresh inflection on regret narratives. However, the "cryptic medium" and "singing spirits" occupy familiar mystical-guide territory without strong transformation. The emotional truth (the splinter steadying the protagonist, the child's frown on the brother) grounds the fantastical frame. The ending resists neat resolution: the medium's final wisdom avoids sermonizing, and "tomorrow is not the moment before deciding" acknowledges limits. Risk-taking in structure (ritual beats, surreal houseboat transition) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The medium is present early, drives the ritual (drags the shard, evokes the room, signals the threshold rule), and delivers the final wisdom that reframes time. She enables the protagonist's key choice and her "fierce tenderness" charges the tone. However, her own interiority and stakes remain opaque; she functions as facilitator more than agent with conflicting pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard appears early, is used in two distinct beats (dragging across the fogged glass to summon messages, then layering the letter under it for moonlight), and the detail "its broken mouth slick with old storms" returns as texture in the evocation. The shard enables the central ritual action. However, its specific properties (why a gargoyle shard versus another relic) do not constrain tactics or carry visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The unsent letters are present from the opening, shape the protagonist's grief and the medium's request, and the first letter (to the brother) drives the evocation. The closing image—letter "no longer unsent, simply unnecessary"—reweights the premise with felt cost: presence replaces written apology. The concept constrains choices (which letter to offer, whether to read it) and charges the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is signaled early ("Your heart heals in moonlight...if you hold still"), frames the stakes (the protagonist must endure presence rather than flee), and the moon's return at closure ("The moon touches our foreheads") marks the stitching beginning. The attribute constrains the choice to stay and charges the ending image. However, the mechanism is more metaphorical than a rule with tactical cost; the protagonist does not sacrifice or risk anything specific to access moonlight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Evoke" is the medium's command and the protagonist's climactic action: "She says, evoke it, and I do, calling up my hunger, my small rebellion, my fear." It drives the threshold moment and the choice to stay. The action shapes the entire ritual structure. It could not be swapped without breaking the logic of witnessing versus revising.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Messages in condensation appear early (medium drags shard across fogged glass, words bloom), provide the date/doorway/breath that frames the threshold, and the "clouded glass" recurs as metaphor for the gathering apology. The method shapes the evocation beat. However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure; the messages simply appear once the letter is placed, with no failed attempts or cost tied to summoning them.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth frames the opening, houses the houseboat and singing spirits, and "folds back around us" at closure after the evocation. The spirits' singing persists into the hospital, maintaining continuity. However, the mangrove functions more as atmosphere than obstacle; it does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter the protagonist's approach. The transition from mangrove to hospital is gestural rather than grounded in spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the space where an apology waits unspoken"—is philosophically central and recurs as the framing question. It shapes the protagonist's goal (to find and witness that moment) and the medium's constraint ("if we do not demand to change it"). However, it reads more as thematic placeholder than a live clock that tightens decisions. The phrase appears in opening, middle, and near-end as a refrain, but does not escalate pressure or narrow options beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the moment before deciding, specifically the choice to leave the hospital room—is stated early, drives the journey and ritual, and faces friction: the protagonist's "hunger," "small rebellion," and "fear of weeping" complicate the desire to stay. The resolution enacts the motivation: witnessing rather than revising, choosing presence over escape. The final acknowledgment ("I still do not know what to do tomorrow") shows the cost of partial healing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fierce tenderness is present in the medium's demeanor ("voice full of silt and patience and fierce tenderness"), echoes in her breath during the threshold moment, and shapes the final line ("I learn to carry tenderness like a blade"). The tone modulates from lyric distance (mangrove ritual) to intimate urgency (hospital doorway) and charges the ending. However, the phrase "fierce tenderness" is repeated three times, twice as label rather than embodied demonstration, and the oxymoron's work is stated more than shown in the protagonist's own gestures.</comment>
