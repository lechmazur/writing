<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's methodical nature shapes every move—warmly methodical trait embodied in line-by-line tactile engagement with rope, gears, and archive patterns. Internal contradiction between curiosity and caution plays out when stepping through the door ("warmed my hands and my thoughts"), and the trait-driven approach to "reading patterns as if they are weather for the mind" constrains tactics throughout. The ending choice to prepare a finding aid and invite witnesses feels earned by prior archive devotion, though the final beat lacks a sharper cost or renunciation that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the archivist completes the repair, the door retires into brick, and the finding aid invites future witnesses—cost is conceptual (devotion to clarity over mystery) and social (opening access rather than hoarding). The accumulative lens holds: fables of absence gather density through treaty/bell/seal, then the rope-braid task reweights the premise by merging schedules into "a single honest ring." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph ("university clock tower mechanism room"), meeting the test. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist traces braid to file to wax-seal diagram, narrowing options to the rope task. Minor slip: the final image ("whoever finds it will have a way to begin") slightly dilutes the closure's sharpness by deflecting to future actors rather than crystallizing present cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mechanism room saturates the middle: gear teeth, escapement, weight drums, pendulum cadence, and the ceremonial rope all constrain the archivist's choices (can't use force, must honor tension/release vocabulary). The rope becomes micro-setting—its braids are tactile anchors the protagonist must "trace with fingers" and "let thrum against forearms," directly shaping the merge action. The door's presence/absence brackets the frame and charges the closure ("no longer matched the wall"), and dust tracings on the floor mark causal consequence. The setting earns high marks by making physicality indispensable to both escalation and ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate confusion into clarity) is signaled early and drives archive investigation through the door into the mechanism room. One meaningful tightening: discovering the sunburst diagram in the wax seal impression narrows options to reconfiguring the rope braids, foreclosing simpler mechanical fixes. The task itself—merging two schedules by adjusting rope tension—provides clear on-page agency with a visible price (embodied effort: "thrum against forearms," repeated pulls). The bell's clarified ring and the door's retirement mark consequence. Minor limitation: the stakes remain intellectual rather than relational or survival-level, and no secondary pressure complicates the solve, keeping tension moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (absence as presence, recall as clarity) emerges from particulars: misdated treaty, broken bell record, vanished week, rope braids as stored decisions. The fables-of-absence concept integrates with the archivist's method ("listen for the space around a fact") and the ending's gesture—sealing the folder to "invite witnesses" rather than lock secrets. The final image resists moralizing: "clear complexity that people can live in" is demonstrated through the finding aid, not stated as lesson. Strong thematic coherence, though the closing meta-note ("whoever finds it will have a way to begin") leans slightly expository rather than purely image-driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: the archivist's perceptual signature filters everything through archive patience and methodical warmth ("I read patterns as if they are weather for the mind," "coaxing a shy truth to the table and feeding it soup"). Distance remains stable in intimate first-person; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("They copied futures into past ledgers, and dates became neighbors that skipped greetings") and metaphor density are pattern-taught early and sustained. Minor slip: near the end, "Because I am an adaptable archivist, my devotion is not to dust, but to clear complexity that people can live in" edges toward thematic statement rather than dramatized stance, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do double duty (archive clues, tactile engagement, conceptual framing). Rhythm modulates well between catalog passages and mechanism-room immersion. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The fables of absence said you listen for the space around a fact, not only the fact itself" is restated by "listen for the space around a fact" earlier, and "confusion breathes / clarity takes the air" recycles the confusion/clarity binary without new pressure. Template cadence runs emerge in the middle third ("I checked the escapement, I checked the weight drums, I checked my own pulse"). These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and, because they appear in a high-pressure sequence, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fables-of-absence frame is fresh, and the rope-braid-as-stored-decision mechanic offers a non-obvious synthesis of archival method and ceremonial object. The ending's choice to write a finding aid rather than hoard the discovery personalizes the trope of scholar-detective. However, the core structure—archivist solves historical mystery by interpreting clues and performing ritual task—maps closely to familiar academic-sleuth templates without a bold counter-pressure or moral calculus that transforms it. The lack of interpersonal friction or secondary cost keeps the originality solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in opening as "adaptable archivist" with archive devotion. Development: choices to catalog fables, step through door, trace rope braids, and reconfigure them all stem from archivist identity. Payoff: final acts (prepare finding aid, seal folder, invite witnesses) are profession-driven. Causal pressure: the archivist's methodical trait constrains approach (no force, must honor "vocabulary of tension") and enables the merge. Closure linkage: the finding-aid gesture and witness invitation directly express archivist devotion. Three beats (cataloging, rope task, finding aid) with strong causal role and closure presence. Cost: conceptual (devotion to access over secrecy). Minor friction: the character's archive work is more vehicle than source of internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph 6 ("letter bearing a diplomat's wax seal impression"). Development: reappears when archivist matches knotwork in folio to sunburst seal diagram, unlocking the merge method ("The impression was not decoration but instruction"). Payoff: in final third, "the vellum with the diplomat's wax seal impression relaxed, no longer braced against a silence," and the folder is sealed "with a rubbing of the wax impression." Three beats with evolving function (clue, instruction, seal). Causal pressure: the diagram's sunburst pattern constrains the rope task. Closure linkage: rubbing-as-seal invites witnesses and charges the finding-aid moment. Cost: visible (conceptual shift from locked mystery to open record). High irreplaceability: swap would require new mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "fables of absence" named in paragraph 4, described as stories solving mysteries by naming what was missing. Development: the concept shapes the archivist's interpretive method ("listen for the space around a fact") and drives the clock-tower investigation. Payoff: the finding aid is titled "Fables of Absence, Mechanism of Return," and the ending gesture (open record vs. rumor) honors the concept. Two beats (initial framing, ending title). Causal pressure: the concept enables the diagnostic approach (checking for "the space") but does not itself narrow options or create trade-offs. Closure linkage: title and witness invitation reference it. Cost: conceptual only (devotion to clarity). Friction: functions more as theme than active stake or tactic-shaping force; swappable with "archival mysteries" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "warmly methodical" appears in paragraph 8 and again in paragraph 16. Development: the trait shapes on-page actions—tracing braids with fingers, checking escapement/drums/pulse in sequence, tightening/loosening "in sequence" rather than forcing. Payoff: closing self-description "I am an adaptable archivist" and "my devotion" echo the warm-methodical stance. Two beats with visible constraint (method forbids force, requires conversational approach). Causal pressure: the trait enables the merge by honoring "tension and release" vocabulary. Cost: embodied (time, repeated tactile effort). Minor friction: slightly label-heavy in self-description ("warmly methodical" stated twice) rather than fully dramatized through contrasting impulses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: the task to "merge the two kept schedules" is named in paragraph 24. Development: the archivist follows the sunburst diagram, lays out the rope, and reconfigures braids "in sequence," tightening and loosening to honor "what had been attempted and what had been withheld." Payoff: the merge completes, the bell rings "a clarified hour," the stuck week rolls back, and the door retires. Three beats (diagnosis, execution, consequence). Causal pressure: merge is the only path signaled by the seal diagram and drives the climactic sequence. Closure linkage: merge success triggers all ending effects. Cost: embodied effort and conceptual choice (alignment over force). High irreplaceability: swap with "repair" or "reset" would lose the two-schedule specificity and ceremonial dimension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: ceremonial rope on peg introduced in paragraph 11. Development: rope's braid pattern matches wax seal diagram (paragraph 14), unlocking the merge method. The archivist lays out the rope, traces braids, and reconfigures them "in sequence" (paragraphs 25–27). Payoff: final pull "spoke a clarified hour," rope falls "into a kind sleep," and dust paths mark consequence. Three beats with mechanical specificity. Causal pressure: braids-as-stored-decisions mechanic constrains the method (no force, must follow sunburst map). Closure linkage: rope work triggers bell and door resolution. Cost: embodied (repeated pulls, thrum against forearms). High irreplaceability: swap with "adjust gears" would lose the ceremonial/tactile layer and seal-diagram linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: mechanism room named in paragraph 10, anchor solidified by paragraph 11 (gears, pendulum, peg, rope). Development: room supplies resources (rope, escapement, weight drums) that the archivist checks and uses; spatial layout (moving "between the gears") shapes actions. Payoff: dust path on floor marks consequence, door "no longer matched the wall," and the archivist leaves the room with notes. Three beats with continuous spatial presence. Causal pressure: room's physical constraints (gears, pendulum swing) shape the tactile approach and forbid force. Closure linkage: door's shift and dust tracings are room-specific effects. Cost: embodied effort within confined space. Indispensable: remove the mechanism room and the merge task, bell consequence, and door retirement all lose concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "when the door shouldn't exist" in opening line frames temporal anomaly. Development: the text references "a week that vanished," "a bell that never rang," and "two schedules" kept by the tower. Payoff: the merge restores the "old cadence," the stuck week rolls back, and the door retires "when clarity takes the air." Two beats (frame, consequence). Causal pressure: moderate—timeframe signals the problem but does not create a ticking clock or narrow tactical window on the page. Closure linkage: door's retirement tied to clarity restoring proper time. Cost: conceptual (confusion resolved). Friction: the "hour when the door shouldn't exist" is more atmospheric constraint than live timer that alters moves; swappable with "liminal moment" or "threshold time" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: motivation stated in paragraph 8 ("translate confusion into clarity before the rumors hardened"). Development: drives archive cataloging, door entry, mechanism investigation, and rope-braid task. Payoff: ending gesture (finding aid, witness invitation) embodies devotion to clarity over secrecy. Three beats. Causal pressure: the desire to clarify shapes every choice, though friction is intellectual rather than conflicted (no competing want complicates the motive). Closure linkage: final acts express the motive's fulfillment. Cost: conceptual (opening access, forgoing mystery-hoarding). Minor friction: motive is told early and dramatized through consistent action, but lacks internal contradiction or trade-off between clarity and another value (e.g., safety, credit).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: tone established early through diction like "inconvenient shapes of truth," "careful smoke," "civic patience," and "warmly methodical." Development: tone modulates with escalation—calm catalog passages ("fables of absence") shift to tactile immersion ("thrum against forearms") and then gentle resolution ("kind sleep," "softened"). Payoff: final image balances clarity and warmth ("clear complexity that people can live in") without false sentiment. Coherent through turns. Causal pressure: tone choices (non-adversarial, methodical warmth) constrain the approach and forbid force or panic. Closure linkage: the finding-aid gesture and witness invitation echo the tone's care. Cost: tonal restraint foregoes thriller-level tension, which fits the accumulative lens. Strong fit with conceptual stakes and archive character.</comment>
