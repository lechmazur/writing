<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior voice is specific and patterned ("regret is a soft tool in a place that worships torque"), but her key choice—to restart the carousel—lacks embodied contradiction in the moment of decision. The negotiation with the ghost proceeds through collected stories rather than enacted hesitation or visible cost that forecloses a live alternative. The fifteen-year-old vow paid as tribute arrives late and feels more like currency than an on-page struggle that alters present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the lagoon's echoes and the camera wheel's clicks build density toward the final shudder and paddle-catch. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the carousel acknowledges and resumes motion—with conceptual cost (the ghost's warning accepted, the vow spent). Orientation anchors by line three (Mara, pontoon, post-halt lagoon). One minor causality slip: the ghost's acceptance feels abrupt after its refusal stance, though the vow-payment bridges the gap adequately for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon supplies vivid micro-setting detail (floating lilies, skimming foam, wobbling pontoon) and the camera wheel's prongs physically interact with the lagoon surface to coax scenes. The halted carousel's "paddles poised like suspended wings" charges the final image when they catch air. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single pontoon and the distant carousel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: restart the carousel or let the settlement lose rain, with the ghost's warning as counter-pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost demands tribute and Mara pays with the library vow, narrowing her options and foreclosing hoarded memory. The final paddle-catch reweights the trade-off under the Accumulative lens. Escalation is driven by Mara's wheel-turning agency, though the ghost's pivot from refusal to acceptance compresses quickly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—eroded ambitions, the cost of repetition, memory as currency—emerges through concrete images (rafts from celebration banners, the rustworker's gradual quit, the unkept library vow) rather than statement. The final line offers a non-literal answer: motion resumes not by reversing erosion but by acknowledging its cost and tending stories. The teacher's warning and lover's map seed resonance without overt moralizing. One phrase ("erosion that sculpted them until unrecognizable") skirts abstraction but remains anchored in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: "silence has weight," "vows are time's favorite minerals," "regret turn heavy as a dropped wrench." Diction remains specific and voice-motivated throughout. The ghost's speech ("do not restart...you will be swallowed") carries subtext and advances plot. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she realizes the ghost will not sort it") appears mid-pressure but does not flatten immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly controlled: "song stripped to bones," "gear teeth on her tongue," "eyes arranged in a sequence that does not match any clock." Two adjacent lines paraphrase without added pressure: "She says the rhythm did not erase them; it sculpted them…that is a different kind of failure" restates the same idea. Template-stem check passes. One metaphor ("stillness fractures") contradicts the established stillness-as-held-breath frame at the close, though the effect may be intentional propulsion. Information density is strong; no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—negotiating with one's ghost by collecting lagoon-stored echoes via a camera wheel's prongs—feels specific and non-obvious, with the ghost as "the slide itself" offering a fresh inflection on temporal confusion. The carousel-as-rain-engine and stories-as-currency premise commits fully. Risk-taking in diction and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the ghost's out-of-order eyes and the chronologically confused trait echo familiar fragmented-self motifs without transforming them deeply.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout and makes the key choice to restart the carousel and pay with the vow. Her stance shift from collecting stories to bargaining with the ghost drives the turn. Setup clear, middle development present (wheel-turning), closure participation solid (final crank and paddle-catch). Causal pressure moderate; the choice feels earned but not irreplaceable—another scavenger could enact similar moves. Cost tied to the element: the library vow and the ghost's tribute. Score reflects strong beat involvement and closure linkage, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears early, is used across multiple beats (four distinct clicks plus the final crank), and its mechanics matter: prongs pluck the lagoon to coax scenes, shaping Mara's negotiation method. Final crank ("not a story but a question mark written in spray") charges the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff all present. High specificity and irreplaceability: removing the wheel would break the story's central mechanic. Cost connection solid: the wheel enables the vow-payment and carousel restart.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" shapes the ghost's identity ("patching leaks with your eroded ambitions") and Mara's reflection on belief that frayed. The rustworker's gradual quit and the library vow embody the concept on the page. Mara's counter-argument ("sculpted them until unrecognizable") engages the concept causally. Setup and thematic presence strong; middle beat involvement moderate (the rustworker story); closure linkage implicit (resuming motion accepts erosion's cost). Score reflects solid thematic integration and one clear causal beat, but the concept operates more as shaping logic than irreplaceable action driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is labeled early ("never sure if the wind carries memory forward or blows it back") and demonstrated when scenes from the wheel slide temporally ("years from now, or years ago"). The ghost embodies the attribute ("eyes arranged in a sequence that does not match any clock"). Setup present, thematic development solid, but the trait does not visibly constrain a single on-page choice with cost—Mara navigates the confusion without tactical friction. Closure participation minimal; the attribute colors the world but remains descriptive rather than enabling or limiting agency.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Regret frames Mara's arrival ("soft tool in a place that worships torque"), enables the vow-payment ("regret loosen from its hiding place"), and is spoken aloud to the ghost ("eroded ambitions, she murmurs"). Setup clear by first third, middle beat involvement present (the feeling "turns heavy as a dropped wrench"), closure linkage solid (vow paid with regret as the loosened currency). Causal pressure moderate: the emotion motivates the tribute but does not uniquely define the action—gratitude or duty could substitute. Cost tied to the element: the library vow is hoarded memory released through regret.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—collecting lagoon fragments via the camera wheel—is signaled early and demonstrated across four clicks, each yielding a story (teacher, lover, Mara's inventory, rustworker). Mara explicitly states the plan ("she plans to bargain by collecting fragments") and executes it. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The method shapes every middle beat and the final negotiation. Causal pressure high: removing this mechanic would collapse the bargaining logic. Cost connection: the collected stories become the argument that persuades the ghost and enables the vow-payment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon supplies the pontoon stage, the foam that stores echoes, and the carousel mechanism. Mara's wheel prongs interact with the lagoon surface to coax scenes. The setting pressures the choice: if the carousel stays halted, the settlement loses rain; if it restarts, the grind resumes. Setup immediate, development present (lagoon as story-storage), closure participation solid (paddles catch air, lagoon resumes motion). Causal pressure moderate: the above-clouds aspect and kinetic detail add texture but the rain-engine stake could function in a ground-level reservoir. Specificity high; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" anchors the setup and frames the static window in which Mara acts. The halt creates the problem (rains stop, pontoons drift) and the ghost negotiation becomes possible only in this pause. Closure participation clear: the carousel resumes. Setup strong, development moderate (the stillness persists and is referenced), but the timeframe does not tighten tactics—Mara faces no visible clock pressure to act quickly. The halt functions as enabling condition rather than escalating constraint. Cost connection implicit: resuming motion accepts future grind.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to negotiate with one's own ghost"—is stated explicitly and dramatized through the wheel-turning, story-collecting, and vow-payment. The ghost arrives and the negotiation unfolds on the page with conflicting wants (restart vs. refuse). Setup clear by first third, middle beats involve repeated attempts and the tribute demand, closure participation solid (ghost accepts, carousel shudders). Friction between want (restart) and cost (erosion, vow) is visible. Causal pressure high: the motivation drives every key beat and the final trade-off. Score reflects strong dramatization and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness that tickles the ears like dust" opens the piece and recurs as "stillness has weight," "held breath," and "stillness fractures" at closure. The tone modulates from suspended stasis through the wheel's gentle clicks to the final shudder and bright-air catch. Setup immediate, development present (tone sustained through middle reflection and negotiation), closure participation clear (stillness fractures as motion resumes). Coherence strong; the tone charges the final image by breaking its own frame. One friction: "fractured stillness" as opening phrase and closing action risks circularity, though the reprise reweights the stake effectively.</comment>
