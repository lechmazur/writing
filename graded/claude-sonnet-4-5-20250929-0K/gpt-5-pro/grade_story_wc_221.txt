<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior landscape is richly embodied through temporally stretched shadows and the compass rose applique that grounds memory and present action. Micro-choices—laying paper, rerouting power, signing with the mother's name—reveal values under pressure. The "blessed pariah" identity is felt through isolation and the contradiction between trusted math and refused voice. Minor slip: the mother's teaching about true north borders on thesis statement but remains concrete enough to charge the final alignment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds pressure through layered observations, sketch overlays, and the discovery of a vector pointing to bedrock. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist aligns the dome's attention with the valley hum, a decisive reweighting that forecloses evacuation and embraces pariah status. Cost is visible: professional isolation, signing with the mother's name, and the knowing acceptance of no applause. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening lines (deck, post-shutdown, solitary).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is not mere backdrop: residual gradients stretch shadows, panels index centuries, visor grids enable the sketch method, and the leftmost lens becomes the instrument of alignment. The compass rose applique, bedrock valley, and river reflection all constrain or charge choices. The protagonist's body—breathing that stutters the star, hands moving twice—functions as micro-setting. The valley's mineral seam operates as true north, indispensable to the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightens through sketch overlay, smear-to-vector discovery, and lens rerouting. The piece accumulates pressure via the protagonist's solitary persistence against institutional fear, then deepens when the valley hums back at matching frequency, validating the alignment. Agency is renunciation (refusing shuttle, staying alone) and decision (rerouting power) with visible cost: pariah status and no applause. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the compass rose motif: true north as "quiet insistence" not magnetic pull, recalculated to "slow axis of change." The sketch method, anniversary custom, and valley bedrock cohere into a pattern of obedience to honest pull. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—alignment as song—without stating a moral. The protagonist's final gesture (signing with mother's name, leaving the sketch) reconfigures prior material: family science speaks when supervisors' fear departs. No sentimental resolution; complexity persists in the "blessed pariah" paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "time dragging light as if mending it," "throat after singing," "river threw back a blurred aurora." Diction remains consistently elevated yet concrete, matching the technical observer's idiom. Psychic distance stays close and stable; no head-hopping. Minor density concern: some metaphors cluster heavily ("like spare cutlery," "black rope thrown to a sinking ship," "wet cloth") in early paragraphs, yet they remain legible and voice-consistent. Rhythmic control holds under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, stakes, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent. Two points of friction: the phrase "temporally stretched by residual gradients" and "temporal drag" echo each other conceptually across adjacent paragraphs, a mild paraphrase loop. The compass rose description recurs but with shifting function, so no penalty there. A few sentences approach overwriting ("Its halves unlocking like a jaw unclenched"), yet clarity remains intact and none touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of time dilation observation deck, family sky-sketching custom, and bedrock valley as "true north" is specific and non-obvious. The story transforms the pariah-scientist trope through the mother's compass teaching and the sketch-as-alignment method. The turn—smear to vector to valley hum—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric-tinged structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image (sketch left for future arrivals) is fresh and integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Blessed pariah" frames the opening choice (refusing evacuation), drives the middle (staying to translate questions), and charges the ending (accepting no applause, aligning the instrument). The contradiction between trusted math and refused voice creates the key tension. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The compass rose applique appears in beat one (flashing star), is invoked in the mother's teaching, returns at the protagonist's sternum "like a liturgy," and "dulls" near the end while warmth remains above the valley. Two distinct beats, closure participation via the warmth/dullness contrast, but the object does not directly enable a tactic. Lyric reprise reweights but lacks middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"True north" is the story's conceptual spine: taught by the mother, redefined as "slow axis of change," discovered in the bedrock valley, and enacted in the lens rerouting. It shapes tactics (sketch overlay, power reroute) and the closure image (alignment as song). The concept narrows options—refuse easy answers, obey honest pull—and the final cost (pariah status, no applause) is tied to this insistence. All three gates, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is visible on the page: the protagonist's shadow reaches "like a black rope," hands move "twice, out of agreement," and colleagues/children layer "like distant rain." It constrains perception and enables the sketch method (ink bleeds slowly). Present in setup, middle, and closure; the trait charges the final image of leaving the sketch "for the ones who would come, long after this moment, temporally stretched." Cost is implicit in perceptual dislocation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Glimpse" anchors the key turn: "Sometimes I glimpse my own hands moving twice" signals the temporal layering, and "In the reflection I saw colleagues walking in yesterday, and children from a future school trip" enables the realization that gestures "agreed on an axis." This action defines the problem (confusion) and opens the path to solution (alignment). Present early, drives the middle overlay work, and the closure image depends on it. High causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced early, enacted twice (thin paper over viewport, anniversary sketch matched to last year's), and its mechanics matter: the ink bleeds slowly under temporal drag, the smear becomes a vector. The method shapes the protagonist's tactics and delivers the discovery that bedrock is true north. All three gates, strong beat involvement, and closure depends on the sketch left behind.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is indispensable: it creates the temporal gradients, stretches shadows, indexes centuries, enables the sketch method via visor grid, and houses the leftmost lens that the protagonist reroutes toward bedrock. The deck's pressure (shutdown, evacuation) frames the stakes. The valley it overlooks becomes the mold, and the deck pours attention into it at closure. Environmental constraint and resource shape every major turn. All three gates, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" frames the entire narrative window: evacuation refused, supervisors gone, the deck stilled. The timeframe tightens choices—act now before the array is lost—and the closure hinges on rerouting power in this post-shutdown moment. The time is tracked implicitly through "emergency strips," "evacuation beacons that still pulsed," and the machines "sleeping but dreaming." Present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Turn confusion into exploration" is stated early, dramatized in the sketch overlays and lens rerouting, and tested against fear and institutional abandonment. The motivation is conflicted: the protagonist refuses the shuttle (cost: isolation), stays to measure drift (friction: blessed pariah status), and sends the pattern with no expectation of applause (renunciation of recognition). The motivation shapes every beat and charges the closure's acceptance of pariah role. All three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" opens the story ("rattled my ribs like spare cutlery"), recurs in the protagonist's listening ("measured its rhythm, the heartbeat of machines sleeping"), and closes the piece ("the echoed silence returned fuller, like a promise kept"). Tone modulates with accumulative pressure—from isolation to discovery to alignment—and charges the final image. Coherent through turns, with the closure reprise reweighting the opening mood from abandonment to fulfillment.</comment>
