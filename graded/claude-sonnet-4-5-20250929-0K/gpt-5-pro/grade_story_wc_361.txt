<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courier's interiority is embodied through the pendant's vibrations and the physical weight of absence carried like the reliquary. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between proving presence and learning to release, enacted through micro-choices (lifting the pendant with two fingers, asking it to give back sharpness). The mentor's absence operates as both weight and teaching, shaping present choices without convenient resolution. Emotional progression remains credible—jittery need modulates to measured release—but the final stance feels more resolved than the established contradiction warrants at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of noticing/inviting/release by the first cairn encounter, then deepens through the woman's encounter and the protagonist's final walk. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist crystallizes practice into stance ("notice, invite, release") with visible cost—accepting the mentor's absence and her own jittery need. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 6. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendant's gift is recognized as hunger that can "thin the next dawn," forcing the release choice that reweights all prior extensions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway pressures movement and supplies the cairn marker for the singer encounter; the narrowing blade-point where the woman waits spatially enacts the story's tightening. The dragonfly-wing pendant functions as micro-setting, vibrating sympathetically to constrain choices (extends encounters, must be released). Sensory detail is purposeful—thyme and bread scents, frost-glinting shawl—and filtered through the courier's attention. The ridge itself becomes an active presence ("leans closer, listening") that charges the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning to practice notice/invite/release without letting the gift become hunger. The encounter with the woman provides one meaningful tightening—the moment "begins to stretch, sweet and dangerous"—that forces the protagonist to lift the pendant and ask it to release, a choice with visible cost (giving back sharpness, accepting limits). Agency is enacted through renunciation with on-page consequence. The mentor's absence operates as persistent constraint shaping tactics (the protagonist speaks aloud to him, works through his teaching). Escalation under the Accumulative lens arrives as deepening: each encounter adds density until the release choice crystallizes the practice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the triad of actions (notice/germinate/release) enacted across three encounters, not stated until the penultimate paragraph where it lands as earned synthesis. The pendant's sympathetic vibration becomes a controlling image: extension as both gift and hunger, with the mentor's absence teaching the cost of becoming myth. The final image—"wonder starts easiest while the feet are sorting stones, and the heart is learning the instrument below it"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to forgive absence and prove presence) by grounding wonder in embodied practice. Subtext operates in the tension between the courier's jittery need and the mentor's choice to leave, resolved not through reconciliation but through acceptance of different kinds of usefulness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: the courier notices tremors, vibrations, germination, and the ridge's angles through a lens of attentive wonder. Diction remains stable within the focalizer's lyric-philosophical register ("veil of green silk torn into ribbons," "small names germinate") with purposeful compression that the piece teaches early. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The woman's brief dialogue ("she tells me her village slid downhill...with forgetting") carries subtext and advances plot. Psychic distance modulates intentionally—closer during the pendant's work, stepping back for reflection—without filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "I speak to him aloud, saying I know why you left" shifts into direct address mid-thought without clear dramatized prompt, though the effect supports the established pattern of carrying the mentor's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the pendant "extends brief encounters" while also being "part insect, part tuning fork"). Rhythm varies purposefully, breathing during reflection and tightening during the woman's encounter. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. One density concern: "by vibrating sympathetically" appears in lines 5, 18, and implicitly in 9, with the second instance feeling redundant given prior establishment. A minor register drift occurs in "rescue one bright pulse from the gray"—the metaphor edge feels slightly elevated against the earthier "sorting stones" texture. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "extends brief encounters without stealing time" borders on explaining the mechanic rather than showing it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of relic courier + dragonfly-wing pendant + sympathetic vibration + memory-to-myth fade offers a fresh angle on mentor-absence narratives. The premise that extension becomes hunger, that usefulness requires becoming myth, and that practice means learning to release—not hoard—wonder feels specific and non-obvious. The ending's image (feet sorting stones, heart learning the instrument below) transforms the opening's jittery flutter into grounded practice in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor constraint: the "memory to myth" frame is asserted more than it pressures on-page choices; the woman's village and the mentor's trajectory operate more as thematic echo than tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The jittery relic courier frames expectation in line 1, makes the key choice to release the pendant's extension at the woman's encounter (constraining the gift's hunger), and in the final movement commits to continuing practice despite unresolved need. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending stance. The jitteriness operates as both character trait and thematic question (proving presence vs. accepting absence), with the final image grounding the jitter into embodied movement. Could score higher if the jitteriness itself created a visible mistake or cost beyond the general need to prove presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant appears in line 2 (setup), vibrates sympathetically in three distinct beats (the singer, the woman's encounter, the release choice), and settles in the final paragraph to close the arc. It enables the extensions, constrains the choice (must be lifted and asked to release), and its mechanics (sympathetic vibration) matter causally. The "shy shimmer" and tuning-fork quality give it specificity. Strong integration; near-indispensable. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the pendant's own cost (what it loses when releasing) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The absent mentor shapes stakes from line 2 ("my mentor is absent, leaving only a method") and reappears in reflection at lines 11–13, teaching the cost of extension and the need to become "useful as myth." The protagonist's practice and final speech to the mentor ("I know why you left") show the absence driving present choices. The mentor's cadence returns at line 27 to guide the down-slope walk, and forgiveness of "the quiet where my mentor used to walk" becomes part of the final stance. Present across setup, middle reflection that primes the release choice, and ending synthesis. Essential to the thematic question and the protagonist's evolving understanding of release.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The attribute "extends brief encounters" is named in line 4, demonstrated with the singer (line 9: "stretches our moment like warm taffy"), and again with the woman (line 20: "the moment begins to stretch"). Line 10 warns of the cost ("only borrowing a little sharpness from elsewhere"), which becomes visible when the protagonist senses the danger (line 20) and chooses to release (line 22). The attribute enables two beats and constrains the climactic choice, but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—what "sharpness" means and how "elsewhere" misses it are told more than shown. Functional and causal, but the cost could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Germinate" is introduced as method in line 3 ("notice what wants to germinate"), enacted with the reliquary at line 18 ("do not explain; allow; let the small names germinate"), and returns in the final image as the practice's core ("seeds, patient, already knowing which weather they require"). The woman's village names sprout from sand as a literal germination that answers her need. Present in setup, climactic beat, and ending synthesis. The action is thematically central but only one beat (the reliquary opening) hinges on it; the rest is metaphor and framing. Solid lyric integration but not indispensable to plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method "by vibrating sympathetically" is named in line 5, shown in action with the woman in line 18 ("trembles by vibrating sympathetically with the breath the woman holds"), and implicitly governs the pendant's operation in the singer encounter. The sympathetic mechanic distinguishes this pendant from a generic magic tool—it responds to intention and breath, not command—and that responsiveness creates the cost (it can become hunger if not released). The method shapes two encounters and primes the release choice. Strong causal role; the specificity matters.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway anchors setting from line 1, hums "like a great sleeping instrument" (line 6), supplies the first cairn for the singer encounter, and narrows "to a blade" where the woman waits (line 15). In the final movement it "answers" the protagonist's speech with "a low chuckle of ice" (line 28), and the closing image grounds wonder in "the feet sorting stones" and "the heart learning the instrument below it" (line 32). The ridgeway is present across all beats, supplies spatial pressure (narrowing path), and charges the ending by becoming the instrument the courier learns. Indispensable to tone and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the fade from memory to myth" is introduced in line 7 as the delivery's destination and returns in the final paragraph as the practice itself ("I will carry them across the fade from memory to myth"). The woman's village has already crossed that fade, and the mentor is in the process of crossing it (line 13: "could not return until he had become useful as myth"). The frame charges the thematic question but does not tighten decisions—no countdown, no urgency from the fading process itself. It operates as conceptual setting more than temporal constraint. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to coax wonder from the routine" is named in line 8 and enacted through the choice to take this "ordinary work" and the practice of notice/invite/release. The final image—"wonder starts easiest while the feet are sorting stones"—reprises and deepens the motivation by grounding it in embodied movement. The jittery need to prove presence (line 1, line 31) creates friction with the need to release, adding complexity. The motivation frames the journey and returns with cost (accepting that wonder requires letting go), but it is not tested by a competing want or visible sacrifice within the encounters themselves. Solid thematic integration with lyric payoff.</comment>
