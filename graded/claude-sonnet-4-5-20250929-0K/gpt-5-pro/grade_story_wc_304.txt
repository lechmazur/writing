<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"I felt the stone listening to me back," the emerald's warmth against her palm. The mother's teaching ("our calling was not decoration but return") roots motivation in lived apprenticeship. The final choice to "stand, lucidly watchful" represents earned endurance rather than transformation, which fits the piece's Accumulative/Textural design. Minor issue: the emotional texture remains steady rather than contradictory under peak pressure, and the reflection-heavy mode occasionally abstracts rather than dramatizes ("I recognized my duty renewed").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening line. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual repetition, the emerald's progressive warming, and the aurora's intensification until the final image reconfigures the protagonist's stance with visible cost—she commits to perpetual vigil at the threshold. Cost is legible in "I would keep this grotto at the lip of that threshold," foreclosing departure or ordinary life. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). One friction: the midpoint meanders through backstory without a clear tightening, delaying the emerald's peak use until late; the escalation reads more as accumulation than causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto's physical details constrain action: "stalactites held beads of condensation that chose not to fall" establishes the uncanny stillness; the aurora "leaned nearer" as an active environmental pressure during the ritual. The emerald chip's warmth and the meltwater washing are tactile and purposeful. The final image—"the arch where aurora meets rock"—charges the closure by grounding the protagonist's vow in a specific spatial threshold. Sensory selection filters through professional focus (aligning eyelids, trimming the brush from her own hair) without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to "capture one last spark before oblivion" for the mother, with the emotional/professional cost of performing the ritual on kin. The emerald's warming and the aurora's descent provide one meaningful tightening when "the chip shone brighter, the shape resolving into a glimmer." Agency is present in the choice to dare the ritual and later to renew the calling. The cost is felt in the protagonist's perpetual commitment to the grotto vigil, foreclosing ordinary life. Friction: the escalation unfolds gradually through ritual accumulation rather than a sharp reversal, and the middle third recounts prior teaching without on-page complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: the threshold between movement and stillness, the "mirror that let the living recognize their courage," and the final vow to "infuse each parting with the truth of remaining." The emerald's dual function—memory stone and catalyst—operates as a recurring image that reweights at closure, grounding abstraction in tactile particulars. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (the protagonist becomes the perpetual guide) without moralizing. The mother's note and the phrase "return" seed the theme early and pay off in the protagonist's renewed stance, avoiding late thematic intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric register: "the hush thickened until I felt the stone listening to me back," "a returning tide that recognized the shore made of her bones." Perceptual signature is consistent—professional attention to detail (eyelids, wrist resonance test) mixed with metaphoric phrasing. The prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the emerald ritual, longer accumulative syntax in reflective beats. One friction: the elevated diction ("coax whatever glowed to hold," "infuse each parting with the truth of remaining") occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction that slightly distances the reader from immediate embodied action, though it remains voice-coherent and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "It warmed, and a faint speckled light crawled through it like spores rising, then stilled." Sentence openings vary and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, several lines loop conceptually without advancing pressure: "the hush thickened" and "the silence gathered not like absence but like invitation" restate atmosphere; "lucidly watchful" appears three times with minimal tactical differentiation. The phrase "infuse" recurs mechanically (lips, cheeks, parting). Template cadence in reflective beats ("She always said," "She had left me," "She had taught me") slightly flattens momentum. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and synonym churn touching multiple beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician frame and the aurora-grotto setting combine familiar death-ritual tropes with a fresh fantasy-realist angle. The emerald's method—"finding patterns in static"—and the "threshold of stillness" offer specificity that resists generic afterlife mysticism. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows through without retreat. One friction: the emotional arc (apprentice performs ritual on mentor, renews calling) follows a familiar template without a sharp counter-reading or moral ambiguity; the transformation test suggests the core beats could transfer to another setting with minor adjustments. Risk-taking in structure and diction is present but does not radically heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beautician mortician is present throughout and her choices drive all beats: preparing the body, testing the emerald, performing the ritual, and committing to the vigil. Setup is immediate (opening line), development includes the wrist-test decision and the whispered invocation, and closure hinges on her vow to continue the calling. The role is irreplaceable—no other character could perform this exact ritual. Visible cost: foreclosing ordinary life to remain at the threshold. Minor friction: some beats (washing, aligning eyelids) are preparatory rather than decision-laden, slightly lowering causal density.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears in setup (mother's bequest), is handled across three beats (wrist test, lip placement, throat securing), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (secured to the comb "so that the spark could travel where honor was braided"). Its unique property—glowing on skin, drinking the aurora—is irreplaceable and constrains the ritual's success. The chip's warming signals escalation and the final securing grounds the protagonist's vow in a tangible talisman. Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage; very difficult to replace with a near-synonym.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "threshold of stillness" frames the protagonist's calling (the sliver of fading where past hesitates) and shapes the ritual's goal (holding the spark at that threshold). It is named early, reappears at closure ("keep this grotto at the lip of that threshold"), and the entire plot is structured around navigating this conceptual space. However, it operates more as thematic atmosphere than a concrete constraint that alters tactics—no on-page moment where the threshold's mechanics force a specific choice or rule. The concept resonates but does not bite with visible cost tied to its exact properties.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is introduced early ("I had taught myself to be lucidly watchful") and recurs at closure ("stand, lucidly watchful"). The trait enables the protagonist to catch "tremors in the breathless" and "listen between heartbeats," grounding her professional competence. However, it remains largely label-level—no on-page moment where being lucidly watchful forces a trade-off or visibly constrains action (e.g., noticing something others would miss at the cost of speed or comfort). The attribute colors perception but does not create friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Infuse" is the protagonist's signature action, named early ("my work was to reach that threshold and coax whatever glowed to hold") and executed in two key beats: infusing the emerald's glimmer onto the mother's lips and cheeks ("I infused warmth onto her lips and cheeks"), and the closing vow ("infuse each parting with the truth of remaining"). The action is irreplaceable—swapping it for "apply" or "restore" would lose the metaphysical transfer that defines the calling. It drives the ritual's climax and charges the final image. Minor friction: the mid-story beats describe infusion retrospectively rather than dramatizing the exact moment of transfer.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method "finding patterns in static" is taught by the mother ("a quiet science of finding patterns in static, because the aurora murmurs even to bone") and appears at the ritual's peak: "my mind went still enough to infuse a single intention" and "the aurora lowered, the green shivering into lines I could almost read." It shapes the protagonist's approach and is irreplaceable. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page detail of what the patterns look like or how recognizing them alters the next step. The method is present and functional but could be more concretely dramatized to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is anchored in the opening line, supplies the ritual's physical constraints (condensation, stillness, the arch where aurora meets rock), and charges the closure image ("the arch where aurora meets rock" becomes the threshold the protagonist vows to guard). The setting is irreplaceable: no other location could provide the aurora's "murmur" or the grotto's uncanny stasis. Environmental pressure is legible when "the aurora lowered" during the ritual and "the grotto lift[ed] a fraction like a held breath." Strong setup, development, and closure linkage with visible atmospheric and spatial cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is the mother's explicit request (note under the comb) and drives the protagonist's ritual choices: testing the emerald, timing the invocation, angling the mirror. The motivation is dramatized through action and conflicted by the emotional cost of performing the ritual on her own mother. Closure hinges on the vow to repeat this act for all future dead, expanding the motivation into a lifelong calling. Friction: the desire is stated more than it is shown in internal struggle—no moment where the protagonist weighs abandoning the attempt or doubts her skill under this specific pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is established early ("every farewell arrived in a radiant hush") and modulates coherently: the opening's professional calm, the thickening hush when the mother arrives, and the final "silence gathered not like absence but like invitation." Tone supports the accumulative pressure and charges the closure image with quiet reverence. The piece maintains tonal consistency without flattening into a single static mood. Minor friction: some mid-story passages ("the sky leaned nearer, ribbons of green folding and unfolding") lean decorative rather than pressing the hush against urgency, slightly lowering the tone's tactical grip.</comment>
