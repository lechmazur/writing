<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter's interiority is consistently embodied through concrete perception ("my ribs ring like struck brass"), and the motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" drives every key choice from following the brooch to scaffolding the chapel. Internal conflict shows in the painter's hunger balanced against collaborative openness with Mara. The final choice—painting the map publicly—feels earned by the arc, though the earlier statement "I wanted nothing but to thresh meaning from experience" edges toward declaring rather than showing the value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within opening lines (tidal island, post-war shore, insomniac painter). The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural teaching the land to follow rain becomes a collective tool, reweighting the protagonist's solitary hunger into communal work with visible cost (scaffolding time, children and elders embodying the effort). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through rain trails → map → mural with the final image charging prior material. One tightening occurs when the brooch's alignment opens the cistern, narrowing options from scattered search to focused excavation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal island constrains choices throughout: low tide reveals the brooch, rain trails guide the search, high tide marks when elders sing. The brooch's circles, cistern mouth, and mural wall function as micro-settings that pressure action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "eelgrass," "blistered mural," "algae painted the ceiling in a feral fresco." The amber brooch returns as a charged object when Mara presses it back, anchoring gratitude and courage in a tactile exchange. Spatial choreography (shore → causeway → desalination hall → chapel) tracks cleanly without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost water map—signals early and escalates when the brooch alignment reveals the cistern seam, forcing the protagonist and Mara into immediate collaborative action. Agency is clear: the painter chooses to follow rain trails, decode the brooch, and commit to public mural work with visible cost (time, exposure, community dependence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the brooch's circles match the drip patterns, narrowing the search. The final painting becomes a tool with on-page consequence: "rain crept down the painted lines the way it crept across the land, teaching us."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—threshing meaning from experience through collaborative work—emerges from concrete actions (following trails, hauling cylinder, painting mural) without thesis statement. The map functions as both literal object and thematic vessel: memory, geometry, and communal learning braid. The final image ("rain crept down the painted lines...teaching us") offers a resonant answer to the protagonist's opening hunger, reweighting solitary art into collective pedagogy. The brooch's return as gift charges the exchange motif. Minor slip: "haggard awe" appears twice as a label, slightly overstating what the scene already conveys.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent perceptual signature: "I palmed it, a line of cold went up my wrist"; "my eyes burned with that haggard awe again." Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring causality. Mara's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: "Do not dress it up, painter" advances the exchange negotiation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during brooch discovery, widening slightly during mural work to accommodate community involvement. Minor filter-verb density in reflective beats ("I wanted to thresh," "I said I wanted nothing") slightly dulls immediacy but does not break pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively ("The drip became a ribbon, the ribbon a current") and information density is high across most beats. Figurative language generally serves pressure: "cistern mouth was a black coin," "spine uncoiling." However, elevated register occasionally drifts from POV plausibility—"haggard awe" repeats as a stock phrase, and "unearthed convergence" reads more authorial than character-voice in peak moments. Opening and closing lines anchor well (tide as lung / rain teaching). Minor paraphrase loop: "amber holds sunlight like a breath, and this one held more than the sun" restates without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frame—post-war tidal island, rain cartography, collaborative mural—synthesizes familiar elements (post-apocalyptic salvage, lost map quest) into a specific vision. The rain-trail method and brooch alignment offer fresh procedural texture. Emotional specificity grounds the arc: the painter's hunger, Mara's "laugh...after measuring a flood with your own bones." The final image (mural teaching the land) transforms the trope of recovery into pedagogy. Proximity check: no close echoes detected. Minor limitation: the premise leans on recognizable post-disaster recovery beats without fully subverting them, though specificity (rain cartography, tidal mill metaphor) elevates execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The insomniac painter's choices—following rain trails, decoding the brooch, negotiating with Mara, painting the mural—drive all major turns. The insomnia itself shapes perception (awake when pumps sigh to sleep) and embodies the hunger that fuels the arc. Present in setup, development (cistern excavation), and payoff (mural completion). Two beats: brooch discovery → cistern → scaffolding. Cost: sleepless hours with children and elders. Causal pressure narrows options. The role is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber brooch appears in setup (tire discovery), middle (alignment unlocks cistern), and payoff (Mara returns it as gift). Its circles constrain the search method and enable the map recovery. Reweighted at closure from tool to token of gratitude and courage. Three beats: discovery → alignment → return. Cost connection: the brooch's use requires collaborative trust and public exposure of the find. Specificity: the etched circles are irreplaceable—no generic object could perform this function. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unearthed convergence appears in setup (painter declares pursuit) and payoff ("not magic, just an unearthed convergence of geometry, rain, and memory"). The concept frames the search stakes: finding where patterns meet. Development: the brooch circles converging with rain trails enacts the concept on-page. However, it functions more as thematic label than a constraint that alters tactics—removing the phrase would not break the plot. Lyric reprise reweights the term from abstract to concrete (geometry + rain + memory), earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" is introduced early ("People said I looked wryly earnest, like a joke that had learned to bow to the wind") but remains largely label-only. It colors voice and others' perception but does not demonstrably constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait could be swapped for a similar descriptor without structural change. No development beat shows the trait altering a choice under pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exchange drives two major beats: Mara's initial trade (brooch story for painting place) and her final return of the brooch as gift. Setup clear ("We sat on the slick steps and agreed on an exchange"). Middle: the exchange enables access to the map's history, unlocking the cistern search. Payoff: the brooch return redefines the relationship from transactional to collaborative gratitude. Removing exchange would collapse the Mara arc and strip the final gesture of meaning. Causal pressure high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Following rain trails is signaled early ("I started by following rain trails") and shapes the entire search method. Development: trails lead to causeway, then desalination hall, then chapel. Mechanics matter: the painter turns the brooch to match wet patterns, and the final mural uses painted lines to teach the land. Present across setup, middle (three locations), and payoff (mural). Causal pressure: without this method, no map recovery. Specificity: the method is tied to the world's rain logic and cannot be swapped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal island supplies resources (eelgrass hides brooch, tide reveals shore, cistern holds map) and constrains choices (low tide for children's shells, high tide for elders' songs). Setup: "the island showed me the day again." Development: causeway, desalination hall, and chapel micro-settings guide the search. Payoff: the chapel wall becomes the mural substrate. Tide rhythm structures work beats. Environment alters tactics throughout. Removing the island setting would strip the rain-trail logic and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the water wars" anchors the timeframe in setup and explains the map's scarcity and the shore's rust. The wars create the need (old maps failed) and justify the cartographer's pre-war chart as precious. However, the timeframe does not tighten present decisions—no live clock pressures the search or mural completion. Development: the wars contextualize stakes but do not constrain tactics. Payoff: the map offers post-war recovery, but temporal urgency is absent. Functional but not irreplaceable; a similar scarcity premise could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to thresh meaning from experience drives the painter's choice to follow the brooch, decode patterns, and commit to public mural work. Setup: "I wanted to thresh meaning from experience...by work." Development: the protagonist tells Mara "I was hunting an unearthed convergence" and later "I wanted nothing but to thresh meaning from experience." Payoff: painting the mural fulfills the desire through collaborative pedagogy. Friction: the exchange with Mara tests whether the work justifies exposure. Cost: sleepless hours and public vulnerability. Causal pressure clear; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Haggard awe is introduced early (Mara's "laugh in haggard awe") and reprised at map discovery ("my eyes burned with that haggard awe again"). The tone—exhausted wonder earned through survival—modulates with pressure: early wryness, middle intensity at cistern, final quiet teaching. Coherent through turns. The final image (rain teaching the land) charges the tone with earned reverence rather than declaration. Specificity: the phrase captures post-war survival mixed with discovery. Minor slip: the label appears twice, slightly overstating what scene work already conveys.</comment>
