<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("fetch wisdom from failure") and heartbeat-counting trait are present but largely decorative; the internal arc relies on telling rather than micro-choices under pressure. The ghost companion offers some interaction, yet the dialogue feels more like thematic echo than character-specific conflict ("remember me as something more than interference"). The death-certificate survivor backstory is recounted but never constrains present action—no visible trade-off or complication emerges from the error. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("counts tree rings and grief") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation arrives promptly (observatory, snow, protagonist alone). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the protagonist climbs, consults the ghost, reads ink patterns, receives a "corridor" metaphor, and decides to descend with the shard and map. However, the closure—"carrying a weatherproof wisdom that does not forget"—remains abstract; the corridor is a metaphorical gift rather than an on-page choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The decision to descend and show the shard/map to "those who wrote my ending" gestures at stakes but does not dramatize a trade-off or visible consequence on the page. One meaningful deepening is present (ghost offers the corridor), yet the final beat summarizes rather than enacts cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory dome, snow, icicles, consoles, and broken mug are vivid and purposeful; the shard becomes a recurring object. Spatial choreography is coherent (protagonist kneels, touches shard to lens). The setting constrains the protagonist's initial isolation and provides the spilled-ink map and the dome's "whale note," which charges the middle beat. However, the corridor itself is a metaphorical construct—wind and snow properties are asserted ("where wind drops and the snow forgets to bite") rather than tested on the page, slightly reducing the setting's role at closure. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but does not decisively shape the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("fetch wisdom from failure") is signaled early. Pressure is more accumulative than causal: the protagonist asks the ghost, the ghost shares a memory and a metaphor, the protagonist accepts the corridor as lesson. No on-page reversal narrows options; the ghost's offer arrives without complication or cost to the protagonist's immediate tactics. The decision to descend is stated but not tested—no visible trade-off (e.g., weather risk, physical toll, social consequence) is dramatized. The piece lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens because the ink-map gift is convenient rather than earned through protagonist struggle or sacrifice; coincidence (ghost generosity) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (reconciling failure, correcting the record, honoring rhythm over erasure) emerges from concrete images: the certificate error, heartbeat counting, spilled ink, and the corridor metaphor. The ghost's request to "remember me as something more than interference" and the protagonist's pledge to "put the shard on the desk" invite reflection without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph leans toward thematic summary ("carrying a weatherproof wisdom") rather than letting the shard and corridor speak through implication. The ending offers a resonant image but edges into direct statement of the lesson, reducing subtext. One strong particular—the porcelain shard on glass writing "a delicate fracture across the sky"—anchors the theme effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, contemplative, and consistent ("the dome breathes," "a shadow stitched from clerks"). Distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping. The ghost's dialogue ("Remember me as something more than interference") reads more like thematic utterance than character-specific speech, slightly flattening voice distinction. Interior monologue ("I do not want revenge; I want a wiser ending") veers toward thesis statement rather than embodied perception under pressure. Diction is elevated throughout; peak beats maintain texture without collapse, though the rhythm becomes uniform rather than modulating sharply with stakes. No filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leaks; purposeful compression and metaphor are taught early and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high: "blankets of hush," "light like a pearl on the tongue," "snow meant for its sleep," "fragile weather," "cloud caught in a fist," "storm maps vanishing," "delicate fracture across the sky." In several high-pressure beats (ghost dialogue, ink reading, corridor offer) metaphor stacks without clear propulsion, slowing momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "to fetch wisdom from failure" / "a wiser ending that begins again" / "weatherproof wisdom"; "counts heartbeats constantly" recurs without added pressure. Register remains consistent but elevated throughout, reducing urgency. No grammar or tense errors; some mixed vehicles ("ink crawls toward the drains and stains the floor with fleeting rivers" mixes liquid motion with geological/cartographic metaphor). Overwriting and template stems ("I [verb], and [noun] [verb]") reduce density in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination—death-certificate survivor, digital ghost in an observatory, spilled-ink navigation—offers a fresh frame. However, the emotional arc (survivor seeks wisdom, ghost grants metaphorical corridor, survivor descends to correct the record) follows a template reconciliation path without a non-obvious turn. The corridor itself is abstract and unexplained; its specificity (wind drops, snow forgets) is asserted rather than tested, reducing the synthesis's credibility. The shard and ink map are memorable particulars, and the heartbeat-counting trait could ground the concept but remains ornamental. Risk-taking in voice and structure is present (lyric mode, metaphor-heavy), yet the closure avoids bold stakes—no visible cost or complication dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout; the certificate error motivates the climb. Setup clear ("I am a death certificate error survivor"), development implicit (the ghost remembers the night), closure participation ("change the word signed to me"). However, the error does not constrain or complicate present action—no creditor, no bureaucratic friction, no social consequence dramatized. The protagonist's choices (ask ghost, read ink, accept corridor, descend) are enabled by the ghost's generosity rather than shaped by the survivor status. Two beats (backstory recounted, future plan stated) but no on-page trade-off tied to the error itself. Mid-band: functional yet swappable with a generic wronged-person backstory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Object introduced early ("I pocket one porcelain shard"), reappears mid-story ("I touch the porcelain shard to the glass"), and in closure plan ("I will put the shard on the desk"). Three touches across setup, middle, and payoff. The shard's unique property (writing "a delicate fracture across the sky") is specific and charged. However, the shard does not constrain a choice under pressure—it is selected, used as a tone generator, then planned as evidence. No visible cost tied to handling it; no trade-off or complication. Development beat (touching to lens) is poetic but not causal. Eligible for ~6.7: essential presence, lyric reprise, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core concept present throughout: the ghost speaks, remembers, offers the ink map and corridor, asks to be remembered. Setup strong ("a faint companion that lives inside the broken receiver"), development clear (ghost dialogue and memory), payoff explicit (protagonist agrees to honor the ghost's request). The ghost shapes the protagonist's understanding and plan. However, the interaction is cooperative rather than conflicted—no cost, no complication, no alternative path closed. The ghost's generosity enables rather than tests. One key turn (ghost offers corridor) but no protagonist sacrifice or tactical shift required. Mid-band: drives one major beat, but easily replaced with a helpful mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Attribute stated early ("I count my heartbeats constantly so the fear has numbers") and reprised late ("If I falter, I will count"). Setup and closure participation present. However, the counting never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No beat where the protagonist must pause to count, or where counting prevents panic, or where it slows escape. The trait is thematic annotation rather than dramatized behavior. The ghost "will count with me, softly" at the end, but this is declaration, not scene. Two touches, ornamental use, no middle development. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Action stated ("to defragment the archives of star misfires and misnamed comets") and performed implicitly (reading ink patterns with the ghost). Setup mid-story (not early), development through the ink-reading beat, but no closure participation—the protagonist's final plan is to show the map, not to defragment further. The defragmentation yields the corridor metaphor, which is one turn, yet the mechanics are vague ("Each ripple rearranges its memory") and the protagonist is passive observer. Easily swappable with "consult archives" or "listen to ghost's story." Functional but replaceable; one beat involvement, no cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("read its voice through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink"), used in the middle beat (kneeling, reading ink), and the resulting map is part of the closure plan ("take the ink map down the mountain"). Setup, development, and payoff all present. The method is specific (ink as medium), yet the mechanics are abstract—"ripples rearrange memory" without clear causality. The protagonist does not wrestle with interpreting the patterns; the ghost guides, and the corridor appears. One key beat (ink reading) but no complication or cost tied to the method itself. Mid-band: shapes one turn, but the protagonist's agency is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting present throughout: dome, snow, consoles, icicles, broken mug, glass lens. Setup immediate, development strong (mug falls, ink spills, shard touches lens, dome "exhales"), payoff implicit (protagonist will descend via the "corridor of air"). The observatory isolates the protagonist, supplies the mug/ink, and the dome's architecture (glass, ribs) enables the shard-tone beat. Spatial choreography clear. However, the snow and cold do not pressure the descent decision—no weather complication, no resource limit dramatized. The observatory shapes two beats (mug fall, lens touch) and charges the atmosphere. Eligible for ~6.9: essential across beats, contributes to ending, but does not constrain the final choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Timeframe stated in opening ("after the radio static clears") and reprised ("Its first syllables arrive only after the radio static clears"). Setup present. However, the clearing of static does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no countdown, no resource depletion, no weather window. The protagonist's actions (ask, read, accept, plan) occur in an untracked duration; no clock pressures tactics. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal. Two mentions, ornamental use, no middle pressure. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("I have come to fetch wisdom from failure") and rephrased at closure ("carrying a weatherproof wisdom"). Setup and payoff clear. Development implicit: the ghost offers the corridor as wisdom. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where the protagonist weighs cost of asking vs. leaving, or where failure's lesson creates friction. The protagonist's desire aligns smoothly with the ghost's gift; no tension between want and price. One key beat (ghost answers the request) but no visible trade-off. Lyric reprise reweights slightly. Mid-band: shapes the arc, but the conflict is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone established early ("Midnight solace wraps itself in the frost") and held through turns: contemplative, elegiac, hushed. The tone modulates slightly (mug shatters, "fragile weather"; ghost hums, dome answers with "low whale note") but remains within the solace register. At closure, "midnight solace" is explicitly reprised ("wrapped in midnight solace and the ghost's even hush"), charging the final image. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the theme of reconciliation. However, the tone does not shift sharply under peak pressure—no break into urgency or fear when reading the ink or accepting the corridor. Strong setup and closure participation, moderate modulation. Eligible for ~6.8: essential to atmosphere and ending, but static through the middle.</comment>
