<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's interiority is vivid and embodied throughout—grief runs "the way water wears a channel," and the lens taps teeth with Morse. The protagonist's trait "inadvertently stubborn" is shown through choices (hiring the skiff, wedging into the seam) with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between wanting to give rest and being compelled by the tapping signals. Minor deduction: the peak choice to occupy the impossible space feels more lyric than grounded in prior micro-choices; the act is declared rather than built through escalating agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the undertaker assigns addresses to the drowned, the lens mends, and the city now holds his address "written in water and stone." The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (lens, Morse, library catalog) and the final cadence shift ("I wanted...and now the city has mine too") reweights the opening stake with conceptual cost (permanent reciprocal binding). The orientation anchors arrive early (shop, package, coordinates, skiff, underwater library). One meaningful deepening occurs when the undertaker wedges into the seam and the messages find shelves. Cost is legible: his name is now written into the water-and-stone ledger, a permanent address he cannot leave. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The broken lens, underwater library (marble/silt/coral arches), and the skiff all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through the undertaker's occupational lens: "salt-stained rags," "plankton make a slow alphabet," "tide-smoothed teeth." The library setting supplies the catalog system that enables the resolution (assigning addresses to Names Unrecovered). Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and the atrium work. Minor slip: the mechanism of "occupying impossible spaces" (wedging between lens and light) lacks concrete spatial anchoring—how the body fits into a "blade-thin seam" remains abstract at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: give rest a permanent address. Pressure coheres and tightens when the lens hums/taps coordinates, compelling the descent, then deepens when the undertaker realizes the lens scatters mercy and he must "occupy impossible spaces" to shelve the voices. The protagonist's agency (laying the lens, wedging into the seam, inventorying the drawers) drives the resolution with visible cost (his own address now bound to the city). One clear tightening: the realization that his "stubbornness has always been a corridor" reframes prior compulsion as active choice. The escalation is meaningful under the Accumulative lens; the price is legible in the final binding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rest as addressable (plot under grass vs. water-and-stone ledger), distress signals as unhoused grief, and the undertaker's corridor-not-wall stubbornness. The broken lens as bottleneck/prism of grief that scatters mercy is a strong motif that reweights at closure when it "remembers how to hold light." The final image—"the city has mine too, written in water and stone where no tide unhouses it"—offers a resonant answer to the opening desire without stating a moral. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending. The piece invites reflection on reciprocal obligation and the cost of giving rest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person throughout, distance held, perceptual signature distinct (undertaker's idiom: "sexton," "plot under grass," "occupancy"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "chased stillness," "coordinates insist," "corridor, not a wall." Free indirect moments are clean. Minor dings: a few elevated phrases ("inadvertently stubborn," "reciprocal act") edge toward register drift from the otherwise tactile voice, and "folded velvet" in the opening feels slightly ornamental. Rhythm modulates well with pressure—short declaratives at the descent, longer syntactic waves during the catalog work. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of the descent mechanics) is legible under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative density throughout: "grief runs me the way water wears a channel," "Books rise from the silt, shaking off eels like tassels," "the pressure of the deep resolving into the weight someone calls home." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully. Deductions: several near-paraphrase loops ("the drowned never quite stop knocking" / "the drowned have been sending distress signals"; "to give rest a permanent address" recurs three times with minor variation). Overwriting in the middle third: figurative language appears in almost every sentence during the library work without clear pattern-teaching, edging toward density for its own sake ("spines bloom with names," "hair combed flat by currents," "rings that learned the circular grammar of waves"). A few stock metaphors: "thin code," "hollow crown." Elevated diction in peak beats slightly obscures immediacy. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation caps Q7 below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes undertaker, lighthouse lens, underwater library, and Morse distress into a coherent metaphor for unhoused grief. The library catalog as address system is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The transformation of "occupying impossible spaces" from undertaker's trick to literal act is original. The piece resists easy binaries and commits fully to its premise. Minor ding: the underwater-city-library motif echoes well-worn fantasy tropes (drowned civilizations, magical archives); the story transforms it through the undertaker's specific occupational lens and the Morse-as-cataloging conceit, but the setting itself is not wholly fresh. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression, patterned elision) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Bonus +0.2 for bold structural choices that cohere.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Undertaker present throughout, drives all key turns: opens package, follows coordinates, descends, lays lens, wedges into seam, inventories drawers, assigns addresses. Choices alter tactics and outcome. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage. Cost tied directly to character's final state (address now bound to the city). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens handled in opening (nested in rags), rides in lap during descent, hums/taps coordinates, laid on desk, protagonist wedges into its crack, cools and mends, placed above door in final beat. Reweighted meaning: bottleneck/prism → mended eye. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure (enables descent and shelving), closure linkage. Indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distress signals shape the dominant stake: drowned send Morse that bounces off collapsed catalog. The lens scatters their calls. Protagonist's work is to shelve each signal properly. Signals tap teeth, spell coordinates, drive descent, and are resolved when messages "find shelves whose spines bloom with names." Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage. Changes options and tactics on the page. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" framed early ("I go because I am inadvertently stubborn"), shown through refusal to ignore the tapping and choice to follow coordinates despite cost. Enables the descent and wedging action. Reappears when protagonist realizes "my stubbornness has always been a corridor, not a wall"—reprise reweights the trait. Two beats, some causal pressure, closure linkage via realization. Solid integration but the initial framing leans tell-heavy and the trait could be inferred from actions alone; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Revitalize" anchors the undertaker's work from the start ("My work is to revitalize rest") and drives the peak action: "I press until the messages no longer ricochet, but find shelves." The inventorying and assigning of addresses enacts revitalization. The lens "remembers how to hold light" as result. Early signal, multi-beat involvement (desk work, wedging, inventorying), causal pressure, closure linkage. The action is unique and irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's resolution. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" signaled as "the old undertaker's trick" mid-story, then enacted: "I wedge myself between the cracked lens and the watery light, slide into the blade-thin seam where breath and brine agree to share." The method enables the shelving of messages. One beat (the wedging), causal pressure (makes the resolution possible), closure linkage. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how the body fits the seam is asserted rather than grounded. Functional and essential but not fully embodied; solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Underwater library present throughout the second half: arches, shelves, catalog signs (Names Unrecovered, Routes That End), atrium desk where tides cross, drawers of tide-smoothed teeth. Setting supplies the catalog system that enables address-assignment. The library constrains action (skiff scrapes to halt, protagonist must navigate stacks) and charges the final image (city now holds his address). Multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe anchored by "After the mysterious package arrives" and sequenced through: shop opening, dusk hire of skiff, descent, library work, surfacing, return to shop. The sequence is clear and the progression from package to resolution structures the narrative. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the piece unfolds without a live clock pressing choices. Present and functional but replaceable with minor edits; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to give rest a permanent address" stated early, dramatized through the undertaker's opening reflection on buried sailors and the drowned who "never quite stop knocking." The descent and catalog work enact this desire. Friction appears when the protagonist realizes his work must extend to the underwater city and that giving rest will bind his own address to the city. Final line: "I wanted to give rest a permanent address, and now the city has mine too." Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, visible cost. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" appears in opening ("air holds a chased stillness like folded velvet") and returns in climax: "the water no longer rushes like a heart chased across rooftops. Instead it becomes a chased stillness, pursuit fading into rest." Tone modulates from tapping urgency (lens hums, taps teeth) to resolution (pressure resolving into weight). The reprise reweights the opening image and charges the final beat. Early signal, lyric payoff, closure linkage. Solid integration; the tone is coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
