<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is distinctive—bone setting as metaphor for healing stories, doubt as kindness—and micro-choices (easing the thrush, admitting the winter misjudgment) embody contradictory impulses. The relationship with Mara is functional but lightly sketched; her presence pressures the narrator to act but without deep status negotiation. The final choice to return the boy and tooth is motivated by the established desire to repair past error, though the cost (admitting wrongness to the father) is quieter than transformative. Embodied emotion is present ("pulse answered with a stubborn drum") but occasionally lapses into elevated abstraction ("catalog of proofs").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (reed body, tooth, sap map, fox healing) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator's stance shifts from clinical skeptic to listener who repairs both bones and belief. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat (narrator identity, river decoy, garden door). The closure lands with cost: the narrator carries the boy home and offers the father both tooth and apology, acknowledging the winter misjudgment with visible humility. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tooth opens the hedge and reveals the boy, reweighting the dominant stake from mystery-solving to relational repair. Minor causality question: the garden's mechanics (why it borrowed the boy, how the tooth functions as key) are taught through poetic assertion rather than dramatized discovery, but the Accumulative lens permits this.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden's physical elements—ivy-cleaved door, pear tree stitched with moths, root-staircase, tree-knuckle chamber—constrain the search and enable the descent. The tooth placed in the hedge fissure functions as a micro-setting object that charges the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's bone-setter lens ("rush-whisper where marrow ought to hum," "bark peeled back to reveal a shallow, root-boned map"). The setting shifts from riverbank to garden to underground chamber with clear transitions and coherent spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repair the winter misjudgment by finding the boy and restoring belief. The substitute body incites pursuit; the tooth discovery tightens by opening the hedge; the underground chamber deepens when the narrator heals the fox and earns the boy's trust. Agency is consistent: the narrator chooses to follow clues, ease the thrush, set the fox's leg, and walk the boy home. Cost is legible—admitting error to the father and relinquishing clinical certainty—but the escalation is gradual rather than urgent; the garden sequence unfolds more as revelation than conflict. No antagonist opposes; the pressure is interior and accumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bone-setting metaphor: repair requires listening, forgiveness of the map and myth, and turning mistakes into constellations. The tooth, fox healing, and final apology are concrete particulars that embody the thematic question without stating it. The closing image—bringing the tooth to the father and declaring "the garden had taught me to listen"—offers a resonant answer to the premise of doubt versus belief. The final paragraph risks slight over-articulation ("I remain a forgiving skeptic") but stops short of moralizing by rooting the claim in prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and distinctive, with elevated diction ("shrewdly innocent," "cleft in certainty," "country tale's wound") that reads intentional rather than affected. The narrator's perceptual signature—filtering events through bone-setting and balancing skepticism with kindness—remains consistent. Free indirect access to Mara and the boy is minimal; their speech is indirect summary rather than quoted dialogue. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I saw," "I felt") appear in the middle passage but do not dull immediacy. The prose stays within the narrator's lexicon, though a few constructions edge toward self-conscious lyricism ("rustles argue with breeze").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "mismatched twins," "bones ask to be believed," "cradle creaked with a stranger's weight," "laugh sounded like water finding its channel." In the garden descent and chamber beats, metaphor appears in nearly every sentence without escalating clarity or pressure—this reads as pattern-taught lyricism rather than overwriting, but it risks flattening momentum. A paraphrase loop occurs: "shrewdly innocent" is used identically for Mara (paragraph 7) and the boy (paragraph 28), blurring distinction. The final paragraph summarizes the narrator's stance rather than closing on image, slightly deflating propulsion. No major loops or scaffold, but information density could tighten in the reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of bone-setting, changeling lore, and the forgiving-skeptic frame is specific and non-obvious. The garden as listener and the tooth as key transform familiar fairy-tale material through the narrator's occupational lens. The fox-healing beat and the boy's gap-toothed smile are memorable particulars. The piece commits fully to its lyric-fabulist register and follows the garden's logic without retreat. Minor proximity question: "mistakes into constellations" echoes therapeutic self-help idiom, but the metaphor is grounded in the narrator's work. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic shards, poetic compression) heightens thematic resonance without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgiving skeptic is signaled in the opening, drives middle choices (following clues, easing the thrush, healing the fox), and crystallizes at closure when the narrator admits error to the father. The trait "forgives the map and the myth" shapes the final stance. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tooth appears when found under the pear tree, is traced against bark to reveal the sap map, placed in the hedge fissure as key, matched to the boy's gap, and brought to the father at closure. It narrows options (opens the hedge), enables tactics (map navigation), and charges the ending (weeping father, apology earned). Indispensable across three beats and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is named by the narrator in dialogue and embodied in the tension between clinical training and field lore. It shapes the narrator's willingness to descend into the garden and informs the thematic arc. Present at setup (opening doubt/hope), developed in the middle (tooth as bridge between worlds), and implicit at closure (listening restores the boy). Causal role in one major turn; lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied to Mara and later the boy, describing their knowledge of the garden's workings. Mara's trait enables the discovery (lifting the leaf, placing the tooth); the boy's parallel innocence mirrors hers. The trait constrains middle action (trusting Mara's guidance) but is used identically twice, reducing specificity. Present in setup and development; minor closure participation via the boy's demeanor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" is named explicitly ("I yearn to give the father back something more useful than an apology") and drives the narrator's pursuit from inciting incident through closure. The desire to repair the winter misjudgment motivates following the trail, descending into the garden, and walking the boy home. The action is essential to escalation and closure, though the verb itself is more label than dramatized friction. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bone setting is introduced as the narrator's occupation, practiced on the thrush mid-story, and used to heal the fox's crooked foreleg at the climax. The method earns the boy's trust and enables his return: "When the fox's joint slid home with a soft yes, the boy's shoulders dropped." It shapes two key beats and the resolution; removing it would collapse the narrator's credibility and the garden's test. Present in setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (time, attention, skill under pressure).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is the locus of all middle and climactic action. The ivy door, pear tree, sap map, hedge fissure, and underground chamber constrain navigation and enable discovery. The setting pressures choices (which path, where to place the tooth) and supplies the resources (fox, boy) that drive closure. Indispensable; the story's logic and stakes collapse without this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the substitute body is found" frames the inciting incident and establishes urgency (a missing boy, grief to be answered). The timeframe tightens the narrator's motive to act that night and anchors the reflective stakes (winter misjudgment, present repair). It does not create a live ticking clock during the garden sequence; elapsed time is elastic. Present in setup and informs closure motive, but middle development is loose. Functional causal role; one gate missing (middle pressure).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is voiced explicitly and dramatized through the narrator's admission of the winter error, the apology to the father, and the act of bringing the tooth. The desire is conflicted—pride versus humility, skepticism versus belief—and the cost is visible (relinquishing clinical authority). It drives the final choice and reweights the closure image. Present across setup (stated motive), development (sap map as constellation metaphor), and payoff (apology as transformation).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" coheres in the blend of old field lore and new clinic angles, the bone-setting metaphor, and the lyric-fabulist register. Tone modulates from clinical skepticism (opening) to wonder (garden descent) to humble repair (closure). The voice maintains elevated, pattern-taught diction throughout without tonal rupture. The tone charges the final image by framing apology and listening as both ancient and newly learned. Present across all three gates; coherent escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
