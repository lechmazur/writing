<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and concrete—finding her brother Fen through pulse-mapping—and her physicalized patience (kneeling until knees "forgot complaint") grounds her. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract; we see her listen to bark and ribs, but internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure is minimal. The final choice to move east feels more procedural than conflicted, and no visible cost forecloses a path on the page—she gathers her tools and leaves, which reads as continuation rather than renunciation or decisive change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is and why she's here emerges gradually through散fragments, with "flash-paper alchemist" and her mother's songs arriving late. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern-dense, layered imagery building toward a final map-reading—but closure is a Charged Poise at best: she "tucked the map into her coat" and "trudged east." Cost is oblique (leaving the tripod, the implicit prior years of searching) rather than felt in the final image. The ending reconfigures stillness into "road she could finally call home," but the reconfiguration lacks on-page friction or visible price paid in that moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard is vivid and specific: hoarfrost on skeletal branches, leftover apples under snow, the aurora overhead. Spatial choreography is clean (grid between trees, tripod of broom handles, ice blocks). The setting constrains her work—she must clear snow, balance the plate on ice, listen to bark—and the orchard's memory (her mother's harvest songs) charges the final image of "less dead" trees. The body and tools (charred gloves, canvas bag, press bar) ground her actions throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding Fen via pulse-mapping—is signaled early and shapes all actions. Pressure is coherent but does not escalate: she unpacks, arranges, etches, lights flash paper, prints, and leaves in a steady accumulation without reversal or tightening choice. The "three pulses braided like paths" moment deepens her method, but no visible cost or narrowed option appears on the page. The protagonist's agency is active (she executes each step), yet coincidence and prior preparation do most of the work; the orchard "rewarded quiet" rather than testing her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: heartbeats as maps, safekept starlight, discarded items forming constellations, "nothing wasted stays wasted." The ending image—"braid of heartbeats tightened into a road"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the alchemist's arc is more demonstration than transformation; she executes a plan rather than confronting a thematic question under pressure. The line "light remembered could be shared" tilts toward thematic echo, though embedded in action rather than stated as moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register: "flash-paper alchemist," "safekept starlight," "moving stillness." Perceptual signature is consistent—poetic compression, body-as-instrument ("listened with her ear against bark, against her own ribs"). Diction remains cohesive under pressure, though the heightened register occasionally distances the reader from immediate sensation. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression ("Small salvations," "tiny channels with a sewing needle") is legible and voice-motivated, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("moving stillness," "pulse could draw a road," "winter riverbed"). Some adjacent lines restate without adding pressure: "She had learned to hear his far heartbeat in storms, a faint tapping that visited her bones like a traveling knock" closely echoes the prior map-via-pulse conceit. A few filter verbs ("She could almost hear") and elevated constructions ("memory enough to mark beats on the air") slightly dull immediacy. Information density is high; no major loops or scaffolding, but the relentless metaphorical texture risks overwriting in a piece where clarity of action matters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of pulse cartography, safekept starlight, and discarded-item constellation is specific and non-obvious, with the illustration plate as navigational relic offering a fresh angle. Emotional specificity—finding Fen through "shared rhythm"—grounds the fantastical premise. However, the overall arc (journey to find lost sibling via magical map) is familiar, and the alchemist's execution is competent rather than risky; no bold structural choice or perspectival gambit heightens stakes. The ending feels inevitable in its lyricism but not in its causal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flash-paper alchemist is present throughout and makes all key choices: unpacking, arranging the grid, etching channels, lighting flash paper from wrist/throat/tree, printing the map, reading it, and heading east. However, most choices are procedural execution of a prior plan rather than under-pressure decisions that alter tactics. She demonstrates skill and patience but faces no reversal that tests her; the orchard "rewarded quiet" rather than forcing a trade-off. Her decision to move east is enabled by the map she created, but the creation itself unfolds without friction or cost visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate appears in setup (heirloom with navigational veins etched on reverse), development (fitted on tripod, channels filled with starlight, used to swallow flash-paper pulses), and closure (pressed to wax seal, rolled with press bar to print the map). It enables the central action and its specificity—copper plate with summers on one side, scratched channels on the other—matters. However, its meaning does not shift; it functions as a tool throughout without charged reprise or reweighted significance at the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Safekept starlight is introduced late (paragraph 11 of ~35), though signaled obliquely in "jar of safekept starlight" earlier. It is used once: unstoppered, it flows into the plate's channels "like milk, but colder" and enables the pulse-mapping. The concept is vivid but mechanically deployed—it solves a problem (how to conduct light through the map) it did not help create, and its properties are not tested or constrained. It does not reappear at closure or shape the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Demonstrates patience physically" is embodied on the page: she kneels "until the knees forgot complaint," lines each shard "with her slow breath and gloved fingertips," listens with ear against bark/ribs, holds still until "frost formed on her lashes and did not drop." The trait constrains her method—listening and alignment require stillness—and the orchard "rewarded quiet" with sounds. However, no visible cost or trade-off arises from this patience; it enables success without friction, making the constraint feel more thematic than conflicting.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Seal" appears twice: she seals the starlight jar with beeswax and presses the plate's legend to the wax "as if the orchard agreed to keep the secret safe." The first seal is procedural (conserving remaining light); the second is more charged, linking plate, wax, and orchard in a pact. However, neither seal creates a major turn or alters options. The action is present and thematically apt, but easily replaceable with "close" or "secure" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Creating patterns with discarded items" is signaled early and executed in detail: rusty hoops, apple crates, torn net, bottle caps, wire teeth, broken pruning shears become "a patient constellation" in a grid cleared between trees. The method matters—each placement "asked for listening"—and the constellation is left behind at the end, suggesting a residual charge. However, the pattern's causal role is unclear; it does not enable the map-printing or constrain her choices. It reads as ritual preparation rather than a mechanism that shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is present from the opening and permeates every beat: skeletal branches, hoarfrost, leftover apples, the rim above, the packing shed's discarded tools. It supplies resources (the discarded items, the old press bar) and shapes her actions (clearing snow, listening to bark, balancing on ice). The setting's memory—her mother's harvest songs—motivates her return and charges the ending: "the orchard seemed less dead, as if the plate had printed warmth onto bark." Micro-setting (body, tools, ground) and macro (crater, rim, aurora) constrain and enable throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"While the world holds its breath" appears once in paragraph 7 as poetic frame, then recurs obliquely in "the world, if it breathed at all, did so in her cupped hands" near the end. The timeframe suggests urgency (finding Fen "before the white noise took his name"), but no live clock or deadline tightens her decisions on the page. Actions unfold in ritual sequence without time pressure altering tactics. The phrase is thematically resonant but does not constrain or escalate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To translate heartbeats into maps" is the protagonist's explicit motive, stated early ("translate heartbeats into maps before the blood forgot its paths") and dramatized throughout: she lights flash paper from wrist/throat/tree pulses, the plate swallows them, three pulses braid, she reads the crossings "as she would a pulse." The final image—"braid of heartbeats tightened into a road"—closes the loop. However, the desire is not conflicted; she pursues it steadily without friction between want and cost. The motive shapes all actions but is not tested or deepened by opposition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Moving stillness" is named in the opening line and closing line, framing the piece. Tone is coherent: hushed, layered, contemplative, with sensory compression ("knuckles of bark creaking," "frost formed on her lashes") and elevated diction. It modulates subtly—stillness dominates the listening beats, then kinetic verbs ("trudged," "tightened") charge the ending. The tone supports the Accumulative lens and the final reconfiguration of stillness into road. It does not shift sharply with pressure, but the consistent texture amplifies the closure image.</comment>
