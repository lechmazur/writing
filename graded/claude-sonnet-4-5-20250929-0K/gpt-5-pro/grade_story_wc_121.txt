<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is dense and image-driven, with embodied tension ("the tablet was my map and my mirror… warm as a pulse"). The protagonist's arc from floating resistance to grounded arrival is earned, and the final choice to walk "like everyone else" carries visible cost. However, the middle beats lean heavily on abstract self-reflection ("versions of myself staring through the balusters") without sufficient contradictory impulses acting in scene; the guard encounter and mother-memory feel more allegorical than psychologically particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (viaduct, rain, Lio's floating ability, tablet). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring images (arches, rain, lamp's "darkening brightness") and a pattern of reflect-rotate-invert that culminates in the protagonist's decision to fall and accept gravity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to arrival): Lio releases resistance, the arches "stitched themselves," and he walks home grounded with visible cost (loss of defiance, acceptance of mortality). One meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses the "staircase with the weakest echo" and later decides to fall, narrowing options under the tablet's procedural rules. Minor issue: the guard and alternate-self encounters read more as symbolic stations than causal pressure points, slightly softening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct after rain is vivid and specific: slick stones, halos thinning, puddles as doors. The tablet functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (its runes glow, warm, spell rules) and charging the final image when Lio dries it and reads the single-line promise. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (arches, balusters, canal), though the procedural maze's internal geography (chambers, landing, central span) occasionally blurs under the lyric compression. The rain modulates from "single notes" to cessation, marking emotional closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: conquer the labyrinth of self or "be divided by it until the stones forgot me." One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio chooses the weakest-echo stair and later decides to fall, forecloses floating as escape. The procedural-generation rules (reflect, rotate, invert) create coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. The final act—releasing resistance and accepting gravity—reweights options with visible cost (end of periodic restarts, acceptance of linear mortality). The guard and alternate-self encounters add thematic texture but lack sharp tactical friction; they feel more like ritual checkpoints than reversals that narrow options through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: gravity as resistance, falling as acceptance, the tablet's evolving runes as self-knowledge earned through procedural trial. The "darkening brightness" and periodically eternal loop ground the abstract question of self-conquest in concrete, recurring motifs. The ending resists moralizing: Lio walks home "like everyone else," the world "learned how to keep me only once"—a quiet, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without stating a lesson. No thematic echo or sermon; the final image (viaduct dimming, clear hush) offers resonance through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and voice-particular: compressed syntax, dense metaphor ("rain had slowed to single notes, spaced like decisions I was afraid to play"), perceptual signature that notices light, weight, echoes. The piece teaches its lyric-compression pattern early and sustains it; elision is purposeful (we infer the procedural trials rather than watch each step). Slight register drift in the guard exchange ("what right I had to float past my sins" / "borrowed from a future that needed this corridor") reads more oracular than Lio's established idiom, but the effect is brief and the internal voice recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, vivid compression ("lamp cast a halo that grew thinner with each minute, a darkening brightness that felt like breath fading"). A few synonym-adjacent phrases cluster mid-piece ("reflect, rotate, invert" / "reflected on the boy… rotated the scene… inverted the guilt") in template cadence, and "periodically eternal" recurs as label without fresh embodiment in two beats (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or scaffold in peak beats. Rhythm accelerates into the fall and slows cleanly at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and land the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity-defiance, procedural-generation labyrinth, and "periodically eternal" time-loop offers a specific, non-generic frame. The tablet as both map and mirror, the mother-counting-tiles memory, and the final choice to walk rather than float are particular to this voice and world. The risk—dense lyric compression, abstract self-encounters, procedural ritual—heightens thematic stakes without obscuring the closure effect. The piece avoids template emotional beats and commits fully to its premise. A small deduction for the alternate-self tableau, which trends symbolic-convenient rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's gravity-defying is signaled early (floats "thumb's width above the slick arch"), constrains middle choices (floating past the guard, choosing to fall), and is renounced at closure ("I floated only long enough to thank the habit; then I walked home"). Three beats, closure linkage, visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tablet is handled early (pocket, warm as pulse), middle (touched, runes whispered, warmed until pulsed, glowed with rules), and at closure (retrieved, dried, runes now spelled a single line). Its procedural rules narrow options ("reflect, rotate, invert") and its final state charges the ending. Three beats, high causal pressure, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape the premise ("periodically eternal, condemned to restart and recall") and generate the alternate-self encounters. The concept constrains the protagonist's stake (conquer or be divided) and the final fall "stitched" the arches into "a single road," ending the cycle. Setup early, development in the balusters beat, closure payoff. One meaningful tightening tied to this concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is introduced early as constraint (reset to same hour, never dying/arriving), recurs as theme-label mid-piece, and returns at closure ("For a breath the world became periodically eternal… because I finally arrived"). The trait shapes the dominant stake but is declared more than dramatized in cost at the ending. Two beats, lyric reprise, modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Retrace" is signaled early (tablet requires retracing mother's steps), executed on-page ("I moved as she had, and where her doubt had paused, a stair formed"), and returns at closure via "crossed the stones… for the first and last time." The action enables the procedural escape and charges the final grounded walk. Two beats, causal role, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Procedural generation is introduced early ("I could only enter through procedural generation, seeding the maze with my heartbeat and breath"), governs the middle trials ("reflect, rotate, invert, then proceed as if forgiven"), and its completion is marked at closure ("the maze would stay closed if I kept walking"). The method shapes tactics and the resolution. Setup, development, payoff; high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The viaduct is anchored at opening ("glowing viaduct after rain, where the stones still remembered light"), provides tactical resources (arches multiply, puddles become doors, balusters frame alternate selves), and charges closure ("I crossed the stones… the viaduct dimmed, its darkening brightness complete"). Three beats, strong causal and atmospheric pressure, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is introduced as the waiting-point ("I had come to wait between the drop and the ripple, the smallest gate in the world"), recurs at the procedural climax ("I aligned every reflection and waited, precisely between the drop and the ripple"), and frames closure ("A ripple carried the lamp's tired light down the canal"). Lyric resonance; the timeframe constrains the final alignment choice. Two beats, modest causal pressure, closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("I was here to conquer the labyrinth of self, or be divided by it") and dramatized in the choice to fall and release resistance at closure. The stakes are felt throughout (periodic restarts, alternate selves, guard's challenge). Setup, implicit middle friction, closure payoff. Friction between floating (want) and grounding (need) creates tension and visible cost at the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is introduced at opening ("halo that grew thinner with each minute, a darkening brightness that felt like breath fading"), recurs through lamp-beats and charged images, and lands at closure ("the viaduct dimmed, its darkening brightness complete"). The tone modulates from suspended tension to grounded hush, charging the final image. Three beats, strong thematic and atmospheric pressure, closure participation.</comment>
