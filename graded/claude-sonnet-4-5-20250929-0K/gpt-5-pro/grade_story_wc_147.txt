<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through concrete sensory details (helmet, gauges, netting) and micro-choices under pressure—the decision to stop kicking and "let the sea hold me" feels earned and character-specific. The mother's teaching about vessels becomes a lived motive that shapes action. Minor slip: the emotional register occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("lonesome splendor," "patient saints") that feels imposed rather than emerging from the diver's immediate crisis state, though this remains controlled enough not to break immersion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (signal, hush, vial) build toward a final image that reweights the opening coordinates into song. Closure arrives on the page with visible cost ("turn down my oxygen," choosing to stay still while the wave passes) and a Resonant Reconfiguration—the distress signal becomes an offering. Orientation anchors clearly (underwater temple, diver alone) and the tightening from snagged net to altar discovery to transmission is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is not postcard description; it constrains movement (cables snag, net traps, anemones guard) and charges the final image with accumulated texture. Micro-setting details—filigree netting, coralized steps, silver air pockets—are filtered through the POV's professional attention and urgency. The body in the suit and the transmitter grill function as tools that enable the climactic broadcast. One small miss: the "listening gods" reliefs hover near decoration rather than pressing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the vial to harness remembering) is signaled early and sustained. The net-snare forces a reversal—panic versus deliberate stillness—that narrows options with visible cost (dwindling oxygen). The final choice to broadcast the hush sacrifices personal reserve for a fragile bridge, forecloses ascent, and shows a price paid on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, this single decisive tightening and cost are sufficient; no multiple reversals are required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (the ephemeral can be kept and carried if the right vessel is chosen) emerges through action—mother's fog jars, the vial, the transmitter—without thesis statement. The ending reweights the distress signal from plea to gift, a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the "gathered hush" as pressure rather than sound, and the diver's final line to her mother ("good work, sailor") carries earned weight. No moralizing; the resonance is built from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—technical details (gauges, fins, oxygen) filter through lyric compression ("thin metallic syllables," "hawk tightening its claws on its own legs"). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Small strain: under peak physical stress (net entanglement, low oxygen) the diction occasionally elevates into metaphoric density ("marionette," "scalloped pillars," "filigree of netting that time had gilded") that feels slightly over-calibrated for crisis cognition, though it remains voice-consistent and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the net "caught me and the transmitter both" advances plot and metaphor). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence across high-pressure beats—"hawk tightening its claws on its own legs," "a gathered hush made visible, breathing in place like a sleeping animal," "doors to swing where there had been walls"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying a −0.5 deduction in this category. The closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of distress signal as broadcast vessel for memory is specific and non-obvious; removing the vial-to-transmitter linkage would break the story's logic. The temple setting and lyric compression create a fresh angle on underwater retrieval narratives. Risk-taking (heavy metaphoric texture, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "forgotten temple / artifact retrieval" frame remains a recognizable adventure template, though the thematic transformation lifts it above derivative execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present from the opening line. Drives the net-snare reversal (stops kicking, unsnarls deliberately), retrieves the vial, and executes the climactic transmission choice. The decision to turn down oxygen and stay still while broadcasting is causally active and shapes the ending with visible cost. All three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Established early as the goal object, handled on the altar in the anemone nest, opened to release the hush, held to the transmitter grill, then tucked into the suit as "a heart outside my heart." The vial's properties (touches memories, milky swirl, liquid light) enable the broadcast and charge the final image. Irreplaceable; removing it collapses the story's logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening line and woven throughout: air pockets as "gathered hush made visible," the vial's opening releases a "hush" that "touches memories," and the signal becomes "the hush itself into the waiting dark." The concept shapes the protagonist's tactic (broadcast feeling, not just coordinates) and charges the ending. All gates met; strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "touches memories" attribute is not merely claimed; it is demonstrated on the page when the vial is opened and "the hush rose... coaxing doors to swing where there had been walls," triggering the mother's voice and childhood sensory recall. This enables the broadcast tactic and constrains the diver's choice to stay still during transmission. Cost is legible: turning down oxygen to preserve the fragile bridge. Irreplaceable trait that drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The unsnarling occupies the story's central reversal: panic would tighten the net, so the protagonist overrides instinct, stops kicking, breathes deliberately, and traces knot logic until freed. This action is causally necessary to reach the altar and vial; swapping it would require structural rewrite. Present in setup (cables snag), executed in the middle beat with detailed micro-choices, and its lesson (stillness under pressure) echoes in the final broadcast choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Signaled early in the mother's teaching (jars of fog, boxes of warmth) and dramatized in the net-snare beat: "To live, I had to unsnarl the mess by overriding instinct, undoing the fierce lessons of cold water and dwindling time that screamed ascend now." The method recurs at closure when the diver turns down oxygen and chooses stillness to preserve the broadcast. Shapes two key choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple is not scenery; it pressures every move. Cables braid the approach and snag fins, the net traps both diver and transmitter, coralized steps and anemones guard the altar, and silver air pockets become the "gathered hush" that the vial releases. The setting provides the constraint (net), the resource (vial on altar), and the atmospheric charge (drowned columns, "listening gods") that shapes the final broadcast image. Irreplaceable; the closure would fail in open water.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Time pressure is established early ("My gauges shouted the numbers that end journeys") and tightens throughout: net-snare consumes oxygen, retrieval and transmission require rationed air, and the final choice is explicit: "As time runs short, I turn down my oxygen." The dwindling clock forces the stillness tactic and charges the cost of staying to complete the broadcast. Live, tracked constraint that alters tactics and costs at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized from the opening: "I came here alone to harness the ephemeral, the way my mother taught me." The desire drives the dive, sustains the search despite gauge warnings, and shapes the final broadcast choice—not escape, but transmission of the hush. Friction between the ephemeral goal and survival cost is on the page: "choosing to stay very still while the wave passes through, so the fragile bridge does not shake apart." All gates met with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: "lonesome splendor" opens the piece, darkens during the net-snare panic ("a hawk tightening its claws on its own legs"), and resurfaces transformed in the final line ("I answer into the lonesome splendor, knowing the ocean will carry it where I cannot"). The tone charges the closure image, reweighting isolation as offering. Diction and rhythm support the tonal shift from distress to transmission without breaking voice.</comment>
