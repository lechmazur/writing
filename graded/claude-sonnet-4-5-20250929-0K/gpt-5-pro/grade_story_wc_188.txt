<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" is clear and drives his methodical setup, but his interiority remains largely opaque—we see him chant, smile, and measure, yet contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene. Mara's cousin's disappearance adds secondary pressure, but her choice to light the fuse reads more as participation than as a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending gesture (packing slowly, "serious playfulness") suggests endurance rather than transformation, yet no prior internal conflict is dramatized enough to make that renunciation earn its weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lio prepares, launches, and the town's despair lifts incrementally through patterned imagery (chanting, mosaic instructions, echo-answering-echo). Orientation anchors who/where/when early (fortress at dusk, Lio the designer, "children had started to count their breaths"). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—Lio and Mara walking the ramparts with "grave smiles" after the display—crystallizes their stance against despair, and the keeper's acknowledgment ("not one star had returned, but the faces below were bright") reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual and felt (no literal stars, only invented cousins of light), though the price is more implicit than vividly embodied in a single decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming fortress, ivy-clad walls, and mosaic note provide vivid spatial anchors that guide Lio's choices (placement of mortars, tuning sound to corridors). The "hush of a night with no stars" tightens urgency and charges the final image when artificial blooms replace absent celestial ones. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (charcoal "like river silt," fire "like a memory deciding finally to speak"), though some figurative language leans decorative rather than constraint-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling hope in a starless, grief-stricken town—is signaled early and pressure coheres through Lio's preparation, Mara's vigil, and the keeper's whispered urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when a gust startles the west wall and Lio alters trajectories through "ambient awareness," narrowing options under environmental pressure. The final volley ("silent bouquet that opened like a hand") reweights the outcome with visible communal response, though the cost remains more conceptual (no literal stars) than a sharp trade-off or forfeited path for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely from the contrast between absent stars and invented fire-cousins: courage versus copies, argument against despair through human artifice. The mosaic's patient music and the town's hummed steps at the end offer a resonant, non-literal answer to hopelessness without stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture (Mara's kerosene-knot rosette, Lio's slow packing) and the keeper's whispered lines, avoiding didactic summary. Minor slips toward abstraction ("gravity of hopelessness," "articulation") nudge the prose toward theme-statement, but the ending image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Lio is mostly stable, with perceptual filters ("serious playfulness," chanting as metronome) establishing voice. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("tesserae," "articulation," "ambient awareness") that reads more authorial than character-bound, especially under pressure. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("silence had grown too loud here") with modest subtext. Figurative density is high and occasionally stacks without clear POV motivation ("gravity of hopelessness," "patient stones"), flattening the narrator's perceptual signature during peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("luminous seeds that hovered slow as moths"), but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without respite, creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, yet template cadence emerges in repeated structures ("he chants while walking… she twirled unlit flame"; "filter… filtering… filter"). Register drift into poetic abstraction ("argument against despair," "articulation," "ledger of what it could carry") occurs frequently, obscuring concrete action. Line-level clarity is adequate, but overwriting in high-pressure beats (the launch sequence) reduces momentum and information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—fireworks as communal ritual against despair, guided by a mosaic note—offers a fresh synthesis of grief, artifice, and hope. The "fire spinner's kerosene rag knot" and the ambient-awareness method add specificity, though the transformation from template (hopeful outsider brings light) is modest. The ending avoids didactic resolution by acknowledging no literal stars return, yet "the faces below were bright" reweights the premise with earned nuance. Risk-taking in tone and structure (lyric accumulation, serious playfulness) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lio is present throughout, driving setup (mixing stars, placing mortars), adapting mid-launch (altering trajectories when wind gusts), and concluding with slow packing that embodies endurance. His choices shape at least two beats (preparation, adjustment) and the ending image of "grave smiles" on the ramparts. Early signal is strong; causal pressure is moderate (adjustment under wind, not a decisive fork); closure linkage is solid. No single sharp cost tied uniquely to his designer identity, but his role is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot appears in two beats: Mara's introduction ("dark as an unspoken thought") and the ending when she "tied the fire spinner's kerosene rag knot into a little rosette" and tucks it into her belt. The second mention reweights it as a memento of flame and effort, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Early signal is present; closure participation is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mosaic note is introduced in the second beat, provides specific instructions ("place flame where ivy clung, to tune sound to the twisted corridor"), and guides Lio's choices throughout the launch ("mosaic's directions revealed themselves with each bloom"). It shapes multiple beats (setup, mid-launch echo-answering-echo, final hush symbol) and charges the ending when townsfolk hum "new steps that matched the mosaic's once silent metronome." Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is direct; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Chanting appears in three mentions (opening, "he chants while walking and she twirled," "Between volleys he kept chanting"), but it never constrains a choice or incurs a visible cost. It adds texture and rhythm to Lio's characterization, yet remains swappable with any habitual behavior. No causal pressure, no closure linkage, and no specificity that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Filter" appears four times: Lio filters charcoal, the keeper asks to "filter fear from breath," Lio and townsfolk "filtering sobs into breath," and "echoes filter down to embers." The term shapes the preparation beat (charcoal sift) and the communal emotional arc (sobs to breath), recurring with thematic charge at closure. Early signal is present; causal involvement is moderate (preparation enables launch); closure linkage is strong via the final echo-filtering image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named twice: Lio "practiced decision by sensing, choosing routes and angles through ambient awareness" and later uses it to alter trajectories when wind gusts. It enables one mid-launch adjustment (a tactical choice under pressure), but its mechanics remain abstract and the term arrives late (second third). No setup, modest development, no closure participation. Swappable with "intuition" or "instinct" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk is anchored early, provides spatial structure (parapet, courtyards, turrets), and the ivy/lichen guide Lio's placement choices per the mosaic. The setting constrains tactics (corridors shape sound, walls catch wind) and charges the ending image (ramparts walk). Early signal is strong; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is solid. The dusk timeframe itself is static post-opening, but the fortress as micro-setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "hush of a night with no stars" is introduced mid-story, frames the launch's stakes (absence of natural light), and reappears at closure when "not one star had returned" but artificial blooms suffice. It tightens the conceptual cost (no literal restoration) and charges the ending image. Setup is late but clear; no live clock that alters moment-to-moment tactics; closure participation is thematic and strong.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated early and drives Lio's entire arc (methodical preparation, adaptation, slow packing). It is dramatized through his actions and the townsfolk's response, though no on-page moment shows Lio torn between conflicting desires or incurring a sharp personal cost. The final "tender concession" implies endurance, but the friction between want and cost remains abstract rather than embodied in a decisive choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" is named twice and modeled throughout: Lio "worked with serious playfulness, smiling not to mock sorrow but to persuade it into a chair," and the ending describes "grave smiles carrying that serious playfulness." The tone modulates with pressure (methodical setup, urgent adjustment, quiet closure) and charges the final image by holding paradox without collapse. Coherent across turns; closure linkage is strong; the tonal stance is indispensable to the thematic effect.</comment>
