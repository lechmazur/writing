<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior life is textured and embodied—"wistfully pragmatic" drives micro-choices, and the father's memory anchors present action without summaries. Contradictory impulses surface when the protagonist guards hope yet leaves it for others to trip over, showing complexity. The final choice to install the light is earned through prior beats (waiting for the petal, retrieving the tooth, nudging the mesh), and the cost is legible: vulnerability exposed on the roof, inheritance risked. Minor slips: some emotional states are labeled rather than dramatized under peak stress, and secondary characters remain functional but thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the light net transforms the stairwell, Theo walks alone, Mrs. Gallo hums, and the narrator's hush becomes a harbor—options and meaning are crystallized with felt cost (the tooth rusts, the rosebush is emptied). Orientation is clean by ~100 words, and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated motifs (rhythm of oars, harbor light, hush, tooth) and a cadence shift in the final third reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening: the padlock yields, enabling the installation. Cost is visible in the tooth's future rust and the emptied rosebush, charging the final image. A single minor causality hop—how the mesh was fabricated is told, not shown—keeps this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harbor, fire escape, stairwell, and roof are spatially coherent and pressure the protagonist's plan: the padlock blocks access, tar holds the tooth, the transom permits light passage. The gauge tooth (micro-object as setting) constrains the key choice—opening the lock—and charges the final image with its promise to rust. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "tar that keeps yesterday's sun," "smell like the hull." The threshold from stairwell gloom to rooftop spill drives Theo's crossing and Mrs. Gallo's hum. No occupational excess; canal-lock detail anchors character without sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reflect light to gentling the building's fear—signals early and tightens once: the padlock yields to patient measure, enabling installation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through recurring rhythm (oars in water) and a cadence shift when Theo walks alone and Mrs. Gallo hums. Agency is decision and action: climbing, opening, guiding the mesh. The cost is legible—tooth will rust, rosebush emptied, hope left exposed—and forecloses retreat. One reversal: the stuck door becomes passage. No second major turn is needed at this length, but a slightly higher mid-scene complication would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—steadiness instilled in uncertain systems, gentling without shouting—emerges through action: the father's canal locks, the patient gauge, the mesh that does not shout. The final image (hush becomes harbor, thorns catching seams) reweights prior material without stating a moral. "Protected vulnerability" and "wistfully pragmatic" are enacted in choices, not asserted. Subtext operates in gesture: Theo's shoulder searching light as rope, Mrs. Gallo crossing herself then humming. The rosebush's empty thorns still speaking is a resonant close. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and consistent: selective perception (harbor spills like milk, tar keeps sun), compression without opacity, and a patient, specific idiom ("reminds the lock of opening"). Psychic distance stays close; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven: "No saints, just angles and a tooth with an honest bite." Filter verbs ("I feel my heart move") are voice-motivated and sparse. The narrator's perceptual signature—watching ripples hold breath, seeing light as promise—remains stable under pressure. Minor slip: a few reflective beats in the first third slightly flatten urgency before the climb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("light like milk," "hush like fog"). Information density is high—lines anchor image, motive, and memory simultaneously. Two slips lower the score: "quivering hush" recurs across multiple beats without escalating meaning (paraphrase loop), and occasional elevated diction ("instill steadiness in waters") drifts slightly from the established idiom. No grammar errors. The final image—thorns catching seams—propels without muddle. Apply −0.4 for the loop and register drift, capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—fire-escape gardener using a lockmaster's tooth to redirect moonlight via a mirror net—feels specific and non-obvious, and the father's canal-lock discipline grounds the method. The metaphor of light as gentling and the rhythm-of-oars refrain are purposeful, not ornamental. Risk: lyric density and elliptical reflection are taught early and pay off at closure. However, the "reflecting light into dark corners to soften fear" motif echoes common metaphors for hope/intervention, and the transformation does not fully escape that template. Strong within-band freshness, but the core arc (lonely caretaker instills comfort) follows familiar beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in first line. Development: waits for petal, retrieves tooth, climbs, opens lock, installs net, guides mesh—multiple decisions alter tactics. Closure: on roof adjusting net when effects unfold below; final touch of rosebush stem crystallizes stance. Causal pressure: all key turns trace to protagonist choice. Irreplaceability: the occupation (fire-escape gardener) anchors spatial access and the installation skill. Cost: hope left exposed, inheritance risked. Two gates plus strong closure linkage and causal pressure place this in the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early via father's memory. Development: used twice—first to open padlock (patient angle), then as anchor for the net (ridges bite tar). Closure: present in final image, will rust but tonight bright as star. Causal pressure: without it, door stays locked and net cannot be hung. Irreplaceability: its gauge function (patient measure) and physical form (ridges, chain) matter. Cost: rust signals future loss, charging the closure. Three gates, two beats, closure linkage, and cost connection push this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase, first line "quivering hush," and recurs across beats (harbor hush, rosebush trembles, net rattles "a quivering hush made of glass breath"). Development: shapes atmosphere and tone but does not constrain a specific choice; closest is the narrator's interior stance ("hush gathers against my ribs"). Closure: "hush inside me becomes a harbor" reweights meaning. Lyric reprise qualifies under the allowance, but the concept remains more thematic than tactical. Two gates (setup, closure); no middle choice directly turned by it. Ceiling ~6.3 for lyric-resonance path.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I am wistfully pragmatic, which means I hope while my hands keep moving." Development: drives the plan (hoping via scraps and gauge) and the guarded-hope stance ("I have learned to guard my hope so it can stay / Yet I leave some of it where people will trip gently over it"). Closure: watching effects while still adjusting mesh embodies the trait. Causal pressure: the trait enables persistence under constraint. Cost: hope exposed, vulnerability unprotected. Three gates, one primary choice, closure linkage, cost. Solid mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "I want to instill light into dark corners" and "I want to instill something like that in people." Development: protagonist instills patience in the mesh flutter, father wanted to instill steadiness in waters—the action recurs and drives tactics. Closure: "instill" echoes in the ending beats and the light "finds the mouth, slides down, and settles." Causal pressure: the entire plan is to instill gentling. Irreplaceability: the verb's dual meaning (to place drop by drop, to impart gradually) charges both the physical and thematic layers. Three gates, multiple beats, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: father "called that rhythm a promise you keep with your shoulders." Development: "Each motion follows the rhythm of oars in water so the metal stays calm" (opening lock), "I feel my heart move with the rhythm of oars in water, steady and near" (watching effects). Closure: harbor answers with "small waves clinking, a far buoy counting its breaths" and the method's cost is implied in the inherited discipline. Causal pressure: the method enables the patient lock-opening. Three gates, recurs across two beats, shapes tactics. Strong 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: first line, "luminous harbor by moonlight." Development: harbor supplies the light resource the protagonist redirects; moonlight coaxed from harbor steers home; harbor answers with wave discipline. Closure: "I whisper thanks to the water for lending its discipline to the sky." Causal pressure: without harbor light, no installation; the setting provides the means. Irreplaceability: the water's steadiness mirrors the father's oar rhythm and anchors theme. Three gates, but the harbor remains somewhat atmospheric rather than a micro-constraint that alters on-page tactics. Mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, I will begin." Development: "It loosens, sighs, and falls" triggers the climb. Closure: "The old rosebush waits empty, but the bush is not done speaking. / Its thorns shine, catching a seam of night." The timeframe establishes threshold but does not create urgent ticking-clock pressure; the wait is brief and the petal's drop is more symbolic gate than live constraint. Three gates (setup, trigger, closure reprise), but the time element does not tighten tactics under duress. Mid-6s under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "I want to reflect light into dark corners until they flinch and soften." Development: the entire plan dramatizes this desire; friction arises in guarding hope ("protected vulnerability") yet leaving it exposed. Closure: light settles where fear nested, Theo walks, Mrs. Gallo hums—desire fulfilled with cost (hope left vulnerable, tooth rusting). Causal pressure: motivation drives every beat. Cost: the tradeoff between guarding and exposing hope is felt. Three gates, strong closure linkage, visible friction and cost. High 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "wistfully pragmatic" and "I have learned to guard my hope so it can stay" establish the protected-vulnerability stance early. Development: tone modulates from watching hush to climbing with "balance he taught me" (protected) to "I leave some of it where people will trip gently over it" (vulnerability). Closure: "The tooth will rust someday, but tonight it is bright as star" crystallizes the tone—acceptance of future loss while acting now. Coherent through turns, charges final image. Three gates, tonal consistency under pressure, closure linkage. Mid-to-high 7s.</comment>
