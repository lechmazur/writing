<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's interiority is carefully rendered through concrete perceptual filters ("roots burrow through old atlases," "mushrooms foxed the leather") and a consistent stance of witnessing without verdict. However, the narrator remains largely observational; their choices—reinforcing the swan, planting cuttings—are responses rather than initiating pressure. The child and refugees are handled in summary, not scene, so relationships as crucible never materializes. Internal contradiction is minimal; the keeper's stance is coherent but static, limiting agency-driven transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, accretive pattern early (vines, stone arches, crumbling peace) and deepens through recurring images (swan, refuge, regenerative silence). Orientation anchors promptly (overgrown library, catacombs). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final paragraph crystallizes the keeper's deepened task ("from writing to tending") and reweights "crumbling peace" as a patient, future-bearing posture. Cost is conceptual and felt—the keeper's hands "learn to balance" with a buckling world—though the image is slightly diffuse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vaults thrum and the keeper chooses to wait, letting transformation arrive on its own time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, multi-sensory, and functionally integrated: vines, stone arches that "sweat minerals," mushrooms editing leather, and the obsidian refuge that "kneels to mirror and forget." The library's collapsing architecture constrains choices (toppled encyclopedias as shelter, roots drafting tunnels) and the swan-enabled navigation turns setting into a tactical puzzle. The final image of planted cuttings greening broken spines charges the closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition to the refuge and back can feel slightly unmoored in time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to witness and tend change without imposing verdict. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vaults thrum and the keeper chooses patience over the swan's eager door-opening, a renunciation that deepens the task. The refugees' arrival complicates pressure, but their presence is summarized rather than dramatized, limiting escalation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the keeper's stance crystallizes into tending rather than mere recording—with felt cost in the discipline required. The piece fits Accumulative lens expectations, but protagonist agency remains reactive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the regenerative power of patient witnessing and the crumbling peace that cradles transformation—emerges organically from image and action. The recurring motifs (swan, refuge, roots) accumulate meaning without overt statement. The final paragraph reweights "crumbling peace" as a discipline of not-knowing, offering a resonant answer to the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (smoothing the swan's wings, planting cuttings) and implication (people offer "no story they did not wish to redeem in the telling"). One minor slip: "opportunity of each moment to be itself" briefly tilts toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: "vines like belts," "water kneels to mirror and forget," "foxed the leather." Diction is elevated but consistent, rooted in the keeper's archival idiom. The brief dialogue with the child is naturalistic and purposeful. Under pressure (the vaults thrumming), syntax tightens appropriately. However, the piece occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the opportunity of each moment to be itself") that slightly loosens the perceptual signature. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are strong—"dust fell like pale rain," "the regenerative silence wove itself through fear like thread closing a wound"—and sentence openings vary. However, paraphrase loops appear: "crumbling peace" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and the closing lines recycle the drift-of-seasons phrasing from earlier. Template cadence surfaces in mid-section ("We returned always, because…"; "Others set stones…, as if…") where parallel constructions repeat without taught pattern. Line-level clarity is high, but density suffers from minor redundancy. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions stay moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—archivist as witness in a collapsing library, using an origami swan to navigate ruin—is specific and fresh. The emotional arc (writing → tending) and the regenerative silence concept transform familiar post-collapse tropes through precise detail (mushrooms editing text, petals of index cards reinforcing wings). The keeper's discipline to "let events arrive without chasing them with our old answers" offers a non-obvious moral calculus. However, the origami swan as magical navigation tool and the vague timeframe ("drift of untold seasons") lean slightly generic. The synthesis is memorable and cohesive, with one or two elements feeling like prompt ornaments rather than inevitable choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is POV throughout, shapes early expectation, and makes two visible choices: reinforcing the swan and choosing patience when the vaults thrum. These choices alter tactics (planting cuttings, tending vs. recording) and the final stance. However, most narrative involves observation and summary of others' actions rather than the keeper's own pressure-tested decisions. Present in closure ("I will remain here, tending") but not causally driving the final image. Two-gate plus lyric reprise, but limited causal pressure caps the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears early ("black as a kept secret"), is visited multiple times (alone, then with refugees), and returns in the closing pledge ("tending the swan, the refuge, the shelves"). It provides spatial contrast and a site for regenerative silence, but its involvement is largely atmospheric—no on-page choice hinges on the refuge's specific properties. Lyric reprise reweights its meaning as a site of mercy and rest, but the element remains swappable with any sanctuary. Three gates met, but low causal pressure and modest specificity limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named early, recurs across beats (the library's breathing, the refuge's water-polished voice, silence weaving through fear), and explicitly shapes the ending's tonal charge ("crumbling peace is enough to cradle tomorrow"). It constrains the keeper's stance (witnessing without verdict) and modulates pressure throughout. However, it functions primarily as theme and tone rather than as a discrete on-page tactic or object that alters choices. Three gates met; strong lyric integration but limited causal leverage keeps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated early as rationale for selection but never dramatized through a visible tradeoff or constraint. The keeper's actions (reinforcing the swan, waiting, planting cuttings) do not demonstrably arise from this trait; no scene shows the cost or benefit of loose reality-grip versus a firmer one. Label-only mention without on-page consequence. Setup gate met, but missing development and closure participation caps the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Burrow appears early (roots through atlases, then refugees taught to "burrow gently through the paper where roots had already drafted tunnels") and shapes one middle choice (making space). The action is specific and supports the theme of gentle persistence. However, it is not load-bearing for the ending; the keeper's final stance (tending, planting cuttings) could stand without burrowing. Two gates met (setup, middle), closure participation is indirect. Functional but replaceable; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Origami swan is introduced early, used in multiple beats (tugging wing → stairwell, creasing beak → room exhales air, leading groups to refuge), reinforced with index-card petals, and returns in the closing pledge. Its cryptic mechanics shape navigation and door-opening, providing tactical specificity. The keeper's choice to "smooth its wings and ask it to wait" is a key middle turn. However, the swan functions primarily as a magical tool; its mechanics are atmospheric rather than load-bearing for the closure. Three gates, moderate causal pressure, charges the final image as part of the tending pledge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overgrown library is anchored immediately, recurs across nearly every beat (toppled encyclopedias, collapsed tables, vaults thrumming, crumbling peace), and directly shapes choices (making shelter, planting cuttings in broken spines). The setting's decay and regeneration drive the keeper's evolving task and charge the ending image. Three gates met with strong causal pressure and high irreplaceability; the library's specific qualities (vines, roots, breathing halls) are essential to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" is named in the opening and closing, framing the timeframe, but never tracked or used to tighten decisions. The narrative is achronological summary without a live clock; no choice is pressured by time scarcity. Lyric reprise reweights the phrase as patience, but the element remains ornamental. Setup and closure gates met, but missing middle development and no tactical pressure cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation to witness without judgment is stated early, dramatized in the keeper's stance with the child ("I kept nothing except the opportunity of each moment to be itself") and refugees (asking for no story they did not wish to redeem), and deepens at closure into tending. However, the motivation is never tested by a counterpressure that would make judgment tempting; the keeper's stance is consistent but unchallenged. Three gates met, but friction between wants and costs is minimal. Mid-band lyric integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crumbling peace is named early, recurs across beats (dust settling, regenerative silence, stones hosting quiet), modulates when vaults thrum (discipline under pressure), and charges the final image ("crumbling peace is enough to cradle tomorrow"). Tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the ending's emotional weight. Three gates met with strong closure linkage and causal shaping of the keeper's stance. High integration; the tone is indispensable to the piece's meaning.</comment>
