<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aurel's interiority is concrete and character-specific—"hive of second thoughts," the weight of the story stick. His arc from bravado to recognition of harm, then to genuine apology and structural reform, is earned by on-page reflection and the troupe's pressure. The final micro-choices (sending the message, brewing coffee, rehearsing a new structure) embody cost and renunciation. Minor slip: Ferro and Miri remain sketched rather than individually contradictory, though their presence suffices to force the protagonist's choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, the argument's residue, the stick's tactile history, and the final bar scene into a deepening that reweights the ethical stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Aurel's apology and the co-written rules foreclose his prior unilateral control with visible cost (humility, shared authority). Orientation is clean by the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the troupe returns and new rules are inscribed, narrowing Aurel's options and redistributing power.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radar dome functions as more than backdrop: its "meteor hush" and acoustics (echoes, the moth's percussion) charge the reflective atmosphere and recur at closure to underscore the shift. The campfire story stick is handled across multiple beats, its char-grooves and notches constraining Aurel's choices and grounding the thematic turn. The seedy bar at the end supplies social texture (drunk, old beer, citric cleanser) that tests the new ethic in a live environment, meeting the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Aurel's storytelling manipulates or liberates—is signaled early and tightens once: the argument exposes harm, Aurel internalizes it, and the co-authored rules foreclose his prior unilateral method with on-page cost (authority ceded, launch delayed). The bar scene demonstrates the new structure under live pressure (the drunk waits, the puppet declines), but that test is brief. Agency is renunciation and redistribution of power, appropriate to the accumulative lens, though the escalation curve is gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling as shared authority—emerges organically from the argument, the mirrored "Listen," and the co-written rules without didacticism. The final image in the bar (audience choosing scenes, puppet declining, Aurel inking a "soft strikeout") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: power sees itself and relinquishes control. The piece resists a tidy moral by showing the system in action with minor friction (bruise "legible but not celebrated"), embracing complexity. Subtext operates through silence, gesture (Ferro scratching his neck, the moth), and the vellum's evolving inscriptions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Aurel notices "pencil scratches," "half-lit epiphanies," "hive of second thoughts." Diction remains elevated but coherent throughout, appropriate to an "urbane calligrapher." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Aurel's apology is "without poetry," and Ferro's line to the moth carries subtext and deflects tension. The prose modulates naturally from introspective density in the dome to sharper beats in the bar without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify; information density is high (most lines do two jobs—sensory detail + interiority or action + theme). Minor loop at "He wrote Listen… then wrote it again" is functional repetition that illustrates the reversal motif. A few figurative phrases approach overwriting ("the dome curved overhead like a skullcap, gathering their earlier words and cooling them into fossils"), but they remain legible and thematically coherent. No scaffold or template cadence detected; clarity and propulsion hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of performance ethics, collaborative rule-making, and embodied reflection (vellum, stick, puppet) feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "artist learns humility" template by dramatizing structural remedies (audience veto, puppet refusal) in concrete scenes rather than abstract epiphany. The mirrored "Listen" and the campfire story stick's tactile history add ingenuity without gimmickry. The seedy-bar venue and the moth's minor percussion are fresh inflections that ground the thematic turn in lived particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurel is present throughout and makes three key choices: he reflects on harm, sends the message requesting return, and co-authors the new rules. His observation dominates the opening, but the middle and closure beats trace directly to his decisions, which alter tactics (from unilateral to collaborative) and foreclose his prior path. He is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in the opening (Aurel touches it), middle (he lifts it and reads its notches), and closure (Miri sets it across her knees; it passes in the bar by audience will). Its tactile history ("char-blackened grooves," tally-mark notches) accumulates meaning, and its final function—embodying distributed authority—directly shapes the resolution. Removing it would collapse the thematic through-line.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is voiced once as Aurel's internal thesis ("bright enough to navigate by but dim enough to keep you humble") and governs his reflective stance throughout. It shapes his decision to reverse power—showing incomplete insight as ethical—and the bar scene enacts it (the drunk surprises himself, the bruise stays "legible but not celebrated"). The concept reweights stakes by defining the ethical middle the story seeks, though it does not constrain a discrete physical turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene on the outside, though his chest carried a hive of second thoughts" is present at the argument and informs Aurel's capacity to listen without reactivity. His serenity enables the reflective turn (he stays, he waits, he writes) and contrasts with the troupe's vocal anger, creating pressure. However, it is not tested under later stress or shown to impose a visible cost; it reads as enabling trait rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reverse" anchors the core mechanic: Aurel writes "Listen" in reverse so it reads correctly only in reflection, literalizing his thesis that "power should see itself before it speaks." This act precipitates the apology and the co-authored rules. In the bar, he inks a "soft strikeout" to reverse a harmful punchline, enacting the principle under live pressure. The action is indispensable to the thematic turn and the closure structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is signaled early as Aurel's plan and tested in the final scene, where the bar's social texture (drunk, owner, flickering work light) pressures the new ethic. The puppet declining a punchline and the audience holding the stick demonstrate the method's mechanics. Removing it would leave the ethical reform abstract; its presence grounds the stakes in performance risk, though the bar scene is brief.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome supplies atmospheric constraint (the acoustics hold echoes, the moth taps a barricaded window) and charges the reflective tone with "meteor hush." Its curvature and history frame the argument's residue. The dome bookends the story, appearing in the opening, middle (the hatch, the dome "holding its breath"), and closure ("back at the decommissioned radar dome"). Its specificity—tracking skies, gathering words—directly supports the theme of attention and ethical listening.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" establishes the temporal frame and charges Aurel's interiority with residual tension. The timeframe (aftermath, night, closing time) paces the reflection and the troupe's return without urgency, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The bar scene occurs "after closing time," closing the loop. Time does not tighten decisions sharply, but the lingering hush pressures Aurel's stance and the dome "holding its breath" marks the turn, lifting the element into functional territory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is voiced in the opening and drives every choice: Aurel's reflection on manipulation, his mirrored "Listen," his apology, and the co-authored rules all test the ethic under pressure. The bar scene dramatizes the exploration in action (audience veto, puppet refusal). The motivation is conflicted—he has "forgotten to ask his troupe to consent"—and that friction incurs the visible cost of humility and shared authority. The motivation is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" recurs across the piece: the dome "remembered tracking skies too wide for anger," the argument "dissolved," the footsteps "released echoes that seemed to venture out and never return," and the closing line returns to "meteor hush." The tone is coherent, contemplative, and accumulative, modulating slightly in the bar (sharper beats, live tension) but returning to stillness at closure. The tone charges the final image and reweights the opening, elevating the element.</comment>
