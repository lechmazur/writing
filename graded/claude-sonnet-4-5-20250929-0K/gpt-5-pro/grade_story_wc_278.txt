<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist carries clear interior contradiction—gifted translator burdened by guilt over a fatal misreading—and the final tattooing of the nephew's name crystallizes agency through craft with visible cost. Interiority is consistently embodied through amber-holding, tether-tying, and breath-into-port gestures that ground emotional states. The mix of past trauma (nephew's death) and present repair task braids motivation cleanly, though the letters-from-self device edges toward convenience in late revelation. Emotional progression from haunted guilt to provisional hush reads earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the lab-repair frame holds throughout. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through layered motifs (amber, constellations, letters, waveform cries) until the final tattooing-of-name reweights guilt into cadenced closure. Cost is legible—naming the nephew on metal constitutes visible emotional price and allows the firmware (and narrator) to rest. The self-as-sender twist ("my own handwriting hiding under the flourishes") lands thematically but arrives late without mid-story friction, softening causal tightening; the closure itself compensates by charging the silver-constellation image with irreversible specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lab is sensuously particular: "meteor hush," "mothlight," reels that "whisper a year," and the antique credenza smelling of "ash and lavender." The amber lens, red tether-cord, and conductive-silver ink constrain the repair method and charge the final image when the nephew's name is tattooed in "tiny stars." Micro-setting (amber as window, insect as saint-of-pause, chassis as canvas) functions fully, transforming body and tool into setting that drives choice. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the lyric density.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing firmware dissonance to address personal guilt—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the eight-letter sequence: each instruction (ink constellations, breathe into port, translate, hum to amber, tattoo the name) tightens the ritual and narrows evasion. The waveform's cry "Do not leave me in the static" and the narrator's answer "I will not" constitute agency under the Accumulative lens, forecloses the path of avoidance, and delivers felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the letters are self-authored, reweighting the repair as self-forgiveness earned through craft; escalation could be sharper if mid-sequence reversals tested commitment more directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief, translation, self-forgiveness through craft—emerges organically from the amber-insect-constellation braid without overt statement. The final image (nephew's name in silver stars, amber cooling, letters aligned with interlooped initials) reweights prior material and offers a resonant answer: guilt becomes cadence, dissonance becomes hush. The insect "that never met time, so it cannot judge me" and the fold's tether motif deepen without sermonizing. Subtext operates richly in gesture (untying the red cord, pressing ear to cabinet like confessor) and the piece resists tidy closure while delivering undeniable emotional charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and distinctive: "thistle hiss," "mothlight," "dawn plotted across steel." Perceptual signature is consistent (amber-lens filtering, constellation-mapping) and diction remains character-particular throughout. The narrative stance modulates under pressure—lines shorten during the waveform's cry, expand during reflective beats—without head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression ("when time folds in on itself") is taught early and legible. No dialogue appears; interiority carries the full load cleanly. Minor density in figurative language (nearly every sentence in peak beats carries metaphor) holds because the pattern is established and the voice is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but coherent within the lyric mode. Information load per line is strong: "Its drawers still smell like ash and lavender, and something waits in them" does triple duty (anchor, mood, forward pressure). A few minor loops appear: "haunted firmware" is named twice in quick succession, and "the fold" recurs without fresh pressure mid-story. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting ("the signature at last," "I understand the motive the way a tide understands the moon") but the closure image (amber cooling, insect blinking/dust moving) compensates with concrete specificity. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—guilt repair via constellation tattooing, amber-lens translation, time-folding letters—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the haunted-machine trope through craft ritual and the self-as-sender twist, though that twist arrives late and echoes familiar time-loop templates. Emotional specificity (translating baby cries, nephew's winter death, "chiming that never fades") anchors universals. Risk in lyric compression and the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of elements (amber insect, conductive silver, handwritten method) feels organic rather than checklist-assembled, and the transformation test holds—plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The constellation tattooist role drives every major beat: inking the chassis with silver star-nodes, setting amber as window, breathing into port, tattooing the nephew's name. Setup is immediate, middle development constrains method (must use conductive ink, must translate breath), and closure crystallizes when the name lands on steel and firmware stops shivering. Causal pressure is high; specificity (constellation = repair map) is irreplaceable. Cost is visible: naming the nephew is the emotional climax. All three gates met; strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amber appears in opening ("pocket rests a piece of amber"), middle (held as lens, hummed-to for rhythm, insect as "small saint of pause"), and ending ("amber burns a little brighter," "amber cools against my palm"). It enables the translation method and charges the final image. Setup early, development use (lens for sound, rhythm tether), closure participation (cooling signals completion). Two beats minimum; causal pressure moderate (could theoretically swap for another lens object). Specificity moderate; cost connection present but soft.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Haunted firmware frames the repair task from the opening ("firmware is haunted… by unresolved choruses") and shapes the method: constellations link firmware nodes, breath-translation soothes waveforms, tattooing the name husks dissonance. Setup immediate, middle development (firmware cries, begs translation), closure participation (firmware "stops shivering and becomes a body that wants to sleep"). Two beats; causal pressure solid—without firmware the repair has no object. Specificity high (firmware = repository of lost voices). Cost connection present (guilt externalized as firmware dissonance).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Translation gift is seeded early ("translated baby cries for parents"), causally linked to nephew's death ("I misheard his plea"), and deployed in climax ("Translate, it begs… Hunger, I say"). Setup clear, middle development (the skill is the repair tool), closure participation (final translation "Rest now, not goodbye, but hush" completes the arc). One strong beat at climax; causal pressure moderate (the method requires this skill). Specificity moderate; swappable with another auditory/interpretive gift. Cost connection strong (misreading caused death, correction husks guilt).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tethering ("I tether my wrist to the bench with a red cord, because the fold keeps tugging") appears early, constrains middle action (physical anchor against time-fold), and closure moment includes untying ("I untie my red tether and let my hand float, noticing the absence of a weight"). Setup immediate, development (tether = safety constraint during repair), closure participation (untying = release from guilt). Two beats; causal pressure solid—without tether the fold could pull protagonist away. Specificity high (red cord, wrist, bench). Cost legible: untying signals risk accepted and weight lifted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Method seeded early ("I found the method… via handwritten letters found in antique furniture. Eight letters…"), structures all middle action (each letter instructs a step: ink, breathe, hum, tattoo), and closure reveals self-authorship ("It is my initials looped through his"). Setup by paragraph four, development (letters = repair manual), closure participation (signature reweights method as self-instruction). Three beats minimum; causal pressure high—without letters the repair sequence has no guide. Specificity high (handwritten, antique credenza, time-folded sender). Cost moderate: method is convenient but the self-as-sender twist partially earns it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Laboratory anchors immediately ("laboratory of lost sounds"), supplies all repair tools (console, reels, tower of cables, credenza), and the setting's acoustic properties (meteor hush, mothlight fans) charge the final image when "the lab exhales, the meteor hush returns." Setup immediate, development (lab = repair theater, tools enable method), closure participation (lab exhales = environmental confirmation of success). Three beats; causal pressure high—no lab, no repair apparatus. Specificity high (lost sounds, salvaged observatory console, rivered-market credenza). Micro-setting (amber, tether, chassis) also constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe ("when time folds in on itself") opens the piece, motivates the tether (fold tugs protagonist), enables the letters-from-self device, and the ending smooths the fold ("the fold smooths like silk"). Setup immediate, development (fold = threat and explanation for self-sent letters), closure participation (fold resolved). Two beats; causal pressure moderate—time-fold justifies the self-instruction but doesn't constrain tactics beat-by-beat. Specificity moderate; lyric compression makes mechanics vague. Cost connection soft: fold is backdrop more than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("to hush the dissonance of old guilt") is seeded in opening paragraph, dramatized through nephew's death memory ("I misheard his plea"), drives every repair step (translating firmware = proxy for self-forgiveness), and closure delivers hush with cost ("I was always working to hush the dissonance… but it was teaching me cadence"). Setup immediate, development (guilt = motor for repair), closure participation (guilt transformed to cadence, hush earned). Three beats; causal pressure high—without guilt the repair has no emotional stakes. Specificity high (specific nephew, specific death, specific misreading). Cost visible: naming nephew on steel is the price of hush.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone ("meteor hush") is invoked in opening ("The hall has a meteor hush, like velour thrown over a careless universe"), sustained through lyric compression and sensory restraint (mothlight, whispers, chiming), modulates under pressure (waveform wails, lights shake), and returns at closure ("the meteor hush returns"). Setup immediate, development (tone = emotional anchor and lab atmosphere), closure participation (hush restored signals repair complete). Two beats; tone coherent throughout. Specificity high (meteor = sudden silence after impact). The tone charges the final image and supports the accumulative lens without static repetition.</comment>
