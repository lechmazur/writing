<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—"quiet hunger was to discover the color of sound" anchors motivation in sensory specificity. The arc from hiding behind truth to "truth was no longer a wall but an open door" is earned through the underwater experience, though the final shift feels slightly hasty. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the tag "singing in my palm"), but much of the transformation occurs through poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The foreman's observation about hiding provides useful external pressure, but the protagonist's internal struggle remains largely reflective rather than conflicted in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: pier lamplighter, harbor, sky lantern release above. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and the parallel ascent of lanterns/descent to wreck, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist emerges changed, "listening begun" replaces work-done signaling). Cost is legible: the protagonist admits seeking transformation and offers "luminous vows," forgoing the shield of passive truth-hiding. One meaningful deepening occurs underwater when the tag becomes a tuning plate and the cabinet "opened without moving," reweighting the quest from literal discovery to interior shift. The lens holds through closure, though the protagonist's agency is more receptive than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and specific—"ribs scrolled with moss," "books splayed like mussels," "phonograph horn nested with eels." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: pier ladder, skiff, pilings, window entry, cabinet. The setting constrains choice by requiring breath-hold and solitary descent during the distraction of the lantern release. The recurring hotel key tag charges the final image, vibrating with "the new color steadying the world," and the wreck's "silence that hums like a closed mouth" creates distinct atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: underwater details intensify as discovery nears, while surface details remain peripheral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist descends during low tide while the crowd looks up, narrowing the window of opportunity. The underwater cabinet moment deepens pressure: the tag becomes a tuning plate, and the protagonist must offer "luminous vows" (a new truth as path) to receive the color. Cost is felt but oblique: the protagonist forgoes hiding and returns visibly changed, waving to the foreman without shame. Agency leans receptive—the cabinet "opened without moving" and "the water vibrated"—which slightly softens the protagonist's role in the transformation, though the choice to descend and the offering of vows are deliberate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening/transformation emerges organically from the quest for sound's color and the protagonist's shift from hiding to openness. The final image—"the color of sound walked through" the open door—reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the parallel structure: lanterns rise with written vows as the protagonist descends to offer luminous vows, creating resonance without explicit comparison. The hotel key tag as "tuning plate" rather than literal key is a fresh inflection that surprises in hindsight. One near-thematic echo appears when the protagonist describes the tag's lesson: "their oath was made in light" risks becoming slightly declarative, though it's filtered through the ledger's script rather than direct narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "Their small suns would climb into the wind like soft-spoken stars with errands" carries consistent metaphoric density and perceptual signature. POV distance remains stable; the narrator's way of noticing is selective (listening for "the sea's color"). No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is present—"the cabinet opened without moving"—and taught through the accumulative pattern. One register drift occurs late: "luminous vows inked with ash-water" in the crowd description echoes the protagonist's interior idiom too closely, though the effect may be intentional mirroring. The lyric density remains high throughout without clear modulation under peak stress, which slightly flattens urgency in the underwater beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with purpose, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor loop: "quiet hunger was to discover" and "I knew I hid there" repeat the hiding theme within close proximity without advancing it. Template cadence appears in the underwater sequence: "I took... I pressed... I realized... I found... I pressed again... I rose"—six consecutive sentences opening with "I [past verb]" flatten propulsion during the climax. Mixed metaphor: "sky folding its lanterned pages" introduces book imagery not established elsewhere. Information density is high, but the figurative load in nearly every sentence of the descent/discovery beat risks overwriting without pattern-payoff, though the accumulative effect ultimately coheres.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia quest, underwater library, and parallel lantern ritual feels specific and non-obvious. The hotel key tag as tuning plate rather than literal key transforms expectation. Risk-taking in the lyric density and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One derivative element: the sunken-knowledge-repository trope (submerged library/Atlantean archive) is familiar, though the specificity of "phonograph horn nested with eels" and the tag-as-tuning-plate mechanism personalize it. The "hides behind truth" attribute is declared by the foreman but not dramatized in a choice with visible cost, which slightly limits transformation depth. Overall the piece commits fully to its lyric premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lamplighter role frames setup (lighting the last lamp), enables middle action (access to pier/salvage stairs), and appears at closure (lifting the lamp "to signify listening begun"). Present in all three gates. The occupation constrains tactics: foreman oversight requires the lantern-release distraction for the descent. The final lamp-lift decision alters what the gesture means, reweighting the role from function to symbol. One friction: the lamplighting itself is complete early; the character's choices derive more from the desire to reach the wreck than from the occupation's duties.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The key tag appears in setup (kept in pocket, stamped with nonexistent room number), middle development (pressed against cabinet to listen, becomes tuning plate), and closure (singing in palm, steadying the world). Present in all three gates. It constrains the protagonist's approach—listening rather than forcing—and its transformation from key to tuning plate is causally central to the discovery. The tag's specific history (sunken hotel ship, apprentices' oath) is irreplaceable. Cost: the protagonist must offer luminous vows to activate it. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows appear in setup (crowd writing wishes on lanterns "inked with ash-water"), middle (protagonist reads ledger entry about apprentices' oath "made in light"), and closure (protagonist offers "luminous vows" and the tag enables discovery). Present in all three gates. The concept shapes the protagonist's final offering—a new truth as path—which is necessary to open the cabinet. One friction: the vows remain somewhat abstract; the specific content or cost of the protagonist's vow is not dramatized, only declared. The concept charges the ending image but could be more concretely embodied in action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute is present: foreman's accusation ("hides behind truth") in setup and protagonist's acknowledgment ("I knew I hid there"). At closure the protagonist declares "I did not hide, because the truth was no longer a wall but an open door." Gates: setup yes, middle absent (the underwater journey doesn't dramatize a moment where hiding is tested or chosen against), closure yes. The transformation is asserted rather than demonstrated through a visible choice with cost. Swappable: "fear of vulnerability" or "avoidance" would function similarly. The trait labels the arc but doesn't constrain an on-page decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Signify" appears at closure: lifting the lamp "not to signal work done but to signify listening begun," and earlier the harbor bells "signify low tide." Present in two beats. The action reweights the lamp gesture, turning functional signal into declaration of transformation. The verb "signify" is thematically apt for a story about meaning-making and listening, and the shift from "signal" to "signify" marks the change. One friction: the signaling function could be replaced with "announce" or "mark" without structural loss; the specificity lies more in the contrast (signal vs. signify) than in the action's unique mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" appears in middle development: "I went down the ladder as if to check the moorings, by wandering purposefully toward the old salvage stairs." The method enables the protagonist to leave unnoticed during the lantern release. It shapes one tactic—disguising intent—and fits the protagonist's character (appearing to tend duties while pursuing the quest). Gates: setup indirect (the character's role allows wandering), middle yes, closure absent (the return is direct). The method is functional but the phrase itself does not return or charge the ending. Mid-band for enabling one key move without closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library appears in setup (mentioned as "forgotten library inside a sunken ship"), middle (protagonist enters, navigates space, finds ledger and cabinet), and closure (seen through as "constellations that finally had names" and left behind). Present in all three gates. The setting provides essential resources: the cabinet, the ledger with phosphor script, the acoustics that let the room "become a bell." Spatial details constrain action: breath-hold limits time, window entry, cabinet location. The wreck's specific condition—"iron spine," "ribs scrolled with moss"—is irreplaceable. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the transformation cannot occur elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sky lantern release appears in setup (townspeople readying lanterns), middle (release begins, provides distraction and timing: "Everyone else looked upward, so no one noticed"), and closure (lanterns seen as "constellations that finally had names"). Present in all three gates. The timeframe creates the window of opportunity—low tide and crowd distraction coincide—and tightens the decision to descend. The lanterns' ascent parallels the protagonist's descent, adding thematic resonance. One friction: the duration and urgency are not sharply tracked underwater; the breath-hold creates implicit time pressure, but the narrative does not return to surface time as a constraint during the discovery beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation appears in setup ("my quiet hunger was to discover the color of sound"), middle (underwater listening: "I pressed the tag... and listened," seeking "a color that was almost a name"), and closure (the color is received: "a shifting dusk that stained the edges of things with rest, and it entered me"). Present in all three gates. The desire drives the descent decision and shapes the protagonist's interaction with the tag and cabinet. Cost: the protagonist must admit "I had come here to be changed" and offer luminous vows. One friction: the quest is receptive rather than agonistic—success arrives through openness rather than struggle—which slightly softens the dramatic friction between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in opening and closing lines, framing the piece. The tone—quiet, liminal, suspended—remains coherent through the underwater sequence ("silence that hums like a closed mouth") and modulates subtly as discovery nears (the water "vibrated until the room became a bell"). The hush charges the final image: protagonist returns to "meteor hush" but now aware, no longer hiding. The tone is consistent with the accumulative/textural lens and the lyric density. Strong setup and closure presence; the tone shapes perception throughout and reweights at the end when paired with "listening begun." High thematic and atmospheric integration.</comment>
