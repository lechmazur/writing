<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mapmaker's motivation is clear and his embodied perception ("tasted its grammar ripple through his skin") anchors interiority in concrete sensation. The craft metaphor and memory of "a winter when words would not hold him" provide backstory that primes the closure choice. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; his micro-choices under pressure are few, and the final act—kneeling, tracing the tone into the ring—reads more as ritual reception than a stake-altering decision with visible cost. The grief and sorrow mentioned early never surface as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, the pause of shifting constellations) arrive early and remain stable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered sensory language and the final image (ring as tool, stillness as guide) reweights the opening's "quiet blaze" with conceptual cost—he carries the melody forward as a mapmaking method. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he completes the dowsing and internalizes the stillpoint, foreclosing the search with the cost of permanence ("stayed like a faithful star"). One deduction: the causality of how tracing the tone into the ring's grooves enables his future maps is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page, and the cost remains implied rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through non-visual senses: "syllables of sap and spores pressing signatures into his fingers," the cedar's "grammar," the clearing's "nave that sang without sound." Spatial choreography is coherent (entering, following the trail, kneeling at center). The ring functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the dowsing method and charges the final image when it opens "like a locket." However, the forest's acoustic properties—its core conceit—remain largely atmospheric; no choice hinges on navigating or misreading its ultrasonic features, and the deer-of-echoes encounter decorates rather than complicates the journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the stillpoint to navigate emotional depths without drowning) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory density and the protagonist's steady progression, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The clearing's balance and the ring's refusal to move provide a tightening moment, but escalation is shallow: no live option is foreclosed en route, no secondary pressure (the deer's warning, the cold note of "You left") materially alters tactics. The resolution—kneeling, tracing, internalizing—unfolds without visible cost or trade-off on the page; the consequence ("his map had been made in him") is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeiture or transformation that closes a prior path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: mapmaking as emotional navigation, stillness as anchor, trust and touch as alternatives to sight. The final image—"patience arranged on skin and page"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The quiet blaze motif bookends the piece with reweighted meaning (banked coals → faithful star). One weakness: the phrase "a place of rest that could bear the weight of tears" skirts thesis statement, and the ending's assertion that "those who touched them felt languages bloom" tells the thematic payoff rather than dramatizing it through a concrete, on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with a perceptual signature rooted in tactile and auditory metaphor: "Words became pulses, pulses became direction." The elevated diction ("nave," "dowse," "poise") remains consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. However, the prose occasionally inflates into register drift—"uncoil upwards, not loud, but a steady anchor the world swiveled around"—and the syntactic uniformity (many sentences open with subject-verb-object patterns or prepositional phrases) flattens rhythm under pressure. The final paragraph's summary mode ("His maps thereafter were patience arranged…") shifts psychic distance abruptly, diluting immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful and textured ("trail of musical notes… each bead a small sounding"). Sentence openings vary adequately. However, overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: the clearing paragraph stacks metaphors ("circular as a held breath," "coin laid on the tongue of quiet," "seed of all maps") without room to breathe, and the closure sequence layers abstract nominalizations ("poise," "harbor within," "quiet blaze capable of guiding") that obscure concrete action. Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]" stems across the middle third. No paraphrase loops, but the density of figurative vehicles occasionally contradicts (a "nave" that "sang without sound" vs. "the world swiveled around" a tone). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind cartographer, tactile language-learning, emotional navigation via stillpoint dowsing—is specific and non-obvious. The ultrasonic forest conceit and the platinum compass ring avoid stock fantasy tropes through sensory particularity. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design, extended metaphor as plot) heightens thematic coherence. One limitation: the emotional arc (grief, loss, healing) follows a familiar trajectory, and the resolution's declarative summary mode ("and those who touched them felt languages bloom") retreats into safe abstraction rather than a bold, image-driven closure that trusts the reader to infer consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker is present throughout and frames the journey. He makes micro-choices (pressing palm to cedar, following the ring, kneeling at center), but these are largely observational or receptive rather than stake-altering decisions. The choice to trace the tone into the ring's grooves occurs in the final third and shapes the ending, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff). However, his decisions do not narrow options or create visible cost; he receives the stillpoint rather than wrestling for it. The character is essential to tone and perspective but somewhat replaceable in terms of plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears early (first paragraph), functions in the middle (dowsing, tightening on his finger, circling for tone), and opens at closure to receive the traced melody, satisfying all three gates. It constrains the dowsing method and charges the final image as the vessel for the stillpoint. Its unique property—grooves that catch starlight and breath—matters at the ending. The ring is causally active across beats and nearly indispensable; removing it would require substantial rewrite. One friction: its opening mechanism is introduced late, and the mechanics of how tracing the tone into grooves enables future mapmaking remain asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint is the quest object, signaled early ("dowse for the hidden stillpoint") and reached at closure ("the hidden stillpoint, where melody begins before notes"). It shapes the protagonist's goal and the narrative trajectory. The clearing's balanced air and the ring's refusal to move dramatize its discovery. However, its function as "a place of rest that could bear the weight of tears" is told rather than tested; no on-page choice hinges on distinguishing the stillpoint from other forest locations, and its conceptual cost (permanence, responsibility) is implied rather than felt. The concept is thematically central but tactically thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Absorbing languages through skin is mentioned early and demonstrated twice: pressing palm to cedar to taste its grammar, and feeling the trail of musical notes on wrists and ankles. These moments are vivid but passive; the attribute enables perception without constraining choice or imposing cost. The trait does not force a trade-off (e.g., vulnerability, sensory overload) or alter tactics under pressure. It functions as a sensory channel rather than a complicating factor. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure participation; swappable with "hears through vibration" or similar without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dowsing structures the journey: the ring begins to dowse in the second beat, guides the protagonist through the trail of notes, and culminates in the clearing where it "refused to move." The action is signaled early, sustained across beats, and present at closure when he "traced the tone into those grooves." It shapes attempts and drives progression. However, dowsing itself is largely automatic—the ring moves, he follows—without requiring skill, error, or adaptation. The action is essential to the narrative spine but does not impose visible friction or cost; removing it would require rewrite, but replacing it with "follows a visible path" would preserve structure with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The trail of musical notes is introduced early ("A trail of musical notes… unfurled like a path of dew") and guides the middle journey ("he followed, counting steps… keeping the ring aligned"). It appears as the object of the final tracing ("traced the tone into those grooves"). The method is signaled, used, and present at closure, satisfying all three gates. However, its mechanics are decorative: the notes "touched his wrists and ankles" without requiring interpretation, choice, or risk of misreading. The trail functions as a visible path rather than a puzzle or constraint. Its specificity matters less than its narrative role; "a scent trail" or "a line of heat" could replace it with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is established early and sustained throughout. Its sensory signature (inaudible choirs, syllables of sap and spores, branches forming a nave) creates vivid atmosphere and anchors the protagonist's perceptual mode. The clearing at center provides the spatial stage for closure. However, the forest's acoustic properties—its core conceit—do not constrain or enable a key choice; the protagonist navigates by touch and the ring's guidance rather than negotiating ultrasonic hazards. The setting is thematically integrated and vividly rendered but tactically passive. Removing "ultrasonic" and substituting "dense" or "ancient" would preserve the narrative with minor tonal shifts.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the pause of shifting constellations" is mentioned early ("The elders had told him to wait… That pause had arrived") and returns at closure ("When the constellations stirred again the clearing breathed"). It frames the ritual window and charges the ending's sense of completion. However, the pause imposes no live clock or deadline; the protagonist's actions unfold without temporal pressure, and the constellations' stirring is a marker rather than a constraint. The timeframe is present in setup and payoff but absent from middle development, and its mechanics (duration, stakes of missing the window) remain abstract. It adds poetic resonance but does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate emotional depths is signaled early ("navigate uncharted emotional depths without drowning") and tied to backstory ("a winter when words would not hold him"). The final image asserts success ("the stillness inside him stayed like a faithful star"). However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The protagonist's grief and sorrow are referenced but never surface as friction in his choices; he progresses steadily without internal resistance or external temptation. The motivation frames the quest but does not generate on-page conflict or force a trade-off between competing needs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The quiet blaze motif appears in the opening line ("a quiet blaze held under his ribs, steady as banked coals") and returns transformed at closure ("a quiet blaze capable of guiding others home"). Tone is coherent: restrained, contemplative, sensory-dense, with controlled lyricism throughout. The prose modulates under pressure—shorter clauses in the clearing, longer rhythms in reflection—without breaking voice. The blaze charges the final image as both constraint (quiet, not consuming) and promise (guiding). However, the tone remains largely uniform; peaks and valleys of urgency are subtle, and the ending's declarative summary mode ("His maps thereafter were patience…") softens rather than intensifies the tonal charge. The motif reweights meaning but does not constrain choice mid-scene.</comment>
