<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exiled tutor's interiority is consistently embodied through the pawn-rolling gesture and layered guilt over the prince's war. The motivation to forgive emerges through concrete action—knotting threads—rather than declaration, and the final choice ("forgive the prince, and forgive the tutor") forecloses self-hatred with visible cost (the pawn left in the tapestry). Minor deduction: the prince backstory risks becoming exposition, though it anchors present stakes. The protagonist's blindness to his own capacity for mercy until the puzzle demands it drives the arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): the tutor forgives himself by tying the final knot, the village breathes, and he chooses the bench to "teach any child the opening called mercy." Cost is visible (the pawn sacrificed, exile's weight lifted but not erased). The accumulative lens—woven hush, threaded interventions, distant thunder as metronome—holds throughout and tightens once when the tutor realizes the puzzle requires self-forgiveness. Orientation anchors by line 6 (mail coach, snow, square, labyrinth). One meaningful deepening: the shift from "refusing comfort" to accepting it charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and tapestry constrain every middle choice: burned threads, silver threads, rope fibers become the tutor's chessboard. The time-frozen village supplies tactile detail (baker's eyelid, child's slingshot, woman at the well) that the protagonist manipulates to restore motion. The pawn rolled across knuckles recurs and charges the closure (left inside the tapestry as payment). Micro-setting (the bench, the gleam) roots the ending. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: the tutor notices geometry, weave, tension—details filtered through his chess-trained perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: undo the mistake that froze the village, implicitly tied to the tutor's need for self-forgiveness. Escalation unfolds through progressive choices—black knots close burns, loosened silver frees laughter, unhitched rope allows water to drip—each narrowing options until the final knot forces the protagonist to forgive himself. The cost is unmistakable: the pawn (symbol of his old teaching) remains in the tapestry, and he must relinquish self-hatred to free the village. Agency is constant; the tutor's decisions drive every beat. Thunder as metronome lends urgency without melodrama.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness as prerequisite for healing, and teaching mercy rather than sacrifice—emerges entirely through the tapestry puzzle and the tutor's realization that his lessons hardened into war. The final image (teaching "the opening called mercy") reweights all prior chess metaphors without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between cutting and healing, the pawn left behind, and "fierce repose" as the tutor's new stance. No thematic echo; the closing question ("ready to teach any child") implies transformation without declaring it. Resonance arises from the particulars: threads, knots, the labyrinth's geometry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single tight POV with consistent perceptual signature: the tutor sees design, endgames, gambits, ranks. Diction remains elevated but rooted in his exile and craft ("winnow possibilities," "refusing comfort," "fierce repose"). Psychic distance narrows under pressure (the confrontation with remorse feels immediate). Brief dialogue in the final third ("asked my name, and I gave the truth") avoids filter clutter and advances closure. Free indirect style is clean. One hairline slip: "variations sprouting like vines" edges toward generic metaphor, but the rest of the figurative language (threads, knots, platinum gleam) stays grounded and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image, choice, or thematic pressure. Rhythm modulates well: long sentences for the frozen hush, short bursts when the tutor acts ("I tied the knot"). No paraphrase loops detected. Minor template cadence in the thread-tying sequence (three successive "I [verb]" constructions) slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is dense ("hush was woven hush, threads across the day") yet legible; no mixed metaphors. The final line ("ready to teach any child the opening called mercy") lands with clarity and charge. Grammar and pronoun references remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess tutor, time-frozen puzzle, and self-forgiveness via literal thread-work is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of chess as war-making into chess as mercy-teaching grows organically from the protagonist's guilt and the tapestry's mechanics. "Fierce repose" and the pawn-as-payment detail feel earned rather than convenient. Risk: the lyric density and extended metaphor could obscure, but the piece commits fully and the closure remains legible. The premise avoids template plotting; the emotional calculus (forgive to heal) is dramatized through knots and threads rather than declared.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exiled chess tutor drives every turn: examines the labyrinth, decodes threads, ties knots, chooses self-forgiveness. Setup in line 4, middle choices throughout (knotting black to black, loosening silver, unhitching rope), closure participation (ties the final knot, leaves the pawn, chooses to teach mercy). Decisions alter tactics and village state. Irreplaceable: the chess lens (ranks, gambits, endgames) shapes perception and the final lesson. Visible cost: the pawn left behind, exile's weight lifted but identity transformed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth appears in setup (line 6), examined (line 15), and brightens in the penultimate sequence as "paths arranged themselves into a problem I understood at last." The labyrinth houses the tapestry and frames the puzzle spatially. At closure, "the labyrinth's center opened" when the tutor ties the final knot, releasing the crows and time. Reweighted meaning: initially a cold geometry, finally a solvable structure that rewards forgiveness. Two distinct beats (discovery, opening) plus closure linkage. Causal pressure: the tutor must navigate its design to access the threads.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Woven hush shapes stakes throughout: the village is arrested by it, the tutor must unknot it. Setup immediate (line 3: "woven hush, threads across the day"). Middle beats: each knotting/unknotting alters the hush ("I felt the hush tremble, not breaking but breathing"). Closure: hush resolves into motion ("footsteps resumed, bread cracked"). The concept is not merely thematic; it defines the problem (frozen time) and the mechanics (weave to be decoded). Cost: the tutor must tie himself into the pattern to break it. Irreplaceable: swapping "woven hush" for generic "spell" would flatten the thread-work logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fidgets productively: the pawn rolled across knuckles appears in setup (line 8) and again when the tutor "moved the pawn in my pocket along my palm as if along ranks" before tying knots. The gesture signals restlessness and chess-thinking, grounding the abstract work in a physical tic. Constraint: the fidgeting keeps the tutor's hands and mind engaged, priming the knotting action. Closure linkage: the pawn is left in the tapestry, transforming the fidget-object into payment. Two beats (introduction, use during knotting). Swappability moderate: another small object could serve, but the chess piece ties directly to his past teaching.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winnow: setup (line 19: "winnow possibilities the way a player winnows lines"), enacted throughout the thread-decoding (tracing, listening, tying selective knots). Each major turn traces to winnowing: choosing which threads to close or loosen, refusing comfort to find the right path, isolating the final knot that requires self-forgiveness. Closure: the tutor's selective action (not fixing everything, leaving the pawn) embodies winnowing. Causal pressure: the method defines how he solves the puzzle. Irreplaceable: swapping "winnow" for generic "solve" loses the chess and selectivity logic. Visible cost: he must choose what to repair and what to sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads in tapestry's border: setup (line 18: "by refusing comfort"), mechanics detailed (lines 20–21: "Each broken filament touched a square of the labyrinth"). The method shapes all middle attempts: tracing burns, loosening silver, unhitching rope. Closure: the tutor ties a thread to his own wrist, completing the decode. The border's frayed state (time chewed it) directly enables the solution. Causal pressure: without understanding which threads map to which frozen faces, he cannot act. Two distinct beats (discovery of method, application to self). Irreplaceable: this exact method defines the puzzle's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Time-frozen village: setup immediate (line 1: mail coach, snow midair, crows pinned). The frozen state supplies all middle pressure—baker's eyelid, child's slingshot, woman at well—each a resource the tutor manipulates via threads. Closure: village breathes and resumes motion when the tutor completes the puzzle. The setting is not postcard; it constrains every choice (he cannot ask villagers for help, must decode alone) and the ending's stakes (restore their breath). Causal pressure: the freeze is the problem to solve. Irreplaceable: swapping for a generic cursed village loses the woven-hush mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "during the lull of distant thunder": appears in setup metaphorically (line 25: "I traced the weave and listened during the lull of distant thunder") and closes the piece (line 52: "I listened to the long thunder walk away over the hills"). The thunder functions as metronome, guiding the "quiet surgery." The lull creates urgency (implied: before the storm arrives or resumes fully) and charges the atmosphere. Two beats (invocation during work, departure after resolution). Constraint: the tutor works within a pause, and the thunder's rhythm paces his choices. Closure linkage: thunder walking away signals time's restoration. Moderate swappability: another ambient pressure could serve, but the lull/resume cycle mirrors the freeze/thaw.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Forgive oneself: setup (line 9: "the chance to forgive myself"), dramatized in middle conflict (line 26: "my remorse stood up and faced me like an opponent"), and directly tested at closure (lines 43–46: "forgive the prince, and forgive the tutor who taught him"). The motivation is not told-only; the tutor's every choice (refusing comfort, patient correction, tying the final knot) enacts the struggle. Visible cost: he must relinquish self-hatred, leave the pawn, and accept that "those lessons could change inside the world he damaged." Irreplaceable: the entire arc hinges on this desire. Causal pressure: self-forgiveness is the puzzle's final step, blocking closure until he acts.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fierce repose: setup metaphorically (line 3: "woven hush"), embodied in the tutor's patient, deliberate knotting under pressure, and named explicitly in closure (line 35: "a fierce repose," line 51: "In fierce repose I listened"). Tone is coherent: restrained intensity, no melodrama, controlled violence (cutting vs. healing). The oxymoron charges the final image: the tutor at rest yet alive with purpose. Modulates with pressure: tense during thread-work, exhales at the bench. Closure linkage: the phrase reappears in the ending, reweighting stillness as active forgiveness. Irreplaceable: swapping for "calm" or "peace" loses the tension that defines the tutor's new stance.</comment>
