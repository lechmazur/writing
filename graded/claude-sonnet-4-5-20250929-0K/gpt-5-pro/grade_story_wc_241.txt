<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The protagonist's internal contradictions—probability professor versus compulsive gambler's daughter, responsibility versus risk—are consistently embodied through micro-choices (lighting the lantern, following the scrawls, bringing carrots). The father's characterization is vivid through sparse detail: refusing soup "to prove the house could not win," the "tired smile I knew returned like an old train." Interiority remains concrete and particular ("my pulse that kept miscounting"), and the final choice to stay and hold space together is earned by accumulated pressure. The ending stance crystallization—holding him through "widening perspectives responsibly"—feels motivated, though the phrase edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the first three sentences (who, where, when). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the layered discovery of the father's handwriting in the archive, the nurse-name coincidence, and the childhood signal phrase, deepening rather than reversing stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the shared lantern moment and his agreement to eat reconfigure their relationship without resolving the underlying tension, with the felt cost visible in "I steadied his cup and thought about betting and models, fathers and daughters." The cost is legible but somewhat diffuse across the final paragraph rather than concentrated in a single decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The rainwashed library is vivid and purposeful: rain ticking on high windows, the mica lantern that "made the room look like a soft probability distribution," the drip that hisses on the pane. The lantern functions as micro-setting and recurring object, constraining the protagonist's attention and charging the final image when placed "between us so the light bridged our bedsides." The ward setting is less textured but functional. Spatial choreography (stacks, table, bedside) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—managing the father's care while cataloging an archive that unexpectedly bears his traces—is signaled early and tightens when his handwriting appears. One meaningful deepening occurs when the map reveals the childhood signal phrase, prompting the ward visit with the lantern. Agency is present: she chooses to follow the markers, bring the lantern, and stay. The cost is felt (her pulse miscounting, the tension of holding space for someone who refuses care) but could be more concentrated; the ending scatters the price across philosophical reflection rather than a single forfeited option.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The theme of lucid contradictions—two incompatible beliefs held true—emerges organically through the archive's dual encoding (routes vs. grief), the lantern's double light (rain and fire), and the father-daughter stances (leverage vs. responsibility). The final image answers the thematic question non-literally: "maps must contradict themselves to stay alive," and the city "rearranged its routes under rain" as the drops follow scrawled arrows. No overt moralizing; the resolution resists tidy binaries. The phrase "widening perspectives responsibly" edges toward prompt language but is contextualized enough to avoid mere labeling.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable first-person with a consistent perceptual signature: probability-inflected ("soft probability distribution," "pulse that kept miscounting"), specific idiom ("clover melancholy," "the house could not win"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You followed the markers," "they were lucky"). The prose modulates under pressure without losing coherence: shorter phrases when discovering his handwriting, more reflective rhythms in the final paragraphs. Filter verbs ("I pictured," "I thought") are voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy. One minor slip: "the tired smile I knew returned" could be tighter.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery. Two minor artifacts lower the score: the phrase "widening perspectives responsibly" recurs nearly verbatim three times, creating a conceptual loop, and the final paragraph's philosophical summary ("betting and models, fathers and daughters") risks abstract scaffolding rather than trusting the dramatized image. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("breathing like a scratched metronome," "rain escorting me like a drumline") with no mixed metaphors. Clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of probability theory, compulsive gambling, archive work, and cryptic transit scrawls feels specific and non-obvious. The conceit that the father's old handwriting appears in a donated archive of defaced maps is a strong, memorable inflection that drives the plot organically. The dual inheritance—her discipline versus his risk—is emotionally particular rather than generic. Minor limitation: the "lucid contradictions" frame is articulated rather than fully embodied at closure, and the piece does not take structural risks beyond its accumulative design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Present early (line 3) and central to every beat. The protagonist's choices—cataloging by scrawl interpretation, lighting the lantern, following the map address, asking the father to eat—are all rooted in her dual identity. Her role as probability professor shapes her method ("letting patterns propose hypotheses without demanding obedience"), and her status as the gambler's daughter charges every interaction with the archive and the ward. The final image depends on this exact character synthesis. Causal pressure is strong; the element is nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Introduced early ("Someone had left the lantern…I adopted it"), used in at least three beats: adopted and lit at the library table, carried to the ward, placed between bedsides to "bridge" them. Its mica pane recurs with reweighted meaning: first as a metaphor for probability distribution, then as a device to "sift time," finally as the shared light that "steadied" the father's cup. The lantern's dual glow (rainlight and fire) directly embodies the "lucid contradiction" theme and charges the closure image. Removing it would break the story's visual and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Introduced early (donor's belief vs. protagonist's belief) and articulated explicitly in the narration. The concept shapes the protagonist's method: she holds both interpretations of the scrawls as valid and refuses to choose between them. It recurs in the lantern's double light and the father-daughter peace. At closure, the protagonist tells the father "maps must contradict themselves to stay alive," directly invoking the concept. However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page stake; it does not force a trade-off or narrow options in a single beat. It remains somewhat ornamental rather than fully causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Mentioned once in line 3 ("theoretically rebellious yet devoted to widening perspectives responsibly"). The phrase does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. No beat turns on her rebelliousness; her choices read as disciplined and dutiful throughout. The attribute functions as a label rather than a trait that alters tactics or creates friction. It does not participate in the closure and could be removed without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Present in at least four beats: traversing the stacks to catalog maps, traversing by interpreting scrawls, the metaphor of the father traversing the city across decades via scrawls, and the implied traversal to the ward ("hurried through the stacks"). The action shapes the protagonist's method and the story's central discovery mechanism. The father's line "You followed the markers…as if the folders and the rails and the years were the same network" explicitly ties traverse to the closure's conceptual charge. The action is load-bearing; alternative verbs (search, catalog, wander) would not carry the same thematic and spatial resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Introduced early ("my method…was to traverse the stacks by interpreting cryptic scrawls") and demonstrated in at least two beats: shelving maps by scratched arrows, writing notes where numbers nest in hearts. The method is what leads to the discovery of the father's handwriting, the address, and the signal phrase, making it causally essential to the plot's key turn and the protagonist's decision to visit the ward. The specificity (scrawls on subway seats) is irreplaceable; no generic "archive clues" would carry the same texture or paternal echo. Removing this method would break the discovery mechanism and the thematic link between the city's hidden routes and the father's movements.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Present early ("rainwashed library at midsummer") and sustained throughout: rain on windows, the library's smell ("clover melancholy, green and sweet and slightly ruined"), the stacks. The setting provides the archive and the lantern, both essential to the plot. Rain recurs in several images and participates in the closure ("the city rearranged its routes under rain"). The library's specificity (high windows, stair, candle-lit table) is functional but not highly constraining; the cataloging work could occur in several similar locations. The ward is less textured. The setting shapes mood and discovery but does not force a key tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Signaled in the opening line and sustained as background pressure: the father is in the rehab ward "breathing like a scratched metronome," and the protagonist phones to confirm he has eaten. The timeframe tightens her decision to visit "after closing," and the heart attack underwrites the stakes (mortality, fragility). However, the heart attack itself is not a live ticking clock; it has already occurred, and the narrative does not treat recovery as time-bound. The timeframe provides urgency and context but does not drive a specific tactical constraint or escalate within the story window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Introduced early (line 3: "devoted to widening perspectives responsibly") and recurs in two later beats: "I believed responsibility widened perspectives beyond leverage altogether" and "What I wanted…was to widen perspectives responsibly enough to hold him." The desire is legible and consistent, but it is not dramatized through a choice with visible friction or cost. The protagonist's actions (cataloging, visiting, asking him to eat) align with this motivation, but no beat forces her to sacrifice one perspective to widen another. The motivation functions more as thematic gloss than as conflicted want. It could be implicit without loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Introduced early ("the library smelled like clover melancholy, green and sweet and slightly ruined") and sustained through imagery: rain, softness, the father's tired smile, the melancholy inherent in discovering his handwriting across decades. The tone modulates with pressure (tightening when his handwriting appears, breathing when the lantern is lit) and charges the final image: the quiet shared vigil, the drops following scrawled arrows. The phrase "clover melancholy" is specific and apt, though it recurs only once explicitly. The tone is coherent and supports closure without becoming static or overwrought.</comment>
