<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives micro-choices throughout (tilting the ink pot, rehearsing grief as performance, paying the "tax" of a warning). Embodied pressure is strong: "Truth was that my city owed him the breath he still owned" operationalizes motive through action. The final choice to carry names to mothers earns closure by forfeiting safety for use. Minor slip: "ethics sharpened to a scalpel" borders on label-speak, but the surrounding concrete choices (coin over eyelid, threading shroud) anchor it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by line 3. The escalation tightens through because/therefore linkage: Yusef taps → narrator rolls → officers confront → habit-performance buys passage → transfer completes → names exchanged. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: "breath for truth, risk balanced by use" reweights the premise via the exchange structure, and the cost is legible in the threat paid and the mothers' future action enabled. One meaningful deepening (the fair-trade calculus) reshapes stakes without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prep room's steel tables, refrigeration hum, and side-door latch function as micro-setting that constrains action (the alley groove, the hedge sightline). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through occupational POV: "formalin and salt," "drips from the faucet to keep the beat steady." The ink pot (body-adjacent tool) charges the final image by reappearing in the confrontation beat. Spatial choreography is coherent across gurney, threshold, alley, and street. Minor gap: chrysanthemum stems feel slightly ornamental rather than pressure-bearing, but the groove and latch do causal work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Yusef's escape—is signaled early and tightens through one reversal (the shout) that narrows options and forces the habit-performance gambit. Agency is decision and performative waiting that forecloses the defiance the narrator craves: "warnings are a tax, and I paid by leaving without the petty defiance I craved." The trade (names for passage) is a visible cost that alters future tactics (carrying receipts to mothers). Pressure coheres under the causal lens; coincidence (patrol car timing) complicates but does not resolve. One credible tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—fair trade, truth as inheritance inversion—emerges through concrete particulars: the ink pot's "black mouth," the coin/shroud gestures, the ledger metaphor operationalized in the final exchange. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "breath for truth, risk balanced by use" reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the narrator's micro-refusals (not outrunning, outlasting) and the officers' "habit" vulnerability. Minor tension: "liquefies rigid thinking" nears abstraction, but the surrounding image-work (solvent for certainties, metronome for courage) anchors it in perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: diction ("as if the dead released a solvent," "drips from the faucet to keep the beat") reflects occupational filter and lyric compression. Psychic distance is stable; internal voice (father's axioms reframed through honesty) remains coherent under stress. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and subtextual: "Sir, I said, the hospital needs these by dawn, and what you are seeing is work, not a door anyone breaks" pursues a goal via misdirection. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "I dipped the nib into the ink pot, its lacquered body older than my oaths, and tallied one more necessity" advances plot, character, and motif). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is controlled except for brief stacks in the opening third ("cold moons," "black mouth," "solvent for certainties" cluster densely but remain legible). No loops, no scaffold, no template cadence. Minor slip: "drips from the faucet to keep the beat steady" is slightly mechanical in a high-pressure beat, but the payoff (officers' attention sag) justifies the setup.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—funeral-home worker as modern Underground Railroad node—is fresh and specific. The fair-trade calculus (breath for names) transforms the asylum premise through occupational logistics and moral inversion (honest child using con-artist skills for truth). The ink pot and metronome signals are purposeful particulars. Minor constraint: the "dissident seeking asylum" frame is familiar; the story elevates it through the ledger logic and prep-room setting, but the core situation trends recognizable. Risk-taking in voice and compression heightens without obscuring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by line 3 ("I was his honest child"). Development: the trait constrains micro-choices (holding the door with truth, using habit-performance instead of flight). Payoff: the final exchange (names for passage) operationalizes honesty as the inversion tool. Two beats (truth-claim to officers, fair-trade delivery) and closure linkage present. Causal pressure is strong; the character's choices create the key turn. Cost is visible (forfeiting defiance, accepting future risk). Irreplaceability high; the con-artist inheritance is the frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: present by line 2 ("I kept my father's vintage ink pot beside the sink"). Development: used once in beat 15 ("I dipped the nib...and tallied one more necessity"). Payoff: reappears in confrontation ("I tilted the ink pot toward the streetlight"). Two touches across setup and closure; the ink pot charges the final accounting image. Lyric reprise reweights the father's legacy. Swappability moderate (another heirloom could serve); specificity (lacquered, older than oaths) adds texture. Gate test: setup + payoff, two of three, eligible to ~6.3; causal pressure in the tally beat lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: "teacher turned dissident seeking political asylum" by line 6. Development: asylum shapes the escape stakes and the transfer destination ("courthouse doors where asylum begins and ends in signatures"). Payoff: the final exchange (names for asylum passage) hinges on the concept. Three beats (introduction, transfer, trade). Causal pressure is central; the concept defines the dominant stake and the method. Cost is tied directly (risk, future testimony). Irreplaceability high; removing asylum breaks the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "the air had an attribute that liquefies rigid thinking" by line 10. Development: the trait licenses the narrator's rule-bending in the prep room. Payoff: implicit in the habit-performance gambit (using softened rules to pass inspection). One clear beat (the permission to bend ethics). Causal role is moderate; the trait enables but does not deeply constrain. Cost connection is weak (not visible on the page). Swappability moderate (another justification could serve). Two gates (setup, development); eligible to ~6.0, but weak cost and specificity lower it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "breach" introduced as threat early (implicit in the secrecy). Development: the shout and officers' arrival crystallize breach as the central reversal. Payoff: "The first officer said breach like a verdict" names and tests the action; the narrator's counter-performance resolves it. Three beats (threat, realization, resolution). Causal pressure is decisive; the breach attempt drives the climax and forces the habit-gambit choice. Cost is visible (tax of warning, forfeited defiance). Irreplaceability very high; removing breach collapses the story's escalation and closure stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "by waiting actively" framed early as method ("This was patience with knuckles, learning time as a muscle"). Development: the method shapes tactics across multiple beats (cleaning/stitching vigil, counting drips, outlasting attention). Payoff: the officers' "attention slumping in the cold" validates the method; the transfer succeeds via waiting. Three beats (setup, vigil, payoff). Causal pressure is strong; the method determines success. Cost is implicit (endurance, suppressed defiance). Irreplaceability high; the method is the tactical frame and thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setup: "funeral home prep room" anchored by line 1. Development: the setting supplies resources (steel tables, refrigeration hum, side door, alley groove) that constrain and enable the escape across multiple beats. Payoff: the prep-room logistics (gurney, sheet, "work" frame) are essential to the confrontation and closure. Four beats (prep work, tap signal, side-door exit, officer misdirection). Causal pressure is pervasive; the setting's tools and social logic shape every tactic. Cost tied to setting (risk of discovery at threshold). Irreplaceability total; no other setting could supply this exact escape logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "calculating the mathematics of a fair trade with the dead" by line 4. Development: the motive drives the decision to help Yusef and structures the risk calculus. Payoff: "That was the fair trade I could prove: breath for truth, risk balanced by use" operationalizes the motivation in the final exchange. Three beats (calculation, escape execution, trade completion). Causal pressure is strong; the motive frames choices and the closure image. Cost is visible (risk, future testimony burden). Irreplaceability high; the fair-trade frame is the thematic spine and ethical calculus.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: tone established early via "steel tables shone like cold moons," "formalin and salt," "metronome for courage." Development: tone modulates with pressure (refrigeration "like a tired lung," alley "wet cardboard and chrysanthemum stems") without breaking coherence. Payoff: the final image ("mothers would carry them to a judge") sustains the clinical-yet-vital register. Tone charges multiple beats and the closure. Coherence is strong; the deathly-vitality pairing threads through without static mood. Minor constraint: tone is more atmospheric than mechanically irreplaceable; a different tonal choice could serve the plot, though this one elevates.</comment>
