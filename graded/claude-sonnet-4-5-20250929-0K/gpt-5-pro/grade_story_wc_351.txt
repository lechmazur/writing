<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice shows distinct perceptual texture ("helix-minded engineer") and embodied grief, with micro-choices visible in the canyon apparatus assembly. The relationship with Mira is rendered through memory and artifact rather than direct interaction, which limits immediate pressure but supports the accumulative design. Internal contradiction appears in the calibration argument memory, showing want versus caution. The final vow to "modify our future by refusing to fossilize the living" earns modest cost through renunciation, though the choice remains largely cognitive rather than viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with elements of Situational pressure: the canyon ritual accumulates density through memory excavation until the narrator reaches a stance crystallization. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): the decision to "catalog not regret but relief" and "refuse to fossilize the living" forecloses the path of protective grief with felt cost in the final packing gesture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (canyon, moonlit, present tense of transformation). The Cost Proof Test is satisfied: "I could not undo, but I could modify our future by refusing to fossilize the living" and the packing gesture make the renunciation legible, though the price remains more emotional than material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon functions as more than backdrop: the trembling earth provides a physical correlate to the narrator's internal excavation, and the mirror placement "at an angle that doubled the moon" becomes a tool that constrains the experiment's progress. The periscope mirror charges the final image by reflecting "three moons where one hung," unlocking the seam to the river-sensor memory. Sensory detail is filtered through the engineer's priorities (circuit whispers, quarter-turn precision, theta-wave dials), and the canyon's "quaking reverie" recurs to frame both opening and closure. The kit, headband, coils, and mirror are handled with tactile specificity that grounds the lyric register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—excavating entangled memories to modify future grief—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's progression. Pressure accumulates as the narrator moves from apparatus assembly to theta-wave adjustment to the hardest memory layer: the flooded-quarter decision where caution and audacity were both "shelter and prison." The Cost Proof Test is met: the vow to stop fossilizing and the dawn packing gesture foreclose the protective stance with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirror splits and rejoins their faces, forcing the narrator to see complicity rather than blame. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the broken periscope mirror, the river-sensor calibration argument, the flooded-quarter non-rescue. The central question—"What did we abandon, and could I still learn its topography without lying about the fault lines?"—is answered non-literally through the final image of packing the apparatus and giving back "the hush that my questions had borrowed." The insight that grief fossilized into "limestone of unsent emails" and the machine's relief at being "remapped" earn thematic weight without moralizing. The piece resists binary resolution: both caution and audacity were shelter and prison, and the narrator chooses to carry artifacts without mistaking them for altars. Mira's belief that "dreams were slow fossils" seeds the excavation metaphor that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The POV remains stable in first-person present tense with controlled psychic distance and a distinct engineer's perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "coil chaos into circuits"). Diction occasionally slips into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-voiced: "quaking reverie," "synaptic plasticity," "limestone of unsent emails" read precise but not always consonant with mid-crisis thought. The reflection-heavy structure keeps the piece in contemplative mode throughout, which fits the ritual frame but flattens sentence-level propulsion. Purposeful compression in lines like "sweet and cracked, into a map that would reveal what held us" maintains coherence, though some constructions ("the whisper of circuits arranging themselves through synaptic plasticity rather than brute force") border on expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most lines advancing memory excavation or apparatus detail, but the piece suffers from template cadence in adjacent lines: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" patterns across the middle third, and synonym loops appear ("entangled memories" recurs without reweighting). Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "helix-minded engineer" works, but "thread silver through canyon," "unspool logic from trembling filaments," and "braided their way" cluster metaphors of weaving, threading, and coiling without clear vehicle coherence. The final packing image is clean and propulsive. Register drift into clinical terminology ("synaptic plasticity," "theta waves," "microvolt") clashes with the lyric frame at peak beats, and the phrase "quaking reverie" appears three times, once as ornament in the opening line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief excavation through neuroscience apparatus and canyon ritual offers a specific, non-obvious angle, and the broken periscope mirror as both literal tool and metaphor for fractured perspective earns freshness. The emotional truth—that protective caution can fossilize as much as it shelters—avoids platitude. The piece commits fully to its lyric-technical premise without retreat, and the flooded-quarter memory provides a grounded moral calculus beyond generic regret. The "helix-minded engineer" framing and the river-sensor calibration argument are particular to this narrator. Risk-taking in the reflection-heavy structure and compressed timeframe heightens thematic resonance, though the accumulative design limits immediate stakes and some metaphoric density feels like ornament rather than necessity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The helix-minded engineer trait frames the narrator's approach (coiling chaos, unspooling logic) and appears in multiple beats: apparatus assembly, theta-wave adjustment, and the acceptance that "I am a helix-minded engineer when I am most honest, I thought, not to build monuments, but to unspool and respool until meaning catches." The trait constrains the method (precision calibration, redundancy debate) and charges the final packing gesture. The narrator's micro-choices—dial adjustments, mirror angling, headband placement—reflect engineering discipline under emotional pressure. The river-sensor argument demonstrates how the trait created both conflict and connection with Mira. Cost is visible: the engineer's caution was "shelter and prison," and the ritual is an attempt to recalibrate rather than erase.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (angling to double the moon, refracting three moons, splitting and rejoining faces), and charges the closure by "giving back the hush." Its specific properties—"cleaved like ice yet still catching the moon with surgical grace"—enable the memory excavation method: "not for looking up but for looking in." The mirror unlocks the seam to the river-sensor memory when it tilts "with a click, refracting three moons where one hung." The brokenness itself becomes thematic: fractured yet functional, mirroring the narrator's grief. The object's return in the dawn packing anchors the final renunciation gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Entangled memories shape the dominant stake and appear in multiple beats: the opening framing ("braided their way through me and the one I had lost"), the theta-wave experiment that reveals "Mira's laugh rose like mineral springs, and mine answered, and the two sounds braided," and the flooded-quarter memory where faces split and rejoined. The concept drives the narrator's method—excavation through layered recall—and the vow to "modify our future by refusing to fossilize the living" addresses the entanglement directly. The "limestone of unsent emails and delayed apologies" concretizes how memories fused into a single mass. Cost is visible: the narrator cannot "tell which ache belonged to whom" and must learn the strata to release rather than preserve.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" appears twice as a descriptor of the narrator's method: the coil layout and the machine drift. The trait constrains the apparatus assembly ("every screw tightened to the quarter-turn my hands had memorized") and enables the theta-wave experiment to "swing without breaking its arc." The attribute reflects the tension between the narrator's redundancy preference and Mira's elegance, both "right, both wrong." However, the trait functions more as thematic label than as a visible on-page tradeoff that alters a specific choice under pressure. The cost connection is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action "modify" anchors the narrator's goal from the opening ("my task tonight was to modify the way memory fed light into itself") through the theta-wave adjustment ("the headset updated my cortex through synaptic plasticity, rewriting not facts but the pathways") to the vow at closure ("I could not undo, but I could modify our future by refusing to fossilize the living"). The river-sensor memory dramatizes the tension between modification and preservation: the narrator wanted redundancy, Mira wanted elegance, and the storm "altered our scale." The action defines the narrator's approach—recalibration rather than erasure—and the final packing gesture enacts the modification. Swappability test: replacing "modify" with "heal" or "repair" would shift the conceptual stakes from systemic adjustment to restoration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through synaptic plasticity" is named once in the middle passage as the mechanism by which "circuits arrange themselves" and again as the method by which "the headset updated my cortex." The phrase signals the means but does not constrain or enable specific on-page choices; the narrator's adjustments (theta-wave dials, bandwidth widening) proceed without visible mechanics tied to plasticity versus other methods. The concept functions as clinical vocabulary that fits the narrator's engineer frame but lacks the causal specificity required for higher integration. The method is stated rather than demonstrated through tactical friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is introduced in the opening line and constrains multiple choices: the narrator travels here "to start tilting too," uses the canyon walls' "faint harmonics" to tune the ritual, and positions the mirror to catch moonlight as a "trembling metronome." The canyon's trembling recurs in sync with the headset's updates, functioning as both physical correlate and trigger. The setting provides the isolation necessary for the experiment and the acoustic properties that amplify memory. The final image—"the canyon gave back the hush that my questions had borrowed"—charges the closure by framing the ritual as a negotiation with place. The setting is handled rather than merely described.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During a period of profound transformation" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs but functions as backdrop rather than live constraint. The timeframe is stated ("cities and codes and treaties, was tilting") but does not tighten specific decisions or alter tactics on the page. The canyon ritual unfolds over a single night from moonlight to dawn, and that contained window does provide a natural deadline, but the broader "period of profound transformation" remains ornamental. The phrase charges the thematic resonance (personal and societal change in parallel) but lacks causal involvement in the narrator's choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is seeded through Mira's belief that "dreams were slow fossils" and concretized in the narrator's vow: "My aim was never salvation in thunderclap form; it was to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams by learning the delicate grammar of release." The desire shapes the method—excavation in layers, cataloging rather than erasing—and charges the final packing gesture. Friction appears between the narrator's protective instinct (fossilizing grief) and the need to excavate gently. The river-sensor memory and flooded-quarter decision test the motivation by revealing what was abandoned and at what cost. The motivation is dramatized through the ritual's progression rather than merely stated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" appears in the opening line, recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("during a period of profound transformation for nations and for neurons, I stood within a quaking reverie"), and coheres through the trembling canyon, the shaking earth, and the machine's hum. The tone modulates with pressure: lyric density in the apparatus assembly, sharper focus in the flooded-quarter memory, and calm resolution in the dawn packing. The reverie frame allows reflection-heavy design without flattening immediacy, and the final "calm hypothesis" arrival shifts the tone to signal closure. However, "quaking reverie" as a phrase leans ornamental in the opening and risks thematic echo when restated near the end.</comment>
