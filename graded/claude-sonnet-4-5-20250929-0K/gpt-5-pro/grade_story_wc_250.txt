<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (mirror angling, shutter work, finger-raise silence). Interior contradiction appears in the tension between the vow and the urge to intervene, driving measured action. The boys are sketched lightly but their silent exchange and the older brother's near-drowning register as credible under the situational lens. Minor slip: the phrase "something older we both understood" edges toward label-only abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardian honors the vow, the boys are saved through silent ritual rather than speech, and the cost—maintaining wordlessness despite urgency—is felt throughout and crystallized in "our bargain stayed wordless." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through layered imagery (rain, mirror, shutters, star) and the final paragraph reweights the opening stillwater motif. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hand surfaces, converting passive watching into active retrieval without breaking silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slicked stairs, moored boats, and boathouse shutters constrain the guardian's tactics (mirror requires angle, shutters signal patterns, water holds danger). The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, shaping each move and charging the final image when pocketed. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "guttered sky," "wet grain," "warm light of the harbor lamp." No occupation-level depth required at this length; the canal as instrument is established and sustained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the boy without speech—is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through escalating ritual acts: mirror angles star, shutters tap sequence, light weaves into the arch. The hand surfacing is the key tightening that narrows outcome. Agency is present in every choice (shutter rhythm, mirror steadying, finger-raise) and the cost—preserving the vow while lives hang—is visible. No causal reversal required under this lens; the density and cadence shift suffice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as pedagogy, teaching through pattern rather than command—emerges organically from the guardian's actions and the repeated mirror/shutter/star motif. "To teach darkness the value of stars without using a single word" is enacted rather than stated at closure. The final image ("the city lighter by one lesson") reweights prior material: the vow's constraint becomes the lesson's vehicle. The dental mirror's inheritance charge deepens without explanation. No moralizing; the ending trusts resonance over summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the guardian notices "ripples I chose not to disturb," "shutters that lace the alleys," "the dark blinked, not angry, only drowsy." Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("spiralingly calm," "starched throat," "ticking against my ribs"). Compression and lyricism are purposeful and taught early. The boys' silence and the guardian's finger-raise function as clean dialogue substitutes. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses during the retrieval, longer cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a dented dental mirror that knew how to catch a tremble of light" establishes object, inheritance, and function). Sentence openings vary, rhythm supports the stillwater tone. Minor template-cadence slip: "I do not speak… not ever… a pact that says…" runs three explanatory clauses in sequence without fresh imagery. One paraphrase near the end: "watching the ripple I had not disturbed return to me" echoes the opening's "counting the ripples I chose not to disturb" without added pressure. No loops touch closure; deductions capped at −0.4 per guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—silent ritualized rescue via mirror-and-shutter semaphore—is specific and non-obvious. The guardian's vow transforms a rescue plot into a pedagogical act where method *is* message. The dental mirror as inheritance anchor and the shutter-language conceit feel fresh. Risk: sustained lyric compression and the wordless pact could alienate, but coherence holds. Transformation test passes: swap setting or ritual and the emotional arc collapses. No close echoes of famous material detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early, drives every beat (mirror angle, shutter sequence, finger-raise, mirror handoff), shapes closure ("I walked the cobalt dock after rain, shutters latched, boys safe"). Choices constrain: the vow forbids speech, forcing ritual. Cost: maintaining silence under life-threat pressure. Causal across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Appears in paragraph 6 (inheritance), paragraph 14 (harvests star), paragraph 21 (threads light), paragraph 26 (steadies during retrieval), paragraph 29 (handed to boy), paragraph 33 (taken back, ticks against ribs). Enables every key tactic, reweighted at closure as both tool and inheritance. Irreplaceable: its small size and reflective property drive the method. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shaped early ("we met in silent empathy like two pages touching") and governs all interaction: no dialogue, no questions, wordless handoff. The vow forbids speech; empathy is the substitute channel. Directly alters tactics (shutters and mirror replace voice) and charges the ending bargain. Causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mentioned once in paragraph 9 ("my hands spiralingly calm") and implied in the measured shutter work. Constrains approach: no panic, no shouting, rhythm over force. Visible in the lullaby-tapping and steady mirror. Functional but not charged at closure; mid-development role only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Central action: weaving light and shutter patterns (paragraphs 20, 22, 24) guides the brother to surface. The spiral traced in paragraph 24 ("tracing a slow spiral, inviting rather than demanding") is the pivot that softens the dark. Causally essential; swapping for "signal" or "call" would break the silent pedagogy premise. Shapes closure: shutters latched = ritual complete.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 8 (houses speak by shutter patterns), enacted paragraphs 20–24 (boathouse shutters opened/closed in taught sequence, "tapped a simple lullaby of forgiveness"). Mechanics matter: the sequence "for gathering strays" is the rescue method. Drives middle and ending; without shutters the brother stays submerged. Tight integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present throughout; the dock's wetness, moored boats, black arch, and water depth all constrain movement and enable the mirror/shutter method. The canal "keeps thoughts longer than people" and "needs to be reminded where to set them down" (paragraph 19)—setting personified as pressure. Charges closure: "cobalt dock after rain" bookends opening. Micro-setting (mirror, body) also used. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Announced paragraph 10 ("Tonight was different, arriving within the edge of a half-spoken secret") but not tracked as a ticking clock. The phrase colors tone but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Time feels unhurried; no urgency countdown. Present setup and thematic echo, minimal causal work in middle or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated paragraph 5, enacted throughout: the guardian uses light (star, lamp) and pattern (shutters) to guide without words, teaching the dark to yield rather than forcing. Friction: the vow constrains method, raising cost. Directly shapes tactics (no speech, mirror and shutter only) and charges closure: "praised the dark for learning, and the star for staying small." Causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Established opening line ("stillwater tension here is a kind of instrument") and sustained: hushed rain, measured shutter-taps, "the dark blinked… only drowsy." Modulates subtly when the hand surfaces (briefly urgent) then returns to calm at closure ("felt the night hum with patience"). Tone charges the final image and coheres under accumulative pressure. Strong fit.</comment>
