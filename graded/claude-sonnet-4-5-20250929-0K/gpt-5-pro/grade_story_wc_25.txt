<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular: the zodiac coin "oily from years," the whisper-vent key filed to "a question," the ability to identify walks by how "footsteps leaned or paused on rusted grating." Embodied emotion appears in the tears "bright as the aurora" and the careful folding of maps "so that sound ran downhill." The protagonist's choices—selecting vents, timing whispers, reading the courier's dragging left foot—are micro-decisions under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values (patience over volume, kindness over dominance). One deduction: the mother's backstory about reading tides by stars feels slightly generic, and the reflection on "gentleness travels" borders on thesis-stating rather than embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The challenge is signaled early (guide the courier by whispers before dawn), pressure accumulates through the storm's charged air and Otero's bellowing failures, and closure arrives as the courier emerges and the narrator articulates the method: "a whisper enrolls the corrugations and walks farther by not fighting." The cost is visible—Otero concedes, the crew cheers, the narrator trades tickets for tea and oranges spaced as beacons—reweighting the opening premise with a felt communal shift. Orientation is clear by line 2 (port city, labyrinth, maintenance worker). One minor causal seam: the "key with no apparent lock" that pops open whisper vents feels slightly under-explained in its mechanics, though the story teaches its function through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is tactile and job-specific: "corrugated steel funneled breath like a riverbed guides rain," vents with drain holes, "graffiti with the blue whale," "pallet of oranges left open," the sympathetic hum of steel under the storm. The geomagnetic storm affects props (radios stutter, compasses rattle, lights hiccup) and the narrator navigates by "the steel remembered me." The zodiac coin is used to rap panels "until the pitch softened," the key turns cams, and spatial choreography stays coherent (Bay Twelve, catwalks, tarps, tower). The micro-setting of vents and corrugations directly constrains and enables the whisper-tactic, meeting the 9+ gate. The storm charges the final image (aurora washing the cranes, green sky) without becoming postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove whispers travel farther than shouts by guiding the lost courier—is signaled in the opening third and tested throughout. Pressure tightens as Otero bellows uselessly, the narrator follows the courier's dragging left foot, and the teenager's panic rises. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: selecting vents, rapping the coin, refolding maps "so that sound ran downhill." The courier's emergence and Otero's concession provide a decisive tightening with visible cost (the wager, tickets traded for tea and oranges). One deduction: the storm itself remains atmospheric rather than imposing a time-based urgency that narrows tactics further; dawn is mentioned but never becomes a ticking clock that forces a hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the whisper versus shout becomes "guidance can be quiet and exact," "gentleness travels," and "patience with surfaces that prefer to carry kind waves." The zodiac coin (Gemini, "twins sharing one smile") charges the ending without becoming allegorical. The final image—steel keeps the whisper, narrator keeps their walks—reweights prior material with undeniable resonance. The mother's teaching ("maps must be folded, because the world prefers corners") integrates into the narrator's choice to refold maps mid-challenge. One minor slip: the line "I wanted to show them that gentleness travels" borders on thesis-stating rather than letting the dramatized action carry the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is consistent and job-specific: sounds as "paused on rusted grating," "the pitch softened," the courier's "left foot dragging a fraction late," "the fresh tar smell." Distance is stable (single POV, first-person). Diction is voice-motivated and lyric without obscuring clarity: "corrugations and walks farther by not fighting," "the world prefers corners," "a dog biting its tail." Dialogue is minimal (Otero's challenge, the courier's whispered "thank you") but functional. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure: short declaratives during the challenge ("Turn right…do not run"), longer reflective lines in the opening and closing. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: "From my belt I drew a key with no apparent lock, an old brass rod filed to a question. Pressed into certain drain holes, the key turned unseen cams that popped open whisper vents between containers." Figurative language is purposeful and grounded (riverbed guides rain, dog biting its tail, sympathetic rider). Minor deduction: a few near-synonyms cluster without adding pressure—"whisper along the seams," "let a thread of voice slip," "kept whispering her map"—and the final paragraph's "the steel kept my whisper, and I kept their walks" risks lyricism over propulsion. No clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core premise—whisper-navigation through container-maze acoustics during a geomagnetic storm—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of maintenance worker expertise (vent cams, folded maps, walk-identification) with the challenge structure feels earned rather than template. The zodiac coin and key are particular to this voice and setting. One deduction: the mother's backstory (reading tides by stars, teaching about folded maps) feels slightly generic as wise-ancestor exposition, and the wager-with-crew frame echoes familiar underdog-proves-skeptics-wrong beats. The story transforms these through sensory specificity and the acoustic logic of corrugated steel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The maintenance worker's choices create key turns: selecting vents, timing whispers, refolding maps, rapping the coin to soften pitch, and turning the key to open the gate. Present in the opening ("I was the labyrinth maintenance worker"), drives the middle challenge beats, and shapes the closure (opens the gate, the courier emerges). Specific costs tied to the role: knowledge of steel moods, patience with surfaces, and the decision to trade tickets for tea and oranges as beacons. Irreplaceable; no other role could perform these acoustic interventions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is weighted on maps at the challenge's start, Gemini glints up ("twins sharing one smile"), is rapped along a panel to soften pitch mid-challenge, and is recalled in the final third as "my mother's." Three distinct beats: setup, active use, and lyric reprise. Causal pressure: the coin helps adjust acoustic pitch. Specificity: Gemini's "twins sharing one smile" ties to the dual-voice theme. One deduction: the coin's role in altering pitch is asserted rather than demonstrated with consequence; it does not decisively enable a turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Folded maps frame the challenge (weighted with the coin, refolded "so that sound ran downhill") and recur in the mother's teaching ("maps must be folded, because the world prefers corners"). The concept shapes tactics: the narrator refolds to change acoustic flow. Present in setup, development (refolding mid-challenge), and closure (the teaching pays off thematically). Causal pressure: the fold changes how whispers propagate. Specificity: "turning the paper city so that sound ran downhill" is irreplaceable. One deduction: the maps' acoustic function is told more than shown; we do not see the fold directly alter a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attribute is signaled early ("Since childhood I could identify people's walks"), enables the central action (tracking the courier's "left foot dragging a fraction late on each turn"), and recurs in the closing line ("I kept their walks"). The trait constrains and enables: the narrator uses it to follow the courier through the maze and to position vents ahead of her movement. Visible cost: patient listening versus louder methods. Specificity: the "late left tapping like a nerve" is irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The challenge is signaled early ("His challenge was simple: guide the lost courier through the maze before dawn without touching a radio"), drives all middle beats (whisper-vent selection, Otero's bellowing failures, the narrator's acoustic adjustments), and resolves at closure (courier emerges, Otero concedes, crew cheers). The challenge redefines options: it forbids radios and pits whispers against shouts, forcing the narrator to use vents, maps, and the key. Felt cost: the wager, the public test, and the tickets traded afterward. Removing the challenge collapses the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The key is introduced in the first third ("From my belt I drew a key with no apparent lock, an old brass rod filed to a question"), its mechanics explained (pops open whisper vents via unseen cams), used mid-challenge to open vents, and employed at closure to turn the maintenance gate wide for the courier. Three beats: setup, development, and closure. Causal pressure: the key enables whisper-propagation and the final gate-opening. One deduction: the key's function is asserted cleanly but does not face a constraint or failure that forces a tactical shift; it works as described without cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures all choices: corrugated steel funnels whispers, vents with drain holes enable acoustic intervention, graffiti and scent markers guide navigation, and Bay Twelve locates the courier. The setting enables the protagonist's tactics (vent-opening, map-refolding, pitch adjustment) and supplies resources (whisper-conducting corrugations). Spatial choreography is coherent (catwalks, tarps, crane tower). The storm (green sky, rattled compasses, hiccuping lights) charges the closure image. Removing the labyrinth breaks the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present throughout (green sky, rattled compasses, static radios, charged air), affects props and atmosphere, and charges the final image (aurora washing the cranes). The "before dawn" deadline is mentioned but never tightens into a ticking clock that forces a hard choice. The storm complicates (shutting down radios) but does not escalate pressure moment-to-moment. Two gates: setup and closure participation. Middle development is atmospheric rather than tactical. The storm enables the challenge (radios down) but does not narrow options as time runs out.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("I had come into this storm to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts, and he knew it") is signaled early, dramatized through the challenge (whisper-vent tactics versus Otero's bellowing), and articulated at closure ("A shout slams and breaks; a whisper enrolls the corrugations and walks farther by not fighting"). The desire is conflicted: public proof versus patient method, the risk of failure. Visible cost: the wager, the crew's attention, and the narrator's choice to trade tickets for tea as beacons. The motivation shapes every tactic and the final thematic statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity coheres in the opening ("I moved with calculated spontaneity, seeming to improvise while stepping exactly where the steel remembered me") and modulates under pressure: the narrator's micro-adjustments (rapping the coin, refolding maps, timing whispers) read as improvised precision. The tone charges the final image: patience and exactness win the challenge. Rhythm and diction reflect the tone: short declaratives during tactical moves, longer reflective lines in opening and closing. One minor deduction: the tone is asserted in the opening line rather than taught solely through action, though subsequent beats dramatize it well.</comment>
