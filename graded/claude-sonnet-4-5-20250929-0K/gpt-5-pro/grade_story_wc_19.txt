<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's claustrophobia and its embodied manifestation—"my ribs fencing with themselves"—drives micro-choices throughout (limiting doll exposure, training listening "the way gardeners train vines"). Internal contradiction appears consistently: fear of enclosed spaces versus need to master enclosed silences. The final shift from seeing the bunker as cage to recognizing "even fear can be engineered into shelter" earns the change through prior sensory work. Minor: the emotional progression reads slightly overstated in places ("walls sprinting inward"), nudging register toward elevated diction, but the perceptual signature remains coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through density and pattern (three pours of silence, each reweighted). Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist alloys bunker silence with gilded hush, and the trellis "approves" by sprouting new tendrils; the final descent reframes the ladder from "jail bars" to "rib cage widening." Cost is visible: the protagonist must taste the traumatic bunker note and endure panic to achieve integration. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "I have mistaken the metal for the cage," reweighting prior material. Orientation is clear early (evening gravity inversion, trellis above clouds, narrator's bunker origin).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The trellis constrains action (hooking ankles, tapping for thanks, sprouting tendrils as approval) and charges the final image (ladder as "rib cage widening"). The doll functions as micro-setting/tool: its hollow torso holds silence, its porcelain surface anchors tactile memory. Gravity inversion and floating dew bells create coherent world rules. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("coins rinsed in sunrise," "rope and patience"). Minor: the clouds' behavior ("wrinkle and smooth like an enormous inhalation") reads slightly ornamental in mid-scene, not directly altering a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mastering traumatic silence to heal claustrophobia) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist tastes the bunker note—"I taste the bunker and I do not break"—and then alloys it with the gilded hush, creating a "kinder quiet." This forecloses the path of avoidance and narrows options to integration. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to open the doll fully despite risk. Cost is on-page: rehearsed panic, controlled breathing, and the visible struggle ("I keep the mouth of the doll a nail's width from my lips, breathing only when my pulse agrees"). The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (fear as both cage and shelter, quiet as map of identity) emerges through concrete particulars: the bunker note's "wet iron," the gilded hush's "coins rinsed in sunrise," the doll as vessel of maternal absence. The ending reweights the premise without stating a moral: "even fear can be engineered into shelter" is earned by the alloying action, and the final culinary metaphor ("cook with them when storms arrive") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The "stretching contracted" concept pervades syntax and image (updraft/gravity, bunker/sky, claustrophobia/open air). No late thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices silences as flavors, tastes quiet "as carefully as tea leaves," and translates sensory experience through a gardener's lexicon ("train my listening the way gardeners train vines"). Psychic distance is stable; filter verbs ("I realize") appear but fit the reflective voice. Diction stays character-bound except for occasional elevated turns ("intangibly tangible," "xenial") that read slightly imported but remain legible. The shared sip with the passing collector demonstrates purposeful psychic modulation. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong ("I taste the bunker and I do not break"), though some mid-scene sentences drift toward list-like parallelism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, interiority, metaphor). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at peak beats ("open the doll fully and let the bunker note breathe with the gilded one"). Minor scaffold appears: "I learned," "I call," "I realize" stems recur in adjacent paragraphs, creating template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "intangibly tangible" reads oxymoronic without clear grounding, and "dew bells...float like seeds" mixes vehicles slightly. One paraphrase loop: "claustrophobic child" and "his corridors shrank my breath" restate the same constraint. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (collecting flavors of silence during gravity inversion, using a doll as canister to heal claustrophobia) synthesizes familiar trauma-recovery arcs with specific, non-obvious world logic and sensory vocabulary. The bunker-builder backstory and maternal absence add specificity; the alloying of silences as culinary act transforms the metaphor into lived technique. The trellis as xenial (hospitable) and approving entity offers a fresh animistic touch. The transformation test holds: swapping elements would break the logic. Minor: "xenial trellis" and "intangibly tangible" read as prompt-adjacent labels that slightly flatten organic discovery, nudging the piece toward constructed rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist identified as bunker builder's child in opening lines. Development: claustrophobia constrains method (limiting exposure) and drives micro-choices (breath control, sipping in single breaths). Closure: decision to alloy bunker silence with gilded hush, thanking father silently, and reframing descent. Two distinct beats (tasting bunker note, sharing with collector) plus causal pressure (fear of corridors returning) and closure linkage. Cost is visible: enduring panic to achieve integration. High irreplaceability: the claustrophobia is the engine of both problem and solution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: doll introduced early as mother's vessel and canister. Development: handled in three pours (gilded, saltless, bunker note), each with distinct action (opening "as if uncorking a throat," limiting exposure, sealing). Closure: strapped to chest as "small heart nested against mine." Three distinct beats, causal pressure (hollow torso enables collection), closure linkage (final embodiment), specificity (porcelain, maternal origin). Cost connection: doll's use requires confronting maternal absence. Irreplaceability is high; no generic jar could carry this weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "gilded hush" introduced in first third as the first pour. Development: described as "coins rinsed in sunrise," it shapes tactics (sliding past fear, sweetening later storms). Closure: alloyed with bunker note to create "kinder quiet." Two distinct beats (tasting, alloying), closure linkage, specificity (warm metal, mercy, shine hidden beneath father's fear). Minor swappability: "gilded" could be "golden" or "bright" with small edits. Cost connection is implicit rather than direct.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: phrase "intangibly tangible" appears once mid-story as descriptor of silence. Development: functions thematically (silence as both absence and pressure) but does not constrain an action with visible cost. Closure: not reprised or reweighted. One thematic beat, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Label-only mention trends low; the concept is more ornamental metaphor than actionable trait. Swappability is high ("paradoxical presence," "felt absence").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: vines "sprout little bells of dew" early; later they "sprout new tendrils" as approval. Development: sprouting signals trellis response to the protagonist's recipe, enabling the micro-turn (trellis approves). Closure: implicit in the ladder becoming "rib cage widening"—a body learning to breathe, the opposite of closing. Two beats (dew bells, tendrils), causal pressure (approval alters environment), closure linkage (widening). Specificity is strong; the verb "sprout" unifies growth and response. Irreplaceability is solid but not total; "bloom" or "grow" could substitute with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: method signaled early ("by limiting exposure") and demonstrated in first pour. Development: shapes every tasting action ("holding the doll to my lips for a single breath," "nail's width from my lips, breathing only when my pulse agrees," shared sip "by limiting exposure"). Closure: the method enables the protagonist to taste the traumatic bunker note without breaking, directly producing the alloying. Three distinct beats, high causal pressure (method is the tactic), closure linkage, irreplaceability (no other method could manage the bunker silence). Cost is visible: patience and restraint under panic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "xenial trellis above the clouds" introduced in opening lines. Development: protagonist hooks ankles, taps for thanks, uses jars kept by trellis; trellis "teaches patience" and "approves" by sprouting tendrils. Closure: descent reframes ladder as "rib cage widening." Three beats, causal pressure (trellis holds and responds), closure linkage (ladder transformation), specificity (xenial hospitality, rungs as ribs). Minor swappability: "welcoming scaffold" could replace with edits. Cost connection is implicit (trellis requires patience).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "when gravity inverts for an hour" appears in opening line. Development: "hour is stretching contracted" mid-story; "hour leans toward its ending" triggers descent. Closure: gravity "rights itself" and protagonist descends. Two beats (mid, end), causal pressure (time limit forces choices), closure linkage (gravity return). Live clock shapes tactics (must finish before inversion ends). Minor swappability: "nightly window" could substitute with edits. Cost is implicit (compressed time for difficult work) rather than vividly felt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist declares "I hunt silences" and collects "flavors of different silences" early. Development: desire drives every pour (gilded, saltless, bunker), each with friction (fear of corridors returning, metallic panic). Closure: alloying the bunker note with gilded hush fulfills the quest and transforms it from collection to integration. Three beats, high causal pressure (desire structures all action), closure linkage, specificity (silence as map of identity). Cost is on-page: enduring trauma to achieve mastery. Dramatized conflict between want (collect) and fear (break).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "stretching contracted" introduced mid-story as descriptor of the hour. Development: tone modulates between claustrophobic compression ("walls sprinting inward," "ribs fencing") and expansive release ("updraft," "rib cage widening"). Closure: final image of descent as "body learning to breathe, the opposite of walls sprinting in" directly enacts the tone. Two beats (hour description, final image), closure linkage, specificity (elastic opposition between compression and expansion). Coherence is strong; tone charges the final image. Minor: phrase "stretching contracted" reads slightly ornamental at first mention, gaining weight only at closure.</comment>
