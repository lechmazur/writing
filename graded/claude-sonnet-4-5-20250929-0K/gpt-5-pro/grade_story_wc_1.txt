<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass artist POV is consistent and embodied through craft metaphors ("breath settle into the valley's long exhale," "steady as cooling glass"). Interior texture remains stable but the protagonist's agency is muted—most of the story is retrospective reconstruction rather than live decision-making under pressure. The final choice to create and distribute "Scorched Testament" is told summarily rather than dramatized with competing impulses. Micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent; the narrator processes the discovery smoothly without visible internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the journey retraces a ledger's route, gathers fragments (ledger, frost map, hidden kiln, mentor's glass), and culminates in a new artwork that embodies the assembled meaning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—creating "Scorched Testament" and distributing it as both orientation and warning—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the artist reclaims purpose through the chamber's long inhale). Cost is conceptual (the piece names the fire's origin and accepts the risk of continued exposure) but felt cost is thin; no on-page dramatization of what the artist forfeits or fears by making this public. The Accumulative lens holds, but the ending summarizes outcomes ("those who needed to cross could hold it") rather than showing a single charged image where stakes crystallize.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: starlight navigation, morning frost as cartographer, the hidden metal door, and the basalt kiln all constrain the search and shape the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the glass artist's lens ("ferned pane," "throat clogged with fused sand"). The kiln's physical state—scarred, unbroken, requiring a traveler flame—directly enables the closure action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the night walk, dawn study, and chamber entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering why the smuggler burned the studio and what the ledger arithmetic means. Pressure is investigative rather than escalating—each clue (ledger, frost, door, kiln, glass) adds knowledge without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The final action (creating and distributing the new piece) is a response but not a tightening; no visible cost dramatized on the page (e.g., fear of retaliation, loss of anonymity, severed safety). Agency is present but the resolution feels like completion of a puzzle rather than a choice under competing pressures. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mentor's secret refuge is revealed, reweighting the fire from mere warning to erasure of a sanctuary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of art remembering what we refuse to emerges organically through the scorched testament fused in the floor, the mentor's glass holding "breaths and pauses," and the final piece encoding safe passage as negative space. The closing image—standing in quiet canyon, purpose gathered in reclaimed pauses, stars as unlit kilns—reweights the opening's "long exhale" with earned stillness. No overt moralizing. The piece resists stating its thesis outright; meaning accrues through craft metaphors (fire, glass, breath, pause) that charge the ending without becoming allegorical placeholders.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person narration maintains consistent distance and a glass artist's perceptual signature: heat/cooling, breath/exhale, luminous/shadow. Diction stays within the artist's plausible lexicon, blending craft terms with lyric compression ("canyon listened," "frost is a quiet cartographer"). Purposeful elision of the "attempt" details in opening serves closure when the chamber reveals the mentor's refuge and the fire's true motive. One friction: the phrase "drifting resonance" appears twice verbatim (penultimate and final paragraphs), a minor template echo that slightly flattens the ending's texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery, setting, or thematic layering. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences in reflective beats and shorter units during the search. Two frictions: paraphrase loop in "It was not empty, just spacious, the kind of hush where a life can set without cracking. I breathed with it" restates stillness without adding pressure. Stock metaphor "leaned like folded wings" (crates) is decorative. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt that memory tug," "felt my purpose gather") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy. No severe artifacts, but these accumulate to prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass art, smuggling ledger, hidden kiln, and a mentor's secret refuge is specific and non-obvious. The "scorched testament" as both ruin-inscription and final artwork title offers a fresh doubling. Emotional progression—from survivor to maker reclaiming purpose—avoids generic resilience templates through craft-specific detail (kiln throat, negative space as route). One derivative element: the mentor-reveals-hidden-knowledge frame is familiar, though the glass/breath encoding adds originality. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from opening ("I am a luminous glass artist"). Development: the artist retraces the ledger route and interprets clues, but these are investigative observations rather than pressured choices. Payoff: the artist creates "Scorched Testament" and distributes it at closure. The character drives all discovery beats, but key turns (finding the door, warming the kiln, mixing the new batch) are recounted summarily rather than shown as micro-choices under competing options. Causal role is present across beats but agency is muted by retrospective narration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("charcoal smuggler's ledger strip, brittle with soot"). Development: the ledger is consulted in multiple beats (canyon walk, door pattern match, final palimpsest reading against the glass). Its numbers and crossings guide the search and align with the discovered kiln's map. Payoff: placed on the kiln lip and read against the glass to complete the score. Handled across three distinct beats with evolving function; the ending reprise reweights it as score rather than mere clue. Cost connection is thin—no visible sacrifice tied to possessing it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "scorched testament fused into the floor" appears early as the ruin-inscription. Development: the kiln holds "a scorched testament continued" in warped glass; warming it exhales shapes of footfalls. Payoff: the new artwork is named "Scorched Testament" and functions as both accusation and orientation for future crossings. The concept constrains the search (reading heat-written traces) and shapes the final piece's form (encoding route as negative space). Present across all three gates and charges the closure naming, but the ending summarizes outcomes rather than showing a single charged image where the testament redefines a live choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: declared in opening paragraph ("I am steadily adaptive, taught by fire to lean without breaking"). Development: brief reprise when learning kiln timings ("Steadily adaptive hands learned new timings"). Payoff: absent from closure. The trait is label-only; no on-page moment where adaptiveness constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. The two mentions describe rather than dramatize the attribute. Swappable with "resilient" or "flexible" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("I chose to retrace the route it hinted, step by careful step"). Development: the retracing action drives all middle beats—following ledger patterns, reading frost maps, finding the hidden door. Payoff: the chamber discovery and kiln activation complete the retraced route. The action is causally central and organizes the entire structure. One friction: the retracing itself is recounted rather than shown as a series of pressured micro-decisions; the narrator tells us the choice was made, then summarizes the walk and discoveries. Still, major turns depend on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: present in first third ("patterns emerged in its grime like constellations"). Development: frost patterns in morning light provide the map ("ferned pane etched a map the heat had hidden, veins pointing toward a bend"). The frost script is followed over stones to the hidden door. Payoff: the final piece holds "the route as negative space" for others to "read the patterns in morning frost as music." Signaled early, used to find the chamber, and encoded in the closure artwork. Two gates clearly met; closure participation is thematic (others will read frost) rather than a live dramatized beat where the method alters the artist's final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase and opening line ("quiet canyon under stars"). Development: canyon paths guide the night walk; rock and brush hold frost maps; the canyon's bend hides the metal door; basalt kiln is carved into canyon geology. Payoff: final paragraph returns to "quiet canyon under stars" with reweighted stillness. Setting constrains navigation and supplies the hidden chamber; the kiln's basalt construction is essential. Micro-setting (body, tool, object) is also present (ledger, kiln, glass). Closure reprise is charged but adds emotional resonance rather than altering a tactical choice at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("after surviving the attempt"). Development: the timeframe motivates the investigation but does not tighten choices; elapsed time is untracked. Payoff: "as evening fell again" marks the end, but no clock pressure shapes the final decision. The temporal anchor is present and frames the journey (post-fire quest → evening closure), but time does not constrain or accelerate tactics. Swappable with "weeks after" or "months after" without altering structure. Two gates (setup, payoff) but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: explicit in first third ("I wanted to discover purpose in the pauses"). Development: the search for purpose drives investigation of ledger arithmetic and kiln secrets. Payoff: "felt my purpose gather in the pauses I had reclaimed." Desire is stated and repeated but not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; no moment where discovering purpose competes with safety, speed, or another goal. Told-only across three beats. The motivation organizes the quest but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: opening establishes lyric resonance ("breath settle into the valley's long exhale"). Development: tone remains cohesive—reflective, craft-inflected, quietly determined—without emotional spikes or tonal breaks. Payoff: final lines ("drifting resonance" verbatim, "stars cooled above like unlit kilns") charge the stillness with earned weight. Tone modulates from survivor's steadiness to maker's renewed purpose without jarring shifts. The phrase "drifting resonance" recurs verbatim in penultimate and final paragraphs, a minor template echo, but the overall tone shapes the ending's quiet authority.</comment>
