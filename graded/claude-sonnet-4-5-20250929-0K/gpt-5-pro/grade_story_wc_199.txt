<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fen's interiority is often abstract and label-driven ("Mossy delight," "bound caution") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to release seeds is stated but not dramatized with visible internal conflict or trade-off in the moment; we're told he "reeled" and then trusted, but the competing impulses don't collide on the page. The progression from hoarder to releaser lacks micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The transformation is asserted through poetic description rather than earned through scene-level struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through monument-building, the Moonstone triggers a shift, and the final release reconfigures the arbor's grammar. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: letting go forecloses hoarding), but the cost is more thematic assertion than felt price—no on-page moment shows what Fen loses by emptying his catalogues. Orientation is delayed but legible by ~150 words; the hush/prophecy frame provides temporal anchor. The lens holds, but cost proof is weak: "his catalogues were towers in his mind" is told, not shown collapsing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Ashen skyborne arbor constrains action (villages hang beneath, tipping risk) and the monument's physical assembly is concrete. Spatial choreography of seed drawers, bark surfaces, and falling leaves tracks clearly. Sensory detail is often metaphorical ("sepia sentences," "ash and candy") rather than immediate; the arbor functions more as symbolic architecture than lived-in pressure. The final lifting "a finger-width higher" does charge the image, meeting the 9+ test partially, but much description is ornamental rather than tactically integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode arbor's language to prevent village disaster. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Moonstone reveals the missing glyph ("release, not store"), forcing a reversal of Fen's catalogue philosophy. However, the turn lacks visible trade-off cost on the page—no dramatized hesitation over specific seeds, no named loss. The escalation is conceptual rather than enacted under pressure. Regional folklore supplies threat but never tests Fen with a live consequence; the villages' safety is background rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (order as question, listening as answer) emerges organically from the monument-building and seed-release structure. The final image—"monuments were winds and whose ink was flight"—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the grammar/monument metaphor and the shift from storing to scattering. However, some lines edge toward thesis statement: "order was a question and listening the only honorable answer" is near-explicit. The piece resists tidy closure, but recurrence of "mossy delight" and "transformed always" feels token rather than charged by cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register; perceptual signature is poetic and distanced ("whispering tremor," "braided in one wind"). Psychic distance remains elevated throughout, which mutes urgency at peak beats. Diction is purposefully archaic and compressed ("thistlefall," "scorched lichen and nectar"), fitting the fable-like tone, but the elevated register flattens emotional variation—calm assembly and climactic release share identical syntactic texture. No dialogue; internal voice is coherent but lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is extremely high: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("patient whale made of wood," "frostbitten firefly," "soft comets sketching relief"). In peak beats (Moonstone flare, drawer-emptying), the ornamental phrasing competes with action clarity—"the monument rang like spring" decorates rather than clarifies the arbor's response. Template cadence appears in paired clauses: "he would prod... he knew... he listened... he adjusted." Paraphrase loops: "building tiny monuments" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines perform one job (describe) rather than advancing multiple threads. No major causality breaks, but momentum drags under metaphor weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor, living grammar, and monument-as-translation offer a fresh synthesis of language-as-ecology. The premise commits fully and follows implications (folklore warnings, villages at risk, final release). However, emotional arc and plot structure are familiar: reluctant keeper learns to let go. The Moonstone as clarity-lens and the "release not store" reversal feel earned in hindsight. Diction is distinctive but borders on generic fantasy lyricism in places ("velvet bough hollows," "sepia sentences"). Transformation test: the core could function in otherkeeper-learns-to-release frames with minor swaps. Risk-taking in structure (highly compressed, non-linear monument assembly) is present but does not fully heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Fen's choice to release seeds is the story's climax, but the decision is compressed into a single paragraph after the glyph clarifies; we see result (drawers emptied) more than process of choosing. He appears in setup (sorting, reading) and middle (building monument, discovering Moonstone) but his agency in those beats is observational—leaves speak, he assembles. The final release alters arbor and folklore, providing closure participation with cost (catalogues emptied), but the choice itself lacks on-page friction or visible trade-off moment. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is passive assembly. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity high (only a sorter could perform this role).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Moonstone appears early (thistlefall morning), is used twice (held as lens to see sequences, flares to reveal missing curve), and its properties (shimmers without light, clarifies stutters) directly enable the final glyph discovery. Without it, Fen cannot decode the release command. Present in setup, active in middle turn (flare shows missing curve), and mentioned at closure (tucked in thumb crease as reminder). Three gates met; two distinct functional beats; high specificity and causal pressure. Closure linkage is strong but not direct—it enables the turn rather than appearing in the final image. Swappability is low; its shimmer/lens mechanics are unique.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Regional folklore frames stakes (misread phrases tilt arbor, spill villages) and bookends the story (opening context, closing transformation). It shapes Fen's caution ("bound caution," trusting grammar) but does not constrain a specific on-page choice—villages never appear, no NPC voices folklore, threat remains abstract. Present in setup and payoff (folklore changes at end) but absent from middle decision beats. The tipping-arbor risk is told, not tested. Two gates met (setup, thematic closure); middle development missing. Cost is conceptual (cultural memory shifts) rather than felt. Functional but mostly atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is introduced as prophecy, repeated twice (old notes, final paragraph), and asserted at closure ("He, like the arbor's proverb, emerges transformed always"). Label-only use: we're told transformation happens but don't see Fen's capabilities or worldview change on the page between monument start and drawer-emptying. No visible trade-off tied to this trait; it describes outcome rather than constraining process. Present in setup (as lore) and payoff (as fulfilled claim) but does not enable or block any middle action. Two gates met; ornamental integration. Summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Prod" appears five times: prod tiny archways to listen for alignment correction (twice in monument assembly), prod base once more before Moonstone flare, "prod fewer arches" in the coda. The action is Fen's diagnostic tool, tied to his iterative method and the final philosophy shift (prodding less, releasing more). Present in setup (habit), drives middle beat (base prod triggers flare that reveals glyph), and reweighted at closure (prod fewer = new approach). Three gates met; two distinct beats; moderate causal pressure (enables discovery but doesn't force the release choice). Specificity moderate; another touch-based action could substitute. Cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Monument-building is Fen's core method, introduced early ("building tiny monuments to forgotten things upon the bark"), drives middle escalation (waist-high sculpture, aligning arches like stars), and is explicitly reweighted at closure ("letting go" and monuments become "winds"). The method shapes every tactical choice (which twig, feather placement, prodding alignment) and the final insight (monuments crumble, words climb him). Three gates met; central to three beats (setup habit, complex monument assembly, conceptual transformation). High causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable; the grammar/monument metaphor is the story's engine. Visible cost: he must abandon hoarding to honor the method's lesson.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The arbor is established early ("drifted above the gray valley") and its stakes are declared (tipping spills villages). It lifts "a finger-width higher" after Fen's release, confirming success. Present in setup, middle (bark provides monument substrate, resin gathers as hush deepens), and closure (lifting, sentences shift tense). Three gates met; moderate beat involvement. Causal pressure is indirect—arbor provides workspace and threat but doesn't block or enable specific moves. Swappability moderate; another living structure could function similarly. Closure participation is reactive (responds to Fen's choice) rather than causally active. No visible price tied to arbor itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" bookends the story (opening paragraph, final line) and is repeated mid-story ("the hush deepened"). The timeframe signals liminal urgency but never creates a deadline or tightens tactics—Fen works at his own pace, no clock pressures release timing. Present in setup and closure; middle mentions are atmospheric. Two gates met (setup, thematic closure); middle development absent. Vague tracking; we don't know how long assembly takes or when hush ends. Lyric resonance is strong (purposeful reprise reweights meaning) but causal pressure is near-zero. Swappable with other liminal time phrases.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Decoding the arbor's leaf-message is Fen's explicit goal, introduced early ("calling was simple: To decode the message") and pursued across all beats (sifting, monument assembly, Moonstone lens use, glyph discovery). The motivation drives setup, middle (every monument choice serves decoding), and closure (successful decode yields release command). Three gates met; high beat involvement. Friction is conceptual—decode reveals "release not store," challenging his hoarding—but the conflict is compressed and told ("The Orderly seed sorter reeled") rather than dramatized with competing wants. Cost is implied (catalogues vs. villages) but not embodied in a struggle beat. Strong integration, moderate dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears three times (opening, middle sifting, final greeting) as Fen's affective signature. Tone is consistent—lyric, patient, reverent—but static; no modulation during the crisis turn when he discovers release-not-store. The monument assembly and drawer-emptying beats carry identical syntactic calm and metaphor density, flattening urgency. Present in setup and closure (purposeful reprise), mentioned once in middle. Two gates met; coherence high but pressure-responsiveness low. The tone charges the final image moderately (delight persists despite transformation) but doesn't vary to reflect internal conflict. Functional but replaceable; another contemplative mood could serve.</comment>
