<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied: the fob recorder, the inherited moonshine route, the physical placement of objects during negotiation. Internal contradiction surfaces when she pours moonshine for the dead but refuses revenge, choosing "understanding sharp enough to thwart my future gullibility." The partner's mask-slipping and belt-buckle reflex are well-observed body language under pressure. Minor slip: some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("a comfort that let unease speak only the truth"), but the physicalized choices—letting false starts multiply, withholding the nod—earn the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Anchors land early (pirate market, tide, watch fob). The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered silence, false starts, and the fob "inhaling tiny collisions" until the belt-buckle confession crystallizes the betrayal's sound. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she walks away with proof, forecloses revenge, and keeps the hush—visible cost in renouncing confrontation. The "ribbon of moonshine for the dead" and his refusal to share lock the guilt's outline. One meaningful deepening (the buckle moment) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rotting pier, swells sighing beneath planks, bucket of eels, swollen crate with orange-blooming nails—all charge the negotiation and constrain movement (the boat horn discourages his bolt). The fob becomes micro-setting, handled across beats and charging the final image when it "hung quiet, curiously steadfast, as if holding open a breathing door." Sensory selection reflects urgency: nail-against-nail, breath swallowing, gull yawns. The market's salt "stayed in me" ties setting to closure. Easily clears the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the sound of trust breaking, not revenge. The protagonist's agency is active throughout—she controls the false starts, lets silence multiply, and uses stillness to "bend his route like warm glass." The belt-buckle moment is the meaningful tightening that narrows options; the partner's mask holds but the pier "groaned disagreeably." Cost is visible: she renounces revenge, pours moonshine he refuses, and accepts a silence that confesses. One deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient and the price charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: trust's sound "never thundered; it wore kindness until the last." The fob shifts from ghost-vessel to proof to breathing door without stating a moral. The "truce of hush" operates through gesture and silence, not declaration. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the proof lets her survive without absolution, and the pier "seemed smaller" while the salt stayed. No thematic echo or moralizing; the final image reweights the entire negotiation. Complexity without false equivalence: the partner's guilt is precise, not redeemed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "nerves were ropes tarred and tight," "his mask held, but the pier groaned disagreeably." Diction is consistent and voice-particular. The sign-language negotiation avoids dialogue but maintains character distinction through gesture and reaction. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" recurs four times as a tag rather than embodied texture, and "comforting unease" in the opening edges toward abstraction. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: short declaratives tighten as the belt buckles, then lengthen as she walks the shoreline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: "He set a crate between us, wood swollen, iron nails blooming with orange" does setting, status, and decay. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Two minor issues prevent higher band entry: "curiously steadfast" appears four times without functional variation, creating a phrase-loop artifact. "Comforting unease" in paragraph one and "a comfort that let unease speak only the truth" near closure echo without added pressure—mild paraphrase loop. Neither touches the closure beat's core mechanics (the fob clipped, the shoreline steps), so capped deduction applies. No filter stacks, no template cadence, strong propulsion overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—silent negotiation to capture betrayal's sound via rewired fob—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "moonshine runner" trope through the daughter's shift from vengeance to epistemological proof feels earned. The belt-buckle as involuntary confession and the "truce of hush" as marketplace rule are fresh inflections. Risk-taking in withholding dialogue and letting accumulative pressure replace causal reversals succeeds without obscuring clarity. The ending's resonance (salt stayed, pier smaller, breathing door) feels inevitable in hindsight. Bonus for structural boldness within the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening ("I came… bringing my father's ghost"). Development: she controls the false starts, places the fob, withholds the nod—multiple choices that narrow his options. Closure: she clips the fob, walks the shoreline, keeps the proof. Causal pressure throughout: her decisions bend his route, force the buckle confession, and secure the silence. Visible cost: renouncing revenge, pouring moonshine he refuses. Irreplaceable: the specific inheritance (runner's daughter) drives the motive and the method. High integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setup: "antique watch fob… rewired its hollow center into a shy recorder." Development: dangles like bait, placed on crate, slides across, touched "as if it could still the hour he ruined," inhales collisions. Closure: "clipped the fob back to its chain… ticking faintly against my wrist… hung quiet, curiously steadfast, as if holding open a breathing door." Causal work in multiple beats, charged specificity (the recorder function matters), and the final image reweights it from ghost-vessel to proof to breathing portal. Indispensable to both method and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "Here we kept a truce of hush until sunrise, or until the law sniffed. Agreed, I signed back." Development: the hush shapes every tactic—no words, gesture-only bargaining, silence "layered with gull yawns and hook squeals." Closure: "We kept still until sunrise, a contract as old as fear, paid fully… the market's hush ending below." The concept defines the stakes, constrains options (boat horn stops his bolt), and the ending honors the contract with cost. Specific mechanics matter; removes it and the negotiation collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I walked in curiously steadfast, as if my nerves were ropes tarred and tight." Development: "I waited, curiously steadfast, until the unmissable sound I needed ripened." Closure: "The fob hung quiet, curiously steadfast, as if holding open a breathing door." The trait enables the waiting tactic that forces the buckle confession—visible cost in sustained tension. Repeated four times; two instances feel mildly ornamental (final third usage edges toward thematic echo rather than action constraint). Still, the attribute constrains the middle beat and charges the final image, meeting two gates solidly and touching closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in "I wanted to capture the sound of trust breaking" and explicit when she begins multiplying false starts. Development: "Each pause thwarted his practiced rhythm… I let the false starts multiply, tiny storms that wore his reefs down." The thwarting tactic is the mechanism that produces the belt-buckle confession. Closure: the thwarting secures the silence and the proof. Major turns trace to this action; swapping it would require rewriting the method and the partner's unraveling. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setup: "We began our bargaining through false starts, gestures too early or too late." Development: "Each pause thwarted his practiced rhythm… my hand trembled thoughtfully, and the start evaporated into another listening stillness… I let the false starts multiply." The method is the tactic, enacted multiple times, and it forces the involuntary confession (belt buckle). Closure: the false starts secure the hush and the proof. Mechanics signaled early, shape the middle escalation, and deliver the ending. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "pirate market hidden beneath a rotting pier before the tide turned… Under the planks the swells sighed." Development: the partner waits "near a bucket of eels," the crate is set between them, the boat horn discourages his bolt, "the pier groaned disagreeably." Closure: "the market folded its corners… the pier seemed smaller, but the market's salt stayed in me." The setting supplies resources (eels as atmosphere, crate as stage), the horn constrains his escape, and the groaning pier becomes a witness that feeds the fob. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "before the tide turned… until sunrise, or until the law sniffed." Development: "We kept still until sunrise, a contract as old as fear, paid fully. When the gulls started scolding…" The clock shapes the truce's duration and the partner's pressure to wait. Closure: "By daylight the pier seemed smaller." The timeframe constrains both parties and determines the ending moment. Not moment-by-moment urgent, but the deadline is present, tracked, and alters tactics (he can't bolt; she can wait). Solid integration with moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I wanted to capture the sound of trust breaking, not rumor, not rage. That sound had cost my father…" Development: the desire drives every choice—placing the fob, multiplying false starts, waiting for the buckle. Friction surfaces: "My aim was not revenge but understanding sharp enough to thwart my future gullibility." Closure: "I had finally heard why… I would not trade that sound." The want is dramatized through tactical choices and the cost of renouncing revenge. Strong integration; the motivation is the engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "Under the planks the swells sighed, a comforting unease that steady hands welcomed." Development: tone oscillates between threat and ritual—"silence here was louder than haggling," the eel bucket, the partner's smile "like negotiating with a mirror." Closure: "It was not absolution, but it was a record I could survive… a comfort that let unease speak only the truth." The tone charges the final image and modulates with pressure (the buckle wince tightens it, the shoreline walk releases). Coherent throughout; the final callback reweights the opening phrase with cost.</comment>
