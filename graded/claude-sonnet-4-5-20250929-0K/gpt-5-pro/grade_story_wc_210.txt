<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is embodied through concrete choices: chalking plans on shale, setting glass jars where wells would be, coaxing algae into loops. Internal conflict operates through simultaneous impulses—remembering wishes as confetti that clogged gutters while choosing discipline over spectacle. The arrival of two women who "take places at the ropework and the kiln frames as if rehearsing memory" demonstrates relationship pressure, though their characterization remains thin. Minor deduction for the amber bottle functioning more as symbolic prop than embodied constraint on his hands-on work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by line 2 (kneeling alchemist, pebbled strand, paper-lantern cove). Closure achieves Charged Poise—the final image of measuring by lantern light with the sea as metronome crystallizes the civilization-building project with undeniable cost (patience, refusal of rescue, stripped romanticism). The accumulation builds through pattern: lantern light → amber lens → projected map → scaffolds → two women joining, each beat reweighting "ghost town revival" from metaphor to literal practice. Cost is conceptual and felt: "Not a spell, but a civilization conceived at weather's lip, held to shape by light."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cove functions as active constraint: tide erases chalk plans, forcing working memory; lanterns project gridded geometry that defines streets; tide pools supply algae for tiny economies. The amber bottle as micro-setting object charges the final image, refracting lantern gleam into neighborhoods and canals traced in light. Spatial choreography remains clear (strand → cliff wall → skiff arrival). Minor gap: the two women's spatial entry and positioning could be more precisely staged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining civilization from sobered bones) is signaled early and deepens through accumulation: rejecting wishcraft → chalking plans → populating silence with scaffolds → speaking to empty benches → two women arriving. Agency operates through endurance and micro-choices under constraint (holding the bottle steady when storms bruise the horizon, handing shells to mark homes not yet built). The tightening is conceptual rather than causal—each beat forecloses romantic shortcuts and commits to "exacting work" with visible cost. The women's arrival complicates without resolving; they join the discipline rather than solving it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber bottle's constraint (a lens that will never open), the chalked rule "Tone: None," and streets named for verbs not heroes (Measure, Temper, Learn, Share, Begin Again). The final image answers the thematic question without stating it: civilization arises not from wishes but from "effort and error" held to shape by light and repeated action. Subtext operates in "the softest applause, tide over shingle" and the unopened bottle kept "like a vow." The piece resists false complexity; its simplicity is earned through specificity (mollusk-shell cairns, brine shrimp loops, kiln armatures).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: the alchemist notices "invisible streets sketch themselves," "lantern strings" loop in his head, "confetti that clogged gutters." Diction stays controlled ("deserted alchemist," "wedge of wrack," "arbors should climb") with purposeful elevated register that matches the conceptual stakes. The brief dialogue ("Tomorrow, we wake the ovens...") integrates cleanly as civic pedagogy rather than conversation. Minor rhythmic uniformity in mid-section beats (several "He [verb]" stems) slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "the cove answers with the softest applause, tide over shingle" provides sound, rhythm, and thematic resonance). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (lantern as grammar, bottle as lens/discipline/constraint). Two frictions: (1) paraphrase loop between "jugs that never open" and "bottle with no opening" across adjacent beats; (2) template cadence in paragraph 18-20 with repeated "he [verb]" stems. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. The phrase "ghost stage where gulls write cursive no one answers" exemplifies the piece's high textural control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes post-wish ennui with civilization-building through a fresh constraint: the unopened amber bottle as lens rather than container. The "Tone: None" gallery rule transforms a potential melodrama into disciplined reimagining. Verbs-as-street-names and algae-brine-shrimp loops provide non-obvious specificity. Risk: the piece commits fully to its anti-romantic stance, refusing rescue prayers and holding silence without spectacle. The transformation test passes—swap names and the vision collapses. Minor proximity concern: the lantern-as-projector and light-as-blueprint echo familiar maker-myth imagery, though the execution elevates through cumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The deserted alchemist drives all key turns: rejecting false comfort, chalking plans then letting tide erase them, holding the amber bottle to project streets, speaking to empty benches, handing shells to the arriving women. Present in setup (paragraph 2), development (chalking, projecting, populating scaffolds), and closure (measuring by lantern light with the women). Cost is visible: he shivers, does not pray, keeps working through storms. High causal involvement across beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in paragraph 6 (setup), reappears in paragraph 8 (casting gridded geometry), paragraph 21 (held before the greatest lantern to trace armatures), paragraph 31 (held to sharpen witness), and final paragraph (keeps its unopened silence like a vow). It constrains choice: will not pour/yield/unscrew, teaching the alchemist discipline through constraint. Its reweighted meaning at closure—vow rather than container—charges the ending. High beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival shapes stakes from paragraph 17 onward: imagining revival "not as a festival, but as a slow calling-in of breath from scattered lungs." It drives tactics: setting glass jars where wells would be, rigging nets where arbors should climb, populating silence with scaffolds. Closure beat makes it literal: "Together they begin the ghost town revival, measuring by lantern light." Development and payoff gates met; alters options throughout second half.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" appears in paragraph 3, constraining the alchemist's stance: he pushes aside stories of benevolent tides and forgiving gods, refuses to pray for rescue when storms come (paragraph 29). Cost is visible: he shivers but does not pray, embraces discomfort. The trait enables his choice of "purpose without anthem or applause" and persists through closure. Present in setup and development with visible tradeoff; moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Conceive" anchors the motivation (paragraph 12: "to reimagine an entire civilization") and recurs in the final line: "a civilization conceived at weather's lip." Major turns trace to this action: chalking plans, drafting a civil tongue, naming streets for verbs. The women's arrival responds to what has been conceived (paragraph 32: they see projected streets and take places). High causal involvement, setup and closure presence, reweighted meaning at end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is signaled in paragraph 13 ("keeping the steps alive through working memory alone") and paragraph 27 ("he juggles it only through working memory, moving parts of the plan across his mind"). It shapes tactics: plans are erased by tide, forcing reliance on memory rather than written record. Constraint is visible and persists. Present in development and referenced at crisis; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove provides resources and constraints: brittle lantern husks frame the opening rule ("Tone: None"), lantern gleam arranges into neighborhoods when refracted through the amber bottle, the cove's cliff becomes a living map at dusk (paragraph 21). The strand supplies wrack, tide pools, shingle. The cove "answers with the softest applause" at closure, charging the final image. High beat involvement, setup and closure presence, alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" frames the opening and closing lines, establishing the post-wish timeframe as constraint. It tightens decisions: wishes are remembered as "confetti that clogged gutters," forcing the turn to discipline. The timeframe shapes the alchemist's stance ("It is, after the last wish is granted, that the real grammar must be learned"). Present in setup and closure, reweighted at end with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to reimagine an entire civilization is dramatized through concrete choices: chalking plans (paragraph 13), imagining ghost town revival (paragraph 17), naming streets for verbs (paragraph 25), drafting a civil tongue (paragraph 23). Friction between want and cost is visible: "exacting work," shivering through storms, speaking to empty benches. The women's arrival tests and validates the desire. High causal involvement, setup through closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Tone: None" is chalked on the lanterns (paragraph 4), studied "like an oath against melodrama," and honored in paragraph 25 ("honoring the old chalked order: Tone: None"). It constrains the narrative stance: no rescue prayers, no anthems, just "exacting work" and "softest applause." Tone modulates with pressure (shivering, holding steady) while maintaining restraint. The directive charges the final image by refusing spectacle. High integration, setup and closure presence.</comment>
