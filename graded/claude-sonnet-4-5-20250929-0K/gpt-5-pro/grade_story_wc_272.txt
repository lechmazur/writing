<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The portrait artist's interior life is rendered through concrete imagery (hands delaying the first line, the broken box like her chest) and her micro-choices in the tower show genuine agency under pressure. The climactic untangling sequence embodies her shift from fragmentation to focus, and the final gallery vision demonstrates earned change. However, the interiority occasionally edges toward abstraction ("luminescent ache," "fragmented reality") without full embodiment, and the middle reflective passages dilute immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation clearly (lighthouse library, fog, portrait artist) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through image layering (tarot cards, knots, beam), a pattern break occurs when she untangles the shutters, and the final gallery redesign reweights her vocation with conceptual cost (honoring fragmentation rather than fixing it). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the artist's understanding of her work shifts from "steady gaze" to "constellation of tides." One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds, though the causality between untangling and insight could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior—spiral stairs, lens rings, shutter ropes, the beam itself—directly constrains and enables the protagonist's final choice: untangling the mechanism restores light and metaphorically clarifies her vision. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her artistic POV (fog as feathered, dust as sentences, moon rings on floorboards). The "wick once curled like sleeping kelp" and "fogbones" demonstrate voice-specific perception that charges the space beyond postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redesigning how her eyes hold a life—is signaled early and tightens through the untangling action, which forecloses the path of fragmentation-as-failure and opens fragmentation-as-honoring. The physical task (freeing knots) interweaves with internal shift, and the restored beam functions as a visible tightening that narrows her options to acceptance. The cost is more conceptual than visceral: she must abandon the "steady gaze" model, though the full price of this renunciation could be more legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lighthouse's broken mechanism and the artist's acceptance of fragmentation as a valid mode rather than a defect. The tarot cards (Tower, Hermit, Hanged Man, Moon) map the journey without stating it, and the final image—"the world is a lighthouse, art is its book room, everything worth seeing begins in a luminescent ache"—reweights the opening premise without moralizing. The recurring motif of "luminescent ache" shifts from wound to working method, and the piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the new gallery unbuilt but conceptually earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: "dust bodied itself into sentences," "fogbones," "heart thudding in the tower." POV distance remains stable (close third focused on the artist), and the compression of abstract phrases ("fragmented reality," "luminescent ache") reads as voice-motivated rather than filter clutter. However, some constructions edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the moment's pressure ("messy theology of maintenance," "barnacled memories"), and brief diction drift in peak beats (e.g., "rhetorical questions, questions rhetorical questions") blurs immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, and figurative language (fog feathered, ocean schooling inside the tower, fogbones) is purposeful and pattern-taught. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "fragmented reality" appears multiple times without added pressure, "luminescent ache" recurs as a label rather than evolving through action, and "walls close in" is stated twice in similar phrasing. The untangling sequence demonstrates clear propulsion, but earlier paragraphs carry synonym churn ("steady gaze, without a subject that would stay") and abstract stacks that slow momentum before the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-studio synthesis and the untangling-as-artistic-breakthrough are specific and purposeful, transforming the "artist in crisis" template through concrete setting pressure and the tarot-card navigation system. The piece takes a structural risk by sustaining lyric compression without traditional scene causality, and the final gallery vision (portraits as "constellation of tides, lamp rings, and questions") offers a non-obvious answer to the opening problem. The phrase "luminescent ache" as both wound and method is fresh, though the piece occasionally gestures toward abstraction ("fragmented reality," "necessary darkness") in ways that echo conceptual fiction templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crestfallen portrait artist is present throughout and makes the key choice to untangle the shutters, which restores the beam and reframes her understanding of her vocation. She appears in the opening, drives the middle action (reading notebooks, laying out cards, freeing knots), and her final gallery redesign is the story's closure unit. Her decisions alter tactics (descent into the belly, naming each loop) and her stance crystallizes at the end. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.4 = base 8.9; slight abstraction in her interiority and occasional passivity in middle reflection −0.3 each = 8.3, rounded to neighbor: 6.7 fits smooth integration with minor clarity loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box is introduced early, handled in the opening beat (rattling, cracked, "like her chest"), reappears when she lays out the cards as a map in the belly, and is carried back to the library at the end. It recurs across three beats and its "hinged and unreliable" quality mirrors her internal state, charging the closure metaphor. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, specificity +0.5, closure reprise +0.9 = base 6.4; the box itself is less causally active than the cards it contains, and its final mention is brief −0.6 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is named early ("split faces into shards") and shapes her stakes: she cannot hold a steady gaze, and the story's resolution honors fragmentation rather than fixing it. The concept constrains her tactics (she must redesign her method, not force unity) and the final gallery vision ("constellation of tides") directly enacts fragmented-as-valid. Early signal +0.7, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6 = base 6.5; label repetition without evolving mechanics −0.3 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Questions rhetorical questions" appears once in the middle when she annotates the keepers' notebooks and laughs at herself for answering a rhetorical question about horizons. The trait is demonstrated in that single beat but does not constrain later choices or return at closure. One beat +0.4, mid-story appearance −0.3, no closure participation (cap 2.8 waived by single beat presence), swappability −0.6 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Redesign" is the story's central action: she comes to redesign more than paintings, redesigns the way her eyes hold life, and ends ready to redesign her gallery. The word appears in three beats (arrival purpose, lighthouse method, final gallery vision) and the untangling sequence enacts redesign physically. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.6 = base 8.7; slight abstraction (redesign as concept more than concrete gesture) −0.4 = 8.3, neighbor 7.3 fits tighter.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Untangling threads is signaled mid-story when she finds the snarled shutter ropes and enacted in the climactic beat: she names each loop, frees the clutch, and restores the beam. The method's mechanics matter—gentleness, naming, sequential release—and the physical success enables the conceptual shift. Two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7 = base 7.6; late first appearance (past midpoint) −0.4 = 7.2, upward for strong causal and closure work = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse provides the entire setting and pressures every choice: the spiral climb, the dusty notebooks, the belly with snarled ropes, the beam that crowns the lens. The lighthouse mechanism is the story's central constraint and resource, and the final image (world as lighthouse, art as book room) charges the setting with thematic weight. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.8 = 9.4; no deductions, strong integration throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" appears twice: once as backstory trigger (the old studio), once mid-story noting "the walls did not close in now." The timeframe names a psychological pressure but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions within the scene. Two mentions +0.6, thematic reprise +0.5 = base 4.1; mid-appearance −0.3, no causal tightening of on-page time −0.5 = 3.3, upward for dual presence and closure-adjacent reprise = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "descend into necessary darkness so that every beam would mean something" is stated explicitly before she goes down to the belly and enacted when she takes the lamp book and cards and untangles the shutters in the dark room. It drives the middle action and the final redesign honors darkness (shadows in portraits, ache that heals). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3 = base 7.0; told more than shown in friction −0.6 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears in the opening paragraph, recurs as "the ache that could also heal" near the end, and titles the final sentence: "everything worth seeing begins in a luminescent ache." The tone is coherent through lyric compression and modulates from wound (opening) to working method (closing), charging the final image with the story's central paradox. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.7 = base 7.6; some label repetition without evolving embodiment −0.0 within band = 7.6.</comment>
