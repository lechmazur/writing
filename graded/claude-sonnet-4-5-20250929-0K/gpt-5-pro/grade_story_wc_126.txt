<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is rendered through concrete acoustic perception and her mendicant's bowl choices, showing character-specific bias. The piece establishes her motivation to find beauty in the unfinished, and the final choice to "refuse perfection and invite errors to sing" feels earned by prior acoustic exploration. However, the transformation lacks visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the arc reads more as accumulative expansion than struggle. Secondary characters (the boy, the diver) apply pressure but remain functional rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through gathering voices, rekindled ritual, and the recovered bell, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where the hush "learns to listen" rather than vanishing. Orientation anchors—Mara, the cove, post-burn timeframe—arrive early. The closure image ("the sea holds quiet but not empty") reweights the premise with conceptual cost: silence becomes a shared breathing space rather than erasure. One meaningful deepening (fire → storytelling → bell recovery → collective sound) tightens stakes under the chosen lens, and the cost is felt in the compromise with imperfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwreck ribs are not mere backdrop; they supply the dripping eaves Mara tunes to, the barge deck that cradles fire, and the bell's hiding place. The mendicant's bowl functions as micro-setting, catching leaks and later serving as buoy—constraining choices across beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "glass ribs jeweled with salt," "fruit knocking seed against skin." The environment evolves causally (bell raised, bowl repurposed) and charges the final image when "ship ribs flicker, orchard glass brightens."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sound and community to a silenced cove—is signaled early and tightens through the fire gathering, storytelling round, and bell recovery. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase: solo violin → collective instruments → recovered bell, each adding pressure. Agency is collective but coherent, driven by Mara's acoustic choices and the group's willingness to "invite the errors to sing." The hush "cracks like thin ice," a clear cost image, and the resolution (hush learning to share rather than vanish) forecloses the path of perfect restoration. No coincidental solve; the bell's recovery requires collaborative action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—finding beauty in incompleteness and rebuilding through flawed, communal sound—emerges organically from the mendicant's bowl (coins, water, sound), the cracked bell ("its tongue missing, its promise intact"), and the refusal of perfection. "The unfinished keeps time, and we keep each other" offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between note and target, the "space between try and arrive." The final image reweights prior material: the chronic hush becomes a listening presence rather than absence. One minor slip: "magnificent simplicity" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic echo, though it's embedded in image rather than stated as thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric-textural register, with Mara's perceptual bias toward acoustic phenomena shaping what is noticed ("dripping eaves," "rhythm of leaks," "curved echoes"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("She draws her bow… She bows near the bridge… She hangs the bell") create a ritualistic cadence that serves the accumulative design. However, the voice occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("mendicant," "unbind," "magnificent simplicity") that, while coherent, edges past the POV's lived immediacy under peak pressure. No head-hopping; distance remains stable. Dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: "The chronic hush tightens, then cracks like thin ice under a patient foot" delivers clear propulsion and image. Information density is high, with most lines advancing both atmosphere and event. However, several beats exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Mara comes to find beauty in the unfinished, because finished things end and end again" (the second clause restates the first without added pressure). "The chronic hush does not vanish; it learns to listen, to share, to breathe behind voices" / "When she plays… the sea holds quiet but not empty"—near-synonym closure. These patterns accumulate across the final third, dulling the closure image slightly. Penalty: −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems touching closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-ecological-collapse ritual rebuilding through imperfect sound feels specific rather than generic. The mendicant's bowl as tuning tool, buoy, and reliquary; the cracked bell with missing tongue; the violin-as-clapper—these particulars transform the familiar "rebuilding community" template into something earned in hindsight. The lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the core premise (acoustic healer in liminal water-space restoring silenced world through collective music) leans on widely used eco-grief and sound-as-healing tropes without fully subverting them; transformation is present but not radical. Risk-taking in structure and tone (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, frames expectation early, and her acoustic choices drive three distinct beats: tuning to leaks, answering drops with near-notes, refusing perfection to "invite the errors to sing." Her decision to hang the bell and use her violin as clapper is the closure action that enables the final reconfiguration. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mendicant's bowl appears in four functionally distinct beats: catching sound (setup), ringing when embers pop (tuning moment), holding gifts by night (communal exchange), and serving as buoy for the bell recovery (enabling action). Its evolving use—from passive vessel to active tool—charges the middle and ending. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied; beat involvement (4), causal pressure, and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chronic hush is established as physical constraint in the opening ("holds the cove like a hand that refuses to unclench") and shapes Mara's acoustic tactics throughout. It tightens before cracking, and at closure it "learns to listen, to share" rather than vanishing—a clear Conceptual Repricing. The hush's transformation from oppressive silence to breathing presence drives the story's central stake. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is signaled early ("chart a room by how silence bends") and enables Mara's tuning-by-leak and note-gap choices. However, the trait functions more as baseline capability than constraining tradeoff; no on-page moment shows what she sacrifices or risks by relying on acute hearing. Present across beats and shaping tactics, but lacks visible cost. Setup and development gates satisfied; payoff indirect (her perception enables the violin-bell moment). Mid-band for functional involvement without felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unbind" is framed as goal ("hopes that memory will unbind the hush") and enacted at the climax: "She chooses to unbind it fully by refusing perfection and inviting the errors to sing." This decision triggers the collective sound-making and the hush's transformation. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied. The action is specific—freeing constraint through intentional imperfection—but could be approximated by "release" or "loosen" with minor edits. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The family tradition is seeded early ("they kept a tradition of storytelling around a bonfire when voices felt weak"), motivates the fire-gathering beat ("They begin a family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire, adopted, patched, and new"), and returns in closure summary ("They keep the family tradition… now kindled by brine and bow"). The method shapes the central turn: stories and collective sound replace solo performance, enabling the hush to crack. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied; beat involvement (2-3), causal pressure, and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse supplies the dripping eaves Mara tunes to, the broken pane for the bowl, the hanging point for the bell, and the acoustics that answer with "fruit knocking seed against skin." The shipwrecks provide the barge for the fire and "throw their curved echoes back." Setup early, development across multiple beats (tuning, fire platform, bell installation), and payoff in the final image ("orchard glass brightens"). The setting's specific features—glass ribs, half-drowned trees, ship ribs—constrain and enable key choices. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burns" opens the story and the boy brings "driftwood and char" from "the burned hills," anchoring the post-catastrophe frame. The timeframe motivates the chronic hush (ecological silence) and Mara's mission. However, the burns function as static backdrop rather than live clock; no escalating urgency tied to elapsed time. Setup and thematic development present; closure participation indirect (the frame persists: "We live after the rainforest burns"). Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not impose temporal pressure. Mid-band for thematic integration without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The desire "to find beauty in the unfinished" is stated early and dramatized through Mara's note-gap choices ("The space between note and target is where she lives now"), refusal of perfection, and embrace of the cracked bell. The motivation drives the climactic choice to "invite the errors to sing" and is reflected in the closure summary ("beauty in the unfinished rings, the flaws that let morning light in"). Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Minor friction: occasionally told more than shown ("Mara comes to find…"), reducing embodied cost slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone—lyric restraint with accretive detail—coheres through turns: opening stillness, gathering warmth at the bonfire, collective crescendo, quiet resonance at close. "Magnificent simplicity" appears explicitly near the end ("Their days arrange themselves with magnificent simplicity, like stones set for crossing a stream"), charging the final image with tonal payoff. Cadence modulates from solo contemplation to choral action without jarring shifts. The tone's accumulative method supports the Textural lens and reweights the hush's transformation. Strong coherence and closure charge; the explicit label is borderline thematic echo but remains image-anchored.</comment>
