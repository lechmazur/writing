<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is rich in sensory detail and poetic texture, but lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure. The decision to "set the pearl among the sea glass and began to teach them a shared breath" arrives without visible internal conflict or trade-off. The "lost the sky" backstory anchors present stance, yet the peak moment (choosing to share the pearl rather than keep or release it) is told through process rather than dramatized as a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied contradiction is absent when stakes are highest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The pearl discovery offers a potential turn, but the presented dilemma—keep/quiet vs. release/storms—dissolves without on-page cost: the protagonist simply "set the pearl among the sea glass" and both outcomes blend into harmony. No visible price is paid; the ending describes villagers harmonizing and the pearl brightening "by being shared," which reads as convenient resolution rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The closure image is evocative but lacks the undeniable pressure or foreclosed path required for RR or CR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered and its coiling shape, mist, and acoustic properties return across beats. The cave "shiver[s] like a sleeping animal" when the pearl is discovered, and later "seemed to inhale and exhale" during the ritual, which charges the environment as quasi-animate. Spatial choreography (tideline, hollow, threads across the grotto) remains coherent. The grotto constrains the protagonist's work (no fire, dependence on mist and reflection) and participates in the closure image, satisfying the 9+ test narrowly; however, the connection between setting and final choice is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: share light without flame, serve the community and seals. The pearl's arrival introduces a stated choice (quiet sea vs. carrying voices), but the resolution—polishing a "shared breath"—sidesteps the trade-off without visible cost. No on-page reversal narrows options; instead, the pearl "brightened by being shared" and villagers' fears are "caught" in a net of hush. Agency is processual (polishing, suspending) rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates through density but does not tighten toward a choice with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—stillness as shared language, reflection over blaze, patience as tide—emerges organically from image and action without overt statement. The pearl and sea glass function as a conceptual braid rather than token symbols. The final paragraph ("quiet can travel farther than blaze, and that sharing is a tide that returns") risks summary but is grounded in prior particulars (the grotto's acoustics, the seals' fear of flame, the villagers' harmonies). The ending offers a resonant answer to the implicit question (how to tend light earthbound) without moralizing, though the lack of felt cost in the closure beat limits the reweighting effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the tide taught me to listen sideways, to read sky from water." Diction is purposefully elevated ("zephyr bloom of patience," "a word, and we were pronouncing it carefully") and consistent with the reflective, poetic stance. Compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained. No head-hopping. Under peak pressure (the pearl choice), the voice remains coherent though the narrative elides the decision process itself. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's knowledge of community response is plausibly observational.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("coils like a map of patient stars," "a lung of stone now soothed"). However, several lines loop: "As memories resurface" appears twice as a transitional phrase without added content. "The mist keeps its promise and drifts slowly" and "When the wind presses the mist thin" recycle mist-movement imagery. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]" without variation. Filter-verb stack is minimal. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; some beats ("I told them only that the sea had lent us a word") summarize rather than dramatize. Paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2; template-cadence penalty −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal metaphor, sensory disability reframed as gift, and communal ritual through polished sea glass is specific and non-obvious. The "pearl of stillness" as condensed hush is a fresh image. The narrator's earthbound stance and the grotto's serpentine, lung-like qualities cohere into a singular vision. However, the narrative arc (loss → alternative practice → magical object → harmonious resolution) follows a familiar template of consolation and community restoration. The piece transforms the template through texture and voice, but the core emotional journey is well-worn. Risk-taking is present in the lyric density and accumulative structure; +0.3 within-band adjustment for sustained poetic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Earthbound star watcher is the protagonist and focalizer throughout. The role frames the opening and the narrator's polishing practice appears in multiple beats (gathering, polishing, suspending). However, the character's key choice—how to use the pearl—is not dramatized as a decision point; the text moves directly from the stated dilemma to "I set the pearl among the sea glass" without on-page deliberation. Present in setup, middle (polishing beats), and ending (the narrator speaks of remaining earthbound and guiding the glow). Two-gate participation (setup + ending lyric reprise) plus one functional beat (the pearl decision, though told) supports mid-band. Swappability: another caretaker role could replace "star watcher" with minor edits. No unique property of star-watching constrains the action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sea glass is introduced early ("gather sea glass from the tideline"), polished and suspended in the grotto (middle beat), and returns in the pearl sequence ("set the pearl among the sea glass") and the ending net image ("sea glass, once broken, now braided the hush"). Appears across setup, development, and payoff. The glass's transformation from dull to vibrant is process-driven and its suspended threads create the light-language. The final image of the net "caught our roaming fears" reweights the shards as both medium and metaphor. Causal pressure: the glass enables the sharing of light without fire, core to the protagonist's method. Cost connection is indirect; the labor of polishing is mentioned but not felt as sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pearl of stillness is introduced at midpoint, nested in the grotto's hollow. The stated choice (keep → quiet sea; release → storms return) shapes a middle stake. The pearl is used in the ending: "set among the sea glass," it "brightened by being shared" and becomes part of the glow. Present in middle and payoff; missing from setup. The pearl's "condensed hush" property is specific and the text claims it "did not dim with use," but the mechanics of how it interacts with the sea glass are told ("coaxed a path for the hush to travel") rather than shown through action. The stated dilemma does not land as a real trade-off; both outcomes (quiet and voices) are achieved. Mid-appearance −0.3; resolution without visible cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Reflectively vibrant describes the sea glass after polishing: "stones wake reflectively vibrant, as if remembering constellations." The trait signals early and recurs in the grotto's glow. However, "reflectively vibrant" functions as description rather than constraint. The text does not show a moment where this specific quality (versus any brightness) enables or limits an action. The vibrant glass allows light-sharing, but any polished/bright surface could perform the same role. Present in setup and ending atmosphere; no on-page trade-off tied to this exact trait. Ornamental use −0.8; swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Weigh appears in "I weigh each piece in my palm and ask the tide what tone it wants to sing" (choosing glass) and "The pearl was heavy for its size, and I had to weigh it with both hands and intention" (pearl decision). Also in the ending: "I polish, and pause, and weigh, and listen." Present across setup, middle, and payoff. The act of weighing is tied to the choice-making process (tone selection, pearl handling). However, the mechanics of weighing do not visibly narrow options; the protagonist weighs and then proceeds without dramatized consequence. The action could be replaced with "consider" or "hold" without altering plot. Two beats + closure mention supports mid-band. Swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early: "By gem polishing and whispered breath, I invite the currents back into its body." It recurs in the pearl sequence: "With slow gem polishing, I coaxed a path for the hush to travel, bead to shard to drop of mist." The method is named in the ending cadence: "So I polish, and pause, and weigh, and listen." Present in setup, middle, and payoff. The polishing transforms dull glass into vibrant shards and later integrates the pearl, making it instrumental to the light-sharing practice. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("coaxed a path," "invite the currents") rather than concrete action. The method is less interchangeable than other elements, but its process is told. Summary-only middle use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto in mist anchors the setting from the opening: "Before dawn I enter the serpentine grotto in mist, tracing its coils like a map of patient stars." The coiling shape guides the protagonist's path ("followed the echo along a wet nerve of the wall"). The mist enables the glints to "move like syllables" and keeps the light diffuse and kind. The cave "shiver[s]" at the pearl's discovery and later "seemed to inhale and exhale," becoming quasi-animate. Present in setup, middle (pearl discovery in the hollow), and payoff (the grotto "speaks in a low bell of light"). The serpentine form and mist are irreplaceable; no generic cave would support the coiling/map metaphor or the mist-syllable effect. Causal pressure: the environment constrains fire use and supplies acoustic/visual properties central to the practice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" appears twice as a transitional phrase but does not function as a ticking clock or tighten decisions. The phrase introduces the protagonist's fever backstory and later the villagers' recollections (cradle, storm, meteors). Time is not tracked; the story's present unfolds in a single visit or across an unspecified span. The timeframe element is ornamental, serving thematic resonance (memory as tide) rather than narrative pressure. No on-page moment where the timing of memory alters a choice. Present in two beats but does not constrain action. Ornamental use −0.8; no causal pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to share light without using fire is stated early: "I come here to share light without using fire, because flames frighten the seals and blind the night." This desire drives the sea-glass practice and shapes the pearl choice (find a way to share the pearl's hush without losing the village songs). The motivation is dramatized through the polishing and suspending actions. However, at the peak choice, the text does not show friction between the stated options (quiet sea vs. carrying voices); instead, both outcomes are achieved harmoniously. The motivation frames the entire arc and participates in closure ("our days lift like lanterns a tide can carry, unburning and true"). Present across setup, middle, and payoff. Cost connection is weak; no visible sacrifice tied to maintaining this constraint.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Zephyr bloom (gentle, patient, flowering) is introduced in the second line: "My work moves with a zephyr bloom of patience, never rushing the hush of the shore." The phrase recurs in the ending: "let the zephyr bloom of patience guide the glow." Tone is coherent throughout: unhurried, reverent, sensory-rich. The piece does not modulate sharply under pressure; the discovery of the pearl and the stated dilemma are narrated in the same contemplative register as the opening. This steadiness fits the thematic content but limits dynamic range. The tone charges the final image by reinforcing the patient, tide-like stance. Early signal +0.5; closure linkage +0.8; static modulation (no tonal shift under pressure) −0.6; lyric reprise +0.3.</comment>
