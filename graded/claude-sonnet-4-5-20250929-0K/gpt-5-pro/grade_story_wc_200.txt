<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly embodied—"modestly fearless, or just practiced at keeping still" and the bargain to share the worst memory first. The journey from refusal ("I refused a drowning man") to integration shows earned change. Minor slip: the widow's laugh and the final laugh blur slightly in tracking, but the internal arc of pursuing joy alongside pain reads as motivated throughout. The final stance—"promising to flood when needed and stay when not"—forecloses the old evasion with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the laugh transforms from "fled from me" to "followed like a small river under my tongue," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator integrates laughter into healing by first offering vulnerability. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through spectral confessions, the crocodile's tooth plectrum, and the gorge's witness until the narrator's confession opens the seam. Cost is visible: "I quit apologizing for staying alive" and the bow at the rim. Orientation is swift (gorge, sunrise, harp by line 4). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is not postcard—it "opened like a throat of stone," and the river's roar constrains the collector's placement of the harp. The crocodile's tooth as micro-setting object is handled twice (pocket → plectrum → pocket) and charges the closure by opening the seam. Sensory specificity is high: "crazed like sun on broken water," "grass singing beneath ice." The gorge witnesses the bargain and hums approval, shaping the final turn. One late image—"the gorge echo inside my ribs like fresh rafters"—reweights the space with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: pursue the laugh "rumored to stitch wounds while stinging like salt." The laugh flees, forcing the narrator to detune further and offer the drowning-man confession—a meaningful tightening that forecloses evasion. The drowners' choir and the laugh's tremor ("because joy had hurt before") deepen pressure. Cost is legible: sharing the worst memory and the widow's laugh, then learning "to laugh, not at pain, but alongside it." One turn suffices; the narrator's agency drives closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: joy and sorrow sharing a chair, the harp "pleasantly wrong," the laugh as medicine. The crocodile's tooth and the widow's laugh recur with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image—"promising to flood when needed and stay when not"—answers the central question (integrating laughter into healing) without moralizing. The piece resists sentimentality: "kindest and cruelest sound, a rope thrown to air, a rope that held nobody." Complexity is held without false balance; the narrator's guilt and the laugh's doubt converge in "companionable ache."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "the river forgot its roar," "memories poured like coarse light," "fear has its manners when the sun is still negotiating dawn." Psychic distance is stable; all knowledge remains character-bound. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during pursuit ("I pursued it by detuning further"), longer cadences at resolution. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices sound, resonance, and light as a collector would. One minor slip: "oxygen and sorrow can share a chair" leans slightly abstract but recovers in the next beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "spectral confessions were treasures and burdens, gleaming as they bruised"). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Clarity holds under figurative load. Minor density spike: the final third stacks metaphors ("thin silver of sound like grass singing beneath ice," "air brightened like milk poured into tea") without rest, though none muddle causality. No loops or scaffold. The closure image ("small river under my tongue") lands cleanly. Pronoun references are unambiguous throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—lost soul collector using a misaligned harp and crocodile's tooth to integrate laughter into healing—is specific and non-obvious. The widow's laugh as both wound and rope is a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in tone ("luminous ache," spectral confessions as "coarse light") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of sound, memory, and healing feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous lines. One small hedge: the drowners' choir could be more causally entangled with the narrator's past rather than ambient chorus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening ("lost soul collector"), middle (pursuit and confession decisions), and ending (gathering the harp, bowing). The narrator's choice to share the worst memory first creates the key turn; the confession opens the seam. The role constrains tactics (using the harp, pursuing the laugh) and the final stance (meeting other souls "with this new companionable ache"). Removing this exact character would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 16), used twice with distinct function: first as plectrum to answer the gorge, then returned to pocket with the ferryman's debt acknowledged. The tooth's property (crocodile laughed, tooth "could bite open the seam where healing begins") is specific and irreplaceable. It enables the key beat: drawing it across the emptiest string opens the narrator's confession. Closure references it ("promised the ferryman his debt was singing interest"). Cost is tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("gorge answered with spectral confessions"), developed through the fisher and mother's confessions, and the drowners' choir. The concept constrains tactics: the narrator must "pursue the sound that refused me" through dissonance. At closure, the confessions "brightened, gaining ribs and wrists," shifting from burden to presence. The concept redefines the stakes: not extraction but integration. Removing it would break the pursuit logic and the final transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 2 ("modestly fearless, or just practiced at keeping still"), returns at paragraph 26 ("I sat, modestly fearless, because fear has its manners"). The trait enables the bargain and the confession under pressure. It constrains the narrator's approach: not heroic, but steady. The cost is implied—stillness requires renouncing flight. The trait could be swapped for a near-synonym ("cautiously brave") with minor edits, limiting the score despite two appearances and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Framed early ("I would pursue the sound that refused me"), drives the middle (detuning, asking why it ran, offering the bargain), and resolves at closure ("The laugh followed like a small river"). Pursuit through dissonance is irreplaceable; the narrator's choice to detune further and offer vulnerability creates the turn. The action redefines options: from chasing to inviting. Removing "pursue" would collapse the arc into passive waiting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 5, "misaligned harp... stubborn wobble"), mechanics matter throughout: "I tuned further away from correctness," "Each sour resonance opened another seam," "I pursued it by detuning further." The method is irreplaceable—perfect pitch would erase the story's logic. It shapes multiple beats and the closure: "the harp limped along, learning to trust its wound." The specificity (dissonance as pathway) is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced in title and opening, the gorge supplies resources (flat rock for the harp, acoustics that answer), witnesses the bargain, and hums approval. The setting constrains: "layered with whispers nobody had the patience to finish." At closure, the gorge "echo inside my ribs like fresh rafters" reweights the space as internalized support. The setting is not merely postcard; it pressures and validates the narrator's work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present in opening ("hush of a hidden sunrise") and closure ("The sun finally discovered us, and the hidden sunrise quit hiding"). The timeframe brackets the action and charges the ending image with revelation. However, the clock does not tighten tactics in the middle; beats unfold without time pressure. The lyric reprise reweights the stake (coming out of hiding), but the element remains more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stated explicitly (paragraph 27, "to integrate laughter into healing, not as garnish, but medicine") after being dramatized through pursuit and confession. The motivation drives the bargain ("I would share my worst memory first") and the closure: "to laugh, not at pain, but alongside it." Friction is visible: the laugh doubts kindness, the narrator must prove safety. The desire shapes every beat and forecloses the old evasion at the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent from opening ("sorrow-lit tools") through middle ("treasures and burdens, gleaming as they bruised") to closure ("shone without burning, an ember that could warm both confession and joke"). The phrase "luminous ache" appears twice (paragraph 15, then implied in "companionable ache" and "ember"). Tone modulates with pressure: pursuit tightens, confession opens, resolution breathes. The final image ("promising to flood when needed and stay when not") carries the tone's exact charge.</comment>
