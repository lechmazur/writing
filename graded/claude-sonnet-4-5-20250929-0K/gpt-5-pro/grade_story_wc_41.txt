<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness is embodied through on-page actions (writing chalk instructions, arranging driftwood) that constrain his choices with visible cost. Interior experience remains concrete and character-specific ("He could almost hear his mother turning pages somewhere long before his birth"). The final renunciation—obeying his future instruction not to rewind—demonstrates earned endurance with conceptual cost. Minor slip: the attribute occasionally feels more asserted than dramatized in micro-choices under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: fog, statues, chalk marks, and recorder accumulate pressure through patterned repetition until the final bloom reweights the dominant stake (capturing age as sound). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the prophet obeys his chalk command, hears "a harbor, the home he could not remember yet," crystallizing the cost of his perpetual leaving. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arrows shift and "knowledge evaporat[es] before the forgetting even arrived," tightening the stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden constrains tactics: statues serve as surfaces for chalk instructions, the amphitheater provides a listening hollow, and the tide shifts the driftwood markers, forcing the prophet to navigate by remnants. The recorder's warmth, the salt taste, and gravel ticking under rain create sensory specificity filtered through the prophet's priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The garden's tidal edges and statues ("a blade runner, a saint, a bell without a tongue") charge the final departure with mythic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and tested through escalating attempts: planting markers, recording fog, chalking commands. The middle tightening occurs when the tide shifts arrows and "knowledge evaporat[es] before the forgetting even arrived," narrowing options. Agency reads as endurance: the prophet obeys his future instruction not to rewind, foreclosing immediate understanding for the sake of future return. Cost is felt in the sustained pressure of memory loss and the fragile anchors he must trust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the sound of age as "leaving without stopping anywhere at all," videotapes "warm with dust," the recorder drinking fog "like broth." The final image—"a harbor, the home he could not remember yet"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Chalk instructions and driftwood markers recur with shifting weight, constraining choice and charging closure. The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing the prophet's perpetual deferral with genuine cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-particular: "precognitively forgetful" modulates diction toward elliptical certainty ("memory was always already gone, like footprints before tide"). Perceptual signature is selective and biased—he hears "tomorrow forgetting him" and tastes salt that "maybe" came from old tears. Purposeful compression ("a space like an ear, big enough to sit inside") and lyric patterning ("do not rewind yet") are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance image, stake, or character (e.g., "He whispered: I am clinging to echoes, do not let them peel away"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the amphitheater sequence and breathing in the final departure. Minor loop issue: "arranging driftwood as directional markers" appears three times with near-identical phrasing, creating template cadence that dulls momentum slightly (−0.4). No other scaffolding or mixed metaphors; figurative language remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of precognitive forgetfulness, fog sculpture garden, and sound-capture transforms familiar memory-loss premises through specific world logic and stakes. The driftwood-as-future-compass and chalk-as-anchor devices feel earned in hindsight, not convenient late additions. The final image—recorder blooming with gray light, revealing "a harbor, the home he could not remember yet"—offers a non-obvious emotional and conceptual payoff. Risk-taking in lyric compression and patterned elision heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The junkyard prophet's choices drive all major beats: he arranges driftwood (setup and middle), chalks commands (middle), presses record in the amphitheater (peak), and obeys his instruction not to rewind (closure). Agency is clear and causal. Present in all three gates. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; cost is legible in his sustained navigation of memory loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chalk appears early (setup), is used to write instructions on statues and the recorder (middle beats), and constrains the final choice when the prophet obeys "Do not rewind yet" (closure participation). It narrows options by externalizing memory into commands he must trust. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Specific cost: he surrenders immediate understanding to obey his future self.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept shapes the prophet's stake ("I am clinging to echoes, do not let them peel away") and his method (recording, chalking, trusting markers). It appears early and informs middle tactics (chalking "Keep," recording fog). Present in the final image when he "kissed the recorder as if it were an ear returning from exile." Two gates (setup, closure lyric reprise); mid-scene causal pressure is more implicit than decisive, placing it in the mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Precognitive forgetfulness is signaled early and constrains on-page actions: he writes chalk instructions because "memory was always already gone," arranges driftwood for a future self who will have forgotten, and experiences "knowledge evaporating before the forgetting even arrived." Present in all three gates. The trait enables his tactics and charges the closure (obeying his instruction without remembering why). Visible cost: he must navigate by remnants of his own foresight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Locate" drives the prophet's search for "the oldest breath" and his movement toward the amphitheater. It appears in the middle ("He needed to locate the oldest breath here") and shapes the attempt to record fog. Present in setup (implied goal) and middle beats, but not decisively active in the closure image, which focuses on obedience and return. One gate (middle development) plus lyric setup; causal role in one major beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers is signaled early, used across multiple beats (setup, middle, and after the tide shifts them), and informs the closure: "He followed what arrows remained." The method constrains his navigation and reflects his precognitive forgetfulness—arrows from future self to forgetting present. Present in all three gates with causal pressure: when the tide moves the markers, his path narrows. Visible cost: he must trust fragmented guidance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden pressures all tactics: statues provide surfaces for chalk, the amphitheater offers a listening hollow, fog and tide alter the markers. Present early (setup) and active in every beat. The setting's tidal edges and statues charge the final departure ("the drowned queen... seemed to exhale"). All three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: no generic location could supply these constraints and resources.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("amid the hush of old videotapes") appears early and colors the prophet's reflection on age ("weddings never rewatched, parties receding"). It informs his stake but does not tighten on-page decisions or create urgency. Present in setup via reflection; absent from middle tactics and closure participation. One gate (setup) with thematic accent but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to this temporal framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to capture the sound of growing older is signaled early, tested through recording attempts, and shapes the closure choice (obeying "Do not rewind yet, let the hush become a room"). Present in all three gates. The desire creates friction: he hears age as "leaving without stopping" and must trust the recorder without immediate verification. Visible cost: deferral of understanding. Causal pressure across two beats (amphitheater recording, final obedience).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tidal longing is coherent from the opening ("tidal at its edges, patient as an ear") through the amphitheater sequence ("breath thinning until it became surf") to the closure ("a wave shouldered through the paths," "a harbor, the home he could not remember yet"). The tone modulates with pressure—expanding in reflection, contracting in the amphitheater—and charges the final image with sustained ache. Present across all beats; the metaphoric structure of tide/memory/departure holds without break.</comment>
