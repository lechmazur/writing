<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied through tactile detail (grille cloth prickling thumb, grease on knuckles) and the contradiction between professional appraisal facts and emotional wounds remains active throughout. The "insulating emotionally with facts" method creates genuine internal conflict as the narrator calibrates each observation against shame. Minor slips: "calibrated by years on the road" edges toward summary, and the final turn ("not to redeem my name, but to discover purpose") articulates rather than dramatizes the shift. The cost of examining Abel's artifact is felt through specific sensory anchors and the letter opening "Dear Echo."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal support. Orientation anchors within the first ~100 words (quarry office trailer, failed TV appraisal). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the protagonist commits to excavation ("midwife a new story from stone") and writes to Abel, crystallizing the shift from shame-driven silence to purpose-driven recovery. The cost is visible—moving from professional redemption to witnessing—and the valley's answer in the final line reweights all prior echoes. One tightening deepening occurs when the rental logo seals the cloth to Abel's tour, narrowing emotional options and making excavation personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quarry setting actively constrains choice: Echo Bench's location and the buried gear frame the excavation plan, while the trailer's trembling desk and concrete dust anchor sensory experience. The grille cloth's weave and singe provide occupational specificity that drives recognition. Spatial choreography is clean (pit below, office above, filing cabinet with busted handle). The final image—wind through trailer vents like crowd noise—charges the ending by transforming setting into active pressure, making the valley a patient calling the narrator back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering purpose after public failure) is signaled early and tightens when the rental logo connects the cloth to Abel's tour, forcing the protagonist to choose between professional distance and emotional excavation. The decision to treat Echo Bench "like a patient" and write "Dear Echo" forecloses the redemption path with visible cost—shifting from name repair to witnessing. Agency operates through attention and renunciation; coincidence (Lark's invitation) complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful deepening narrows options under accumulative pressure as artifacts accumulate emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (what remains after applause, how we price meaning after loss) emerges organically through concrete particulars: the cloth scrap, the Echo Bench map, Abel's laughter at free reverb. The final image—valley as patient calling its doctor—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in silences: "You look like someone hearing a song for the second time" captures recognition without explanation. The shift from appraising objects to pricing moments, from redemption to discovery, reweights the premise through lived action rather than thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV stability throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters all observation through roadie/appraiser expertise (tweed combos, output transformers, rental logos). Diction remains character-bound ("souvenir work," "ozone and beer," "pellets after the snare splits") and modulates under pressure—compressed syntax in the grille cloth examination, expansive rhythm in the valley's final answer. Lark's brief dialogue ("We keep finding bits…") carries natural rhythm and advances plot. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around the cloth, broadens for Lark's history, then narrows again at closure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure simultaneously ("The scrap prickled my thumb, as if asking whether I had finally fallen to souvenir work"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the filing cabinet sequence, breathing in the Abel memory. Minor template cadence in the opening repetition ("After failing publicly" appears twice within ~150 words) and slight filter-verb stack in the Lark observation paragraph ("watched my face align and misalign"). No paraphrase loops; figurative language (valley as amphitheater, kids as notes on a stave) remains coherent and voice-motivated. The final image propels without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of roadie expertise, antiques appraisal, and quarry archaeology as grief work feels specific and non-obvious. The grille cloth as both artifact and emotional hinge, the Echo Bench concept, and the move from public failure to private excavation avoid template paths. Risk-taking in pacing (extended interiority, long paragraphs) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The letter to Abel ("Dear Echo") and the valley-as-patient frame transform familiar redemption arcs into witnessing and purpose discovery. Lived detail (rental logos, tweed combos, tarps smelling of ozone) grounds the metaphorical weight, making the premise feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ex-roadie/appraiser protagonist is present throughout and drives key turns: examining the cloth triggers memory, wrestling the filing cabinet open reveals the map and set list, and the decision to excavate Echo Bench and write to Abel constitutes the closure choice. Early signal in paragraph one, causal pressure across multiple beats (cloth recognition, cabinet, inventory plan), closure linkage through the commitment to "midwife a new story." The specific skill set (amp knowledge, tour history) is irreplaceable and shapes every observation. Cost is visible in the shift from redemption to purpose.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth appears in at least four beats: initial recognition on the corkboard, tactile examination ("prickled my thumb"), identification of singe and weave pattern, and discovery of the rental logo that seals it to Abel's tour. Each appearance deepens meaning: from professional curiosity to personal connection to emotional hinge. The cloth enables the protagonist's recognition and constrains choice by making the excavation personal rather than professional. It charges the closure by linking all prior losses (Abel, the tour, the broadcast mistake) into one artifact. Irreplaceable and causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After the applause" frames the entire stake: what remains when performance ends, how meaning survives loss. Present in the opening image (amphitheater where claps used to ricochet), returns in Lark's history ("After the applause, the band left a mountain of gear"), and structures the closure decision ("after the stagehands vanish, someone must decide what noise was meaning"). The concept shapes tactics—treating Echo Bench as patient, writing to Abel—and charges the final image of the valley answering. Not merely thematic but a pressure that alters the protagonist's approach from appraisal to witnessing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain, calibrated by years on the road" appears in the Bassman/Twin identification beat and describes the protagonist's method throughout: facts as railing across shame, appraisal vocabulary insulating emotion. The trait enables professional recognition while revealing its cost (falling to souvenir work). It constrains the protagonist's initial stance and is visible in the careful examination of the cloth. However, the exact phrasing "confidently uncertain" is used once; the trait is demonstrated more than labeled. Present in closure (inventory plan with note to Abel) as the tension between method and emotion. Functional across beats but not indispensable as phrased.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once: "I asked for a flathead and tried to wrest the drawer free, grease smearing my knuckles." The action yields the photographs, map, and set list that enable the excavation plan—a causal turn. Setup is brief but clear; the act itself is physical and specific (grease, busted handle). Development: the revealed materials directly shape the next choice (Echo Bench, inventory plan). However, the verb "wrest" itself could be replaced with "pry" or "force" without major structural loss; the discovery matters more than the specific word. Functional and present in a key beat but not irreplaceable as phrased.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is signaled early ("insulating emotionally with facts about pattern names"), enacted across multiple beats (oxblood stripe, transformer details, rental logo identification), and contested at closure when the protagonist acknowledges "inside them I felt the ache open" and writes "Dear Echo." The method shapes every appraisal gesture and creates the central tension: can facts protect or must they yield? The mechanics are visible—pattern naming, technical vocabulary—and the cost of maintaining the insulation drives the final shift. The method is causally essential and charges the ending by being partially relinquished.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer provides spatial constraint (desk trembling with blasts, filing cabinet, corkboard with cloth, concrete dust smell) and frames the valley as both setting and stake. The pit below as "parched amphitheater" and Echo Bench as the excavation target are essential to plot and theme. The trailer is where recognition occurs, the cabinet holds the map, and the final image returns to the trailer vents (wind "like distant crowd noise"). Setting shapes choice (excavation logistics) and charges closure (valley answering). Early signal, development through discovered materials, payoff in the commitment to return. Highly integrated but shares space with the larger quarry/Echo Bench complex.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" anchors the timeframe in the opening and late closure ("After failing publicly, I needed silence shaped like work"). The broadcast mistake is the inciting wound that makes the quarry job necessary and the appraisal stakes personal. However, the timeframe is more situational anchor than live clock—no escalating countdown tightens decisions within the scene. The past failure frames motivation but does not constrain present tactics beat-by-beat. Present in setup and closure, but the "after" is static backdrop rather than dynamic pressure. Functional but not indispensable as a timeframe mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is the protagonist's dominant motivation, signaled early ("I needed silence shaped like work") and dramatized through conflicting impulses: professional appraisal versus emotional witness, redemption versus purpose. The desire is tested in the cloth examination (falling to souvenir work?), the Abel memory (grief versus duty), and the closure choice ("not to redeem my name, but to discover purpose"). Friction between wanting absolution and needing meaning creates visible cost. The motivation is causally essential, shapes all major choices, and is reweighted at closure through the decision to excavate and write to Abel.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" describes the tone throughout: the valley as amphitheater where applause once ricocheted, Abel's "free reverb," the scrap as ghost, and the final image of the valley answering "like distant crowd noise, promise filigreed with grit and absence." Tone is coherent across beats—melancholic, reverberant, tender around sound—and modulates with pressure (tightens during cloth examination, expands in Abel memory, charges in the closing commitment). The tone is not static mood but active longing that shapes perception and charges the final image. Integral to voice and closure effect; removing it would flatten the emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>
