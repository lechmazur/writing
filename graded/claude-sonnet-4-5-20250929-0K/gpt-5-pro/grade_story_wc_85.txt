<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's guilt and contradictory impulses are embodied through concrete choices—pressing the watch hand, levering the slat, writing the letter—each with visible cost. Interiority is specific ("tempered regret is the only armor I own") and the final renunciation (refusing to "sell comfort" or "sell silence") forecloses the profitable path with felt weight. Minor deduction: the fisherman and Mara remain off-page, limiting relationship pressure; the protagonist's change is earned but operates largely in reflection rather than live confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the narrator writes Mara, refuses to profit, and commits to stand at the terrace—a renunciation that forecloses the black-market path. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (cobalt terrace, dusk, genealogist). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrator sifts artifacts (watch hand, driftwood, hair coil) that deepen understanding of complicity, culminating in the letter as a pattern-break that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crescent splits and reveals the hair, shifting tactics from abstract guilt to concrete reparation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The driftwood shore and its carvings constrain the investigative choice: the groove accepts the watch hand with a "tiny click," and the crescent mark must be levered to reveal the hair coil. The cobalt terrace brackets the piece, charging the final image where "the silence there no longer felt empty but weighted like a scale I could finally read." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (sea-stained paper, kelp smudge, dew-slick cobalt). Minor gap: the terrace itself does not pressure a mid-story choice; it functions primarily as bookend.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the withheld truth anchoring the narrator's name, signaled early. Pressure tightens when the watch hand seats in the groove, then escalates when the crescent splits to reveal the hair coil linking the narrator to Mara and the master's barter. The final act—writing the letter and committing to stand—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the silence with visible cost ("I would not sell her comfort"). One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost is legible in the refusal to invoice or evade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—complicity in erasure and the cost of truth—emerges through concrete particulars: three children reduced to one, the narrator discovering they proofread themselves out of a family, the driftwood alphabet that "speak[s] back." The final image (the terrace "weighted like a scale I could finally read") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The letter's contents ("the map of the shore and the facts") reweight prior material. No thematic echo or overt thesis statement; the arc is inextricable from the genealogist's discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and distinct: "tempered regret is the only armor I own," "a sieved hush through the grassed dunes," "the clerk who turned them into one, reducing a forest of futures." POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the closure (the scale becomes legible). Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("amputated three children into two archives and a ghost") risks register drift, though it remains largely voice-motivated and the perceptual signature is selective throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the watch hand found me as if the sea remembered my ledger" advances plot, atmosphere, and guilt). Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrase loops ("I told a fisherman his daughter had drowned" / "The daughter lived, traded like an heirloom") and some elevated metaphor density in expository beats ("a forest of futures," "proofread himself out of a family") that slightly slow momentum. No loops or artifacts touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—black-market genealogist discovering complicity in their own erasure via driftwood forensics—is specific and non-obvious. The watch hand and driftwood alphabet are fresh inflections that avoid stock noir tropes. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection interwoven with present investigation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional calculus (guilt vs. professional survival, truth vs. market) is particular and earned. The premise transforms familiar guilt-narrative material through occupational specificity and the driftwood-as-ledger conceit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The genealogist's guilt drives three key choices: traveling to the shore, pressing and levering the driftwood to reveal the hair coil, and writing the letter renouncing silence. Introduced in the opening, the profession and guilt shape tactics (sifting carvings, reading the master's mark) and the closure (refusing to sell comfort). Cost is visible: the letter forecloses the profitable path. The character is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The watch hand is mailed early, seats in the driftwood groove (middle beat), and is pressed deeper to split the crescent (climax beat). It reappears in the letter description ("how the watch hand matched the groove"). Its evolving use narrows options and its physical fit in the groove is causally necessary. High integration; removing it would collapse the investigation's mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" appears in two phrases ("the wind made a sieved hush," "I meant to quell that hush," "The sieved hush of the surf thickened into a warning") but functions primarily as atmosphere. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the narrator's investigation proceeds regardless of the hush. Present but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Manufacturing false memories is established early ("my trade manufactures false memories") and causally tied to the dominant guilt: the narrator "stitched a vision of gulls and foam" to comfort the fisherman and sold Mara's past. This enables the black-market trade and motivates the quest for truth. It appears in one middle beat (the gulls-and-foam memory) and is referenced in the final renunciation. Functional but the attribute could be replaced with "forged records" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Quell" frames the opening intent ("I meant to quell that hush by sifting") and is negated in the closure ("I would try to quell the market I helped build by speaking"). The action shifts from silencing internal noise to dismantling complicity. The investigation and letter both serve this reweighted action. Present in setup and payoff with clear cost; middle development is implied rather than dramatized in a distinct beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sifting driftwood carvings is signaled early and drives two middle beats: finding the matching initials and groove, then levering the slat to reveal the hair coil. The mechanics matter—tally marks, the boat with three leaves, the crescent mark—and the final letter references "the map of the shore" derived from this method. Essential; the investigation cannot proceed without it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace brackets the story (opening and near-closing) and the final image ("the silence there no longer felt empty but weighted like a scale") reweights the opening mood. It does not constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; the shore investigation occurs elsewhere. Lyric reprise with clear thematic charge at closure, but no causal pressure in development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" and "a deadline I could not invoice or evade" signal urgency in the opening. The timeframe is present throughout (dusk, "tonight") and the commitment to "stand at the terrace until she came" suggests future pressure. However, no live clock narrows options during the investigation beats; the pressure is emotional rather than temporal. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The withheld truth is the dominant stake, dramatized in the opening and pursued through each beat: matching the watch hand, splitting the crescent, discovering the hair coil linking the narrator to the barter. Friction between the desire for truth and the cost of exposure drives the investigation and the final renunciation. The motivation shapes the closure directly and is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tempered regret coheres from the opening ("a hair shirt I earned") through the investigation ("the only armor I own") to the closure ("I would not sell comfort"). Tone modulates subtly under pressure (the hush "thickened into a warning") and charges the final image where the scale becomes legible. The tone is consistent and supports the ending's quiet weight without flattening into static mood.</comment>
