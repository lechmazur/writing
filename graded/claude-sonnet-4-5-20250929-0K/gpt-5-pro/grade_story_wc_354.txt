<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The exiled tutor is embodied through the basalt worry stone habit and the memory of prior failure ("trusting speed"), and the student's silent understanding creates a working dynamic. However, the protagonist's choices at key moments read more as ritualized procedure than urgent internal conflict—the "thoughtfully precise" trait constrains method but doesn't force a visible tradeoff between competing impulses. The exile backstory anchors motive but remains summary; the final king-tipping gesture is legible but feels ceremonial rather than a hard-won renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates gestures—placing pieces, correlating needle with birds, matching breath to force—and the final libation and rail-song constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant "unshadows") with felt cost (they are "keepers, if only until morning"). Orientation anchors (magnetic nexus, twilight, tutor + student) arrive early. The covenant premise is seeded at paragraph 5, the eclipse backstory at paragraph 6, and the resolution at the ending image; causality is more ritual than because/therefore, but the lens holds and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus supplies the humming rail, drooping needle, and iron plate that anchor every chess move; the basalt stone and the aurora guide piece placement. The environment constrains method—correlating shifts with migrating birds, wires between lampposts—and the final rail-song charges closure. Spatial choreography (parapet, guard below, back rank) remains clear. Temporal cues (twilight thinning, last light leaching) track pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: mend the eclipsed covenant before the registry seals their names as oathbreakers or custodians. The treaty's collapse a year ago establishes prior failure; the tutor's exile and lesson ("listening") deepen motive. Pressure accumulates through the chess sequence—each placement tests whether the field will "consider us again"—and the needle's twitch, rail's song, and covenant's "unshadowing" constitute a meaningful tightening with cost (custodianship "if only until morning"). The student's queen reaching back rank and the tutor's tipped king function as the culminating gesture, though the final act reads more as completion of ritual than a decision under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: exile teaching listening over argument, silence as grammar, the city outlawing congregations that listen because "roots buckle pavement." The covenant as older than thrones, the fern-frost maps to patience, and "hopeful melancholy" as the tutor's weather all accumulate without thesis statements. The final image—covenant unshadowing, custodianship "if only until morning"—reprices the opening's unsteady compass and steadier memory with undeniable pressure. The piece resists tidy closure while remaining legible; the cost of temporary custodianship resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single tight third-person POV anchored in the tutor's perceptual signature: "cold iron railing humming like a velvet throat," "worry stone dent, a small harbor where my nerves had previously docked." Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("salted with snowmotes," "tariffs," "catalogues of wind in ivy"). Distance modulates purposefully—close in the basalt passage, wider when narrating the guard's doctrine. The student remains exterior but legible through gesture (hood, nod, queen move, stillness as refusal). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts serve pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("words had become tariffs," "pauses print their characters on metal," "light that does not leave entirely"), and while individual images are vivid, the accumulation in nearly every sentence risks opacity during peak beats—lines like "She lifted a knight and held it to the aurora until it learned its route" beautify but slow propulsion. The final paragraph sustains metaphor ("tipped my king, not as surrender, but as a poured libation") without clarifying mechanics. Rhythm varies and information density is strong, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments (correlating, translating silence) triggers the density check: −0.5 in Q7 for pervasive figurative layering without taught pattern payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—chess as geomantic ritual, exile teaching humility, covenant mending through correlating silence with migrating patterns—feels specific and non-obvious. The city's ban on listening congregations and the magnetic nexus as living board transform familiar mentor-student and redemption frames. The closure (temporary custodianship) resists Hollywood resolution. Risk-taking in diction and structure (accumulative/textural lens, heavy lyricism) elevates the piece, though the chess-as-metaphor and exile-redeems-self arcs remain recognizable templates beneath the ornamentation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor frames the story, places the black king, moves the bishop along the flock's vein, and tips the king as libation in the ending beat. These are three distinct on-page actions that shape beats, and the exile backstory (trusting speed, losing the covenant) primes the final renunciation. However, many key moves are shared with or driven by the student, diluting solo causal pressure. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappability (another guide/mentor) and limited solo cost (−0.6) constrain the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The polished basalt worry stone dent appears in paragraph 7 ("my thumb found... where my nerves had previously docked") and is handed to the student in paragraph 8 ("because memory needs apprenticeships"). Two beats, early signal, and the handoff charges the passing of custodianship. Yet the stone does not return or constrain a later choice; after the handoff it vanishes from the narrative. Setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), but no closure reprise and no causal pressure in the ending (−0.8 for missing payoff gate) limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is the dominant stake: seeded at paragraph 5, backstory at paragraph 6 ("dimmed the night a year ago"), and resolved in the final lines ("eclipsed covenant unshadowed, appointing us its keepers"). It drives every chess move—the pair must "mend" it or be named oathbreakers. The covenant shapes method (translating silence, correlating shifts) and the ending image. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.5), irreplaceability (+0.7), cost connection (+0.5). Strong integration across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is stated at paragraph 3 and enacted in the chess placements (black king on central square, bishop along the vein, matching breath counts to lines of force), but the trait functions more as consistent characterization than a constraint with visible cost—no moment where precision trades off against speed or intuition. Setup (+0.4), beat involvement in placements (+0.4), but ornamental use (the trait doesn't narrow options or create friction) and swappability (careful, meticulous) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Correlate" structures the method: correlating needle with migrating birds (paragraph 9), the bishop move with flock bank (paragraph 17), captured pieces with wire sway (paragraph 23). Three distinct beats and the method drives the covenant's resolution. However, "correlate" could be swapped for "align," "match," or "synchronize" with minimal rewrite—the specificity of correlation (finding mathematical or causal relationships) is not leveraged. Setup (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappability (−0.6) and summary-like exposition (−0.4) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By translating silence" is named at paragraph 9 and enacted when "we spoke in patience" (paragraph 10), "we played by translating silence, letting pauses print their characters on metal" (paragraph 18), and "carefully widened quiet" at closure (paragraph 27). The method shapes every move after its introduction. Setup (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2), but the mechanics remain metaphorical—how silence becomes moves is asserted more than dramatized—and the phrase is swappable with "listening" or "interpreting stillness" (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight provides the humming rail, drooping needle, iron plate, thin aurora, and the spatial frame (parapet, guard below). The setting constrains every chess move (needle twitches toward breaths, rail sings at closure) and supplies the tools (iron, magnetic pull) that enable the covenant's mending. Early anchor (+0.7), four beats (rail hum, needle droop, aurora guiding knight, rail song at end; +1.4), closure linkage (+1.4), irreplaceability (+0.6). The nexus is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Before the next phase of the moon" is stated at paragraph 13 and frames the registry's deadline, but the timeframe does not visibly tighten tactics—no mid-scene awareness of the clock running out, no choice forced by dwindling time. Twilight "thinning" and "last light leached" track atmospheric progression, not urgency tied to the moon phase. Setup (+0.5), stakes framing (+0.4), but the deadline remains abstract and does not constrain a single move (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult" is articulated at paragraphs 20–21 ("always my argument, the lesson I could not bill") and enacted in the tutor's embrace of "hopeful melancholy" and the student's early lesson (frost ferns as maps to patience, paragraph 22). The motive underlies the covenant work but is told more than tested—no moment where the desire to find beauty conflicts with expedience or self-preservation. Setup (second third, −0.3), two beats (+0.9), closure mood (+0.5), but ornamental use (the motive doesn't narrow options) and summary exposition (−0.6) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is named at paragraph 20 ("a weather I know: the ache of the unsaid, rising like bread, and the light that does not leave entirely") and permeates the voice from the opening ("unsteady compass and a steadier memory") through the ending ("if only until morning"). The tone modulates with pressure—elegiac in backstory, patient during placements, charged at the rail's song—and the final custody "if only until morning" reprices hope with transience. Early signal (+0.7), coherence across beats (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.4), irreplaceability (+0.6).</comment>
