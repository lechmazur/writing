<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's interiority is vivid and particular, with embodied tension in lines like "hope burning my palms through the gloves." Internal conflict operates through the method itself—staggering then gliding, refusing pattern—though the peak choice to release the cages feels slightly underearned; the hoarding impulse is named but not dramatized as a live temptation with visible cost. The voice remains consistent under pressure, but the final surrender reads more as thematic fulfillment than inevitable character necessity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who (historian), where (pagoda archive), and when (twilight) cleanly by the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through the purification sequence and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): releasing the cages into the central chamber forecloses the hoarding path with conceptual and relational cost ("opening a vein and watering the street"). The cost is legible in the final image of mirrors showing child and scholar, though the causality of the pagoda's response (new stairs unscrolling) feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive's bronze ribs, glassy shadows, and "steadily unpredictable" air create a tactile, character-filtered environment. The quartz cages and their hum constrain the historian's approach, forcing varied step sequences and hand gestures. The final image—stairs unscrolling, mirrors reflecting child and scholar—charges the closure by spatializing the internal split. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the lyric density.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: access forbidden knowledge without dissolution by the archive's guardian questions. Pressure tightens when the first atom floods the room with gardens and questions line up, testing whether she will answer or hoard. The release of purified cages is a genuine forfeiture—betrayal of her teachers, surrender of exclusive access—with visible cost in the final image of child/scholar split. The archive's shiver and stair-unscrolling feel slightly deus ex, but the choice itself is protagonist-driven and forecloses the hoarding path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ancestors froze wars by teaching light to lose count, peace lasted one generation, the method was hidden from future selves who would mistake randomness for innocence. The historian's arc—hoarding then releasing—enacts the thematic question of whether forbidden knowledge deserves exclusive custody. The final image ("twilight was the hour when promises learn to be true without shining") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or late thesis statement mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, first person. Perceptual signature is distinct: "I read by walking, advancing towards a column until sorrow thinned, turning aside until wonder rose." Diction is elevated and consistent—"anguished joy," "foreign country," "interference in irregular counsel"—though under peak stress the register remains ornate rather than compressing. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is stable; the voice modulates purposefully without unmotivated register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong images like "thunderheads caught in the throat of a bell" and "opening a vein and watering the street." Information density is high; lines often do multiple jobs. However, the piece shows pattern debt: "anguished joy" appears three times, "across the end of innocence" twice as a refrain without clear reweighting, and several lines carry near-paraphrase (e.g., the steadiness/rhythm paradox is restated). Minor template cadence in the purification sequence. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—anti-pattern as purification method, nostalgia atoms in quartz cages, reading by walking until emotions guide comprehension—feels specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk-taking in the lyric density and conceptual architecture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc cannot work unchanged with different names. Minor deduction for the "anguished joy" phrase, which risks sentimentality, though the embodied grief/joy tension mostly earns it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The historian's choices create key turns: she touches the first atom, refuses to answer the memory, purifies by letting it sing without compulsion, reads by walking until emotions guide her, and releases the cages despite the urge to hoard. Early setup (opening line), middle beats (purification sequence), and closure participation (release decision) all present. Causal pressure and cost connection visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pagoda frames the opening and provides the archive's structure (bronze ribs, glassy shadows, stairwells). It returns at closure when it shivers and new stairs unscroll. However, the pagoda itself is not handled or used across distinct beats; it functions primarily as container. The twilight setting charges the opening and final image but the pagoda as object remains more atmospheric anchor than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia are the archive's contents, each in a quartz cage, demanding varied approach. They shape tactics (step sequences, whispered arithmetic, varied hand gestures) and stakes (purification vs. dissolution). The first atom floods the room with gardens; the second shows children learning single-pattern steps. The release of purified cages is the closure action. Early setup, middle development, closure participation all present with causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" describes the archive's air and motivates the method (avoiding patterns). It constrains the historian's movements—she staggers then glides, counts to five then nothing—with visible tactical cost. The trait appears early and shapes the purification sequence. Closure participation is indirect (the method remains active), but the attribute itself is not visibly reweighted at the end.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Purify" drives the historian's goal and the purification sequence (touching atoms, letting them sing without compulsion, placing cages where shadows interfere). The first purification reveals text in distances the heart must cross. The release of purified cages into the central chamber is the closure action. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage all present with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoiding patterns is the method taught by the elders and dramatized across the purification sequence: varied step sequences, counting to five then nothing, brushing quartz sideways then with the back of hand then not at all. The method constrains choices, creates tactical cost, and is tied to the thematic revelation (ancestors taught light to lose count; custodians hid the method from future selves). Early setup, middle beats shaping attempts, and thematic payoff at closure all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archive is the setting and the stake: corridors fold tighter each year, quartz cages hum when longing is honest, questions answer until names dissolve. It pressures every choice (step sequences, whispered arithmetic) and supplies the resources (atoms of nostalgia, text in distances). The archive notices hoarding and sharpens questions, forcing the release decision. Early setup, middle pressure, closure participation all present with causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" appears as a refrain framing the city's fear of elders and the historian's own transformation. It brackets the narrative (early and late) and charges the final image where the historian feels split between child and scholar. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions in real-time; it functions more as thematic marker than live clock. Early setup and closure reprise present, but middle development as pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To pursue forbidden knowledge motivates the historian's journey to the pagoda and her willingness to risk dissolution by the archive's questions. The motivation is dramatized in the opening ("not for vanity, but because the days behind me had become blurred") and conflicted when she nearly hoards the purified knowledge. The choice to release the cages tests and transforms the motivation. Early setup, middle friction, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Anguished joy is named three times and embodied throughout: "the smell of wet loam remembered the name my mother sang, a name we burned to protect" (joy + grief), "I nearly became a dam" (hoarding vs. mercy), "opening a vein and watering the street, a cruelty and a cure." The tone modulates under pressure and charges the final image where promises "learn to be true without shining." Coherent through turns, though the phrase risks becoming a label when repeated.</comment>
