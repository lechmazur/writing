<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The folklorist protagonist exhibits clear interiority rooted in professional identity and personal history. Embodied emotion appears in "pilgrim's ache," breath management as a survival reflex, and the tactile engagement with the fairy ring. The final gesture—bowing to settle the debt—forecloses the wrong-name bargain with visible cost (she now knows "which promises to keep this time"), and the shadow motif tracks a persistent internal contradiction. Minor slip: some introspection verges on label-speak ("chronically curious," "pretending not to hope") without full embodiment in micro-choices under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through recursive imagery (shadow, glass, names, debts) and a pattern of bargains/restitution. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the protagonist corrects the wrong name, recovers sensory fragments, and bows to honor the debt, reweighting prior material with felt cost ("which promises to keep this time"). Orientation anchors promptly (sunken greenhouse, diver return, decades later). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mushroom ring releases fragments and she steps through, then unwinds the wrong name. Cost is legible in the act of speaking the right name and accepting its lining of recovered sensory memory. The mosaic structure (lyric shards linked by motif rather than strict causal beats) teaches its method early and holds coherent pressure to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks constrains the protagonist's movements (diver caution, breath management, fin strokes) and charges the final image (shipwrecks as "old choir lofts"). Micro-setting details—silt geometry, panes rhyming with portholes, antique ladder—are filtered through professional/personal perception and recur with reweighted meaning. The fairy ring mushroom under the ladder becomes a spatial anchor that enables the climactic step-through. Sensory hierarchy reflects diver priorities (water taste, light motes, peppermint sting). The environment is not postcard backdrop but an active constraint and mnemonic field.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover stolen memories by correcting a past bargain. Agency materializes in the step through the ring, the hand-slide that blurs the wrong name, and the spoken correction—all protagonist-driven micro-choices under pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when she detects the gaps in constellations/portholes, identifies the wrong name, and acts to unwind it. The cost is visible: she trades the eels' trick (fogging glass to forget) for iron-and-mint clarity, accepts the returned sensory fragments as "buttons" that straighten her spine, and bows to honor the debt. The resolution is earned by her hands-on method and childhood promises. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern convergence rather than causal reversal, consistent with the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through debt, naming, and the cost of correcting bargains signed without reading. The fairy ring, shadow, and glass motifs recur with shifted meaning, charging the final image (spores as first snow, knowing which promises to keep). The ending offers a non-literal answer: restitution requires embodied acts (bow, spoken name) and acceptance of recovered memory as obligation, not mere retrieval. No thematic echo or overt moralizing; the particulars (cider press, woodsmoke, mother's hands) ground the meditation on habit, theft, and the moment patterns listen. The lyric mode supports complexity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with stable, profession-inflected perceptual signature: "hands-on folklorist," "empirics of rumor," "tidewriting." Diction is consistently elevated yet concrete, blending technical observation with lyric compression ("kelp and rust script," "anemone apples," "vowels travel slow"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during tactile engagement (touching the ring, sliding hand over film), wider during reflective passages anchored to present stimuli (checking the watch, humming the song). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm tightens during the step-through sequence and loosens in the coda. Sentence variety and image density remain high throughout. Minor consideration: some metaphors approach overwriting ("pollen of faint light," "film spools") but remain legible and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character memory, or motif. Figurative language is pervasive (most sentences carry metaphor or simile) but largely coherent and voice-motivated, befitting a lyric-accumulative mode. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Clarity remains navigable despite compression. Deductions: some adjacent lines hover near paraphrase ("Memory thieves are rarely men... they are habits, ruts, tides" / "Here the bargains are written in kelp and rust") and a few metaphors stack densely in high-pressure beats without breathing room (the film/eel/coat sequence risks slight muddle). No loops that obscure causality; propulsion is steady. The final spore image recharges prior material cleanly. The density approaches but does not cross into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater folklore recovery, sensory-fragment mechanics, and debt correction through naming is specific and non-obvious. The fairy ring as doorway, film-like memory retrieval, and eel-fogging trick are fresh inflections that feel inevitable in hindsight. The lyric-accumulative structure commits fully to its premise without retreat. The hands-on folklorist frame transforms a familiar "return and redemption" arc through occupational detail (tidewriting, rumor empirics) and embodied ritual (bow, spoken name). Risk-taking in density and compression heightens stakes without obscuring the core closure. No close echo of famous work detected. The premise avoids template defaults through its braid of setting, method, and metaphysics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The folklorist identity frames expectation early ("hands-on," "empirics of rumor") and appears in at least three beats: cataloging noises with oilskin notebooks, touching the ring because "doors like manners," and deploying the eel trick to blur the wrong name. The final bow enacts professional respect for debt. The occupation constrains tactics (diver caution, breath discipline) and enables the closure move. Swappability is low; another profession would require different methods. Cost is tied to professional stance (she came to pay, not pry coins).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fairy ring mushroom is introduced mid-story under the antique ladder, touched to release light-motes, stepped through as a doorway, and honored with a bow at closure. It enables the memory-film retrieval and anchors the climactic correction. Its cap color ("old maps, paler rim like a kept promise") charges symbolic weight. The spores settle "like first snow" in the final image, reweighting prior material. Removal would collapse the closure mechanism. Three-gate presence (setup, middle use, payoff) with high causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Decades later" is established in the opening line and shapes the dominant stake (recovery of memories from childhood bargains). The elapsed time creates the gap (shadow mismatch, missing constellations) that the protagonist must close. It does not tighten choices beat-to-beat but provides the before/after frame essential to the closure's weight. The concept is more structural premise than active pressure. Lyric reprise: the opening "decades later" and final "which promises to keep this time" bookend with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Chronically curious" appears as a label in the opening block but does not demonstrably constrain or enable an on-page choice with visible cost. The protagonist's investigative actions (catalog, detect, test) align with curiosity but would read identically without the explicit trait tag. No moment where curiosity compels a risky trade-off or narrows options. Present and functional, but swappable with "methodical" or "trained" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Detect" is the named method ("I detect the stolen drift of my life by studying broken constellations") and drives the middle turn: she maps absences (missing panes, portholes), identifies the wrong-name debt, and acts to correct it. The detection creates the problem-solution hinge. The action recurs implicitly (noticing gaps, tasting water shift) and explicitly anchors the escalation. Removing "detect" would require rewriting the causal spine. Cost is indirect but clear: detection obligates correction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By studying broken constellations on the glazed roof and rusty hulls" is the specified mechanics of detection. It appears once explicitly in the middle third, shapes the identification of gaps/absences, and enables the name-unwinding. The method is concrete and irreplaceable within the story's logic. It does not recur at closure but its fruit (the right name) does. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect (the detected gap leads to correction). Slight swappability: another spatial pattern could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is established in the opening line, constrains movement throughout (diver breathing, fin strokes, silt geometry), supplies the fairy ring under the ladder, and charges the final image (shipwrecks as choir, greenhouse relief). The dual micro-settings (greenhouse shell, shipwreck ribs) create spatial crucible and mnemonic anchor. The glass panes and portholes rhyme to reveal absences. The cider press bench locates the memory retrieval. Removal would erase the story's spatial and thematic logic. Three-gate presence with high causal and symbolic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When habits break" appears as inherited advice from the mother ("the moment to strike bargains is when habits break, because then the pattern listens") but does not visibly tighten the protagonist's on-page decisions. The story shows a return to an old site and correction of a past error, not a depicted moment of habit-breaking pressure. The timeframe remains vague (checking watch "though the tide keeps truer time"). Present thematically, but does not function as a live clock or constraint. Setup only; no middle or closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To recover stolen memories" is the dominant stake, signaled early ("I came to recover stolen memories"), dramatized through the detection of gaps and the step-through retrieval, and fulfilled at closure when sensory fragments (cider, woodsmoke, mother's hands) lace back along her spine. The motivation faces friction: she must trade fogging (forgetting) for clarity (iron and mint), bow to honor debt, and accept which promises to keep. The cost is felt (standing straighter, knowing the burden). Three-gate presence with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Crisp nostalgia" is coherent throughout: peppermint sting, bitter-then-sweet apple taste, sensory fragments as coat lining. Tone modulates from restrained longing (opening ache) to tactile recovery (film, warmth) to relief (greenhouse freed from mispronunciation). The crispness (clean sensory edges, no sentimentality) charges the final spore image without collapsing into mawkishness. Tone pressure increases as fragments accumulate and resolve. The ending crystallizes the nostalgic drive into embodied restitution. Coherent and purposeful, if not indispensable to structure.</comment>
