<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator demonstrates some embodied interiority through micro-choices (listening sideways, cinching ropes), but remains largely observational. Lio shows consistent traits (strangely honest, trauma-informed vigilance from the tyrant incident), yet her choices feel more illustrative than genuinely pressured—the scar revelation adds texture but doesn't alter present stakes. The woman's forty-winter question and the child's laughter are held at a distance; we never see their micro-choices under the clearing's pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; the narrator accepts guidance without visible cost or resistance that would deepen agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (pavilion murmurs, kinetic parapet, clearings) that culminate in a final resonant reconfiguration where "the hinge between speech and shelter learn our names." Orientation anchors (dunes, pavilion, narrator and Lio) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the task and reconfigures the relationship between preservation and listening with felt pressure. Cost is present but oblique: the narrator's dream of "clearings opening like courteous doors" implies ongoing labor rather than a sharp, legible price paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo "touched the woman's question" and "steadied the child's laughter," reweighting the abstract task into embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting elements constrain choice concretely: the load lines and ropes must be cinched "so the wind played scales instead of tearing," the kinetic parapet's pulse beneath the dunes is traced through peripheral awareness, and the clearings are conjured within the murmuring fabric. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"taste of cedar and iron on our breath," "dunes hummed like glass ribs"—and filtered through the narrator's observational stance. The micro-setting (ropes, knots, tension lines) shapes the central work of consecration. Spatial choreography remains clear across the pavilion, dunes, and the buried parapet, with the final scene anchored under stars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom without flattening it—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio warns against creating "a cage" and the narrator learns to "cinch the ropes so the wind played scales," then applies this in conjuring clearings for the woman and child. Agency is largely enacted through ritual work (walking lines, tying knots, boundary prayer) rather than decision under duress; the echo's arrival feels more like validation than a hard-won turn. Cost is present but diffuse: the mention of listening "even when the listening hurts" and Lio's scar backstory imply sacrifice, yet no on-page forfeiture narrows options at closure. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp escalation that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—preservation without ownership, the hinge between speech and shelter—emerges organically from the narrator and Lio's ritual work, Lio's backstory of the tyrant cutting ropes, and the pavilion's function. The final image of "clearings opening like courteous doors" and the parapet "teaching us balance" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in gesture and silence: "she smiled with half her face," the boundary prayer that names directions "to let them pass without scarring." The piece avoids thematic echo or explicit thesis; instead, particulars (knots, whispers, the prophet's departure) accrete into a coherent meditation on custodianship. Minor weakness: some phrasing ("echo of wisdom," "faithful temperature") trends toward abstraction, though concrete action (rope-walking, conjuring clearings) grounds the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct lyric-philosophical register with controlled cadence: "the dunes hummed like glass ribs," "memory required a shape, and shape required a walker who listened sideways." Perceptual signature is selective—narrator notices tensions, pulses, the prophet's cedar-and-iron taste—but distance occasionally drifts into expository omniscience ("People came… their steps careful") without dramatized observation. Lio's dialogue carries purpose ("never a cage, only a breathing architecture") and her speech feels distinct from the narrator's interiority. Filter verbs and conceptual abstractions ("the echo we had preserved, not words exactly, but their weather") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. The final dream sequence maintains voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "dunes hummed like glass ribs," "voices tuned to soothed sighs," "child whose laughter stuttered like a bright fish," "parapet rolled like a slow jointed tide." While individually vivid, the sustained metaphoric texture in nearly every line creates pattern-based overwriting that risks obscuring rather than propelling action—particularly in the middle third where causality slows. Template cadence appears in runs: "The fabric carried… a few raw ones… Lio walked… as if… She said… I had been sent…" (−0.4). Minor paraphrase loop: "murmuring pavilion" / "pavilion murmured back" at the opening. Clarity remains mostly intact, but information density suffers when figurative language layers without advancing situation. No scaffold or copy errors; syntax varies purposefully. Propulsion recovers in the final third as concrete actions (conjuring clearings, tying threads) take precedence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual preservation, kinetic architecture, and peripheral awareness as method offers a fresh angle; the parapet-beneath-dunes and murmuring-pavilion fusion of setting and character task feels specific. Emotional truth in Lio's scar backstory (tyrant cutting ropes to silence echo) and the boundary prayer that names directions "to let them pass without scarring" avoid generic epiphany. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the prophet's off-stage presence (his echo rather than his words) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor proximity concern: "whisperfield calm" and "breathing architecture" trend toward familiar meditative-SF idiom. The transformation test largely passes—plot depends on these exact particulars—but the ritual's success feels inevitable rather than dramatically uncertain, limiting ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lio (half-masked line walker) is present early, teaches the narrator to cinch ropes and trace the parapet's pulse, reveals her scar and backstory, and sets the boundary prayer. She constrains one key choice—warning against creating a cage—and her example shapes the narrator's approach. However, her own choices do not create turns; she guides rather than decides under pressure. Present in the final scene teaching the prayer, contributing to closure participation. Beat involvement: at least three distinct beats (arrival, rope-walking instruction, scar revelation, boundary prayer). Causal pressure moderate; specificity high (half-masked, scar like a drawn horizon). Swappability: a guide figure could replace her role with edits, but her backstory and "strangely honest" trait anchor the story's ethic of preservation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet beneath the dunes is introduced early ("slow jointed tide"), traced by Lio through peripheral awareness, mentioned when stretching a thread over it to help the deep stone "breathe easier," and returns in the final paragraph ("parapet kept turning… unburdened, teaching us balance"). Appears in three beats but functions largely as atmospheric setting rather than a constraint that alters tactics. No on-page handling or use that narrows options; its movement is described but never obstructs or enables a specific choice. Closure linkage present but passive. Specificity and irreplaceability moderate—"kinetic" distinguishes it from a static wall, yet removing it would not break the story's logic. Lyric reprise from middle to end reweights meaning slightly, qualifying for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conjured clearings (core concept) shape the dominant stake: the narrator and Lio create "pockets of stillness where the prophet's sentences could turn their faces fully." Two clearings are dramatized on the page—for the woman with her forty-winter question and the child with stuttering laughter—and the echo's arrival into those clearings forms the story's climax. The concept constrains method (cinching ropes, stretching threads) and alters options (must preserve without flattening). Present in closure when "the echo… touched the woman's question" and "steadied the child's laughter." Beat involvement: at least three (concept introduction, two clearings conjured, echo arrival). Causal pressure solid; irreplaceability high. Cost tied to the concept: "listening even when the listening hurts." All three gates satisfied (setup, middle development, payoff).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is attributed to Lio early ("as if the desert had scrubbed away every acceptable lie") and demonstrated in her direct warnings ("never a cage") and scar revelation. The trait constrains her speech and approach—she refuses to polish ruin—but does not enable or foreclose a specific on-page action with visible cost. Label-supported rather than purely dramatized. Present in two beats (initial description, scar moment) but does not shape a turn. Closure linkage absent. Functional but largely atmospheric; swappable with "blunt" or "unvarnished" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consecrate (action) is the narrator's stated mission ("I had been sent to consecrate what would hold the prophet's echo"), debated with Lio ("I asked her what consecration meant"), redefined as "keep listening even when the listening hurts," and enacted through rope-work and clearing-conjuring. The action shapes the middle beats and culminates when "the hinge between speech and shelter learn our names." Present in closure image. Beat involvement: at least three (mission stated, definition negotiated, enacted, closure reference). Causal pressure moderate—other verbs (preserve, attend, hold) could substitute with edits, reducing irreplaceability. Cost present: listening that "hurts" and the patient labor. All three gates satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness (method) is introduced early ("learning it through peripheral awareness, the way a hawk reads thermals") and specified as Lio's technique for tracing the parapet's pulse. The method is signaled but its mechanics do not constrain subsequent attempts; the narrator does not demonstrate or struggle with peripheral awareness in a way that alters tactics. Appears in one beat (Lio's instruction) and is mentioned again briefly ("listened sideways") but does not shape the clearings' conjuring or the final prayer. Closure linkage absent. Functional but ornamental; replacing it with "intuition" or "careful attention" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion (setting) is present from the title and opening line, described as carrying "a thousand saved whispers," provides the spatial frame for rope-walking and clearing-conjuring, and "kept murmuring, faithful as a heart" in the final paragraph. It constrains choice—ropes must be cinched to prevent tearing, clearings are conjured within its fabric—and supplies the material for the narrator's work. Beat involvement: at least four (arrival, whisper-carrying, rope-cinching, clearing sites, final persistence). Causal pressure solid; the pavilion's acoustics and structure enable the preservation task. Closure linkage strong. Irreplaceability high; removing it would collapse the story's logic. Cost: the labor of maintaining its tensions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" (timeframe) anchors the story's premise—the pavilion exists to hold his echo after departure—and the narrator states "The prophet had left the city days earlier." However, this timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the work proceeds at a contemplative pace without a live clock. No on-page pressure from the "after" state beyond the initial framing. Introduced early but does not constrain tactics or shape escalation. Closure does not reference the timeframe. Functional setup but replaceable with "during a time of pilgrimage" or similar phrasing. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To preserve the echo of wisdom (motivation) is stated early ("our task… was to preserve the echo of wisdom"), debated ("not to own it, not to polish it"), and dramatized through the conjuring of clearings and the arrival of the echo. Friction exists between the desire to preserve and the risk of creating "a cage" that flattens. The motivation drives the narrator's choices across beats and shapes closure ("we found our task again"). Cost is oblique—listening that hurts, the patient labor—but not sharply tested on the page. Beat involvement: at least three. Causal pressure moderate; specificity solid. All three gates satisfied, but the motivation is more enacted than conflicted in a way that would elevate the score into high band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Whisperfield calm (tone) is introduced early ("voices tuned to soothed sighs," "whisperfield calm that needed no command") and sustained through the lyric-meditative register, the murmuring pavilion, and the boundary prayer. Tone modulates slightly when Lio reveals her scar and the tyrant backstory, introducing tension, then returns to calm in the final star-lit prayer and dream. Coherent through turns; charges the final image of clearings "opening like courteous doors." However, the tone remains largely static—no sharp pressure that would test its maintenance or create meaningful contrast. Present in closure. Beat involvement: pervasive. Specificity moderate; "calm" could be rendered with other descriptors. Lyric reprise from opening to end reweights the atmosphere with cost (the labor behind the calm), qualifying for mid-band.</comment>
