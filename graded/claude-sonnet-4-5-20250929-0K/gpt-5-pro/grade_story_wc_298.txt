<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("patch holes in the soul") is established early and drives the catacomb journey, but the character remains more archetype than individual—"reckless idealist, fiercely gentle" functions as label rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's traded future provides backstory weight, yet his presence as "laugh stumble like a foal" then "laugh ran clear" feels more symbolic than causally earned through on-page struggle. Micro-choices (kneeling to soothe roots, scribing on bone) advance the goal, but the final regraft succeeds without visible cost beyond accepting scars—a declared rather than dramatized price. Internal conflict between courage and craft is stated but not shown as simultaneous competing impulses in a single high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard sequence accumulates meaning through layered images (roots, pear, card) that converge at the regraft moment, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the protagonist pledges shared breath and the brother's laugh clears. Orientation anchors who/where/what by the second paragraph. Closure cost is present but oblique: "accept the scars" and "promising never again to bargain alone" land as conceptual rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture of a live option or visible tactical sacrifice. The turn from solo bargaining to partnered mending reweights prior material, but the final image ("card cooled to a leaf's calm") resolves tension more than it sustains charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored: roots between bones, pear grafted into skull's crown, moth-worn gauze lantern. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (kneeling, scribing, walking corridors). The burned tarot card functions as both object and micro-setting, warming like a coal and blinking at the climax, constraining the protagonist's choice to regraft rather than undo the bargain. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "tarry syllables," "dust of wasted afternoons," "bees in snow." The orchard's root-response to the lullaby and the pear's exhalation directly enable the regraft, elevating environment from backdrop to active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the brother's traded future. The protagonist's agency—kneeling to soothe roots, scribing to inlay meaning—drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. One clear tightening: the Keeper's condition ("graft will hold only if you accept the scars") narrows options and the protagonist's pledge ("never again to bargain alone") forecloses solo action. Cost is legible but abstract: "accept the scars" and shared breath are conceptual prices rather than a visible on-page forfeiture. The orchard's bristling roots attempt to trap, then loosen—opposition that tests commitment but resolves quickly without compounding difficulty. No major reversal; the regraft succeeds as a single turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—survival hunger taught to ask kindly, mending through shared witness—emerges organically from the orchard-as-loom image and the protagonist's method of inlaying meaning. The final image ("card cooled to a leaf's calm") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the Keeper's lines: "seams hold until someone loves them open" and "teach it to ask kindly" carry layered meaning. The burned card's eye closing "content to dream" reweights the opening setup with earned cost. However, "stories grow where water listens" and "irrigation for the thirsty" edge toward poetic abstraction rather than staying rooted in the catacomb's bone-and-bark particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is poetic and controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: "breathing architecture of memory and debt," "resolve like a shawl," "humming that sounded like bees in snow." POV remains stable third-limited, no head-hopping. Dialogue ("You have come to barter more, she said, or to complain at what you bought with your crying") carries subtext and advances plot. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism that tests the protagonist's immediate experience under duress: "dusky resolve settled in my bones" and "every bargain given a witness who would not lie" read more authorial than character-lived. Psychic distance is mostly consistent; the card's blink and the brother's laugh are filtered through perception rather than stated omnisciently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "fever broke," "graft took like morning," "breath stitched with soot." Clarity occasionally suffers from stacked metaphors: "market of bartered destinies" and "holes it makes in people" and "trammel that breath" within three beats risks mixed vehicle logic. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "I traced... I told... I answered... I began..." runs across four moves. Information density is high—most lines advance both action and atmosphere—but "fiercely gentle" is asserted three times without fresh embodiment. Propulsion remains strong; no paraphrase loops touch the closure beat. One minor homophone slip: "dusky resolve" functions as tone label rather than sensory anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard as a market for bartered destinies offers a fresh synthesis of underworld imagery and relational debt. The protagonist's method—inlaying meaning everywhere—transforms the typical rescue-quest by making the repair work itself the climax rather than a confrontation. The burned tarot card with its surviving eye is a specific, non-obvious detail that earns its symbolic weight. However, the "reckless idealist" and "fiercely gentle" framing touches familiar YA/fantasy templates, and the regraft resolution avoids the harder calculus of permanent cost. The orchard-as-loom reveal and "teach hunger to ask kindly" risk abstraction. Transformation test: the emotional arc (solo courage insufficient, partnered mending succeeds) would hold with different imagery, suggesting freshness resides more in texture than in structural ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The reckless idealist trait shapes the protagonist's initial solo approach and the Keeper's rebuke ("courage without a craft is only noise"), driving the turn to "inlaying meaning" as method. The decision to kneel and soothe roots with the lullaby, then to pledge shared breath, are on-page choices that narrow options. However, "reckless idealist" is stated in paragraph three and functions more as label than embodied contradiction—no on-page moment where recklessness visibly costs the protagonist a tactical advantage or forces a tradeoff. Present in setup, one middle beat (kneeling), and implicit in the closure pledge, satisfying two gates. Cost is conceptual (accepting scars, forgoing solo action) rather than a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The burned tarot card is introduced early (paragraph five), handled across multiple beats (traced with thumb, pressed to bark, threads cling to it, eye blinks, card cools), and charges the closure image ("cooled to a leaf's calm, eye closed"). Its warming "like a coal" and the blinking eye enable the regraft turn. Removing it would collapse the brother's presence and the closure's anchor. Cost is tied to it: the card survived flames and still holds heat, embodying the debt's persistence. Specificity is high: "all edges cindered except the eye looking straight through." Present in setup, middle development (bark press, eye blink), and ending (cooling, dreaming), satisfying all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bartered destinies frame the premise (brother traded his future, market takes destinies) and the Keeper's dialogue ("exchange so the living remember how to choose," "seams hold until someone loves them open"). The protagonist's goal—to trammel the market's breath—directly engages the concept. However, the mechanics remain abstract: what constitutes a destiny, how bargains are struck, and why the regraft succeeds are told rather than shown. The concept shapes the dominant stake but does not visibly constrain tactics on the page—no moment where the barter's rules force a specific choice or forfeiture. Present in setup and thematic dialogue, weak in middle mechanics, implicit in closure. Two gates, lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is stated in paragraph three and demonstrated in one on-page action: kneeling to soothe roots with "tarry syllables." The trait enables the roots to loosen, altering tactics. However, it is repeated as label twice more ("Fiercely gentle, I knelt") without fresh embodiment or visible tradeoff. No moment where gentleness costs speed or fierceness risks harm. The attribute appears in setup and one middle beat, missing closure participation. Swappable with "patient" or "soothing" in the kneeling beat without structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Trammel" (to bind or restrain) is stated early as the protagonist's goal: "to trammel that breath, to bind it where it will do no more harm." The action shapes the journey and the Keeper's response, but the actual trammeling is performed through "inlaying meaning" (scribing on bone/root/air) rather than a discrete binding act. The final pledge to return and "trammel what slithered in as temptation" defers the action off-page. Present in setup dialogue and implicit in the scribing method, but no single on-page beat where trammeling decisively alters outcome. Could be replaced with "heal," "seal," or "guard" without rewriting structure. Two gates, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "inlaying meaning everywhere" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 27: "my method: inlaying meaning everywhere") and demonstrated on-page: "scribe on bone, on root, on air, threading stories like veins through wood." The scribing causes the orchard to quiver, pears to exhale, and threads of light to fall—direct causal pressure. The protagonist continues the method post-closure ("On the walls, I continued inlaying meaning... as irrigation"). Removing it would leave the regraft mechanics unexplained. However, late signal (past 40% mark) and the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how inscription binds destinies is told more than shown. Present in middle development and ending, missing early setup. Two gates, strong causal role, late arrival caps ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is anchored early (paragraph two: "tree roots snake between bones") and supplies concrete pressure: roots attempt to trap ankles, pear tree grafted into skull enables the regraft, branches release light threads. Spatial details (Keeper beneath pear, protagonist kneeling, walking corridors) remain coherent. The orchard's response to the lullaby and its quiver during scribing directly alter tactics and outcome. Removing the orchard would collapse the story's spatial logic and symbolic architecture. Present in setup, middle (root trap, pear graft), and ending (orchard as loom). Micro-setting (roots, skull-crown pear) constrains choice and charges the final reveal. All three gates, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" opens and closes the story as setting descriptor and tonal frame, not a temporal constraint. No live clock or deadline tightens decisions—the journey unfolds at contemplative pace without time pressure. The half-light suggests liminality but does not limit options or force urgency. Present in first and final paragraphs as lyric bookend, absent from middle development, no closure participation beyond atmospheric reprise. Static mood rather than escalating constraint. Two gates (setup, ending) via lyric return, but no causal pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to patch holes in the soul, mine and those left whistling through the orchard's ribs" is stated early (paragraph four) and drives every major choice: following the map, confronting the Keeper, scribing to mend, pledging shared breath. The desire is dramatized through action (kneeling, scribing, offering method) and tested by the Keeper's condition (accept the scars). Cost is visible: forgoing solo courage, accepting permanent scars, sharing breath. Internal friction appears when the protagonist admits "I had not bought, I had begged, and the price ran on"—want (to repair) conflicts with the debt's ongoing cost. Present in setup, middle (scribing), and ending (pledge, regraft). All three gates, strong causal role, felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone "dusky resolve" is stated late (paragraph 41: "Dusky resolve settled in my bones") but the mood—somber determination within shadowed liminality—is consistent from the half-lit corridors opening through the veiled lantern and bruised grove to the cooled card ending. Modulation under pressure: urgency when roots bristle, quiet intensity during scribing, calm at closure. The final image (card cooled, eye content) charges the tone with earned rest. However, "dusky resolve" as phrase is label-only, not sensory anchor. Coherent across beats, modulates with stakes, charges ending. Present in setup (half-light), implicit in middle (lantern lowered to bruise), explicit and charged at ending. Two-to-three gates, strong coherence, late label.</comment>
