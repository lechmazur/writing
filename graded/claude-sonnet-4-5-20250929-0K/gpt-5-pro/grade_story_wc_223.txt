<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's internal voice is distinctive—trauma survivor wrestling with performance vs. authenticity—and the choice to "unbind" from false scripts drives meaningful movement. Embodied detail ("wrist still wore the faint ladder of scars") grounds emotion. However, interiority occasionally slips into lyric abstraction ("luminous absence taught me where to stand") that reads more poetic than character-particular. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost (coiling the red cord, marking pebbles on the chessboard), though the Custodian remains more archetype than individuated pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (chessboard, tiles, dome echoes) and the final walking-words sequence reconfigures the narrator's relationship to memory with felt cost. Orientation anchors quickly (whispering gallery, interregnum, narrator as crisis-actor-turned-survivor). The closure—walking LISTEN, STAY, MEND and receiving the Custodian's nod as "both sentence and pardon"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in the choice to "teach grief to migrate." One small gap: the transition from walking BEGIN to the full walking method feels compressed, but causality holds under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's curved acoustics and tiled alphabet constrain and enable the protagonist's method throughout, fulfilling the micro-setting test. Sensory detail—iodine and smoke from the dome, veined marble bench, concentric tiles—anchors the space without tourism. The gallery's circular architecture mirrors the thematic refusal of linear drills and scripted exits. Spatial choreography (center under oculus, second rank of chessboard, heel-to-toe tile touching) remains clear and purposeful across all beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming historian of small gestures to prevent the city from forgetting—signals early and tightens when the Custodian warns against performance and the narrator must unbind from false danger scripts. The walking method provides one meaningful escalation (touching tiles summons stored murmurs with visceral cost: iodine, smoke, a torn sleeve memory). The final "nod" as permission and pardon offers Charged Poise with felt cost, though the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative rather than pressured by external antagonist. One reversal (rejection of performance for small harvests) narrows options with visible consequence (coiling the red cord, mapping pebbles).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as embodied practice, small gestures outlasting grand speeches—emerges organically from the tile-walking method and chessboard's missing pawns without overt statement. The interregnum's "luminous absence" and the Custodian's callused palm spelling HOME deliver resonant subtext. The final image (words held "as a lantern holds the idea of fire") offers non-literal answer to how a city rebuilds from "choreography of care" rather than plans. Minor slip: "nomadic penumbra" phrase feels decorative rather than thematically weight-bearing, but overall the piece earns its wisdom through concrete particulars (kettle clicks, child's apologies, lovers' silence).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-dense and sustained, with a perceptual signature rooted in crisis-survival grammar ("drills inside me broke like cheap toys," "exits painted on the walls"). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The Custodian's dialogue carries distinct authority ("we only harvest the small"), though brief. Minor artifice: some metaphoric stacking in early paragraphs ("pause so wide the air itself seemed to hesitate," "absence could phosphoresce") approaches overwriting but stays legible and voice-consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between reflection and present action without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; however, several adjacent lines layer metaphor without causal propulsion ("echo," "phosphoresce," "luminous absence," "ledger of breaths" cluster in opening third). Sentence variety strong; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. One scaffold moment: "I understood and unbound the red cord entirely" tells the understanding rather than showing the micro-choice. Information density solid overall, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Final image ("dome held them as a lantern holds the idea of fire") lands cleanly without muddle, keeping closure untouched by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The whispering-gallery-as-archive premise and tile-walking method offer a fresh synthesis; the crisis-actor/real-survivor duality adds non-obvious moral texture. Transformation test passes: plot and arc are inseparable from the specific gallery mechanics and the scars of performed vs. actual trauma. The interregnum frame and "benevolently ruthless" Custodian avoid stock post-apocalyptic templates. Minor proximity concern: "luminous absence" and lantern-as-idea-of-fire echo poetic commonplaces, but the walking alphabet and chessboard-pawn metaphor feel specific and earned. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character (crisis actor real crisis survivor) is introduced early, drives the central tension (performance vs. authenticity), and shapes the final choice to unbind from false scripts and walk words of care. Present in opening, middle reflection on drills breaking, and closure coiling the red cord. Two beats: rejecting performance, teaching grief to migrate. Causal pressure moderate; the character background enables the stance shift with visible cost (scars, torn sleeve memory). Swappability moderate—another trauma type could substitute with edits—but the drill/real-fire contrast is specific enough to earn mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Object (chessboard missing all the pawns) appears early, handled twice (Custodian sets it down, narrator places pebbles on squares to mark letters), and functions as map of the vanished. Returns in closure paragraph as the narrator "kept count of the lost while I kept count of the living." Three beats: introduction, explanation of missing pawns, final pebble-marking ledger. Causal role moderate—it provides thematic resonance and a physical anchor for the narrator's task but does not constrain a peak choice under pressure. Closure linkage present but somewhat ornamental; the walking method does the heavier causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core Concept (nomadic penumbra) appears once as retrospective phrase: "we lived on the edge of permission, in the swing of a door that never decided." No setup in opening third; no middle development that constrains choice; not present in closure. Functions as thematic label for the narrator's post-crisis wandering but does not shape on-page tactics or stakes. Ornamental and swappable—"liminal dislocation" or similar could replace with no structural impact. Late, tell-only, zero causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attribute (benevolently ruthless) applied to Custodian twice: introduction and final nod. The trait manifests in on-page action: she brings the chessboard and spells out the method without sentimentality ("you must unbind yourself"), then prunes the narrator's flourishes and grants sparse permission. Two beats, visible tradeoff (no coddling, but guidance with cost). Present early and at closure ("benevolently ruthless, pruning my flourishes"; "in that nod I recognized both sentence and pardon"). Swappability moderate—"stern grace" could substitute—but the pairing of care and severity drives the Custodian's pressure role. Missing causal cost tied specifically to the attribute; the narrator adjusts behavior but not under visible duress.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Action (unbind) recurs across three beats: Custodian instructs "unbind yourself from the scripts," narrator literally unbinds the red cord, and final paragraph references unbound state. Early signal (first third), middle execution (coiling the cord as decision), closure participation (cord coiled beside chessboard in final ledger). The action definitionally opposes the crisis-actor's bound scripts and enables the walking practice. Causal pressure strong—removal of the cord enacts the refusal of performance and opens the circle for the ledger work. Cost visible (renouncing safety of drills). Irreplaceability high; "release" or "let go" would lack the physical and metaphoric specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Method (a pattern of walking that spells words) introduced by Custodian in first third, demonstrated in middle (narrator walks B-E-G-I-N, then full words), and executed at closure (LISTEN, STAY, MEND). Mechanics detailed: heel-to-toe, touching tiles, letters summon murmurs from dome. Three distinct beats with escalating use: learning, practicing with sensory feedback (iodine, smoke, laughter), and final installation of words as city memory. The method is the protagonist's primary tactic and irreplaceable—no other action could fulfill the historian role. Causal pressure high; the walking constrains choices (must stay centered, cannot perform flourishes) and delivers the closure's ledger of breaths. Cost implicit in the physical discipline and renunciation of grand gestures.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting (whispering gallery) anchors opening, provides the curved acoustics and tiled alphabet that enable the walking method, and houses the closure scene. Three gates met: early setup, middle constraint (circular choreography, center under oculus, tiles as alphabet), closure participation (dome holds final words "as a lantern holds the idea of fire"). The gallery's physics—echoes return "brighter," murmurs stored in the crown—directly shape the protagonist's task and supply the resources (tiles, acoustics) that make memory preservation possible. Irreplaceable; a library or archive could not provide the kinetic, spatial grammar. Causal pressure high; the environment is the method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Timeframe (during an interregnum) signals in opening line and recurs as backdrop ("pause so wide the air itself seemed to hesitate," "the city had no ruler"). Present early but does not constrain on-page choices—no ticking clock, no rival claimant arriving, no deadline. Functions thematically (power vacuum, absence as resource) but not tactically. Middle and closure beats proceed without time pressure. Swappable with "post-collapse" or "transitional period" with minimal edits. Lyric resonance moderate (interregnum enables the gallery work) but no felt cost tied to duration or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation (to become the historian of small gestures) stated early, dramatized in the Custodian's teaching ("we only harvest the small," "do not record fire, we record the fingers that strike the match"), and fulfilled at closure (walking LISTEN, STAY, MEND as ledger of breaths). Three beats: declaration, conflict with impulse to perform, resolution via walking method and pebble-marking. Friction visible between the narrator's drill-trained impulse to "perform" and the Custodian's pruning, creating on-page cost (unbinding the cord, practicing small routes). The desire shapes all major choices and the final image. Irreplaceability moderate—"archivist of quiet acts" could substitute, but "small gestures" vs. "grand speeches" pairing is specific to the narrator's trauma grammar.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone (luminous absence) established in opening ("absence could phosphoresce," "luminous absence taught me where to stand") and sustained through contemplative, lyric register across all beats. Modulates with pressure: reflective in backstory passages, concentrated during tile-walking, elegiac at closure ("lantern holds the idea of fire"). The tone charges the final image by making absence productive rather than void, reweighting the interregnum and missing pawns as resources. Coherent through turns; no tonal rupture. Specificity high—this exact tonal pairing (light within loss) cannot be swapped without structural change to theme. Cost implicit in the sustained discipline of seeing absence as presence.</comment>
