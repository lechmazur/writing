<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to free creativity is consistent and embodied through the instrument and aurora interactions. Internal experience is vivid—"my heart hears unspoken words," the dust that "bloomed into maps behind my lids"—but theursed gift and silent communication remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The fledglings scene offers embodied emotion, yet the protagonist's micro-choices feel preordained by the dreamlike logic rather than forged through genuine internal conflict. The final renunciation ("let the instrument rest") lands as earned stasis with visible cost, but earlier beats lack the friction that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and teaches an accumulative/textural lens early: the protagonist traces star-routes through the instrument to unlock trapped creativity. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis—"I bowed and let the instrument rest again upon the stone"—with the conceptual cost legible in "a thin line of cold remained inside me" and the promise to "watch whenever stars begin to fall." The causal chain is present but sometimes elided ("stepped into a night deeper than weather," "shaped the silent chorus into a key") in ways that favor lyric resonance over mechanical linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fledglings open their eyes and creativity walks back, tightening the stakes and demonstrating cost. The lens holds, but the middle transitions rely on poetic compression that occasionally obscures the exact mechanics of unlocking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is grounded early, and the instrument functions as micro-setting—brass and sorrowful, its face bearing an "unwritten calendar" that the protagonist traces and uses to catch falling star-routes. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "frost in my hair," "the ground rang like a bell," "ink ran from their beaks like warm rain." The archway and instrument constrain choices (the protagonist must stand within the arch, turn the brass circles) and charge the final image when the instrument rests "dark now, the needles at peace, the brass chill as a vow." The town's transformation—windows unlatching, a child shaking dry paint, an old poet threading stitches loose—anchors the consequence spatially. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, with the protagonist's position and the instrument's state tracked across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity before it starves—is signaled early and drives the protagonist's journey under the arch. Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's method: tracing star-routes, breathing on scratches, combing the night with needles until sparks drift free. The fledglings' sealed beaks and the calendar-trap provide external resistance, and the unlocking sequence offers one meaningful tightening when the protagonist "shaped the silent chorus into a key" and "unlocked the fear sewn across the calendar, stitch by stitch." Agency is present but operates more through ritual than contested decision; the protagonist's choices feel guided by remembered stardust rather than forged through doubt or trade-off. The cost—"a thin line of cold remained inside me"—is felt, though the escalation relies on accumulative density rather than a sharp reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: creativity as living thing that molts, starves, and walks on patient feet; fear as a calendar-trap that must be unlocked stitch by stitch without tearing the days. The returning motifs—stardust, the instrument, the archway, the unwritten calendar—shift meaning across beats and charge the final promise to "watch whenever stars began to fall." The cost of unlocking is not stated but embodied in "a thin line of cold remained inside me" and "the ache of the sky" asking for mercy. The piece resists overt moralizing; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to free creativity without destroying time. Subtext operates in the fledglings' "unspoken plea," the keeper's silence, and the protagonist's bow. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with a consistent texture in diction ("moonstruck dreamer," "star-salted mantle," "hour between breaths") and a perceptual signature that filters the world through remembered stardust and silent sound. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person, and the protagonist's way of noticing—"aurora rippled as if amused," "ground rang like a bell"—is selective and biased toward celestial metaphor. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that, while beautiful, can feel crafted for effect rather than urgent interiority under pressure ("syllables, remembered stardust stitching itself into lullabies and oaths and brushstrokes"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and mostly paid off, though some transitions ("stepped into a night deeper than weather") rely on poetic license that slightly obscures the stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is generally controlled, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that create visual cadence. Information density is high in places—"windows unlatched as we passed, and shy lamps leaned out like listeners, and the boarded shops breathed"—but the piece also carries decorative metaphor runs in high-pressure beats that slow propulsion: "Their unspoken plea rustled against my ribs" followed immediately by "The creativity of a hundred minds had been trapped by fear of the day, and now it slept standing up." Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "I [verb]" structures across adjacent lines. Minor paraphrase loops: "the aurora flared, and the instrument awoke" followed shortly by "the aurora heard me through stone, answering in ripples." The closure beat is clean, but mid-section figurative density and some filter-verb stacks ("I felt the hour," "I should have exulted") dull immediacy. No single artifact touches closure, so the accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for template stems and figurative stacking in pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of aurora, falling stars, an unwritten calendar, and trapped creativity as fledglings with wax-sealed beaks is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms familiar tropes—dreamers freeing beauty from repression—through the grounded mechanics of the instrument and the star-tracing method. The final promise to "watch whenever stars began to fall" feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is evident in the accumulative/lyric structure and the highly metaphorical language, though that same density occasionally prioritizes texture over clarity. The emotional truth of the cost—"a thin line of cold remained inside me"—anchors the fantastical premise. No close echoes of famous lines detected, and the voice feels coherent as a singular artistic stance rather than a prompt-response.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonstruck dreamer is present from the opening line and makes key choices: to lift the instrument, to trace cold arcs, to step into the archway, to turn the brass circles, to speak to the fledglings, to shape the silent chorus into a key, to unlock the calendar, and finally to let the instrument rest and promise to watch. These decisions drive at least four distinct beats and directly shape the closure. The character's traits (hears unspoken words, remembers stardust) enable the method. Early signal, strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost is visible in the "thin line of cold" and the promise that binds the protagonist going forward. Irreplaceable: the dreamer's specific curse/gift is necessary for the unlocking.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument appears in the opening ("I lifted my astronomical instrument"), is described in detail as "brass and sorrowful" with "an unwritten calendar" on its face (setup beat), is used mid-story when the protagonist "turned the brass circles to catch their routes" and "let the instrument rest against my shoulder" (development beats), and returns at closure when "the instrument dark now, the needles at peace, the brass chill as a vow" and the protagonist "let the instrument rest again upon the stone." Present in or shaping at least three beats, with evolving use. The instrument constrains the method (protagonist must trace with it) and charges the final image. Early signal, strong beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present. Minor friction: the exact mechanics of how the instrument "awakens" and its needles pivot are poetically elided.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Remembered stardust is seeded early ("guided by remembered stardust") and returns in the key mid-story moment: "I remembered my mother brushing morning light from the sill, saying the stars molt like birds. I had not believed her until the first idea I ever loved arrived with ash on its feathers." It reappears when "Those sparks were not embers but syllables, remembered stardust stitching itself into lullabies and oaths and brushstrokes." The concept shapes the protagonist's method (tracing star-routes) and the thematic resonance of creativity as fallen matter. Present in two distinct beats and charges the closure image obliquely. Early signal and lyric reprise qualify, but the concept operates more as thematic frame than on-page constraint that narrows options. Mid-high 6s for purposeful early-to-final resonance with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The attribute "hears unspoken words" is introduced early ("my heart hears unspoken words and answers without moving my lips") and enables a key beat: "Their unspoken plea rustled against my ribs, and my cursed gift flared; I heard what they would not say." This allows the protagonist to understand the fledglings and proceed with the unlocking. Present in two beats, with one clear causal role. The attribute constrains the method (protagonist must listen, not speak) and the cost is hinted in "cursed gift." Early signal and moderate beat involvement, but it does not reappear at closure or shape the final image directly. Mid-6s for functional causal role without closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "rest" appears at the emotional peak when the protagonist "let the instrument rest against my shoulder" mid-story (a pause under pressure) and again at closure: "I bowed and let the instrument rest again upon the stone." The final rest is the decisive act that signals Earned Stasis and crystallizes the cost ("a thin line of cold remained inside me"). Present in two beats, shapes the closure unit, and the repeated form reweights meaning (from tactical pause to vow). Early presence, closure linkage, and specificity. Minor friction: the first use is less decisive than the second, so the action's full weight lands late. High 7s for closure-shaping repetition with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method "by tracing the path of falling stars" is explicitly stated mid-story: "The method was plain, written in wind and ice: I would free it by tracing the path of falling stars." The protagonist then enacts it: "I set my feet within the archway and turned the brass circles to catch their routes as they sank. Each star wrote a thought across the instrument, a pale scratch that warmed when I breathed upon it." The method shapes the middle beats (combing the night with needles until sparks drift free) and the closure consequence (creativity walks back, protagonist promises to watch falling stars). Signaled explicitly, demonstrated across multiple beats, and present in the final promise. Early signal, strong beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway anchors the setting from the opening line ("I arrived beneath the aurora-lit archway") and constrains the protagonist's action: "I set my feet within the archway" to unlock the trap. The aurora responds to the protagonist's voice ("The aurora heard me through stone, answering in ripples") and "kept the archway lit" at closure, "a slow wave folding and unfolding like breath." Present in opening, middle, and closing beats. The archway functions as threshold and pressure-point; the protagonist must stand within it to perform the unlocking. Early signal, moderate beat involvement, causal pressure (location matters), and closure linkage. Mid-high 7s for essential spatial role and charged final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The unwritten calendar is introduced early as the instrument's feature and the trap's form: "Its face bore an unwritten calendar, not blank but breathing, teasing numbers from the edge of thought" and "the trap was sprung across an unwritten calendar, stretched thin as a net over the dark." The protagonist uses it: "My fingers traced cold arcs where nights should have been named" and unlocks "the fear sewn across the calendar, stitch by stitch, without tearing the days." The timeframe reappears in the final promise: "Across an unwritten calendar that only my fingers could feel, I promised to watch whenever stars began to fall." Present in three beats, with causal and closure roles. The calendar constrains the method (must unlock stitch by stitch without tearing) and charges the final vow. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage. Mid-high 6s for functional integration; the "hour between breaths" motif is less developed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to free trapped creativity" is stated early ("I had come to free trapped creativity, before it starved in attics and dried on the tongues of children") and drives all major choices: lifting the instrument, stepping into the archway, tracing star-routes, speaking to the fledglings, shaping the silent chorus into a key, unlocking the calendar. The motivation is tested when the protagonist glimpses "the cost of a lock and its key" and feels "a thin line of cold remained inside me," yet proceeds. The desire is dramatized in action and carries friction (the cost, the keeper's silence, the protagonist's bow). Present across all beats, shapes closure, and the final promise reaffirms the commitment with visible cost. Early signal, strong beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection. High 7s for driving the arc with felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tone "shadowed rapture" is established in the opening lines ("shadowed rapture of green fire," "frost in my hair and purpose in my breath") and modulates across beats: awe when the aurora ripples, solemnity when the fledglings appear with "their eyes shut, their beaks sealed with midnight wax," quiet triumph when "creativity walked back to the town on patient feet," and melancholy at closure ("I should have exulted, but rapture is always shadowed when you glimpse the cost"). The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image: "the aurora kept the archway lit, a slow wave folding and unfolding like breath." Early signal, modulation under pressure, and closure linkage all present. The tone is purposeful and distinct, supporting the accumulative/lyric lens. High 7s for coherent emotional arc that reweights the opening rapture with cost.</comment>
