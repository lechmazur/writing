<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is embodied through physical action (tying ribbons, carving) and carries a distinct perceptual filter shaped by craft and loss. The spectral mentorship avoids therapy-speak and operates through gesture and remembered discipline. Internal conflict between instruction and judgment is felt but could press harder at the closure moment. Micro-choices (untying the braid, cutting channels where hollows demand) earn the final shift without forcing an epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. The piece braids lines and voices across multiple evenings, teaching its mosaic early, and the closure—loosening the braid so gaps can glow—reweights the dominant stake (collective grief's shape) with visible cost (letting go of tight control). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One slight pressure wobble: the shift from "no edge" to "let it fall open" feels slightly under-motivated within the scene, relying on the grandmother's poem rather than an on-page dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse's fogged panes, iron ribs, misting pipes, and butterfly-laden rafters ground every beat. The woven ribbon roll becomes micro-setting infrastructure, constraining the carver's method and supplying the visual logic of the braid. Spatial choreography (figs, trellises, benches, vents) remains coherent across multiple nights. The environment charges the final image: untying ribbons among ferns, gaps glowing in stone, and the last monarchs lifting outside.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the shape of collective grief—signals early and tightens through ribbon-tying, carving intersections, and townsfolk contributions. The peak question ("how to finish what had no edge") forces a meaningful choice: loosen the braid, let gaps glow. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's obedience to spectral guidance and prior accumulation of voices. Cost is visible (letting go of control, permitting incompleteness) but the dramatized friction leading to the grandmother's final poem could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as a braid that holds through gaps rather than closure—emerges from the ribbon mechanics, the crossings, and the final untying without sermonizing. The supper where "voices circl[e] like moths" and the promise to "retrace the braid as new losses join" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the "corridor of light" the stone accepts and the butterflies that "shiver as if punctuation had traveled through their thin bones." No thematic echo or moralizing; the final image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "slow of hand and fiercely meditative," noticing "crossings," "hollows," and the greenhouse's "damp lungs." Psychic distance remains stable; free indirect style is clean. Diction—"spectral mentorship," "thundering calm," "unseen figure"—reads purpose-driven and voice-consistent. The grandmother's presence is rendered through "pressed behind my shoulder" and "measured pauses between drops," not head-hopping. One slight register drift: "coordinates" and "articulate" feel fractionally elevated in a few beats but do not break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density; nearly every line advances character, setting, or the ribbon/stone relationship. Rhythm modulates well: longer contemplative sentences compress into shorter beats at peak moments ("I obeyed"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "fiercely meditative, the kind who listens before any chisel dares to speak" and "sorrow grows where life insists on staying" edge toward purple without obscuring meaning. Figurative density is high but purposeful and consistent with the lyric mode taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of gravestone carving, greenhouse setting, butterfly migration, and ribbon-tracing as method for collective grief is specific and non-obvious. The braid metaphor is earned through physical action rather than imposed. The spectral mentorship via pauses in misting pipes and favorite poems at dinner transforms familiar tropes. Risk-taking (mosaic structure across multiple nights, heavy reflection, lyric closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One derivative shadow: the "artist communes with dead mentor" frame is recognizable, though the ribbon-and-gap mechanics freshen it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in opening. Development: ties ribbons, translates stem to stone, carves at intersections, asks the grandmother how to finish. Payoff: obeys the grandmother's instruction to loosen the braid, cuts channels where hollows demand, and promises to retrace next season. The carver's choices—what to tie, where to carve, when to untie—drive every major beat and shape the closure. Cost: letting go of control, accepting incompleteness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: drawn from satchel in paragraph 7. Development: tied to stalks and trellises, traced across bench, becomes a guide; each strand crosses another, teaching the braid. Payoff: loosened between ferns in the penultimate beat, then rewound in the final line with a promise to retrace. The ribbon's mechanics (crossings, intersections, slackening) are irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's core logic. High specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "spectral mentorship" named in paragraph 10, operating through "pressed behind my shoulder." Development: the grandmother offers poems in "measured pauses," makes room in the air for townsfolk, and answers the carver's peak question about finishing. Payoff: her final poem about hands prompts the untying that enables closure. The concept shapes tactics (what to carve, how to listen) and alters the final image. Cost: the carver must obey guidance without full understanding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "fiercely meditative" in the opening. Development: the trait manifests in "thoughts did not scatter but pooled," listening before chiseling, and reciting poems into leaves. Payoff: visible in the final promise to "retrace the braid" and "keep the thundering calm." The attribute constrains method (slowness, listening) but does not force a visible tradeoff or friction point that alters a key choice under pressure. Mostly label-consistent behavior rather than a high-stakes enabler.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "retrace" appears in paragraph 15 as the ribbon becomes a guide. Development: the carver retraces the path of each voice, and "retrace where the ribbon intersected shadow." Payoff: the final paragraph promises "to retrace the braid as new losses joined." The action defines the method and recurs with reweighted meaning (from discovery to ongoing ritual). However, "retrace" is somewhat swappable with "follow" or "trace" in most beats without breaking logic; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph 12 as a pre-existing custom that continued "like a clock without hands" after the grandmother's death. Development: renewed each evening in the greenhouse, poems become "coordinates," and the grandmother answers through pauses. Payoff: the supper where "everyone traded favorite poems at dinner" and the grandmother's final poem about hands that instructs the untying. The custom shapes the carver's tactics, enables the spectral mentorship, and charges the ending's communal resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: "ancient greenhouse at dusk" in the opening line, detailed across paragraphs 3–4 with fogged panes, iron ribs, misting pipes. Development: the greenhouse supplies the fig trees, gutter, ferns, vents, and mesh for ribbon-tying; its "damp lungs" breathe approval; butterflies settle along rafters. Payoff: the final supper among the benches and the last monarchs lifting outside anchor the closure. The setting constrains method, shapes every beat, and charges the final image; removing it breaks the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "across the butterfly migration" in paragraph 4. Development: butterflies settle and shiver through multiple evenings; the "last monarchs" gathered on the heaviest evening mark the peak. Payoff: "the butterflies outside lifted in a last radiant cloud" after the supper. The timeframe provides seasonal rhythm and a visual motif but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics with a live clock. The story's pacing is iterative ("night after night") rather than urgent, so time functions as texture more than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 5, "a simple oath to discover the shape of collective grief." Development: every ribbon-tying and carving beat dramatizes this desire; the carver braids voices, seeks intersections, and asks how to finish. Payoff: the loosening of the braid and the promise to retrace as new losses join answer the motivation. Friction between wanting control (a tight braid) and needing openness (gaps that glow) creates visible cost. The desire is dramatized through choice, not told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setup: "thundering calm" in the opening line. Development: "gentle thunder, a private storm under glass," "every pause returned...in calm," and "keep the thundering calm" in the final line. The tone modulates with pressure—contemplative in ribbon-tying, heavier at the peak question, resolving into communal breath at the supper—while maintaining coherent duality (force and stillness). The oxymoron charges the final image and is irreplaceable; the story teaches the reader to hear both registers simultaneously.</comment>
