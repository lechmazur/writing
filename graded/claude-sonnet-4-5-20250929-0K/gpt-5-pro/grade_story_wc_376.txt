<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's physical sensitivity to dishonesty provides a concrete internal contradiction that operates on the page ("my wrists went weak because I had paid with a lie"). The final confession sequence embodies emotional progression through specific admissions that accumulate pressure. However, the calligrapher's motivations remain largely told rather than tested through difficult trade-offs; the journey to the Ear unfolds without meaningful resistance that would force contradictory impulses to act simultaneously. The ending choice feels more like a revelation than a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered imagery (glass lungs, irrigation spines, the Ear's acoustic metaphor) and the closure unit achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when voices "deferred until someone honest enough" are released. The map-piecing method provides causal linkage across beats, and the final image reweights the premise (words weren't lost, only held). Orientation anchors arrive within the first third. Cost is felt conceptually—candor as payment—but the price remains abstract; the protagonist doesn't forfeit a live option or relationship on the page, which keeps this from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city functions as more than backdrop: glass ribs throw shadow-bars, toxic sky closes vents, the Ear's panels require specific interaction. The zinc plate slot and the spindle of copper vine are handled objects that constrain the protagonist's path. Sensory economy is strong—"breath of old glue rose, sharp and clean like a reprimand"—and the micro-setting (the corroded slot, the scarred panes) charges the final image. The setting directly enables closure by providing the mechanism through which lost words return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding lost conversations—is signaled early and sustained. The progression from fragment to map to corridor to spindle provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The Ear's demand for candor creates a threshold that narrows options, and the confession sequence ("I told the panels how I hoard...") supplies on-page escalation. However, the cost of candor is more atmospheric than tactical; no live relationship or resource is visibly forfeited, and the protagonist's confessions don't foreclose a competing path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: breath as currency, gilded leaves outlasting intent, the city trading conversations for rain. The recurring motif of words-as-physical-objects (vowels like seeds, letters snipped from vines) accumulates pressure and reweights at closure when voices are revealed as "deferred" rather than lost. The final image—words waiting for an honest listener—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Candor-as-payment integrates organically with the protagonist's physical sensitivity, avoiding thematic echo or sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "the gilding on my cuffs knows how to listen if my heart stays steadier than my breath," "floorboards curled like tongues bitten too long." Psychic distance remains stable, and the narrator's way of noticing is consistently filtered through the calligrapher's craft. Some figurative language approaches density limits in high-pressure beats—"a slow ribbon of mist unspooled, beaded with words"—but stays legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; focalization is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, and most lines advance atmosphere or action. However, several beats show paraphrase loops: "The routes converged...I went alone...At the Ear, I slid..." mechanically sequences actions without layering pressure, and "I found the evidence everyone insists does not exist, a puzzle that promised direction" restates the map discovery without added detail. Figurative language clusters in the Ear sequence—panels "trembling," "hush lifted like dust," ribbon "coiling"—approach overwriting but remain coherent. Template cadence appears in the confession list: "I told...how I hoard / I confessed I reread / I admitted I once gilded." Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs per the penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gilded-leaf calligraphy, postal infrastructure, and candor-as-currency feels specific and non-obvious. The greenhouse city setting transforms the familiar post-apocalyptic frame through the detail of living leaves and breath rationing. The map-piecing method and the Ear's acoustic architecture provide fresh inflections on the "lost messages" premise. However, the core emotional arc—protagonist seeks truth, confesses, retrieves voices—follows a predictable contour that could map onto other settings with minimal alteration, limiting the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The calligrapher's choices drive the plot: taking the fragment to the sorting shed, piecing the map, traveling to the Ear, confessing to open the panels. Present across setup (gilding work establishes character), development (map assembly and journey), and payoff (confession enables closure). The character's decisions narrow options and enable the final discovery, meeting causal pressure and closure linkage tests.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears early, is handled in multiple beats (found in leaf press, fitted to map margin, inserted into Ear's slot, threaded through spindle), and its specific properties—code of routes, ability to align with the map, function as key—matter causally. It shapes the journey and participates directly in the closure mechanism. High irreplaceability; the exact object enables the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is dramatized as the Ear's payment and shapes the protagonist's confession sequence, which unlocks the final discovery. The concept constrains the protagonist's choices (must confess truthfully to proceed) and alters tactics (the list of admissions is specific and costly). Present in setup (physical sensitivity to dishonesty), development (implicit throughout the search), and payoff (confession opens the vent). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The trait—wilts near dishonesty—is established early and recalled twice: once when clients edit silence, once when the protagonist gilded a disbelieved promise. The final beat provides visible cost ("my wrists went weak because I had paid with a lie"). However, the trait doesn't constrain a key choice in the present action; it functions more as backstory color than as a live pressure point during the Ear sequence. Mid-range for setup and closure linkage but weak on development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rereading is mentioned once in the confession list ("I confessed I reread every letter I write after dark...") but doesn't shape a major turn or define the protagonist's method. It's a character detail rather than a plot-driving action. No setup, minimal development, ornamental presence in the payoff. Swappable with another reflective habit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded map is signaled early, occupies a full beat (spreading shreds, aligning the plate fragment, tracing routes), and its mechanics matter—the map leads to the Ear and converges routes. The method shapes the protagonist's path and enables the closure by providing direction. Present in setup (fragment found), development (map assembly), and payoff (routes lead to the spindle). Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city pressures every choice: toxic sky closes vents, glass architecture supplies routes and barriers, the Ear's panels serve as a narrative hinge. The setting provides resources (leaf-pressing, the sorting shed, cisterns of breath) and constraints (rationed air, the need for candor) that alter tactics. Environment participates directly in the closure mechanism (the Ear's spindle and vents). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the oasis dries—establishes the world's scarcity economy and motivates the search for lost conversations (breath as currency). It frames the stakes but doesn't create a live clock or tighten decisions within the single-scene window. The oasis's failure is backstory rather than present pressure. Setup strong, development and payoff implicit but not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to find lost conversations drives every beat: the fragment discovery, map assembly, journey to the Ear, confession, and release of voices. The motivation is dramatized through choices and sustained across the arc. Friction arises from the cost of candor required to retrieve the words. Present in setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>
