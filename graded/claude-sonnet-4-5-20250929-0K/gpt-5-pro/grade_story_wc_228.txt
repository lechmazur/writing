<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The painter's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—packing the shell, entering the cave, placing it on the pool—and the internal contradiction of "intimately aloof" shapes perception throughout. The final recognition of the stranger beneath his face and the decision to leave the canvas for the tide demonstrate earned endurance with visible cost. Interiority remains specific ("recognition finally exceeding patience") and avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction: the promise itself is somewhat abstract until dramatized through cave action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through mirror-crack → cave descent → painting act → shell-floating → stranger-reflection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the painter gains "another surface that could briefly hold me and let me go." Cost is legible: he leaves the canvas to the tide, unmooring but anchoring elsewhere. Orientation anchors (painter, quay, rented room) land by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pool "decided to reveal a stranger," reweighting his relationship to surfaces and time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains the journey (flooded split, wrong turn, rising floor) and the slit of daylight charges the painting act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "brine and sleeping fire," "olive" light, mineral breath. The shell and pool function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice to set the canvas and shell afloat. Spatial choreography (descent, cavity opening, ledge, pool) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keeping the hidden promise to find a place where paint can hold time. The mirror crack signals deadline, cave entry raises physical risk, and the painting act tests the promise against tide and erasure. One meaningful tightening: the stranger's appearance and nod force the painter to sign with salt water and accept tidal reclamation. Cost is visible—he leaves the work to be destroyed, trading permanence for "temporary eternity." No coincidence resolves; the protagonist's choices drive all turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—temporary eternity as refuge—emerges through the shell painted long ago, the cave painting, and the tide's future claim, never stated as thesis until the painter writes it on canvas back. The final image (shell pulsing, harbor light climbing like tide) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: he has unmoored to anchor elsewhere. "Intimately aloof" and "held and released" accumulate to reweight the premise without moralizing. The stranger reflection introduces ambiguity (self without harbor) that enriches rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and specific: "fading glints," "surfaces, water, and paint," "duration between ripples and drip." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during painting, pulled back during stranger encounter). Diction remains within the painter's idiom—lyric but grounded—and compression ("Rain kept to the offshore line, as if the horizon were a leash") is taught early and legible. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Internal voice ("I preferred intimately aloof, close in texture, far in claim") is distinct and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across fragments, clauses, and full declaratives. Information density is high: most lines advance character, image, and thematic charge. Minor template cadence in the cave sequence ("I took," "I walked," "I set," "I rinsed," "I balanced," "I painted") pulls momentum slightly (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors; figurative language ("salt," "fishscale," "blade of day") remains coherent and voice-motivated. Closure lines ("Light from the harbor climbed the wall like a tide seeking my canvas") are propulsive and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of nostalgic painter, painted shell as teacher, wrong turn to oasis, and temporary eternity offers a non-obvious synthesis. The emotional calculus—choosing erasure as fulfillment—feels earned rather than contrived. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation without antagonist) and the stranger-reflection beat elevate without gimmickry. Minor deduction: "intimately aloof" as descriptor borders on overly articulated paradox, though the story earns it through action. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would not survive name-swaps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (painter above quay), middle (descent and wrong turn), and payoff (painting, shell-floating, signing with salt water). Drives at least three beats: mirror interpretation, cave entry choice, and canvas abandonment. Causal pressure is strong—his artistic mission shapes every tactic. Cost is tied to his identity: he unmoored but "would keep painting water into breathable walls."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Seashell appears in four beats: drawer glitter post-crack, packed for cave, rinsed and balanced during painting, set afloat on pool, and carried in pocket on return. Reweighted at closure: "pulse, not magic, just memory aligning." Its painted quay connects past (mother's admiration) to present promise, and floating it enacts release. Removing it would break the inheritance and fulfillment arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is not merely thematic echo—it structures the painter's goal from the start ("a kind of temporary eternity I could bear"), dictates his material choice (salt water signature), and governs the closure decision to leave the canvas to tide. The concept changes options: permanence is rejected, erasure embraced. Cost is conceptual and visible: the work will vanish, which is "the point."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is labeled early and enacted through his relationship to surfaces rather than people. It constrains his mode of loving ("through surfaces, water, and paint") and the stranger encounter dramatizes it (nodding without speech). The shell-floating and canvas-abandonment reflect closeness-with-distance. One clear tradeoff: he remains alone but anchored elsewhere. Mid-range because the trait is more consistently embodied than causally decisive at a single pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reveal" occurs late (pool reveals stranger beneath his face) and reweights identity, but does not create new options—it confirms what he already knew (he is "without the harbor, without paint"). The nod and ripple-crossing charge the moment, yet the major turn is his prior decision to paint and release. The reveal enriches but does not redefine the arc, fitting lyric reprise more than causal hinge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wrong turn is signaled early ("a wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis, I had once heard"), attempted mid-story ("So I took the wrongness by the sleeve and went left"), and delivers the chamber that enables painting. Mechanics matter: flooded split forces choice, rising floor confirms rightness. Removing this method would eliminate access to the oasis and collapse the fulfillment beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coastal cave network pressures every choice: fishermen avoid at high tide, descent path has changed, flooded split forces wrong turn, chamber's slit of light enables painting, tide will reclaim canvas. Setting supplies both obstacle (navigation, darkness) and resource (pool, ledge, mineral breath). Micro-setting (pool, stone ledge, ceiling slit) alters tactics and charges the final image. Essential across setup, middle navigation, and closure threat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the mirror cracks" frames the story's opening and deadline pressure ("I took it as a sign, not of bad luck, but deadline"), but exact elapsed time is not tracked on the page. The slit thinning to "silver hair" signals dusk and exit urgency, yet no live clock tightens micro-decisions during painting. Present and functional but lacks the iterative pressure of a tracked countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hidden promise ("to find a place where paint could hold time") is seeded early, dramatized through cave descent and painting act, and resolved when he whispers "I had kept my promise." Friction arises between the desire for holding and the cost of release ("The tide would decide if it stayed, which felt fair"). The promise drives goal-pursuit across all three acts and the closure image makes fulfillment legible with visible cost.</comment>
