<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The donor heart functions as an embodied internal contradiction throughout, twitching and changing stride in response to pressure. The protagonist's motivation to understand story magnetism generates consistent micro-choices (holding the wing, asking questions, adjusting perception). The dye master's decisions are filtered through observation rather than high-stakes agency, which limits his arc. Minor deduction for the ease with which the protagonist accepts the mystical framework without sustained internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (steam, mist, light) and deepens through recurring images that shift meaning. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I felt less like a patient and more like a harbor" crystallizes the protagonist's stance with conceptual cost (accepting borrowed identity). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wing demonstration reframes the central question. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of echo over drum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house constrains movement and charges atmosphere throughout. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, pressuring perception at three distinct beats and charging the final image when carried down the path. Sun trails supply a recurring motif that guides both method and closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's post-transplant hyperawareness (pulse, rhythm, breath). The valley-mist anchors tone and spatial logic consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why some magnetize stories—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the dye master reframes it as structural rather than mystical. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the donor heart's nature ("tuned to echo, not drum") forces a tactical shift from seeking answers to accepting lens-work. The cost is visible: protagonist must relinquish the desire for fewer moving parts. Agency is present in the final acceptance and the decision to follow sun trails home.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the blue morpho wing's iridescence-as-structure metaphor, which is earned through repeated demonstration rather than statement. "Carry iridescent caution" and "let yourself be a lens rather than a lantern" arise from concrete experience with the wing. The final image—"the heart answered"—offers a non-literal resolution that reweights the borrowed-heart premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the dye master's silences and the protagonist's bodily responses. One minor slip: "Some hearts are tuned to echo" borders on thematic statement but is anchored by prior wing work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: post-transplant hyperawareness of pulse, rhythm, borrowed grief. Diction stays within the protagonist's contemplative register; the dye master's speech carries a different cadence ("Work ends where a listener might begin"). One brief filter-verb cluster in the middle third ("I could feel," "I thought of") but voice remains coherent under pressure. The final paragraph's compression ("the heart answered") is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer sentences for contemplation and shorter for realization. Minor deductions for three instances of paraphrase loops: "Color lives in structure" / "stories live in the angles between breaths" restates the same concept; "the way light dragged across my pulse" / "tracking sun trails" recurs without added pressure in two adjacent beats. No template cadence or register drift. Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing as structural metaphor for story magnetism is specific and non-obvious. The donor heart as tuning mechanism rather than emotional transplant freshens a familiar premise. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and oblique closure pays off. Minor deduction for the tea-house-as-wisdom-site frame, which is a recognizable template, though the iridescence angle and sun-trail method transform it sufficiently. The synthesis of borrowed identity, light physics, and narrative theory feels earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watchful dye master appears early, drives two key beats (wing demonstration, cloth-drawing), and shapes the protagonist's final stance. His observation creates pressure but his decisions are primarily instructional rather than conflicted. Present in closure via the farewell instruction. Strong causal role but limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing appears early (paragraph ten), is handled in three distinct beats (demonstration, trembling edge, gifted at closure), and its structural iridescence drives the core realization. The wing's meaning shifts from trophy to lens to permission across the arc. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and thematic closure. High irreplaceability and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Iridescent caution is introduced midpoint, demonstrated through the wing's angle-dependent shimmer, and applied as tactical guidance ("carry iridescent caution"). It shapes the protagonist's final choice to be a lens rather than lantern and constrains the departure. Present in closure image. Strong thematic integration but arrives slightly late for maximal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quietly explosive appears once in description of the wing's shift ("a quietly explosive shift that made the slate blush with sky") and shapes the dye master's teaching method ("This place moves with iridescent caution, so our answers do not shatter"). The trait informs tone but does not constrain a major on-page choice with visible tradeoff. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Illuminate appears early in the mirror/wing demonstration, drives the cloth-drawing beat ("words appeared like fish"), and recurs in the final descent ("slung light along the ridges"). It enables the protagonist's insight and shapes the lens-versus-lantern climax. Removing it would require significant rewrite. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though the action itself is shared with the dye master.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is introduced in paragraph seventeen, demonstrated on cloth, and provides the method for the protagonist's descent home in the final line. It shapes the dye master's craft and the protagonist's closure action. Present in setup, middle, and payoff. Specific enough to matter but arrives slightly late for maximal pressure across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house frames the entire encounter, provides the tether and anchor lines that create atmospheric pressure, and constrains movement throughout. The island's approval of the wing loan and the clouds tugging the anchor in the penultimate paragraph charge the departure. The setting's verticality (path down, valley) shapes the closure action. Strong spatial integration and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>After receiving the donor heart anchors the protagonist's hyperawareness, motivates the central question, and provides the "borrowed thunder" and "echo" metaphors that drive resolution. The heart's rhythm changes at noon and answers at closure. Timeframe shapes stakes and interiority throughout. Present in setup and payoff; the transplant premise is indispensable to the protagonist's perceptual signature and thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To learn why some people magnetize stories is voiced explicitly in paragraph four, drives every interaction with the dye master, and generates the wing demonstration and cloth-drawing beats. The desire faces friction when the answer requires becoming a lens rather than receiving an explanation. Resolution costs the protagonist agency. Strong setup, middle development, and payoff with visible conceptual price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is established in the opening lines, sustained through "steam curled," "shimmer," "quietly explosive," and modulates at closure when the valley lifts "its cool breath." Tone coherence is high; contemplative wonder deepens without breaking under the dye master's instruction. The mist and light vocabulary charges the final image. Strong integration across all three gates and consistent pressure modulation.</comment>
