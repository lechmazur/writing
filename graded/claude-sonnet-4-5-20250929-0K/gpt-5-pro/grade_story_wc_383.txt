<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is densely layered—"charmed skeptic," keeper of "quarantined memory"—with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) that drive the final choice. Embodied emotion appears in "bones ring," "fear once nested," and the physical act of becoming a door. The climactic decision to open "not outward, but along" earns Reina's passage through sustained interior pressure. Minor deduction: some introspective phrasing leans abstract ("translate isolation into independence") where a concrete micro-choice would sharpen agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the narrator becomes a threshold, allowing Reina's laugh to pass through with visible cost ("my fear once nested" replaced by "a small bravery humming"). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (velvet garden, twilight, archive keeper). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through resonance structures, culminating in the shell's harmonization and the protagonist's transformation. One meaningful deepening (the question "Must I let you loose, or must I become the door?") narrows options and the final image reweights the quarantine premise. Cost is legible: the narrator shifts from keeper to passage, altering their role permanently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The velvet garden, archive aisles, glass bell, and whispering seashell constrain choices throughout: the narrator walks paths "read like braille," touches jars in sequence, and places the shell in the oldest arch niche—each spatial beat advances the ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful ("silvered air," "hedges breathe," "dew numbers each grief") and filtered through the keeper's professional attention. The shell as micro-setting charges the final image when left "on a nail, an ear for travelers." Minor gap: the oldest arch's physical properties could be more concretely rendered to ground the climactic placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive question: "Must I let you loose, or must I become the door?" The narrator's agency (carrying the shell through the archive, asking the avoided question, standing until bones ring) drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. The cost is visible: the narrator transforms from clasp to passage, losing the role of keeper but gaining fluency. The shell's harmonization with closed doors escalates pressure, and Reina's departure forecloses the prior containment with undeniable consequence ("quarantine sign dissolves").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—independence as learned passage, not absence—emerges from the garden's resonance structures, the archive work, and the final transformation without didactic statement. The whispering shell and the door motif recur with shifting meaning: from containment tool to threshold, from quarantine to protocol for crossing. The ending image ("practice kindness" revealed beneath the sign, shell left as "an ear for travelers") answers the central question obliquely, reweighting the keeper's solitude. Subtext operates in "becoming a door means opening" and "loss listens, without ownership, exactly." No moralizing in the final paragraph; the garden "builds morning from memory without locking anyone inside" serves as resonant closure without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is職業-specific ("archive those vibrations," "resonance structures") and poetic ("paper gull," "each leaf a tongue"). Diction sustains a heightened, incantatory register ("soundless words that shiver the marrows of flowers") that fits the narrator's archival role and the garden's enchantment. Minor slips: some metaphoric density approaches self-consciousness ("fanged around tenderness withheld") and a few filter verbs ("I tell her") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; the laugh's "answer" reads as perceived resonance, not true access to Reina's interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structures shift from short declarations ("She believed sound could open doors") to long, layered images ("Jars hold lullabies that burned, portraits with erased eyes, promises that exploded into fragrant shrapnel"). Information density is high—most lines advance metaphor, action, or atmosphere. Minor artifact: mild paraphrase in the archive-aisles passage where "dew numbers each grief" and the jar descriptions restate containment without new pressure. A few elevated phrases ("tragically radiant," "quarantined memory") trend toward stock lyricism. No loops touch the closure beat; the final paragraph's propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-keeper, quarantine-as-kindness, and sound-as-threshold offers a fresh angle on memory and release; the protagonist's transformation into a door rather than simply opening one is non-obvious. The velvet garden and resonance structures feel specific to this voice. Risk is present in the sustained metaphoric density and the refusal of straightforward plot turns. Minor limitation: the core setup (keeper of sealed voices, must decide to release) leans on familiar curator/archivist templates; the execution personalizes it through sensory layering and the door conceit, but the premise itself is not fully transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "charmed skeptic" trait appears early and frames the narrator's stance ("skeptical of every promise"), shapes the middle choice (testing Reina's belief by archiving sound), and informs the final question ("Must I let you loose, or must I become the door?"). The skepticism-to-acceptance arc drives the transformation. However, the trait is more descriptive than causally decisive; the turn pivots on the resonance structures and the narrator's endurance rather than a skeptical test that fails or succeeds. Present in all three gates but functions more as character flavor than irreplaceable engine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is handled in multiple beats: held to the ear, carried along archive aisles, placed in the oldest arch niche, and left on a nail at the gate. It enables the middle turn (harmonizes with closed doors, speaks Reina's voice) and charges the final image (becomes "an ear for travelers"). Its split nature (tide vs. grief) and the sealed laugh drive the stakes. Removing it would collapse the plot; no generic container could replace its acoustic and symbolic function. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Quarantined memory" shapes stakes from the start ("quarantine holds what would infect the living with yesterday") and alters tactics (the narrator must learn resonance structures to release safely). The middle conflict hinges on the quarantine's persistence ("cities hoard fear, and bells forget") and the climax dissolves the quarantine sign into "practice kindness." The concept is irreplaceable: it defines the keeper's work, the garden's function, and the moral calculus. All three gates met; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears twice as a descriptor for Reina's face ("tragically radiant, unable to look away from me" and "her tragically radiant smile softens"). It colors the emotional stakes but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait is told rather than shown through a choice; it functions as atmospheric intensifier rather than causal lever. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle development; no visible tradeoff tied to the radiance itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archiving drives the setup (the narrator's role), the middle (touching jars in sequence through resonance structures), and the payoff ("I archive the echo not as an artifact, but as a protocol for crossing"). The action defines the protagonist's method and the garden's logic. The climactic turn depends on archival knowledge applied to the shell and doors. Swapping "archive" for "catalog" or "preserve" would lose the specific connotation of ordered, purposeful storage that enables the resonance structures. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through resonance structures" is signaled early ("The garden taught me to listen through resonance structures, the way lattices carry meaning") and shapes middle tactics ("I touch them in sequence, through resonance structures learned from Reina's patient chalkboards"). It enables the shell's harmonization with doors and the narrator's transformation ("my bones ring, and the hinges in me answer perfectly"). The mechanics matter: resonance allows passage without forcing. Present in all three gates and drives the climax, though the exact mechanics remain poetic rather than concretely rule-bound.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet garden at twilight anchors orientation, supplies resources (hedges, fountains, archive aisles, the oldest arch), and pressures choices (the paths "invite a careful pilgrimage," the night "thins" at the arch). The garden's consent is required for the final opening. Time of day (twilight into dawn) tightens the window. Removing the garden would collapse spatial logic and thematic coherence. Strong setup and payoff; middle development is implicit in the archive walk.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When the last star fades into morning light" appears at the climactic threshold ("There, the night thins, a curtain pulled by morning, and the last star hesitates" and "This is the moment when the last star fades into morning light, and the garden consents"). It signals the time limit and charges the ending with transition from night to dawn. However, the timeframe is more symbolic than tactical; no earlier beat shows the clock tightening decisions. Present in setup (twilight) and payoff (dawn) but weak in middle pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is stated early and shapes every beat: the keeper's work, the question avoided, the final transformation. It is dramatized in the choice between keeping Reina locked or becoming a door. The friction between isolation (safety, control) and independence (passage, risk) creates visible cost: the narrator loses the keeper role and gains vulnerability ("I remain, less charmed, less skeptic, more door"). All three gates met; strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is coherent throughout: the narrator tends with "steady, ghostly resolve," navigates the archive with spectral patience, and transforms into a permeable threshold. Tone modulates under pressure—intensifies at the climactic question, softens when Reina passes through—without breaking the spectral register. The final image ("I remain, less charmed, less skeptic, more door") sustains the ghostly quality while shifting from haunted keeper to open passage. Tone charges the closure; removing it would flatten the voice.</comment>
