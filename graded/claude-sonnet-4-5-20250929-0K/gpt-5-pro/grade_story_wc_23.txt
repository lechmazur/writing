<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The navigator's interiority is vivid and particular—embodied detail (pressing the censer foot into palm) reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator polishes the relic "not to shine, but to persuade the past that it still has muscle," showing layered motivation. The relationship with Rowan creates genuine crucible pressure: "we measure the distance between us by the time delay, and by the number of names she can say before crying." Rowan remains largely off-page as voice only, limiting direct interplay, but the final renunciation ("I do not ask if the house still stands; I ask if their grief can breathe") forecloses reunion curiosity with visible cost and character-specific deflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who (patchwork navigator), where (signal station), and stakes (guide convoy home) by line 6. The piece teaches its lyric, mosaic pattern early through recurring image clusters (dish, censer foot, moon phases, Rowan's voice) and sustains coherent pressure as the narrator rigs the broken hydraulics and sends directional pulses. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "I do not ask if the house still stands; I ask if their grief can breathe, and I send one last bearing home"—the final lines reweight all prior labour from reunion quest to grief navigation with palpable cost (deflection of homecoming hope). One meaningful deepening occurs when the convoy reaches the harbor and the narrator shifts from map-giver to solace-giver, narrowing his role with conceptual price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its weight stabilizes the dish ("Its weight remembers smoke, and its curve cups a thread of wire"), and the narrator threads, lashes, and leans into the arc to manually aim the broken hydraulics. The station's spatial details (dish, cradle, counterweight rig, signal horn) are interleaved with action and pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: "The air tastes of ozone and rust, a recipe for remembering." The final image—"I rest my head against the censer foot"—charges closure by making the relic both tool and pillow, physical anchor for exhaustion and solace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: guide Rowan's convoy home through cryptic coordination. The hydraulic failure forces a meaningful tightening when the narrator must become "the missing motor with my body," improvising a manual rig with the censer foot. Agency is visible: stripping the cradle, threading rope, leaning weight into the arc to aim the dish, then sending timed signal bursts. Escalation operates under the accumulative lens via density increase—each transmitted star-name and silo-pulse tightens the path, and Rowan's shift from asking about maps to asking about the house smell signals proximity and reweights emotional cost. The final choice to ask "if their grief can breathe" rather than "if the house still stands" forecloses sentimental reunion with legible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of navigating loss emerges through concrete action: "My work is to navigate the geography of loss, and to teach others how to bear its coordinates without drowning." The censer foot accrues meaning across the story—altar relic to counterweight to headrest—each use reweighting past/present muscle. Reverse migration becomes literal wayfinding with palpable friction: "We break the route into night-sips, skirting sinkholes and fences, letting the mud cool around their ankles until it grips." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: raw solace is not homecoming but breath-space for grief, and the navigator's final rest against the relic ties personal and collective mourning without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices via professional bias (signal strength, moon phases, static texture) and personal metaphor ("the night becomes a tuned glass"). Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure—lyric compression ("a scab of stars," "night-sips") without register drift. One brief elision (the house and cloves) is anchored in present stimulus (Rowan's question) and paid off in the ending's deflection. Rowan's voice is filtered through the narrator's focalization; no head-hopping. Minor density at peaks (stacked modifiers in "Dawn gnaws the horizon when they reach the harbor, a rib cage of pilings") slightly dulls immediacy but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density and purposeful rhythm: "After the hydraulics fail, I learn the math of cranks and patience, and I become the missing motor with my body." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and rooted in the narrator's technical-mystical idiom. Minor overwriting in adjacent beats: "The dish will not swivel, so I strip the cradle and rig a counterweight" followed immediately by "My relic is a patina bronze censer foot…Its weight remembers smoke" recycles the counterweight concept without new pressure (paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2). One mixed vehicle: "raw solace that tastes like salt" after "whispering backward" water—sensory blend unclear. No scaffold or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary and propulsion holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-disaster wayfinding, reverse migration as literal navigation, and the navigator's embodied labour with an altar relic feels specific and non-obvious. "Patchwork navigator" and "geography of loss" risk abstraction but are grounded through concrete acts (manual hydraulics, star-naming as bread, pebble-marking). The moon-phase signal modulation and censer-foot counterweight rig are fresh details that grow organically from premise. The final deflection ("I do not ask if the house still stands; I ask if their grief can breathe") transforms the homecoming arc into a grief-craft moment with earned surprise. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation and elided causality heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator drives at least three distinct beats: diagnosing the hydraulic failure and deciding to rig a manual counterweight (early choice), threading the censer foot and leaning into the arc to aim the dish (middle causal action), and choosing to ask about breath rather than the house at closure (final reweighting). Each choice narrows options and alters tactics. Early signal by line 3. Closure participation is strong: the final question forecloses sentimental reunion with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in setup ("My relic is a patina bronze censer foot"), middle development (threaded on rod, lashed to tide wheel, used as counterweight to stabilize dish), and closure (narrator rests head against it). Three functionally distinct beats. Causal pressure is high: its weight enables the manual aiming that guides the convoy. The final image reweights it from tool to pillow, charging the ending with embodied exhaustion and solace. Specificity is irreplaceable: patina, altar origin, and curve that "cups a thread of wire" all matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reverse migration shapes stakes from the opening: "They are not migrating away but home, practicing reverse migration along memory channels cut raw through the land." It constrains the navigator's task (guiding people back rather than out) and the convoy's path (toward drowned orchard, old harbor). Middle development: "Reverse migration completes itself like a breath let out, and the sea gives up a road shaped exactly by their hunger." Closure linkage is present but conceptual—the migration completes when they reach the harbor, reweighting the journey as grief-breathing rather than home-finding. One visible cost: the narrator deflects reunion hope.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Moon phases constrain on-page action across at least two beats: "When the moon fattens, the static fattens too…When it thins, the night becomes a tuned glass." The narrator times his work to the moon's thinness ("Tonight the moon is a careful bone, and I am ready to build"). Causal pressure: the signal's clarity depends on lunar phase, forcing tactical patience. Closure participation is indirect—the convoy arrives at dawn, implying the night's thin-moon window succeeded—but the phase itself does not reappear in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Build" drives the central turn: after the hydraulics fail, the narrator strips the cradle, rigs the censer foot counterweight, threads rope, and manually aims the dish. This act enables all subsequent guiding. Early signal (line 12: "I am ready to build what the broken hydraulics denied me"). Middle causal beats detail the physical construction. Closure participation: the successful build allows the convoy to reach the harbor and the narrator to rest against the censer foot. Swapping "build" for "repair" would require different mechanics; the improvisational construction is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight are signaled early: "It begins, always, through cryptic phone calls at midnight, when the towers sigh and the ghosts of circuits wake." Middle development: Rowan calls at midnight from the convoy, and the narrator translates her star-descriptions into bearings. The method shapes attempts—delay measured by time lag, names spoken before crying, static clarity tied to moon phase. Closure participation: the final bearing is sent via this channel. The mechanics (phone, signal horn, time delay) matter and constrain the navigator's tools.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The starlit signal station pressures choices across the story: the broken dish forces improvisation, the signal horn sends directional pulses, and the station's isolation frames the navigator's embodied labour. Setup by line 2. Middle beats: the station supplies the dish, cradle, and counterweight rod that the navigator rigs. Closure: "I rest my head against the censer foot and sleep in the starlit signal station, the navigator patched by dawn"—the setting charges the final image with exhaustion and solace. Micro-setting (censer foot, dish, horn) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the hydraulics fail" is signaled in the opening line and sets up the entire problem. Middle development: the failure forces the manual build, and the navigator times work to the thin moon. The convoy's overnight journey tightens decisions—dawn arrival signals success. Closure linkage: "patched by dawn" marks temporal completion. One cost: the all-night labour exhausts the navigator. The time constraint shapes tactics (waiting for moon phase, sending bursts, measuring delay) but does not create a ticking-clock crisis that escalates pressure beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to navigate the geography of loss" is stated early (line 5) and dramatized through physical and emotional acts: rigging the counterweight, naming stars as bread, translating sky into bearings. Friction between want (guide Rowan home) and cost (deflecting reunion hope) appears at closure: "I do not ask if the house still stands; I ask if their grief can breathe." The desire is tested across multiple beats (each transmission, each name Rowan speaks before crying). Closure reweights the goal from homecoming to solace with palpable renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone of raw solace is coherent throughout: diction like "metal throat that swallowed its own echo," "salt-burned voice," "dust and other people's photographs" establishes elegiac, tactile mourning. The tone modulates under pressure—tenderness in star-naming, exhaustion in leaning weight into the arc, grief in Rowan's crying—without flattening. Closure charges the tone: "raw solace that tastes like salt" and "I rest my head against the censer foot" fuse physical labour and emotional reprieve. The tone shapes the final image's resonance, making solace feel earned and embodied rather than sentimental.</comment>
