<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cargo broker POV demonstrates clear occupational filter ("instincts as a broker twitched") and sustained motivation to honor silent contributors. Interiority remains concrete through most beats ("I counted cranes like stars"). However, the narrator's voice occasionally lifts into generic uplift ("our continuous return") and the final third relies on summary rather than embodied choice under pressure, weakening the sense of immediate stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (docks → library → tuner backstory → group assembly) with legible transitions. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ledger becomes a living archive, "each thank you encouraging another like tide and moon"), but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. The final image reweights prior material yet the felt price stays implied rather than dramatized, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting details are purposeful and voice-filtered: "library windows open like sails," "tables smell faintly of lemon and salt," the wharf cranes mirroring stars. The breezy library under stars constrains the choice to house the ledger and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across pier, library, and wharf. Minor deduction: some environmental details (gulls, neon tourists) appear ornamentally without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained. The sequence from envelope discovery to ledger initiation provides one meaningful tightening (the tuner's arrival with the locket, dockhands and stagehands gathering). However, escalation remains gentle and choices never face a live trade-off or cost that narrows options on the page. The resolution (ledger begun, names delivered) feels declarative rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: cocoa, the locket photo, the tuner's gratitude "landing like feathers on water." The cycles-of-compassion concept avoids thesis statements and is embodied through the uncle-tuner connection and the ledger. The final image ("cargo and music share one truth, their weight becomes grace when lifted by many ungloved hands") offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "our continuous return" edges toward abstraction in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV first person maintains consistent perceptual signature: nautical idiom ("making parentheses," "tide and moon"), occupational lens ("my ledger closed but my senses open"), distinct rhythm. Lena's indirect characterization through action and the broker's filtering keep distance stable. Late-paragraph reflection ("I thought of my uncle, the tuner, Lena...") compresses multiple beats without micro-choices, mildly diluting momentum. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the envelope-discovery and tuner-recognition beats. However, the final third features paraphrase loops ("We had begun something gentle yet sturdy, a chorus sung in whispers..."; "Each card would remind the next card...") and elevated diction that drifts from the broker's earlier concrete voice ("cautious exuberance," "continuous return"). Filter-verb use is restrained. Proofreading clean; no grammar breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The envelope-as-bridge device and the ledger-of-acknowledgments concept offer a fresh synthesis; the uncle-tuner connection provides earned coincidence rooted in maritime community. Specific occupational detail (cargo manifests, winch operator, stevedores) grounds the premise. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure supports stakes without gimmickry. Minor deduction: the cycles-of-compassion frame echoes workshop templates for community-repair narratives, though the maritime setting and ledger mechanism provide sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cargo broker is present by the opening line, makes the choice to carry the envelope to the library (middle beat), and pledges logistics at the initiation moment. The occupational lens filters observation throughout. However, key turns (tuner's arrival, ledger agreement) are collaborative rather than broker-driven; the character enables rather than decides at closure. Swappable with "seasoned postal clerk" or similar facilitator role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in the mistaken-envelope discovery, is examined by the tuner who recognizes his mother, and is placed on the ledger "like a lighthouse" at closure. Three distinct beats; the final reprise charges the ledger's symbolic weight. However, the object does not constrain a choice—it serves as token and reminder rather than tactical necessity. Removing it would shift emotional texture but not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cycles of compassion shape the thematic question and the ledger's purpose ("each thank you encouraging another like tide and moon"). The uncle-tuner cocoa connection demonstrates one cycle. However, the concept remains thematic rather than altering on-page tactics or narrowing options. It frames reflection more than it pressures choice. Present in closure image but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Whimsically attentive is applied twice to Lena: "straightening bookmarks into constellations" and "she wore the compliment lightly." The trait informs characterization but does not constrain a choice or enable a turn. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this specific attribute. Largely ornamental; swappable with "thoughtfully organized" or similar descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Initiate anchors the central action: the agreement to "initiate a harbor ledger" occurs mid-story and drives the gathering of crew and stagehands, the reading of cards, and the ledger's placement in the library. Two beats (pledge, first reading) and closure participation (ledger as breathing archive). However, the initiation is collaborative and declarative; it does not impose a cost or force a trade-off on the page. Replacing "initiate" with "establish" or "begin" would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The friendship kindled by mistaken-envelope delivery is signaled early (envelope arrives, narrator carries it to Lena), shapes the middle investigation (tracing the tuner), and provides the relational foundation for the ledger partnership. The mechanics matter: the mistaken address is the catalyst. Three beats; causal pressure across the arc. Removing this origin would require a new inciting incident, though the exact friendship-formation method could vary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The breezy library under stars is established by the second paragraph, hosts the envelope examination and ledger agreement, and is chosen as the archive's home at closure ("by night it would rest here, breathing"). The setting provides symbolic resonance (windows open like sails) and a spatial anchor. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice—meetings could occur elsewhere with minor atmospheric loss. Closure image gains charge from the setting but does not depend on its unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>After the symphony ends is mentioned in the opening and closing lines, framing the recurring meeting pattern. The timeframe establishes a quiet window and ritual cadence. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; it functions as atmospheric anchor rather than pressure device. Removing the symphony reference would shift tone but not alter causality or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to uplift silent contributors is stated early ("my private mission") and dramatized through the envelope delivery, ledger proposal, and card-reading beats. It drives the protagonist's choices across the arc and is present at closure ("I keep delivering names"). Two beats and thematic payoff. Minor deduction: the motivation is declared more than conflicted—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is named once mid-story ("I felt cautious exuberance, the tremor of good news that knows the sea can take it back") and modulates the narrator's stance, tempering optimism with maritime realism. The tone coheres across beats and charges the final image's restraint ("we promised restraint and persistence"). However, it is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or pressure-tested choices. Present in closure's tonal register but not indispensable to the ending's logic.</comment>
