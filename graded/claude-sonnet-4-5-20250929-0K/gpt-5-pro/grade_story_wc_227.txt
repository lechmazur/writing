<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's interiority is concrete and embodied—holding breath underwater, greasing gloves with limefat, feeling for constellations in wounds—and micro-choices (dropping the charm into the crucible, whispering names to the mechanism) carry visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between doubt and the need to forge meaning, though it operates more as alternating states than simultaneous impulses in a single beat. The teacher's absent presence anchors motivation credibly, but the final choice to sacrifice the charm, while poignant, feels slightly pre-determined by thematic design rather than wrestling with a live alternative path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (workshop, acid sea, alchemist at work) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (pockmarks-to-gear ratios, kintsugi seams, the charm's warmth) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the melted charm seals the heartplate and the wheel turns—Charged Poise that crystallizes survival and earned repair. Cost is legible: the charm is destroyed, the dives exact physical toll, and the final image of pressing his forehead to the warm plate carries the weight of temporary reprieve with more work ahead. One minor clarity slip: the statue's function as lighthouse versus prow ornament blurs spatial logic briefly, but does not break causality or closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The acid sea, neutralizing vat, and the statue's pockmarked face all constrain choices—he must dive to work safely, must read craters as navigational logic, must match them to the stormwheel's teeth—fulfilling the micro-setting rule. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: limefat grease, vitriol's sting, the rasp of a mentor's laugh quilted from memory. The statue's craters charge the final image by becoming "a map not of stars but of survival," and the warm heartplate anchors the ending's embodied relief. Spatial choreography is clean; the vat, engine, and prow remain coherent anchors throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conjure meaning and restart the engine before acid destroys the workshop—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the timed dives, failed seals, and the stormwheel's refusal until names are whispered. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: he chooses to map pockmarks, to narrate aloud, and ultimately to sacrifice the irreplaceable charm, foreclosing the path of preserving the teacher's gift. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wheel refuses touch until he offers the names of ruins, and cost is visible when the charm melts and he accepts "more dives, more seconds counted like seeds" as the price of survival. The stakes remain single-threaded and coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—repair through acceptance of breakage, meaning forged rather than found—emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor realized in action (pouring the melted charm into the crack) rather than stated. The final image of the statue's pockmarks "used for mercy rather than erosion" and the alchemist exhaling "as if surfacing from an ancient depth" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the charm's warmth responding to promises and the teacher's paradox ("it unlocked him"). One small thematic echo: "he had conjured meaning from the edge of oblivion" in the final paragraph risks summarizing the premise, but it follows the dramatized act and does not replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric-philosophical voice ("everything now happened between breaths held underwater," "salt in his eyes though there was no salt in this world"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the alchemist notices mechanical constellations, measures time in breaths, and frames memory as quilt-work. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible interiority—"kintsugi intentions," "shivered purposes," "vitriol and its memories"—reading more like authorial metaphor than character thought, creating minor register drift in peak beats. No dialogue appears; internal voice remains coherent but borders on over-wrought lyricism in places where compression would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance situation or charge imagery. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries momentum through the dive-surface cycle. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym chains appear: "meaning was not found but forged" / "conjure meaning" recurs without added pressure; "the seams are where the warmth lives" / "golden seams to hold him" / "lined with brightness" cycles the same metaphor. Template cadence in the middle third ("He would dip... He would rise... He heard... He set...") flattens propulsion. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (crucible, vein, artery, constellation, quilts) approaches overwriting, though metaphors remain internally consistent. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, touching but not obscuring the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of kintsugi philosophy, steampunk alchemy, and the timed-dive constraint offers a specific angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The statue-to-gear-ratio matching is fresh procedural detail, and the choice to sacrifice the charm rather than use tin solder is emotionally and thematically earned. However, the "floating workshop on acid sea" and "uncertain alchemist" setup hews closely to familiar genre templates (isolated craftsman, magical repair quest), and the lyric voice occasionally prioritizes ornament over surprise. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending heighten stakes without gimmickry, warranting a modest positive adjustment within the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The uncertain alchemist drives all key turns: choosing to map pockmarks, narrating aloud to anchor knowledge, whispering names to the wheel, and sacrificing the charm. Present throughout, his decisions alter tactics (diving to read, surfacing to scribe) and enable the engine's restart. Cost is visible in the physical toll of dives and the irreplaceable loss of the charm. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The key ring charm appears in five beats: introduction (wrist), warming when promises are sworn, teacher's memory attached, set upon the heartplate, and sacrificed into the crucible to seal the crack. It constrains the final choice (he has no other golden alloy) and charges the closure by becoming the literal seam that restarts the engine. Early signal, irreplaceable properties, felt cost, and causal necessity all met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions shape the protagonist's understanding ("mend shivered purposes with seams of bright alloy") and motivate the decision to use gold rather than tin, but the concept functions more as thematic metaphor than on-page constraint. The act of pouring the charm along the crack enacts kintsugi, yet the concept could be replaced with "honorable repair" or "meaningful sacrifice" without structural breakage. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together" appears twice: as trait description and enacted when he recalls tinctures and the teacher's laugh to steady his hands before winding the gears. The trait enables one micro-choice (steadying to act) but does not constrain later decisions or participate in closure. Present by the first third and functional in one beat, but swappable with "draws on memories" or similar phrasing without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrate functions as both prayer and method: he surfaces to "narrate the sequence aloud, so that air could hold what water tried to dissolve," and later "said, narrate, half prayer, half inventory, binding sound to mechanism." The act of voicing the pattern is necessary to make the reading legible and operational. Early signal, two distinct beats, and direct causal linkage to solving the puzzle. Could be replaced with "record" or "speak the pattern," lowering irreplaceability slightly, but the ritual quality ties to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Matching pockmarks on the statue to the stormwheel's teeth is signaled early ("the old books hinted"), drives the middle sequence (reading craters underwater, tracing patterns on the heartplate), and enables the engine's restart. The method's mechanics matter: crescent on brow, triad below eye, pit under chin → gear ratios → memory of how engines sang. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea is established in the opening line and constrains every choice: failed seals force underwater work, acid threatens pillars, the neutralizing vat supplies safe immersion, and the stormwheel and heartplate are the puzzle's physical anchors. The setting pressures tactics (dive cycles) and charges the ending (workshop drifts into mercy's lee). Early signal, multiple-beat involvement, causal constraint, and closure presence all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "between breaths held underwater" is introduced early and shapes all middle action: he must surface to think and scribe, then dive again, creating a live clock that tightens decisions. Elapsed breath-time is implied but not precisely tracked; the urgency is felt rather than counted. Present in setup and development, drives tactical choices, and mentioned in the final reflection ("more seconds counted like seeds"), though closure does not hinge on a final breath-limit test.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated early and dramatized through the sequence of problem-solving under acid threat. Internal conflict appears in the tension between doubt (uncertain alchemist) and the need to act, and the cost of sacrificing the teacher's charm enacts the friction between preserving the past and forging survival. The desire is present across beats and closure, though the phrasing leans abstract; a more embodied want (e.g., "restart the engine before the pillars collapse") would sharpen urgency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dire enchantment is coherent throughout: "sky crackled," "storms into scrolls," "foam into whispering mouths," "acid ate the pillars," and the final "acid wind sang elsewhere." Tone modulates subtly—urgent during dives, elegiac when recalling the teacher, relieved but wary at closure ("he knew there would be more dives"). The lyric register sustains pressure without breaking into incongruous lightness, and the ending's "warm plate" and "ancient depth" exhalation charge the final image with earned calm inside ongoing threat.</comment>
