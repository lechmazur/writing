<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's stance is consistent—a meditative archivist trading personal connection for preservation duty—and the ink-silt ritual embodies his method. Interiority remains concrete through sensory anchors (tarnished ink smell, thumb tracing lime), but no dramatized contradiction surfaces; he enacts his purpose without friction or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "less man than listening notation" reads as thematic summary rather than a choice under pressure. Minor embodiment: "fingers burn pleasantly" lands, yet the piece withholds micro-decisions that test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the surveyor's ritual accumulates density through recurring images (inkwell, notes in mortar, algae as pennants) and a steady cadence that reweights preservation as both archive and self-erasure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he commits to becoming "less man than listening notation," accepting the cost of ongoing dissolution into the city's memory. Orientation anchors clearly (submerged pavilion, post-drawbridge window, surveyor role) by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers S.G.'s prior note, linking his act to a lineage and charging the final commitment with conceptual cost—yet the cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains movement (tide windows, scaffolding left by masons) and charges the closure: water as "faithful reader" that "praises and erases" recurs to frame the surveyor's acceptance of impermanence. Micro-setting elements—mortar seams, barnacle-encrusted plaque cavity, algae as "patient pennants"—anchor each beat and the inkwell becomes a tactile setting object that links past surveyor to present. Sensory hierarchy filters through the surveyor's professional lens (hairline tremors, precise joins) without tourist catalog. The final image of "coals under river glass" synthesizes prior water/light motifs to land the thematic stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and shapes each beat (note placement, inkwell filling, sealing seams). The piece tightens once when the surveyor finds S.G.'s prior work, validating his method and deepening his commitment to the lineage. No external opposition materializes; pressure accumulates through the water's patient return and the implied futility of preservation. Agency reads as endurance and ritual repetition rather than a foregrounded choice with visible trade-off; the final commitment to becoming "listening notation" reconfigures stance but the cost—what he renounces—remains atmospheric rather than concretely dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as interlaced presence/absence, preservation as self-erasure—emerges through recurring images (water as reader, notes sealed in stone, lineage of watchfulness) without overt statement. The final image reweights prior material: becoming "less man than listening notation" synthesizes the inkwell lineage, the act of sealing notes, and the water's dual role as eraser and preserver into a resonant answer about the cost of vigilance. The piece avoids moralizing yet lands a non-literal closure that honors complexity—though the "interlaced absence" refrain borders on thematic echo in mid-passage ("Absence interlaces with presence like rivers with banks") before the ending redeems it through embodied image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single first-person POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the surveyor notices through a professional-archival lens (hairline tremors, seams, joins), filtering sensory detail through preservation priorities. Diction remains elevated yet character-consistent ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence," "drowned rehearsals") without register drift. Two brief reflection blocks (the woman with oranges, the trumpeter at dawn) anchor in present stimuli (opening a seam, moving to another wound) and tilt present stance by validating the method. Lyric compression ("breath and applause, both already half departed") and patterned syntax ("After the drawbridge rises") teach a cadence that the piece sustains. No head-hopping; purposeful elision (S.G.'s identity) pays off when the initials "glow like a signal."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance setting, interiority, or thematic image without slack. Figurative language threads consistently (water as reader, algae as pennants, notes as heartbeat) with coherent vehicles that land the pavilion's dual presence/absence. Paraphrase loops appear: "I come not only to measure but to become the archeologist" then "measure is a kind of praise" recycles the claim; "interlaced absence" repeats across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in parallel "I + verb" openings and "After the drawbridge rises" bookends, yet the pattern reads voice-motivated rather than artifactual. Minor filter-verb stack ("seemed to float," "thought," "try to guide") in mid-passage slightly dulls immediacy. No syntax monotony; rhythm modulates appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor as memory-archivist sealing notes into a drowning structure—offers a fresh angle on preservation/erasure themes through specific professional detail (foundation repairs, mortar beds, tide windows). The inkwell lineage (S.G. initials) and the water-as-reader metaphor feel earned rather than imposed. Emotional specificity (the woman with oranges, the trumpeter) grounds abstract stakes in particular images. Risk: the lyric-heavy register and accumulative structure could obscure causality, yet the piece commits fully and teaches its pattern early. The transformation test passes—swap the pavilion for another ruin and the story loses its tidal constraint and the interplay of water/stone that anchors the final image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The firm shore surveyor frames the piece and makes micro-choices (prying seams, filling the inkwell with silt, sealing notes) across multiple beats. Setup clear by paragraph one. His decisions enable the ritual but do not force a high-stakes trade-off; the role constrains method (must work in tide windows) yet the final commitment to becoming "listening notation" reads as thematic stance rather than a turn that narrows options. Two-gate pass (setup, closure linkage); middle development is observational ritual rather than a choice under friction. Causal pressure modest; specificity moderate (surveyor vocabulary: seams, joins, mortar beds).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The antique traveling inkwell appears in three distinct beats: discovery/description with S.G. initials, filling it with midnight and silt, and the glow moment ("initials S.G. glow like a signal") that validates lineage before the final sealing. It enables the note-writing method and charges the closure by linking past surveyor to present, reweighting the act as inherited duty. Setup mid-first-third, development (filling/use), payoff (glow/lineage recognition). Causal role: provides material and symbolic bridge. Specificity high (brass hinged, tarnished ink smell). Cost connection oblique—the glow moment shifts stance but the inkwell itself imposes no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named early, recurs in mid-passage as explicit theme ("Absence interlaces with presence like rivers with banks"), and the pavilion's arches "practice interlaced absence" in paragraph six. The concept shapes tactics: the surveyor's notes aim to make absence "show as a fabric, not a void." Closure stakes rest on this premise—his act preserves what water erases. Yet the phrase functions more as thematic claim than a constraint that alters on-page options; it frames interpretation rather than forcing a choice. Setup clear, closure linkage strong (final image of "interlaced absence we stitched"), but middle beats treat it as label rather than pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" appears twice: once as the supervisor's label ("I am stoically sensitive, or so my supervisor wrote on the form, meaning I stand without tremor while taking tremors in") and again implied in the opening ("stoically sensitive to the hairline tremors of silt and memory"). The trait describes his stance but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible trade-off. It remains label-only; no on-page moment demonstrates the tension between stoic exterior and sensitive interior under pressure. Setup present, but no middle development or cost that differentiates this trait from generic watchfulness. Swappable with "patient" or "attentive" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once: "I pry at a seam the masons left shy, and wrest the loosened stone just enough to open a pocket" (paragraph eighteen). This action enables the first note placement and models the method for subsequent beats. Setup occurs past the first third (late signal −0.3). The verb choice charges the moment with effort (resisting the sealed structure) yet the act does not redefine options or create a major turn; it initiates a repeated ritual. Functional in one key beat, but easily swappable ("pry open," "lift") without altering stakes. Specificity moderate; causal role limited to enabling rather than transforming.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Placing notes in foundation repairs is signaled by paragraph nine ("placing notes in foundation repairs"), demonstrated across four beats (opening the seam, sealing with lime, tucking message at pipe, pressing final note into mortar), and charges the closure ("my notes will surface as questions in someone else's daylight"; "the interlaced absence we stitched will hold firm"). The method is irreplaceable: it concretizes the preservation stake, provides the ritual structure, and the final image ("coals under river glass") depends on the hidden, sealed quality of the act. Setup, development (repeated execution under tide constraint), and payoff all present. Causal pressure strong; cost connection visible (fingers burn, patience required, future discovery uncertain).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion supplies the tidal constraint (water returns, forcing time-limited work), the spatial architecture (columns, arches, seams, scaffolding) that guides each beat, and the dual presence/absence that anchors theme. Setup immediate (paragraph one). Development: tide level ("dropped to the waist of the columns") enables access; water's return ends the window. Closure stakes depend on the setting's erasure threat ("water praises and erases"). The setting is irreplaceable—swap for dry ruins and the tidal urgency, the preservation paradox, and the final "river glass" image collapse. Micro-setting elements (mortar beds, barnacle-encrusted plaque) alter tactics. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the drawbridge rises" bookends the piece (opening line and penultimate paragraph), framing the surveyor's solitary work window and signaling the ritual's recurrence. The timeframe creates a bounded opportunity (masons depart, tide drops, water returns) that shapes urgency. Setup immediate. Middle beats reference the tide's movement ("tide has dropped," "water returns") to tighten decisions. Closure linkage: the frame recurs ("After the drawbridge rises again tomorrow") to charge the commitment with cyclical cost. However, the clock remains atmospheric rather than beat-by-beat tracked; no moment where seconds force a tactical sacrifice. Two-gate pass with strong lyric reprise; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To become the archeologist of abandoned dreams, beginning with my own" appears in paragraph five and is restated at closure ("until I am less man than listening notation"). The desire motivates the ritual yet remains told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page friction between this want and a competing need; the surveyor enacts his purpose without visible cost that tests commitment. Setup present, closure linkage strong (the final transformation fulfills the stated aim), but middle beats lack a moment where the desire forces a trade-off. Swappable with "preserve memory" without structural loss. Thematic resonance high; causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is named in paragraph two ("Night here never shouts; it kindles a hushed blaze") and the tone—quiet intensity, lyric precision, restrained fervor—modulates consistently through turns. Diction sustains the register (archival patience, "coals under river glass," "quiet oath sealed under grit") without flattening into monotone; the final image charges with controlled heat that matches the opening's promise. The tone constrains exposition (no shouting stakes) and enables the accumulative structure. Setup early, development coherent, closure participation strong (the "ember" and "coals" reprise the blaze). Irreplaceable: swap for overt urgency or cold detachment and the ritual's meditative pressure collapses. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>
