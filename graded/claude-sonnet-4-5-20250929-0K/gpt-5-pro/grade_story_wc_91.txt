<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is present through sensory filters ("whispering hush pressed against her ears") and her practice of orchestrating kindness shows embodied choice. However, her competence is never genuinely threatened—every coincidence falls into place without visible struggle or error, flattening internal contradiction. The rescue unfolds through perfect execution rather than flawed agency under duress, and the boy's mother lacks any interior presence beyond "ash tears," remaining a rescue object rather than a second character with pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density builds through layered images (ashfall, fumaroles, lightning bugs) and cadence shifts tighten at the rescue. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara recognizes she has "fulfilling prophecies accidentally again," the final image reweights her practice, and "transformation wore her name lightly" reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost (she remains unseen, coins spent, footprints vanishing). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One weakness: the prophetic fulfillment and neighbor arrivals lean on orchestrated coincidence to resolve rather than complicate, softening causal pressure at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The black sand, fumaroles, and obsidian flats constrain the rescue path—the "sea cave briefly unveiled" and "shoal path skirting the fumaroles" directly enable the skiff's route, charging the final movement. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's attention ("metallic sighs," "steam instructions," "velvet hem"). The volcanic setting recurs with purpose (setup, complication at the ridge, closure hum), and the body-level texture of "slippered like wet sand and granular like grief" deepens thematic resonance. The beach reappears in the final line, grounding the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the boy's mother before the volcano or tide forecloses access—is signaled early and tightens through the celestial low tide window and the fumaroles' "warning drum." Mara's agency assembles the tools (oar, rope, skiff, lightning bugs) in a meaningful convergence, and the "coil of rope fit the jut of rock" narrows options at the rescue beat. However, the neighbors and tools arrive as orchestrated luck rather than earned struggle, and Mara's orchestration is frictionless competence without visible cost or trade-off during the rescue itself. The final coin donation gestures at price but occurs after resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through attention and small orchestrated kindnesses—emerges from particulars: the lightning bugs, the repaired oar, the vanishing footprints. The phrase "transformation wore her name lightly" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "She wanted to learn by doing, to touch change" risks thematic echo but is embedded in dialogue and grounded by prior action. The recurring motif of "whispering hush" and "borrowed stars" reweights the premise at closure. One slip: "fulfilling prophecies accidentally" in the penultimate sequence comes close to articulating the thesis rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with a consistent lyric register ("vibrant hush," "velvet hem," "slippered like wet sand"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and coherent. Dialogue is minimal—the boy's two lines and Mara's response are naturalistic and goal-driven. Two slips: "the way a street musician orchestrates coincidences until melody finds a pocket" is clever but slightly authorial, and "she wanted to learn by doing, to touch change" edges into abstract philosophizing rather than staying embedded in perception. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and many lines do multiple jobs ("The hush whispered like pages, telling her that if fire has many mouths, water has many doors"). However, figurative density is high throughout peak beats without clear pattern-teaching—"velvet hem," "portable constellations," "slippered like wet sand," "transformation wore velvet"—and some vehicles ("sea would mistake them for a patient constellation") stretch coherence. Minor paraphrase loop: "whispering hush" and "vibrant hush" recur without distinct functional shifts. Stock metaphor: "seeding kind accidents…like wildflowers after rain." These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mechanics, volcanic timing, and philanthropic orchestration is specific and non-obvious. The frame of "destitute philanthropist" reframes charity through attention rather than wealth. However, the prophetic-stranger trope and the perfectly timed rescue with neighbors arriving on cue echo familiar beats, and the emotional arc—Mara's competence meeting need—lacks genuine risk or transformation under pressure. The final image of vanishing footprints is evocative but leans on a known poetic gesture. No close echoes of famous lines, but the piece stays within safe lyric territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, her choices drive the rescue assembly (releasing lightning bugs, guiding the skiff, coaxing tools into place), and her final coin donation and recognition of prophecy fulfillment charge the ending. She is seeded early, involved in three beats (setup, rescue, closure reflection), and her specific trait (orchestrating coincidences) shapes tactics. Cost is conceptual (anonymity, spent coins, vanishing footprints) rather than visceral struggle. Subtract −0.3 for frictionless competence during the climax; her orchestration succeeds without visible error or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lightning bugs appear in four beats: gathered from porches (setup), released to mark the shoal path (rescue tactic), raised by the boy in the prow (middle action), and coaxed back into jars with thanks (closure gesture). They constrain the rescue by lighting the tide-revealed path and are thanked as "borrowed breath," reweighting their role with cost (temporary use, then returned). The specificity (bottled, glowing, coaxed to "trembling life") is irreplaceable. Strong integration; subtract −0.2 for the final beat being a gesture rather than a causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Whispering hush" recurs five times, framing the atmosphere and pressing "against Mara's ears" as an embodied sensation. It signals early, modulates with pressure ("vibrant hush inside her chest"), and charges the final line ("the whispering hush kept time with the heavens"). It shapes the tone more than the stakes or tactics directly; the concept operates as thematic texture rather than altering options. Lyric reprise reweights the premise at closure, earning mid-band placement, but it does not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Orchestrates coincidences" is signaled early ("seeding kind accidents"), demonstrated through multiple prior acts (repaired oar, coil of rope, note under kettle), and enables the rescue when these tools "fell into place as if magnetized by need." It shapes two beats (prior errands, rescue assembly) and is reflected at closure ("orchestrated coincidences vanish like footprints"). The cost is conceptual (invisibility, expenditure of attention and time). Subtract −0.3 for the coincidence mechanism being told more than constrained—neighbors arrive conveniently without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The detour—"following a rumor that the tides would bow low"—initiates the entire rescue sequence and is signaled early. It leads directly to finding the boy and the shoal path. However, it is a single narrative hinge rather than a recurring pressure point, and it could be replaced with "happened to arrive" or "was summoned" without major structural change. It drives one major turn and primes closure but does not recur or reweight meaning. Mid-band for functional but somewhat swappable role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fulfilling prophecies accidentally" is seeded early ("she kept stumbling into them"), demonstrated at the rescue ("seeing a stranger light the ash night and lead a child"), and reflected at closure ("realizing she was fulfilling prophecies accidentally again, with borrowed stars"). It shapes the rescue beat and charges the final recognition. However, the mechanism is summary-told rather than shown under pressure—the prophecy arrives fulfilled rather than contested or costly in real time. Subtract −0.5 for summary-only climax and cameo closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The black sand beach and volcano constrain every beat: the ashfall, fumaroles, obsidian flats, sea cave, and shoal path all directly enable or threaten the rescue. The setting is seeded in the opening line, pressures the middle (volcano's "warning drum," path "swallowed itself"), and recurs at closure ("the beach rethreaded itself around the saved"). The celestial low tide and volcanic timing are irreplaceable mechanics. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment drives tactics (skiff route, rope anchor, eddy navigation). Strong causal integration with visible cost (time pressure, physical danger).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "slow dance of celestial bodies" is signaled early, creates the tactical window (bay pulled low, shoal revealed), and tightens pressure at the rescue ("choreography of moon, planet, and patient spin"). It recurs at closure ("the slow dance continued"). The timeframe directly alters tactics—the tide window is the enabling constraint—and is irreplaceable. Subtract −0.4 for being somewhat passive (the tides act on the characters) and for the clock not visibly ticking down during the rescue beats; the urgency is declared but not counted.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To understand the texture of transformation" is told in reflection ("Mara had come to understand the texture of transformation, not in books, but in heat, ash, and human pulse") and echoed at closure ("the texture of transformation was slippered like wet sand"). It is present in two beats and primes the final image, but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible trade-offs—Mara's desire to learn is asserted rather than tested under friction. The motivation labels the theme more than driving a choice. Lyric reprise earns mid-band; subtract −0.6 for told-only and lack of on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" is introduced in the opening line, recurs as "whispering hush" with modulation ("pressed against her ears," "inside her chest now"), and charges the final line ("the whispering hush kept time with the heavens"). Tone coheres through turns—quiet accumulation to rescue to reflective closure—and modulates with pressure (from patient to urgent to settled). The tone is integral to the piece's lyric-accumulative mode and reweights the premise at closure. Strong integration; it is more atmospheric anchor than direct stake-shaper, capping it just below 8.5.</comment>
