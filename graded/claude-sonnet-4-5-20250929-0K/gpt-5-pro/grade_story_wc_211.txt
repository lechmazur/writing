<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oath scribe's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("memory has teeth like moths"), with contradictory impulses present: the desire to archive versus the knowledge that their work makes them complicit ("my name will be the knife"). The final choice—to witness rather than seal—is earned by the spiral of recognition through the grooves. Minor: the protagonist's agency is contemplative throughout; a single additional micro-choice under visible pressure in the middle third would have sharpened the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis: the protagonist writes the prophecy beside the split rather than sealing it, accepting the cost of exposure to preserve emotional legibility. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through the grooves, bark, and memory until the final image reweights "oath" from binding to witnessing. Orientation is anchored early (orchard atop skyscraper, after foghorn, oath scribe). One tightening occurs when the prophecy reveals the scribe's own signature in the grooves, narrowing options to complicity or witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard and the wax shaving function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the bark "whispers in Hittite," forcing the scribe to respond in a dead language, and the grooves' texture guides the protagonist's final decision. Sensory detail is purposeful ("syrup"-colored lamp, "velvet disquiet," grooves that "skim the rim"). The skyscraper-orchard juxtaposition is vivid but remains atmospheric; a single additional spatial constraint affecting a middle beat would push this higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to seal the prophesied split or preserve its legibility—is signaled early and tightens when the scribe recognizes their own cadence in the grooves. The choice at closure forecloses sealing and accepts exposure as cost. Pressure accumulates through textural discovery rather than external antagonist, fitting the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: the realization "you are the knife, and also the sheath" crystallizes the dilemma and forces the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: oaths as "legible binding," archive versus erasure, witness versus weapon. The final image—writing the prophecy beside the split and attaching a name as witness—offers a non-literal answer to what an oath is for without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the grooves, the famine oath, and the tree's reply. The phrase "archive of our emotional patterns survive exposure" edges toward thematic echo but remains tied to the scribe's specific work and the wax cylinder's mechanics, avoiding pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and maintained: arcane diction ("venerable," "bruised by memory," "willow ink") fits an oath scribe who speaks dead languages. Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (sound as texture, memory as taste, oaths as weather) is consistent and character-specific. Minor: a few constructions edge toward over-ornamentation ("velvet disquiet presses over the garden, as if the air puts on mourning gloves"), slightly slowing momentum in the middle third without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The shaving remembers, and memory has teeth like moths; it eats holes that spell unlikely constellations of sound"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative density is heavy but mostly coherent. Minor deduction: the simile "the way a cat rubs against a book and makes it smell like a promise" in a high-pressure beat (the prophecy moment) slightly dilutes urgency; one or two other metaphors ("city fog rests below like a down comforter") are textural rather than propulsive, creating minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—wax cylinder shavings as accidental prophecy archive, oath scribe atop a skyscraper orchard—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "oath" from binding to witnessing is earned in hindsight through the grooves and the famine oath callback. The use of Hittite and the third-grade docent memory ("sound has a rind") are fresh inflections. Minor: the skyscraper orchard and wax phonograph feel slightly assembled from disparate aesthetic prompts rather than causally interdependent, but the ending commits fully and integrates them into a coherent vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The venerable oath scribe's choices create the key turn: recognizing their signature in the grooves and deciding to witness rather than seal. Present in setup (opening), development (unspooling the shaving, dialoguing with the tree), and payoff (writing the prophecy beside the split). Two beats of causal pressure; the final choice alters the archive's function. Cost is legible: exposure over erasure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wax cylinder phonograph shaving appears in setup (introduced in paragraph 7), development (immersed, threaded along glass, interrogated for grooves), and payoff (set to dry, its prophecy written beside the split). Handled across multiple beats; its grooves enable the recognition that narrows the choice. The shaving's mechanics—grooves that remember—are indispensable to the plot and closure. Cost tied to it: the scribe's name in the grooves makes them complicit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accidental prophecy is signaled early (paragraph 18: "An accidental prophecy rubs against my ear") and shapes the climax: the prophecy states "a vow will split at dusk...and my name will be the knife." The protagonist must choose whether to seal or witness. Present in setup (grooves as remainder), development (testing on bark, tree's reply), and payoff (writing the prophecy). The concept reweights the scribe's archive work from neutral preservation to active complicity. One friction: "accidental" is asserted more than dramatized—mechanical chance versus character error is not fully legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Speaks dead languages" is established early (paragraph 6: "I, whom the guild says speaks dead languages") and used once with causal force: answering the pear tree in Hittite validates the prophecy and enables the tree's reply ("you are the knife, and also the sheath"). Present in setup and payoff. One beat of constraint; swappable with "knows ancient scripts" without major loss. Cost connection is thin: the trait enables understanding but does not visibly complicate the choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Immerse" is the central action: immersing the wax shaving in warmed rainwater (paragraph 11) loosens the grooves and makes them audible. Present in setup (announced as method), development (the act enables discovery of the prophecy), and payoff (the shaving is set to dry after yielding its message). Two beats depend on it; the prophecy cannot emerge without immersion. Causal necessity is high; removing this action breaks the plot. Minor: the immersion is procedural rather than pressured—no visible risk or tradeoff in the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip memory is signaled in paragraph 13 ("I learned this trick via a curious third-grade field trip memory") and frames the method of coaxing sound from the shaving. Present in setup (backstory anchor) and development (explains the technique). Participates lightly in payoff through the inherited logic ("sound has a rind"). One beat shaped by it. Friction: the memory is told rather than dramatized, and the field trip itself does not constrain present choice or carry visible cost; it provides procedural warrant but remains ornamental context.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper is introduced in the opening line and anchors the entire scene. The trees are "grafted from pilgrim stock" with bark that holds pledges; the oldest pear tree speaks Hittite, enabling a key revelation. Present in setup, development (tree dialogue), and payoff (writing on bark). Two beats shaped by setting; the bark's ability to speak constrains and enables the climax. Friction: the skyscraper location is atmospheric but does not alter tactics—removing "atop a skyscraper" and keeping "orchard" would not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the foghorn falls silent" opens the story and establishes a boundary condition, but time remains untracked and does not tighten decisions. The prophecy mentions "dusk," yet no clock pressure shapes the scribe's deliberation. Present in setup only; absent from development and payoff. The timeframe is ornamental: swappable with "after nightfall" or "when the city quiets" with no structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To archive emotional patterns" is stated in paragraph 4 and drives the protagonist's presence in the orchard. The motivation is tested at closure: the scribe must choose between sealing (erasing patterns) and witnessing (preserving them with exposure). Present in setup, development (the work of threading the shaving and interpreting grooves), and payoff (the final act of writing the prophecy to keep "the archive of our emotional patterns" intact). Two beats of friction between the goal and the cost; the ending choice directly serves this want with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" is introduced in paragraph 9 ("a velvet disquiet presses over the garden") and recurs implicitly in the closure's quiet, charged restraint. Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: syrup-colored lamplight, mourning gloves, the grooves' "pebbles poured from a glove, pocked with salt and grief." The final image (writing the prophecy, small arch of night, witness rather than knife) sustains the tone without flattening into summary. Minor: "velvet disquiet" as a phrase is asserted once and not rhythmically reinforced; the tonal effect is consistent but the label itself does not recur to charge the ending.</comment>
