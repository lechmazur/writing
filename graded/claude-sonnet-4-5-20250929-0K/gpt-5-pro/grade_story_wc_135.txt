<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied choices (cleaning the valve, climbing the dais, organizing work crews). Internal contradiction appears in the "reactively visionary" paradox, though the protagonist's agency remains mostly observational rather than decisively transformative. The final renunciation—not blowing the trumpet—registers as earned endurance with cost, but the arc skews toward witness rather than struggle. Relationship dynamics with the boy and returned exiles apply pressure without deep testing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the archivist refuses to blow the trumpet, instead waiting for children's laughter, and the final image reconfigures the harbor's breath as permission rather than command. Conceptual cost is legible—the old herald's sacrifice is honored by choosing listening over signal. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered motifs (valve, breath, intervals, spray) and the ending reweights silence as "not the trumpet, but the breath." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (ivory harbor, after rain, archivist role).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, rain-wet quays, dais, and trumpet case provide tactile grounding and constrain movement (climbing steps, placing the valve). The valve as micro-object charges the closure—its fitting opens "a room where breath can gather." Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the archivist's oceanic idiom (brine-laced, salt that never dried, kelp smell). Spatial choreography remains coherent across locations without teleportation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing the city's broken signal and breath—is signaled early and tightens when the boy brings the valve. One meaningful escalation: fitting the valve transforms absence into "a room where breath can gather," foreclosing the exile's logic. The archivist's choice to wait rather than blow enacts agency as endurance with visible cost (the refusal becomes the practice). Pressure accumulates through staggered intervals of testimony collection, and the final image crystallizes the stakes without forced reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—navigated absences as instruments, silence as honest warning—emerges organically from the valve's mechanics and the herald's choice. The trumpet becomes permission rather than proof, and "ending is a practice" reweights the exile without moralizing. Subtext operates in the archivist's walking, the gaps between questions, and the city learning "to read what was not sent." The final image (breath pulling across the mended valve with "grateful abrasion") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor reliance on abstract phrasing ("accountable memory," "practice becomes meaning") slightly dilutes concrete particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with ocean-spray idiom ("brine-laced ledgers," "windborne testimonies," "boats sigh, ropes sneeze") and rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during valve handling, reflective during testimony collection). Compression and patterned diction ("hearten," "staggered intervals," "navigated absences") are taught early and sustained. Some phrases edge toward elevated register ("reactively visionary," "accountable memory") that slightly exceeds the archivist's lived lexicon during peak moments, and syntactic parallelism ("I step, I pause, I step") occasionally tips into template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per line. Figurative language (gulls, kelp, spray, breath) coheres into a marine texture that charges the closure. Minimal loops or scaffolding; each paragraph advances. However, repeated stems ("I [verb]," "We [verb]") and near-synonym clusters ("hearten," "listening," "shaped questions") appear in adjacent lines without full pattern payoff. Stock metaphors ("dry bones waking," "houses stop flinching") dilute specificity in two beats. The closure beat remains clean and imagistically strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—exile caused by a missing trumpet valve, resolved by archival listening rather than signal—transforms the herald trope through specificity (the valve's threaded stem, the herald's walking as path-tracing). "Reactively visionary" and "navigated absences" offer fresh synthesis. Emotional truth (the city learning breath, not command) avoids genre templates. Risk: extended lyric mode and non-linear testimony structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity to exile-and-return templates slightly constrains full originality, but the valve-as-closure and silence-as-warning reweight the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist is present throughout, drives key beats (cleaning the valve, fitting it, organizing crews, waiting to let the boy lift the trumpet), and shapes the closure by choosing not to blow but to listen. Early signal, involvement in setup/middle/payoff, and causal pressure (the archivist's method enables the city's breath) all register. Swappability is low: the archival lens and "reactively visionary" method are intrinsic to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in beat 2 (boy brings it), beat 3 (archivist cleans and recognizes engraving), beat 4 (fitting into the trumpet), and closure (breath across the mended valve, valve as bookmark). Early signal, distinct beat involvement (≥3), causal pressure (its absence caused exile, its return enables breath), closure linkage (the valve's mechanics charge the final image), and specificity (threaded stem, engraving, the socket's tremor) all score high. Cost connection is visible: the valve's failure was the honest warning, and its repair permits the new practice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Navigated absences shape stakes (the exile began with silence, the archivist maps gaps, the harbor reads "what was not sent") and tactics (the archivist listens for "navigated absences, the way currents outline reefs by what they refuse"). The concept appears in setup (line 11), middle (ledger mapping), and closure (the Ledger of Navigated Absences, breath as permission). It constrains on-page action (organizing testimony, drawing routes of desire and fear) and charges the ending. Swappability is low: the concept is integral to the resolution's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is signaled early (line 4) and shapes the archivist's method (foreseeing only after the world taps) and the herald's parallel stance (answering threats only when confirmed). It constrains the archivist's listening practice and aligns with the closure choice (waiting for children's laughter before allowing the trumpet). However, the trait functions more as thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint with visible cost; it enables decisions without forcing a clear tradeoff or sacrifice in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears as the archivist's method (line 8: "listener who can hearten"), the herald's walking ("walked the piers to hearten us"), and the city's practice ("hearten each other until the light takes"). It drives the middle (heartening fishmongers, ferrymen, widows through shaped questions) and charges the closure (the practice of returning). Early signal, involvement in ≥2 beats, causal pressure (heartening replaces signal as the city's breath), and closure linkage all register. Swappability is modest: "comfort" or "reassure" would serve similar functions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is signaled early (line 9) and shapes on-page action: the archivist's method of pausing between questions, the herald's walking pattern, and the city's reassembling practice. It appears in setup, middle (listening at intervals, gaps inviting voices), and closure ("Through staggered intervals we keep reassembling"). Causal pressure is moderate: the method enables testimony collection and charges the final image ("every pause becomes a quay"). Specificity is high (intervals as tactical choice, not mere pacing), though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain provides sensory grounding (wet marble quays, spray, salt-stained stone) and spatial pressure (climbing the dais, walking piers, Jetty Road). Rain is present in setup (line 1, line 5) and post-closure (final line: "after rain"), and the harbor's breath shapes the ending. The setting constrains movement and supplies the trumpet's location. However, the harbor functions more as atmospheric frame than tactical resource; no environmental detail (e.g., tide, weather shift) alters a mid-scene choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" anchors the timeframe in line 1 and shapes stakes (people return in hesitant flotillas, the city reassembles). The temporal frame appears in setup, middle (collecting testimony from those who fled), and closure (the exile is over, but ending it is a practice). It provides urgency (the city must relearn breath) and charges the final image (returning becomes meaning). However, time does not tighten on the page—no live clock or deadline alters tactics within the scene, and the "after" status remains static rather than escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is declared early (line 3) and dramatized: the archivist collects testimony, places words beside tax records and tide tables, maps navigated absences, and titles the ledger. The motivation drives middle beats (cleaning the valve as fragment, assembling the city's story) and shapes closure (the valve as bright bookmark, "our history is not the trumpet, but the breath"). Friction appears between the desire for completeness and the acceptance of gaps ("most fragments arrive as salt and rumor"). Cost is visible: the work is ongoing, never finished.</comment>
