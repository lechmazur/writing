<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity and functional creativity are shown through concrete actions—touching railings, sketching routes, threading carnival tubing—but her interiority remains somewhat abstract and label-driven ("questions keep clicking like distant thermal relays"). The progression from puzzling to acting to inviting others demonstrates agency, yet the emotional texture stays in a narrow register of patient determination without embodied contradiction or visceral stakes. The final choice to invite the community feels earned by the fountain's success but lacks a visible personal cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through Mara's layered technical work (rerouting panels, threading tubing, tuning resistance) and culminates in the fountain's activation and the evening's quiet opening. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the terminal glows, townspeople drift in, and Mara outlines future paths—reconfiguring the space from abandonment to potential with conceptual cost (the modest scale, the uncertain "tomorrow"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the single-POV, two-location structure (concourse and atrium) coheres. One minor causality gap: the sextant piece's role in aiming the beam to wake the sensor feels abrupt and under-explained, slightly loosening the technical chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with purposeful details: ringed benches cradling dust, departure boards stuttering star names, the cosmic-mouth fountain, and the carnival's leftover cable. Mara's engineering lens filters perception—she notices valves, solar arrays, and head calculations—making the setting legible through her professional idiom. The sextant piece and the fountain both constrain her choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across concourse, atrium, roof, and maintenance door remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting the fountain as a test of hope's systemic rebuild—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's sequential problem-solving: tracing water lines, rerouting solar power, threading tubing. The reversal arrives when the fountain coughs and gurgles, then the townspeople appear, adding a social vector to her technical grid. Agency is clear (her decisions drive each beat), and the escalation follows the Accumulative lens (density and modest stakes rather than life-or-death conflict). The cost, however, remains conceptual (time, patience, modest scale) rather than viscerally felt; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: hope as redirected flow, resurrection as asking where a place can bear to bend, "amperage and head, friction and gradient." The sextant piece and fountain image recur with shifted weight, and the final notebook line ("functionally creative, ethically steady, open to wonder") feels earned rather than imposed. The piece avoids moralizing and invites reflection on renewal and repair. One weakness: the phrase "to puzzle out new equations for hope" and the boy's question ("what the water is doing") edge toward thematic echo, though they remain anchored in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—compressed, lyric, with engineering idiom ("load paths and social paths," "head and gradient")—and stays character-particular. POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("exhales its stale air," "maze of intentions engraved into every walkway") that feels slightly authorial rather than Mara's idiom under pressure. The boy's brief dialogue is functional but generic. Sentence openings vary, though some stems repeat ("She touches," "She shows," "She writes").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, and the prose advances character and atmosphere beat by beat. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "She reroutes the panels to a pump, and the pump to a cistern" echoes prior phrasing, and several "She [verb]" stems cluster in the middle third. Figurative language is dense and sometimes strained ("fountain shaped like a cosmic mouth," "water and confetti stars, sweet and improbable") without always clarifying the image. One minor clarity slip: "the sextant arc" in the penultimate section assumes the reader remembers its shape.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned infrastructure, engineering as hope-practice, and carnival remnants feels specific and non-obvious. The sextant piece as a tool seeking a problem and the fountain as systemic metaphor avoid stock post-apocalyptic tropes. Emotional truth (Mara's patient resolve, the modest scale of her success) grounds the premise. The piece resists gimmickry and commits fully to its engineering-as-repair lens. Some images verge on ornamental ("bone cold of metals that remember weight"), and the overall arc—lone engineer restores public space—echoes familiar "one person makes a difference" templates, though the specific texture and restrained tone freshen it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity drives every beat: she listens, studies the map, touches the railing, finds the sextant, sketches routes, reroutes power, threads tubing, tunes the sensor, and invites the community. Her choices create the story's escalation and closure. She is on the page throughout and her engineering lens filters all perception. Her decisions alter tactics (shifting from study to action to social invitation) with visible cost (time, patience, modest results).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: discovery under the banner, use to aim the beam at the sensor, and the final pocket-click as she locks up. Its curved arc and mirror enable the sensor activation, and it recurs with reweighted meaning ("star learning a new orbit"). However, its mechanical role in the sensor-waking is under-explained, and the piece could function with a generic mirror or reflector. The object serves as a motif more than an indispensable tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" appears explicitly ("The terminal was designed for pulse and purpose, a maze of intentions engraved into every walkway") and returns at the end ("The maze of intentions inside her steadies, corridors of doubt closing like doors behind her heels"). It shapes Mara's approach—she traces arrows, reads failure as blueprint, maps flows—and charges the closure image. It functions more as thematic frame than on-page constraint, but it reweights the premise by the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is named early ("Her mentor taught her to be functionally creative") and demonstrated throughout: Mara reroutes power, repurposes carnival cable, uses the sextant piece in a novel way, and writes "functionally creative, ethically steady, open to wonder" in her final notebook line. The trait enables multiple on-page actions with visible tradeoffs (modest scale, patient trial). It could trend higher if the label were less explicit and the trait more dramatized through contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the story's central action: Mara resurrects the fountain, the concourse, and implicitly the terminal's purpose. Every beat traces to this goal. The piece defines resurrection as repair through redirected flows, and the fountain's activation is the story's climax. Removing "resurrect" would require a different core premise. The action is indispensable and shapes the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" is signaled early ("Hope, she thinks, is a system that can be rebuilt through redirected flows") and mechanics matter: she reroutes solar panels to a pump, the pump to a cistern, threads carnival tubing into dry arteries, and tunes resistance and head. The method shapes her attempts and is demonstrated on the page with visible trial (the fountain coughs, then gurgles). It is present across multiple beats and integral to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal is the story's only setting and pressures every choice: Mara traces water lines, uses the roof's solar array, finds the cistern behind a maintenance door, and opens the terminal to townspeople. The terminal's infrastructure supplies resources (panels, valves, carnival cable) and its abandonment is the problem she addresses. The setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. It is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" sets the initial condition and provides leftover resources (cable, tubing, the sextant case). It anchors the opening and explains the found objects. However, the carnival itself never returns, and the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The story unfolds over one day ("By afternoon," "at evening," "Night deepens") but without urgency tied to the carnival's departure. The element is functional setup but does not shape escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is named early ("She has come to puzzle out new equations for hope, because numbers feel like handholds") and drives Mara's actions throughout: she studies, sketches, tunes, and calculates. The motivation is dramatized through her patient technical work and the modest success of the fountain. Friction arises between her hope and the terminal's scale of abandonment, and cost is legible (time, patience, uncertain outcomes). The phrase edges toward label, but the desire shapes choices across beats and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is coherent throughout: Mara's patient resolve, her mentor's teaching "to read failure as a useful blueprint in stoic wonder," her quiet satisfaction at the fountain's success, and the understated ending ("small proofs that carry farther than applause"). The tone modulates with pressure (compressed technical detail in the middle, softer reflection at the end) and charges the final image. It is present in diction, rhythm, and Mara's perceptual filter, though the label itself appears on the page.</comment>
