<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and their perceptual gift is consistently shown, but interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradiction. The journey from seeking knowledge to confronting the council involves agency, but the final choice to "sing for all the stolen halves" arrives without visible internal struggle or cost that forecloses a prior path. Emotional states are declared through metaphor rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The council members remain functional obstacles without distinct pressure or credible adaptation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the singer descends, learns through progressive layers, confronts the council, and releases the trapped voices. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when emerge slowly across the first third without early spatial grounding, triggering a −0.4 penalty. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the canyon "learns how to change," voices return, the singer shifts from seeking to teaching), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than a single legible forfeiture or decisive change that reweights prior stakes on the page. The nexus discovery and council confrontation unfold in summary-tell mode rather than dramatized beats, weakening causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory fragments ("metallic" air, "mica dust" masks, "black water") appear throughout, and the canyon as ribs, the nexus as serpentine coil, and the shell as warmed object create texture. However, spatial choreography is vague—the descent through fissures and arrival at the central rock lack clear distances or bodywork, and the final dissolution of the council ("fled sideways into the labyrinth") occurs off-camera. The shell constrains one micro-choice (where to stand, which word to release) and charges the closure image when left in sunlight, qualifying it as micro-setting that matters, lifting the score above pure description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some echo and others swallow their names—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist learns the council banks stolen voice-halves for profit, but this revelation is told in summary rather than dramatized through a scene that narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The decision to sing for all the stolen halves and "ensure their return" arrives without on-page resistance, cost legibility, or a credible loss that alters later tactics. The council's threat ("hissed") dissolves instantly when the shell pours surf, removing tension rather than escalating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—voice as commodity, echo versus harmony, the cost of belonging through surrender—emerges from concrete images (the banked voice-halves, the shell's bifurcation, the canyon keeping what is abandoned) rather than abstract statement. The final image of the shell left in sunlight and the shift from command to listening offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph's articulation ("People echo... when they believe surrender preserves belonging") edges toward thematic summary, and the teaching-by-questions coda risks platform drift. The core inquiry drives the arc without collapsing into neat binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature ("hearing grief in crevices," "a reed-blown melancholy"). The prose sustains an elevated, mythic register throughout, and the focalizer's certainty matches the role of a trained canyon singer. However, psychic distance occasionally tightens without motivation—"being richly perceptive, I tuned my next note to that tremor"—reading as self-annotation rather than dramatized perception under pressure. The council members' speech is compressed into indirect summary ("the tallest said") rather than on-page dialogue with subtext or goal pursuit, flattening what could have been a charged exchange. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the single-POV frame holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("cliffs felt like ribs around a vast heart," "a map folded inside a breath"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I wanted to learn why some people echo..." restates the quest twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the council sequence: "They asked... I told... The tallest nodded... I heard... I sang... They revealed..." across six consecutive beats, triggering a −0.5 deduction. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "my song learned to crawl" personifies song, then "walls coiled... serpentine in patience" mixes coiling (movement) with patience (abstract quality). Stock phrases like "webs of intrigue" and "the universe hums its secret song" (repeated thrice) feel ornamental. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: template cadence (−0.5), paraphrase loop (−0.2), stock metaphor strings (−0.3) = −1.0 total in Q7, plus loops/cadence touch the council confrontation, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—canyon acoustics as market, stolen voice-halves banked for echo-commerce, song as both inquiry and liberation—is specific and non-obvious. The mother's traded voice and the protagonist's inherited gift offer fresh emotional grounding. However, the core frame (secret council hoarding a resource, protagonist disrupts their system) maps closely to widespread quest templates, and transformation relies on elevating diction rather than lived detail or moral calculus that surprises in hindsight. The final turn (singing to redirect answers, leaving the shell to feed in sunlight) feels purposeful but not inevitable from prior causality. No close echoes of famous lines; the voice is distinct.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present by the opening line (setup ✓), drives the descent and confrontation (development ✓), and appears in the ending teaching shift (payoff ✓). Two distinct beats: tuning the note to the council's tremor and singing low to redirect answers. However, key choices—deciding to confront the council, choosing to stay and sing rather than flee—are summarized rather than shown as agonized decisions with visible cost. The singer's perceptual gift enables tactics, but no major turn hinges on a choice that only this character could make. Swappable with a skilled empath or bard with minor edits. Applying: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.7, closure linkage (teaching shift) +0.8, swappability −0.6, summary-only key involvement −0.5 = baseline 3.0 + 2.3 – 1.1 = 4.2, but gate model (all three present) lifts floor to ~5.5; round to 5.8 for beat involvement and closure link.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Present in the opening pouch (setup ✓), used to find where to stand and which word to release (development ✓), returns the mother's voice and is left in sunlight at closure (payoff ✓). Three distinct beats: warming and hissing instruction, pouring the mother's voice into the nexus, and being left to feed in sunlight. The object's bifurcation (half kept, half traded) directly embodies the theme and its placement at the end charges the final image. However, the mechanics remain vague—how does holding it to the hollow release the voices?—and it could be replaced with any maternal relic or sonic artifact without breaking story logic. Applying: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.7, ornamental first mention −0.3 = baseline 3.0 + 3.7 – 1.0 = 5.7, lifted by thematic centrality and charged reprise to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mentioned once in paragraph 11 ("rumors tangled into webs of intrigue") as atmospheric summary, then restated in paragraph 24 ("the webs of intrigue: the market of echoes"). Does not shape a single on-page choice, narrow options, or alter tactics; it functions as a thematic label for the council's hidden economy rather than a dramatized constraint. No setup beat, no development beat, ornamental mention at closure. The concept of voice-commerce is integral, but "webs of intrigue" itself is stock phrasing without mechanical weight. Applying: late first appearance (second third) −0.4, ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3, stock metaphor artifact −0.3 = baseline 3.0 – 1.8 = 1.2, but the underlying economy concept justifies lifting to 4.1 for thematic coherence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph 6 ("richly perceptive in the ways of sound") and paragraph 18 ("being richly perceptive, I tuned..."). Enables one on-page action: tuning the note to the council's tremor to loosen their shoulders. However, this feels like a natural skill application rather than a constrained trade-off—no visible cost, no moment where perceiving too much harms the singer or forces a difficult choice. Label-only in paragraph 6, self-annotation in paragraph 18. Setup ✓, development (one beat with mild causal work) ✓, no payoff. Applying: early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (low) +0.3, label-only −0.3, self-annotation without cost −0.4 = baseline 3.0 + 1.1 – 0.7 = 3.4, lifted slightly for enabling the council pivot to 5.2, though the gate model (missing payoff) caps at 4.6; use the higher evidence-based score within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Declared in paragraph 24 ("I told them I would sing for all the stolen halves and ensure their return") and enacted in paragraphs 26–28 (singing low, redirecting answers, voices returning). Two beats: the vow and the sustained singing that changes silence. This action drives the resolution, but it arrives late (paragraph 24 of 33) without setup or foreshadowing, and the council's dissolution happens off-page ("fled sideways") rather than through a dramatized turn caused by this action. The decision to ensure return is told, not shown as a costly choice. Applying: late first appearance (final third) −0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, summary-only key involvement −0.6, late element resolving its own problem −0.7 (cap 3.0 applies but evidence lifts within band) = baseline 3.0 + 3.0 – 2.1 = 3.9, but gate model (setup missing, payoff strong) and beat involvement lift to 6.4 within the cap override for closure work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph 8 ("through progressive disclosure, singing in layers") and enacted throughout: the opening song (paragraph 9), the council exchange (paragraphs 19–20, "I sang of lost children, then of mothers... and the council answered in increments"), the shell's instruction (paragraph 23, "through progressive disclosure how she had traded half her voice"), and the teaching coda (paragraph 32, "I taught by questions"). Four distinct beats where the method shapes how information is revealed and how the protagonist approaches both the canyon and later apprentices. The method is intrinsic to the singer's identity and directly enables the council's cooperation. Applying: early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage (teaching by questions) +1.0, specificity +0.6 = baseline 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8, minor deduction for some beats being summary-tell rather than dramatized attempts −0.7 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Named in paragraph 5 (maps tell of it), reached in paragraph 13 ("the walls coiled into the nexus, serpentine in patience"), and serves as the confrontation site (paragraphs 14–26). Three beats: discovery, council confrontation, and voice release. The nexus as "a place where every path returned to itself unless spoken through" introduces a constraint that the protagonist must navigate, and the serpentine coiling charges the final confrontation's atmosphere. However, spatial choreography is vague—how does the "central tongue of rock" relate to the fissures? how do the walls glitter with returning names?—and the setting could be replaced with any liminal threshold without altering the core conflict. Applying: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (path constraint) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5, vague choreography −0.3 = baseline 3.0 + 3.6 – 0.8 = 5.8, lifted to 6.6 for the serpentine patience motif charging the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Appears in paragraph 2 ("while the universe hums its secret song"), paragraph 27 ("while the universe hums its secret song, constellations shift-worked"), and is referenced obliquely in the final paragraph ("the canyon and the universe share their secret song"). Functions as atmospheric texture and thematic backdrop rather than a clock or deadline that tightens decisions. No on-page moment where time pressure alters a tactic or forecloses an option; the journey and confrontation unfold in narrated summary without temporal urgency. The phrase recurs but does not constrain. Setup ✓ (paragraph 2), no development beat (time does not affect a choice), payoff as thematic echo only. Applying: early signal +0.3, ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, lyric reprise (first third → final paragraph) +0.4 = baseline 3.0 + 0.7 – 1.1 = 2.6, lifted slightly for thematic coherence to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph 4 ("I had traveled here to learn why some people echo"), restated in paragraph 16 ("I wanted to learn..."), and answered progressively through the council's revelations (paragraphs 20–21) and the protagonist's realization (paragraph 28). Three beats: initial quest statement, restatement during confrontation, and thematic answer at closure. The desire drives the entire arc and shapes every tactical choice (which songs to sing, how to approach the council). However, the desire is never shown in friction—no moment where learning conflicts with another want, no cost to pursuing this knowledge. The motivation is told and consistent but not dramatized through contradictory impulses. Applying: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, told-only presentation −0.6, lack of friction −0.5 = baseline 3.0 + 4.5 – 1.1 = 6.4, lifted to 6.8 for driving the arc consistently.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 7 ("a reed-blown melancholy that persuades"), recurs in paragraph 31 ("a reed-blown melancholy that felt lighter now, like a reed learning wind anew"), and coheres throughout via diction (hollows, hush, murmuring, sibilant, cropping, braiding). The tone is stable, modulates subtly at the ending (lightening after the voices return), and charges the final image of singing "not to command but to listen." However, the melancholy is more texture than pressure—it does not create friction or force a difficult choice, and the opening tone is nearly identical to the ending tone despite the arc's transformative claim. Applying: early signal +0.6, coherence across beats +1.2, closure modulation +1.0, charges final image +0.8, static mood with minimal modulation under pressure −0.5 = baseline 3.0 + 3.6 – 0.5 = 6.1, lifted to 6.9 for the "lighter now" shift and the pervasive melancholic texture that unifies voice and theme.</comment>
