<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's stance ("contemporary of extinct species") reads as conceptual claim rather than lived trait; interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("taste of emotion felt sapped by the salt of persistence") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The vow to "coexist without pretending they were still here" offers a stance shift, but prior choices remain sparse—turning the sundial and walking aisles are gestures, not pressure-tested decisions that foreclose paths. Motivation is articulated late and resolved through declaration rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise). The narrator renounces reunion and commits to "independence" as a stance; the vow and placement of the sundial reconfigure options with a felt opportunity cost (choosing not to crave return). Escalation is density-driven—layered imagery and thematic weight increase—but causality remains diffuse; many beats are observations or reflections rather than because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors late: who/where/when coalesce gradually across the first third without immediate grounding, applying a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tidal library, floating shelves, and stone circle hum create vivid atmosphere, but function primarily as backdrop; the sundial is used twice (angling to open the door, final placement as beacon), offering modest constraint. Spatial choreography is loose—aisles, wing, threshold blur without precise positioning. Detail is lyric and dense but does not narrow tactical options in a legible way at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate isolation into independence. Pressure accumulates through reflective density rather than narrowing choices; the narrator's agency is largely attentional and contemplative until the final vow, which arrives as declaration rather than a choice tested under competing pulls. The Librarian encounter and ledger reveal deepen understanding but do not force a visible tradeoff or foreclose a live path with on-page cost scaled to the claim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—coexistence with absence, independence without reunion—emerges organically from image and gesture (sundial, extinct friends' marginalia, "Tone: None"). The vow and final sundial placement offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "orphaned by their silence" and "without craving reunion" edge toward thematic summary, but the closing image ("between shelves and sky") successfully reprices the premise with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistently elevated ("wet-lipped bookspines," "memory arrives like frost and splinters at a touch"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The Librarian conversation "by gestures, because speech in that room turned to foam" is clever but borders on convenient filter rather than dramatized limitation. Perceptual signature is idiosyncratic, though register stays high throughout without modulation under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and largely coherent ("atomically reflective," "tide," "hum"), but several beats loop conceptually: "isolation into independence" appears three times with paraphrase variations, and "coexist" recurs without added pressure mid-text. Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("I set…and the library decided…There, between…") stacks parallel constructions. Sentence rhythm varies, but information density dips in reflective passages that restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal library above clouds and reincarnation-memory frame offer fresh synthesis; the image of the narrator as "contemporary of extinct species" is evocative. Execution leans toward lyric meditation, a less common register, but core emotional arc—mourning isolation, choosing independence—follows a recognizable template. The final vow and sundial placement reprise the premise with specificity, lifting the piece above generic but not achieving full inevitability in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present by title and opening claim, but functions as conceptual label rather than trait that drives choice. The narrator observes and reflects on extinct friends; no decision hinges on being their "contemporary." Late vow to "coexist" reweights the stance, but the element itself remains ornamental to that turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brass sundial appears early, is used twice (angling to open the door, final placement as beacon), and is described with charged specificity ("polished so fine it looked atomically reflective"). Its reflective property enables one beat (sending light into stones) and its final placement reconfigures the closure image. Swappable with another tuning tool without deep structural loss; involvement is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" seeds early ("Each morning was one of those brittle awakenings, where memory arrives like frost and splinters at a touch") and returns in the vow ("tempered by brittle awakenings"). It shapes emotional texture and primes the fragility of memory, but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its role is atmospheric and thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" is described vividly and enables the sundial to send light into the stones, opening the door. One functional beat, but the attribute could be replaced with "brightly polished" or similar without structural loss. Present but not irreplaceable; no cost tied to its specific atomic quality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the stated goal, drives the narrator's inquiry and vow, and anchors the final image ("the extinct and I could coexist without craving reunion"). It shapes the ledger reveal, the Librarian conversation, and the closing stance. Central to theme and arc; removing it would hollow the story's logic and ending charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hum of the ancient stone circle is seeded early, used to open the door when the sundial's light activates it, and recalled in the ledger memory ("by the hum of an ancient stone circle"). It enables one key turn (access to the Librarian's wing) and links past survival to present architecture. Functional across two beats but mechanics remain abstract; a similar mystical mechanism could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal library above clouds is established early, grounds the narrator's journey, provides the catalog ("Tone: None"), and supplies the threshold for the final sundial placement. It shapes atmosphere and stakes (study of extinct friends) but does not constrain choices in a tight causal way. Present across setup, middle, and ending, yet its tide metaphor remains poetic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" anchors the temporal frame in paragraph four and colors the narrator's relationship to past lives. It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; time remains vague (mornings, seasons past, "until morning"). Present but not used to escalate pressure or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is stated early, repeated mid-text, drives the Librarian conversation, and anchors the vow and closing image. The desire is articulated rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices, but it shapes the arc and participates in closure. Functional across beats; cost is conceptual (renouncing reunion) rather than a visible tradeoff.</comment>
