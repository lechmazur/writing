<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is voice-consistent and embodied ("I hear more than I speak, because the mouth fills with our own weather while the ears catch seasons"), but motivation remains largely declarative rather than tested under pressure. The curator's choices—calling for coffee, asking the inspector to wait—read as facilitative rather than revealing internal contradiction or costly trade-offs. Secondary characters (Mrs. Lin, Javi) supply information but do not pressure the protagonist's stance in ways that force a hierarchy of values. The final choice to read letters aloud lacks visible personal cost; the curator's arc is more witness than participant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (courtyard gathering, multiple voices) and converges on a single closure unit: opening the mailbox and reading Maria's letters aloud. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (courtyard, thrift-store curator, locked mailbox). One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket's half-moon piece unlocks the padlock, and the letters reweight the courtyard's grudges. However, the cost at closure is diffuse—"grudges softening"—and the conceptual repricing (listening heals) is stated rather than felt in the final image. The piece holds its lens but the closure lacks the sharp undeniable pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is anchored early with sensory particulars ("dust swirled like hush," "robes and work boots," "spoons clinking against enamel"). The aged locket constrains the midpoint turn (its half-moon sliver opens the lock), qualifying as micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (mailbox cluster, hamper behind counter, benches). The metal mailbox cluster and its third-from-left position are legibly tracked. However, the courtyard itself does not evolve or pressure the final choice; it remains a stage rather than an active constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving that listening heals—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inspector arrives with bolt cutters and a deadline ("until the kettle whistled a second time"), narrowing the window. The curator's agency at the climax (pressing the half-moon into the lock, asking neighbors to listen) is present but the price paid is unclear; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The letters resolve the mailbox mystery and soften grudges, but the resolution feels granted by Maria's prior action rather than earned by the curator's sacrifice or renunciation. Escalation is legible but cost is diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme—listening as healing—emerges from courtyard storytelling and the locked-mailbox reveal. The final image of reading letters aloud and grudges softening offers a resonant answer, but the curator's note ("addressed to me, though I never met her, instructing us to listen first") risks thematic echo by articulating the premise in near-prompt language. The piece resists overt moralizing in most beats, allowing Maria's letters to do implicit work, yet the closing paragraph ("proving that listening heals") restates the thesis rather than trusting the particulars. Subtext operates in the locket's mechanics and the inspector's softened stance, but the final resolution trends toward tidy satisfaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains a stable collective stance without head-hopping into individuated interiorities; interior access is consistent. Diction is voice-specific and lyric ("the mouth fills with our own weather while the ears catch seasons," "a click like a teardrop touching wood"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, elevated register in high-pressure beats (e.g., "sandstorm calm," "mosaic," "mutual aid ledger") drifts above the thrift-store curator's plausible lexicon without dramatized justification. Purposeful compression ("Maria woke before dawn, everyone said") and patterned repetition ("the outside world intrudes") are taught early and pay off, yet dialogue is minimal and secondary voices (Mrs. Lin, Javi) lack distinct idiom. Under peak stress the voice remains lyric rather than fragmenting, which reads as authorial rather than POV-grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("dust swirled like hush," "a grainy rattle, like wind inside a thimble," "a click like a teardrop touching wood"). However, template cadence runs appear across multiple lines ("I am a discerning thrift-store curator," "I lead through following," "I am trained to read stains") with identical "I [verb/state]" stems, triggering −0.5. Stock metaphors ("sandstorm calm," "ears catch seasons") and elevated diction in peak beats ("mosaic showed Maria's pattern," "mutual aid ledger") muddle immediacy without consistent POV grounding, adding −0.4 for register drift. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several sentences restate the theme ("listening heals," "hear the room like a heartbeat," "listen first") without added pressure. Information density is high in the locket and mailbox beats, partially offsetting artifacts. No loops touch the closure image directly, so deductions remain within-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox frame and thrift-store curator lens offer modest freshness, and the locket-as-key mechanism provides a satisfying micro-ingenuity. However, the core arc—community storytelling unlocks a mystery and heals grudges—follows a familiar mutual-aid template without sharp transformation. Maria's letters as deus ex machina (apologies, recipes, shared rent fund) resolve the conflict through her off-stage generosity rather than the curator's earned risk. The "listening heals" thesis is stated rather than discovered, and the inspector's sudden capitulation ("agreeing to give us until the kettle whistled") lacks the friction that would make the turn feel inevitable. Specific details (origami cranes, florist ribbon, red X sketch) add texture but do not fundamentally alter the template's emotional or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The curator is present throughout and makes key choices: calling for coffee and benches, reading the locket's clues, pressing the half-moon into the lock, and asking neighbors to read letters aloud. Setup is early (first paragraph), middle development includes decoding the locket and negotiating with the inspector, and the curator participates in the closure by facilitating the reading. However, the choices are primarily facilitative—arranging space, decoding, asking—rather than involving visible personal cost or trade-offs. The curator's "leads through following" trait is enacted but the final action (we read them aloud) is collective; the curator does not face a dilemma that tests competing values. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle causal pressure is modest. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure participation +0.7, but causal pressure and cost are limited, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aged locket appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the donation bin (paragraph 13), examination revealing the sketch and half-moon sliver (paragraphs 18–20), and use as the key that unlocks the mailbox (paragraph 27). Setup is early (by ~40% of the text), middle development includes the hinge and clasp mechanics that reveal the sketch and sliver, and the locket directly enables the climax turn. The half-moon's specific shape and the locket's number seventeen tie it causally to the mailbox mystery. However, the locket does not return with reweighted meaning in the final image; once the lock is opened, it vanishes from the text. Three gates met: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, but no closure reprise −0.5, and swappability is moderate (another keyed object could serve with edits) −0.4. Strong mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery is the central engine: it generates the gathering (paragraph 9), prompts storytelling to trace Maria's pattern (paragraphs 12, 23), and the unlocking is the story's climax (paragraph 27). Setup is immediate (paragraph 5), middle beats include the inspector's deadline and the locket's clues, and the payoff is the mailbox opening and letters revealed. The mystery shapes tactics (coffee and benches, neighborhood storytelling, negotiating with the inspector) and the resolution alters the courtyard's emotional state. Three gates met: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0. The concept is indispensable to the plot. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is stated explicitly (paragraph 8) and enacted when the curator calls for storytelling rather than solving alone, and when asking the inspector to "hear the room" (paragraph 25). Setup is early, middle beats show the curator facilitating rather than directing, and the closure involves collective action (we read aloud). However, the trait is label-heavy and its cost is never dramatized—no moment where leading-through-following forecloses a faster or safer path. The attribute is voiced but not tested under friction. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, but label-only treatment −0.6, no visible cost −0.4. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hear" and "listening" saturate the text: the curator's job is listening (paragraph 2), the goal is to prove listening heals (paragraph 3), the inspector is asked to hear the room (paragraph 25), and the climax involves hearing a click and reading letters aloud (paragraphs 27, 30). Setup is immediate, the action shapes middle beats (storytelling as listening, the curator hears the locket's rattle), and closure hinges on communal listening. Three gates met: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. However, "hear" is somewhat diffuse—swapping "listen" or "attend" would not break logic −0.3. Strong integration but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (paragraph 9: "we would move through neighborhood storytelling until a key appeared") and enacted across multiple beats: Mrs. Lin's memory (paragraph 12), Javi's account (paragraph 15), collective mosaic-building (paragraph 23), and the final communal reading (paragraph 30). The method is the story's central tactic and its mechanics matter—each neighbor's voice adds a tile to Maria's pattern. Setup is early, middle development includes the mosaic metaphor, and the method participates in closure (reading letters aloud). Three gates met: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0. The storytelling is the means by which the community reaches the unlock, making it essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard at dawn is anchored in the first sentence and recurs across beats (paragraphs 1, 10, 16, 24). It provides the gathering space that enables the storytelling and houses the mailbox cluster. Setup is immediate, middle beats include the drone intrusion (paragraph 16) and the inspector's arrival (paragraph 24), and the courtyard frames the closure (paragraph 30). However, the courtyard functions primarily as a stage rather than constraining choices—no environmental feature (weather, access, visibility) alters tactics under pressure. Three gates met but causal pressure is low: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure frame +0.4, but no choice-constraint −0.6. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is stated (paragraph 4) and enacted twice: the drone and developer's banner (paragraph 16) and the inspector's arrival with a deadline (paragraph 24). These intrusions tighten the window (kettle deadline) and add external pressure. Setup is early, middle beat includes the inspector's ultimatum, and the timeframe shapes the urgency of the unlock. However, after the kettle deadline is granted, the clock vanishes—no second whistle or ticking tension in the climax. Two gates (setup, middle) met; closure participation is absent. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, but no closure participation −0.7, and the deadline does not materially alter the final moves −0.3. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that listening heals" is declared (paragraph 3) and drives the curator's choices: calling for storytelling, negotiating with the inspector, and facilitating the letter-reading. Setup is immediate, middle beats include the curator's patient stance and the inspector negotiation, and the closure validates the thesis (grudges soften). Three gates met. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no moment where the curator's desire to prove this thesis conflicts with a competing want (speed, safety, personal gain) and forces a visible trade-off. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only treatment −0.8, no friction or cost −0.6. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is named explicitly (paragraphs 1, 25) and the prose maintains a lyric, measured cadence across most beats. The tone is coherent but largely static—no modulation under pressure (the inspector's threat, the unlock) that would heighten or fragment the calm. Setup is early, the tone is invoked at a middle beat (meeting the inspector's gaze), and it frames the closure's unhurried reading. However, the tone does not charge the final image; it remains descriptive rather than functional. Two gates met: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, but static mood −0.5, no closure charge −0.6, label-heavy ("sandstorm calm" is stated twice without embodied enactment) −0.3. Low-mid band.</comment>
