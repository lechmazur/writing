<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian's interiority is distinctly embodied ("I tidy chalk, refill fountain pens," "the scarf tugged") and motivations are clear—seeking "the place where stories live" through concrete action. Internal contradiction appears in observed solitude balanced against patron presence, and the choice to "shelve the air" demonstrates agency under pressure. Minor deduction: the predecessor's voice sometimes merges with the narrator's reflective register, and the final return to desk duty, while thematically resonant, could show more visible cost in the choice itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its hyperbolic-geometry pattern early ("I began to learn the library through hyperbolic geometry") and maintains coherent escalation through density increase and image recurrence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I belong to their weather and their measure" crystallizes the stance with felt cost—the librarian's autonomy absorbed into custodial recursion. Orientation is clean by line 3. One micro-turn when the atlas clicks does not fragment pressure. Deduction: the cost at closure is conceptual and atmospheric rather than a hard forfeiture that narrows future options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library's hyperbolic geometry constrains movement and choice throughout: "I walked the translation, turning left forever and arriving gently at right" is not decorative but alters spatial logic. The scarf functions as micro-setting, catching in the atlas hinge and warming to cue memory. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "pencil shavings and rain on windows," "cedar and lightning." The final image—"every book becomes precisely heavier"—charges closure by reweighting the physical environment with the librarian's new obligation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding "the place where stories live." Pressure accumulates through hyperbolic traversal, the atlas slot click, and shelves becoming "lungs." The tightening occurs when "I stepped into a cul-de-sac that was wider inside than out"—geometry narrows escape and forces the librarian into direct encounter. Agency is present in "I began to shelve the air," a renunciation of mere observation. Deduction: the coincidence of the scarf catching in the atlas complicates but does not resolve; however, the patron responses (woman's "quake," boy's star-sentences) feel more atmospheric than a test that narrows the librarian's options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—custodianship as recursive belonging—emerges through particulars: "You face what you can love, and the angles protect what you cannot yet carry." The scarf, hyperbolic geometry, and "analog memories" accrue meaning without thesis statements. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "I belong to their weather and their measure" reweights the quest into submission with conceptual cost (loss of sovereign search for embedded service). No overt moralizing. The phrase "sanely eccentric" borders on a character self-label but is inherited, not asserted as epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and interior access remains consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct: "equations can dream," "shelves that are lungs," "the library breathes out." Diction stays within the librarian's idiom—scholarly yet tangible. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("observed solitude") and metaphoric density serve the accumulative lens. Minor deduction: occasional elevated constructions ("sanely eccentric archivist," "hyperbolic geometry") risk slight register drift, though they remain plausible for this narrator and the piece teaches its lyric-conceptual voice early enough to earn trust.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "I slid my chalkboard ticket through and heard a click, not mechanical, but like a thought deciding" advances plot, world logic, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent within the taught pattern. Deduction: −0.6 for elevated metaphoric saturation in peak beats without functional payoff—"lungs of shelves," "shelved the silence back into a sonnet," "filed a thunderclap"—reads as textural ornament rather than causal necessity. The closure image is clean, but mid-story density occasionally obscures immediate cause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hyperbolic-geometry frame is a fresh synthesis of mathematical topology and literary custodianship, not a stock metaphor. The librarian's quest transforms from external search to recursive submission, avoiding the safety middle. Specificity (chalk, fountain pens, tessellated floor tiles) anchors the concept. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative rather than causal) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "analog memories" and "observed solitude" motifs, while specific, echo recent literary fascination with archival mysticism and solitary curators; the piece does not fully escape the template's gravitational field, though execution is confident.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout, makes the key choice to "shelve the air," and returns to the desk with altered stance. Setup (line 3), development (traversal and shelf encounter), and payoff (custodial return) are all present. Causal pressure: the librarian's action opens the corridor and redefines obligation. Closure: "I belong to their weather" directly articulates the librarian's final stance. Cost: autonomy exchanged for service. Irreplaceability: high—any other role (archivist, patron, night guard) would not carry the same custodial recursion.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scarf appears in beat 7 ("I knot a tattered silk scarf"), catches in the atlas (beat 17), warms and smells (beat 27), is hung on a hook (beat 42), and is carried back ("a scarf that had learned to rest," beat 52). Setup, development (atlas hinge), and payoff (resting scarf at closure) are present. The scarf's predecessor-link constrains the librarian's method ("listen sideways"). Deduction: the scarf's role is symbolic and mnemonic rather than causally indispensable—removing it would weaken thematic texture but not break plot logic. It does not force a trade-off or narrow options with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Analog memories are introduced in beat 9 ("analog memories refuse to sit on a server"), reappear as "ferried voices" docking (beat 28), and underpin the final weight shift ("every book becomes precisely heavier"). Setup and payoff present; middle development is atmospheric. The concept shapes the librarian's method (physical reawakening vs. digital retrieval) and primes the ending's tactile charge. Deduction: the concept operates more as thematic backdrop than a constraint that narrows tactics under pressure. It is present across beats but does not force a visible trade-off or alter the librarian's options in a dramatic turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is attributed to the predecessor (beat 8) and claimed by the narrator at closure (beat 51). Setup and payoff present; no middle development beat where the trait constrains action. The trait colors voice but does not force a visible trade-off. Swappability: "methodical oddness" or "disciplined quirkiness" would function similarly. Deduction: label-only use; the trait does not enable or block a key choice with cost. It enriches characterization but remains ornamental to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is introduced as the predecessor's teaching (beat 10: "you must reawaken them in their native weather"), enacted when the librarian asks for directions and shelves the air (beats 30–43), and echoes in the ending's breath-and-weight image. Setup, development (the act of shelving air as reawakening), and payoff all present. Causal pressure: the act opens the corridor and alters the librarian's stance. Deduction: the action is more metaphoric than procedurally specific—what "reawaken" entails on the page (shelving silence, aligning meridians) is gestural. A more concrete cost or visible failure mid-attempt would elevate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled in beat 12 ("I began to learn the library through hyperbolic geometry"), shapes traversal mechanics (beat 14: "turning left forever and arriving gently at right"), and structures the corridor generation (beat 32: "through hyperbolic geometry, the library made a path"). Setup, development, and payoff present. The method constrains movement and enables discovery. Deduction: the geometry is more metaphoric shorthand than a system whose specific properties (negative curvature, parallel-line behavior) force tactical adjustments. Swappable with "non-Euclidean topology" or "impossible architecture" without major edits. It enriches world logic but does not impose a visible procedural cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is introduced in line 2, supplies tools (chalk, fountain pens, slide rules, atlases) across beats, and its physical geometry (shelves, tessellations, vents) alters movement and closure. Setup, development (atlas slot, cul-de-sac, tessellated floor), and payoff (breathing shelves at closure) all present. The setting constrains choice: hyperbolic layout forces the traversal path, and the shelves' lung-like state imposes custodial obligation. High irreplaceability: the dual scientific-poetry mandate and spatial recursion are load-bearing for the librarian's role and the ending's weight metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" is signaled in line 4 and recurs in beats 21, 36, and 46. Setup and scattered touches present, but no middle development beat where patron presence tightens a decision. Payoff: patrons' responses (woman's "quake," boy's star-sentences, final nods) register the librarian's success, but they do not impose urgency or alter the librarian's tactics. Time is more backdrop than ticking constraint. Swappable with "during open hours" or "before dawn." Deduction: the timeframe is functional but replaceable; it does not narrow options or escalate pressure with a clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is stated in beat 11, drives the hyperbolic traversal (beats 12–30), and is answered by the room (beat 39: "Here is where stories live"). Setup, development (walking the translation, using the atlas), and payoff (finding and then belonging) all present. The desire forces the journey and the final renunciation ("I belong to their weather"). Deduction: the motivation is dramatized through action but not visibly conflicted—no moment where the librarian weighs abandoning the search or fears the cost of finding. The friction is intellectual (maps failed) rather than an on-page values collision. Cost at closure is felt but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is introduced in line 5 ("the metronome of my observed solitude"), recurs in beat 22 ("Observed solitude means your heart is quiet but never unattended"), and charges the ending ("curves mind the people"). Setup, development, and payoff present. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: quiet opening, spatial tension during traversal, breath-and-weight resolution. The tone shapes how the librarian perceives patrons and shelves, constraining emotional register. Deduction: the tone is consistent but does not itself force a choice with cost—it colors rather than narrows. The closure image reweights it (solitude becomes custodial recursion), earning solid integration without full indispensability.</comment>
