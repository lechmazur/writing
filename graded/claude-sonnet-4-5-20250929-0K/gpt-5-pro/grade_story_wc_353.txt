<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tree-song sculptor's interiority is rendered through embodied perception ("pressed my ear to bark and felt empathy in motion") and micro-choices (when the hedgehog nods, permission is felt to continue). Motivation is consistent—creating music in a silent world—and the character's choice to match the insulator's refusal to hurry shows a values hierarchy. Internal contradiction is minimal; the protagonist displays patient conviction without complication. Backstory is substantial (~20%) but anchored to present stimuli (studying ruins informs current tuning practice) and tilts present stance, meeting BRR expanded-mode tests.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words ("tree-song sculptor," "siskin alder grove," "after the hedgehog uncurls"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: the protagonist completes one phrase, offers it to river/hedgehog/grove, winds the wires to rest, and promises to return—endurance that forecloses rushing and affirms continuance with visible cost (time, patience, restraint). The lens holds through pattern-building and cadence shift; the final image ("If I am true, the song will outlive me") reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Cost is legible in the repetition of "offer" and the grove's refusal to applaud, which marks the price of listening over performance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grove's sensory detail is vivid and selective: "thin green light," "small gray pipes," "quills slicked with dew." The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its refusal to hurry dictates the protagonist's tempo ("I match its refusal"). The wire-bark-insulator system anchors spatial choreography and charges the closure image: the protagonist leaves the insulator "to dream of sky," a purposeful release that reweights the grove's continuance. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency; during strumming, the protagonist notices exhale warming wire and glaze cooling thumb, details filtered through the tactile focus of the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to create music in a silent world, signaled in line 4. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hedgehog nods and "permission to continue" is felt—a small ceremony of witness that gates the protagonist's strumming. Agency is expressed as patient endurance and attention that forecloses rushing; the protagonist's decision to wind the wires and leave marks a trade-off (stopping now to preserve the grove's lesson). The cost is legible: the protagonist collects tools and promises to return, accepting that this phrase is complete and tomorrow requires fresh listening. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift under the Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—listening as empathy, patience as creation—emerges through concrete particulars: studying stress cracks, matching the insulator's refusal, offering the phrase without applause. The final image ("the song will outlive me, moving from root to river to wing") reweights prior material without stating a moral, answering the central question of how music can exist in silence. Subtext operates in gesture (the hedgehog's nod, the river leaning against ankles) and the grove's non-applause, which refuses tidy closure. The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question: to create requires submission to the grove's tempo, and the resolution affirms continuance over crescendo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "fingertip to letter to breath," "small letters," "as if mending fabric." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; elevated phrasing ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") reads consistent with the sculptor's training and post-siren world. Purposeful compression ("the river gathering its coat and pretending that movement is not confession") is taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows; inference reads as inference ("deciding the hour for bustling"). Minor density in figurative language ("room made of leaves," "porcelain ear," "hollow log body double") stays within the sculptor's idiom and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines often perform multiple jobs (e.g., "Its glazed body remembers storms, and memory is a resonant thing" establishes object history and thematic resonance). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences ("I learned the names of fractures...") breathing between shorter action beats. Figurative language is dense in places—"river gathering its coat," "pressure migrates," "sympathy of materials"—but most images clarify rather than obscure. Minor scaffold appears in parallel stems ("I offer it to the river... I offer it to the hedgehog... I offer it to the grove"), a taught pattern that pays off thematically but nears repetition. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs elsewhere. Closure beats are clear and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-siren world where silence is studied rather than mourned, music created via sympathetic resonance—is specific and non-obvious. The sculptor's method (analyzing stress cracks in toppled museum sculpture, mapping them into intervals for trees) transforms familiar post-apocalyptic material through grounded, occupational detail. The hedgehog as witness and timekeeper is a fresh inflection. The grove-insulator-wire system feels inevitable in hindsight; removing any component would break the story's logic. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous lines; the voice is singular and committed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tree-song sculptor is present throughout and makes key choices: pressing ear to bark, strumming wires, matching the insulator's refusal, winding wires to rest, promising to return. These decisions shape tactics (pacing, touch) and participate in closure (the choice to stop and collect tools). Setup is immediate; development occurs in the strumming sequence; payoff is the departure and promise. Cost is visible in the restraint and the vow to return "symphonically minded and patient." Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears in setup ("bolted to a dead stump, a pale ear"), development (protagonist touches it when wind arrives, "the glaze cools my thumb"), and closure ("leave the insulator to dream of sky"). It constrains choice by refusing to hurry, which the protagonist matches. Its presence charges the final image with the promise of continued listening. The insulator's "glazed body remembers storms" adds specificity. Two distinct handling beats and closure linkage; causal pressure evident.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is stated in line 14 ("felt empathy in motion, slow and circular") and echoed at line 35 ("empathy in motion translated into patient vibration"). It shapes the protagonist's method—moving with the alder, matching the insulator's pace—and is implicit in the offering sequence. Setup occurs early; development is present in the strumming; payoff is in the final promise ("to keep listening"). However, the concept is more thematic echo than on-page choice constraint; it colors stakes but does not demonstrably narrow options in a beat. Lyric reprise with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" appears in lines 9 and 50. It frames the protagonist's orientation ("not toward grand crescendos, only toward the gentle alignments") and is restated in the closing vow. The trait colors the protagonist's approach but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with felt cost. Setup is immediate; closure linkage is present; middle development is absent. Functional but largely ornamental—more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Strum" is the action that initiates the grove's music: "I strum the hairline wires with my fingertips, coaxing rather than demanding" (line 19). The strumming produces the first and second tones, forms the melody, and is the protagonist's central task. It enables the offering sequence and shapes the closure by being wound to rest. Setup occurs at the action beat; development spans the tone and melody lines; payoff is the winding down. Causal pressure is strong; the action cannot be swapped without losing the wire-based mechanism. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks appears in lines 10–12: the protagonist studied ruins, analyzed cracks in a sculpture, and mapped those lines into intervals for trees. This method is stated to inform the grove tuning ("a grammar for trees that had forgotten their verbs") but is not dramatized in a middle beat. Setup is early; closure linkage is implicit (the method enables the current work); middle use is summary-only. Functional causal role but not irreplaceable—another method could justify the tuning with edits. One-gate strong setup plus thematic payoff, but swappable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is named in line 5, functions as the workspace, and supplies the trees that the protagonist strings with wire. The grove's spatial details (riverbank, fern roots, windward sides) guide the protagonist's actions. The grove "keeps its lesson" and "does not applaud," constraining the protagonist's expectations and shaping the departure. Setup is immediate; development occurs through the tuning and strumming; payoff is the offering to the grove and the promise to return. The grove pressures choices and charges the final image; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the hedgehog uncurls" opens the story and recurs at closure ("when the hedgehog curls again"). The hedgehog's nod marks permission to begin strumming, functioning as a gate. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions beyond this single ceremony; it sets tone and frames the work but does not create urgency or alter tactics under pressure. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle pressure is minimal. Lyric reprise with moderate causal weight—purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To create music in a silent world" is stated in line 4 and reprised in line 47 ("My motive remains simple...to create music in a silent world, and to keep listening"). The motivation drives all actions: studying ruins, tuning the grove, strumming wires, offering the phrase. It faces friction in the grove's refusal to applaud and the protagonist's acceptance of restraint. Setup is immediate; development spans the work sequence; payoff is the vow to return. The desire is dramatized through choices with visible cost (patience, time, the trade-off of stopping). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is stated in line 2 and maintained through diction ("tremor," "hush," "not loud," "small letters") and syntax (long, measured sentences). Tone modulates with pressure: the strumming sequence tightens slightly, then releases into the offering. The grove's refusal to applaud and the protagonist's decision to match the insulator's slowness are tone-consistent acts. The final image ("the song will outlive me, moving from root to river to wing") charges the tone with quiet permanence. Coherent through turns; the tone shapes closure and cannot be replaced without breaking the premise.</comment>
