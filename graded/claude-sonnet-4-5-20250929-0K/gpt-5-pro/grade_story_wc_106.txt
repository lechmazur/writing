<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is consistent and distinct, but agency at the ending is muddied—the "stay" decision belongs to the future self, not the protagonist whose jar-opening is the visible act. Interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion ("I steal nothing except light from time") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The florist and the man provide pressure, but the protagonist's choice to "simply stay" and release moonbeams reads passive, a gesture rather than a foreclosure with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; much is told through metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (emerald station, moonlight, narrator's role) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator stays and releases light rather than capturing a portrait), but the cost is asserted ("carrying away nothing but relieved light") rather than dramatized—no tangible loss or foreclosed path is shown on the page. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens (moonbeams, flower codes, reflections layering toward the ending), but causality blurs: the man's decision to miss the train hinges on a future memory of the narrator's past act, a temporal loop that obscures who drives the turn. The final image reweights "thief" into "keeper," a valid RR, yet the felt cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald station by moonlight is vividly anchored (tiles, brass door, timetables, concourse flow) and the jar of moonbeams functions as a micro-setting element that charges the closure image when released into the rafters. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cut stems and station metal, minnows pooling around laces). Spatial choreography is clean across moves. The setting subtly guides choice—destiny's door becomes the literal threshold where the man and narrator lean together—pushing this into the high 7s despite the dreamlike register that occasionally floats above concrete action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (whether to capture this illuminated moment) is signaled early, but pressure plateaus rather than escalating. The man's decision to stay is his, not the protagonist's; the narrator's agency is releasing moonbeams, a symbolic act without visible tradeoff. The reversal (recognizing the man as a future self) reframes identity but does not narrow options or force a choice with on-page cost. Coincidence (the temporal loop) complicates rather than escalates, and the ending softens into mutual listening and light-release without a tightening that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme (the ethics of capturing versus releasing moments; the recursion of choice across time) emerges from particulars—jar, door, bouquet codes—and the final image reweights "thief" into "keeper" with thematic resonance. However, the piece leans toward stated insight ("sometimes the greatest portrait is the one you reinterpret") rather than letting image alone do the work. The temporal loop invites reflection but borders on metaphysical convenience. The ending offers a non-literal answer (light forgives, cycles recur) yet the conceptual cost remains diffuse, held at arm's length by the lyric register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetically compressed ("a dark aquarium glowing with petals," "minnows testing a river mouth"), but the register is uniformly elevated—vocabulary and syntax rarely modulate under pressure, flattening urgency. POV is stable first-person, though the temporal loop introduces a mild focalization puzzle (how does the narrator know the future self's memory?). Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early, but diction stays in one key throughout, missing the rhythmic tightening or sensory narrowing that would mark peak stress. No dialogue appears; the piece relies entirely on narration and reported gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often lyrical ("tides," "coastlines," "minnows," "lanterns"), but metaphors occasionally crowd each other without clear physical grounding—"redistributing choices into new coasts" and "a heart being reinterpreted by tides" layer abstractions in adjacent lines. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm is controlled, but information density dips when metaphor replaces concrete action (e.g., "the moonbeams clicked their tiny shutters"). A few paraphrase loops appear ("carrying away," "carry away") and the phrase "reinterpret" recurs five times, approaching template cadence. Clarity holds, but the lyric texture occasionally obscures causal sequence, lowering propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (a thief of illuminated moments who uses captured moonbeams and flower codes) is inventive and the temporal-loop twist (narrator meets future self) offers fresh inflection. The reversal is seeded early (florist's warning about reflections) and feels earned in hindsight. However, the concept risks abstraction—"illuminated moments" as currency remains metaphorical rather than anchored in specific world rules—and the resolution (releasing light, staying instead of capturing) leans toward lyric gesture over concrete tradeoff. The piece commits fully to its poetic register but stops short of bold risk that would heighten stakes with visceral cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The golden-hour portrait thief is the narrator and focalizer throughout. The character observes, releases moonbeams, and decides to stay, but the pivotal turn (the man missing his train) belongs to the other character. The narrator's choice to leave the camera capped and release light is present but does not narrow options with felt cost—it's a symbolic gesture rather than a tactical decision under pressure. Setup is early, middle involvement is continuous (reading bouquet, unscrewing jar, leaning on door), and the ending features the character, meeting the gate model's two-of-three. However, the character's agency is diffuse and the closure choice is more renunciation than active decision, capping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The jar of captured moonbeams appears in setup (paragraph 3), is unscrewed and released mid-story (paragraph 15), and returns in the final third ("cracked the jar further," "keep the jar safe"). It constrains a choice (releasing light to illuminate the man's decision) and charges the closure image (moonbeams roosting in rafters, "the jar safe until another choice"). The jar is handled across three distinct beats and its state changes (sealed → opened → cracked further), meeting the gate model. Specificity is high (the hum, the pale swarm, the minnows), and the element shapes the dominant stake (capture versus release). However, the jar's mechanics remain metaphorical—what moonbeams do and why they "recognize master and apprentice" is asserted rather than shown with causal grounding, limiting irreplaceability and keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Illuminated moments is the story's premise, named in paragraph 2 and framed as what the narrator steals. The concept shapes the dominant stake (whether to capture this moment) and the closure (releasing light instead of taking a portrait). Middle development is weak—the concept is discussed more than dramatized—but it returns in the man's explanation (paragraph 29: "illuminated moments were not accidents but maps") and the ending assertion ("relieved light," "the world forgave itself"). The concept is present in setup and payoff, meeting two of three gates, but it functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint. Causal pressure is oblique: we are told illuminated moments matter, but their mechanics (how light reveals truth, why it "forgives") remain abstract. The element scores mid-band for coherent thematic presence but lacks the tactical specificity or visible cost that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Quietly savvy appears once as a self-description (paragraph 5: "I am quietly savvy about timing") and recurs near the end (paragraph 42: "quietly savvy"). The trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates savvy timing under pressure—the florist's codes and the jar's hum do the noticing work, and the narrator's key choice (to release light and stay) is symbolic rather than tactical. The trait does not constrain or enable a beat with visible cost. Ornamental use and late reprise without middle development place this in the low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reinterpret drives multiple key beats: the narrator reinterprets the florist's bouquet as a warning (paragraph 22), realizes the "you" in "press your ear" is herself (paragraph 30), and concludes "the greatest portrait is the one you reinterpret as belonging to someone else" (paragraph 35). The action is verb and concept, shaping the dominant turn (recognizing the future self) and the closure choice (reframing theft as release). Setup is early (paragraph 5: "tonight the timing smelled"), middle development is strong (paragraphs 22, 27, 30), and payoff is explicit (paragraph 35, and the florist will "reinterpret the codes" tomorrow, paragraph 38). The element is causally active and irreplaceable—removing "reinterpret" would collapse the story's logic. Cost is present (the narrator forgoes the portrait, accepts the loop) but felt rather than visceral, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Codes in flower arrangements is introduced early (paragraph 6) with specifics (chrysanthemums for caution, violets, heliotrope, fern, dusk roses, moonflower), used in middle beats (paragraph 8: "ring of dusk roses and one stray moonflower, a warning about reflections"; paragraph 27: "WAIT with roses and thyme, LISTEN with lilies"), and referenced at closure (paragraph 33: "the bouquet agreed by dropping three petals"; paragraph 38: "reinterpret the codes in flower arrangements tomorrow"). The method shapes tactics (the narrator reads the warning, interprets the man's bouquet) and is present across setup, development, and payoff. However, the codes function more as atmospheric detail than hard constraint—the narrator's choices are driven by the jar's hum and direct encounter, not by decoding flowers. Specificity is high but causal pressure is moderate, placing this in the upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald station by moonlight is named in the title phrase (paragraph 1), described throughout (tiles, destiny's door, departures board, concourse, rafters), and charges the closure image (paragraph 40: "The emerald station by moonlight exhaled"). The setting supplies the brass door (a recurring anchor where the man and narrator lean, paragraphs 20, 31) and the moonlight that deepens the tiles (paragraph 14), both of which pressure the choice to stay. Spatial choreography is clean (Track Three, concourse, door, window), and micro-setting elements (door, jar, tiles) constrain action. Setup is immediate, middle beats use the setting actively (door as threshold, moonbeams in rafters), and the ending reweights the station as a living presence. The setting is indispensable to tone and the final image, pushing this into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Under a fleeting golden sunset appears in the opening and closing lines (paragraphs 1, 41) as a framing image, and moonlight is the ambient timeframe throughout. However, the clock is loose—"impossibly between hours" (paragraph 1) signals dreamlike time, and no on-page pressure from a ticking deadline tightens decisions. The man's train is called (paragraph 32) but he stays without visible cost from delay. The timeframe sets tone and anchors the lyric register but does not constrain tactics or escalate urgency. Lyric reprise (first line → closing) lifts this above ornamental, but the lack of middle development and tactical pressure caps the score in the low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To press your ear against destiny's door is introduced as the bouquet's message (paragraph 13), enacted literally (the narrator and man lean on the door, paragraph 31), and resolved when the narrator realizes "the you was me" (paragraph 30). The motivation is dramatized in a concrete action (leaning, listening together) and shapes the peak beat. Setup is clear, middle development is present (the door as threshold), and payoff reframes the motivation as recursive. However, the desire is more conceptual than visceral—what the narrator wants from the listening is asserted ("a coastline remapping itself," paragraph 32) rather than shown as a tradeoff with cost. The element scores mid-band for coherent presence and concrete action but lacks the friction or price that would push it into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Luminous disbelief appears explicitly twice (paragraph 23: "He lifted his head with luminous disbelief"; paragraph 39: "I walked into the concourse with luminous disbelief") and pervades the tone—wonder, impossibility, and radiant uncertainty. The tone modulates subtly (caution in early paragraphs, recognition at the peak, relief at the end) and charges the final image ("the world forgave itself long enough for us to walk home"). Setup is immediate, the tone coheres through turns, and the closing line reweights the emotion with thematic force. However, the tone is asserted more than embodied—"luminous disbelief" is named rather than rendered through contradictory action or sensory degradation under pressure. The element is present and purposeful but lacks the micro-level texture that would make it indispensable, placing it in the upper-mid band.</comment>
