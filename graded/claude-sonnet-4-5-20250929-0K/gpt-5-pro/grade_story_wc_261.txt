<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "read the stories in scars" is embodied through concrete choices (examining coffee rings, touching ivy's wound, cutting the elm) that drive the arc. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between seeking closure and opening wounds, acted out rather than summarized. The fern and ivy function as relationship pressure in the single-POV frame, forcing the protagonist to negotiate consent before reclaiming the miracle. Embodied emotion is strong ("pain salts the floor with stars"), though some therapy-adjacent phrasing ("I will listen to the stories in scars") edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The pattern is taught early (waking, fern speaks, coffee-ring reading established as method) and deepens through the tunnel descent and elm encounter. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist renounces the old method of opening wounds without consent, accepts that scars can be read without erasure, and the final image reweights the initial question with visible cost (the scar "opens like a book that stays intact"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One credible tightening occurs when the ivy refuses to yield the miracle without being read first, forcing the protagonist to negotiate and perform a consensual cut rather than simply reclaiming what was lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tower, its service tunnel, ivy, and elm are handled as micro-setting that constrains choice: the fern's refusal sends the protagonist down, the ivy blocks access until consent is given, the elm's wound becomes the door for the miracle's return. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("meteor hush," "sap rises like a sigh," "roots stitch the darkness together"). The hourglass and coffee rings function as intimate anchors; spatial choreography (room → tunnel → elm at stair foot → return) remains coherent. The tower's roots and plants become pressure-bearing agents rather than décor, charging the final image when "the tower windows glitter like healed skin."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the protagonist's need to reclaim the displaced miracle while learning a less violent method of reading scars. Pressure tightens when the ivy withholds the miracle and demands to be read first, forcing a new bargain. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to tunnel down, kneeling to read the ivy's scar, asking the elm for consent, and making the cut that retrieves the miracle. The final cost is legible on the page: the protagonist's own scar "opens like a book that stays intact," memory is accessed without erasure, and the old method of opening wounds is renounced with visible consequence (the elm's wound, the shared breath, the protagonist's changed practice). One meaningful deepening through negotiated consent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the protagonist's history of opening wounds to learn is tested and transformed by the plants' insistence on consent and the elm's teaching that "repair does not demand erasure." The hourglass, coffee rings, and scars function as recurring images that shift meaning—initially tools of forensic reading, finally reweighted as emblems of memory that can be accessed without destruction. The final image ("I will read them in rings") answers the central question non-literally, showing that closure can coexist with openness. No moralizing; the ivy's lesson is dramatized through the protagonist's embodied choice to negotiate rather than take. Subtext operates in the exchange of permissions and the protagonist's physical pain as cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable first-person distance. Voice is distinct and lyric ("meteor hush that rings like distant glass," "green rain, shy and certain"), with diction calibrated to the protagonist's forensic mindset and poetic precision. The fern's and ivy's "speech" is rendered as thought-address rather than dialogue, maintaining focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist notices coffee rings as tree rings, reads scars as stories, and processes pain through figurative precision. Brief compression under pain ("pain salts the floor with stars") fits the heightened state. No head-hopping; the plants' voices are experienced as telepathic intrusion, not separate POV. Elision of the miracle's exact mechanics is purposeful and paid off through the negotiated retrieval.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance image, choice, or pressure. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent ("frosted hourglass exhales a pale breath," "sap rises like a sigh"). Minor overwriting in clusters: "meteor hush" recurs three times, and some metaphors stack without full payoff ("coffee rings...dried into concentric moons" then "tree rings" feels slightly redundant). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One mixed vehicle: "tunnel down the throat of brick" (throat implies flesh, brick implies masonry) momentarily blurs. Final line offers crisp closure. Artifact load is light; propulsion remains strong through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—accidentally telepathic with plants after surgery, with a displaced miracle—offers a fresh synthesis. The protagonist's forensic reading practice (coffee rings, scars) and the requirement to negotiate consent with ivy transform familiar "quest to reclaim" material into a meditation on agency and repair. The final turn (reading without opening) feels earned in hindsight. Lyric diction and the tower setting avoid generic elsewhere framing. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and plant-as-agent design elevates without obscuring clarity. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on this exact combination of forensic reader, displaced miracle, and plant negotiation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character trait present from opening ("I have opened more wounds than I have closed") and drives all major beats: examining coffee rings, tunneling down, reading the ivy, asking elm for consent, making the final cut. The protagonist's choices create reversals (ivy's refusal, elm's lesson) and the closure unit hinges on renouncing the old method. Cost is visible (elm's wound, protagonist's scar remains open as book). Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability all present. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hourglass appears in three beats: bedside (paragraph 3), protagonist tips it to measure risk (paragraph 18), and it "gives up its last white tear" during the miracle's retrieval (paragraph 26). Its "frosted" state and white grains function as clock and metaphor for risk measurement. However, its role is more atmospheric than causal—tipping it does not constrain the protagonist's choice to tunnel, and its final tear does not change the elm negotiation. Present across structure, but swappable with another time-marker without breaking plot logic. Mid-band for reprise without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Displaced miracle is the inciting premise (paragraph 9: "a displaced miracle slid along our roots") and the dominant stake: protagonist seeks to reclaim it. It shapes all tactics—following the fern's map, negotiating with ivy, cutting the elm—and the closure depends on retrieving it ("the miracle unlace from the roots and pool in the wound"). The miracle's displacement into plant roots creates the telepathy and the need for consent. Without it, no plot. Early signal, drives two major beats (ivy negotiation, elm retrieval), closure-essential, irreplaceable. High integration with visible cost (elm's wound, protagonist's permanent scar-as-book).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Telepathy with plants introduced in paragraph 7 and enables all subsequent action: the fern speaks the miracle's location, the ivy articulates its demand, the elm answers "yes" and teaches through shared breath. Without this trait, the protagonist cannot locate or retrieve the miracle or learn the new method. Visible cost: the protagonist must submit to being flooded with "summers I did not live" and share the tower's breath. Early signal, enables two beats (fern guidance, ivy/elm negotiation), closure-linked (elm's teaching rewrites the method). Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tunneling action appears in paragraph 19 ("I tunnel down the throat of brick") and is the physical turn that moves the protagonist from passive waking to active retrieval. It leads directly to the ivy encounter and the elm negotiation. Without tunneling, no access to the miracle. The act is embodied with cost ("pain salts the floor with stars" when swinging legs precedes the descent) and is signaled by the fern's map. One major beat shaped by this action; it redefines the protagonist's options from bedside reflection to embodied negotiation below. Causal and irreplaceable, though brief on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Examining coffee rings introduced in paragraph 13 as "the old method" and demonstrates the protagonist's forensic reading skill. The rings reveal "sleeplessness," "a hand that trembled," and "a slip, a transfer, a miracle that missed its mark"—information that clarifies the displaced miracle and primes the retrieval. This method is then contrasted at closure with the new method of reading scars without opening. Setup and thematic payoff present, but the coffee-ring reading itself does not constrain a later choice or create cost; it functions as exposition and thematic anchor. Mid-band for lyric reprise without direct pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tower introduced in opening line and structures the entire arc: protagonist wakes in the tower, plants braid its ledges, the service tunnel is "the throat" the protagonist descends, the elm anchors the stair foot, and the ending image shows "the tower windows glitter like healed skin." The tower's roots channel the miracle, and its spatial layout (room → tunnel → stair foot) constrains the protagonist's path. Early signal, involved in three beats (waking, descent, return), closure-linked (windows as healed skin metaphor). The tower is both container and agent, irreplaceable to the plot's spatial logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening and explains the protagonist's vulnerability and the miracle's fresh displacement. Dawn progresses to morning by the ending ("dawn has bloomed into morning"), creating a single continuous window. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure forces faster choices, and the hourglass measures risk symbolically rather than tracking elapsed minutes. Setup present, slight developmental role (the passage of time allows the protagonist to recover enough to tunnel), but no tactical constraint at closure. Functional but mid-low for lack of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to learn to read the stories in scars" stated in paragraph 5 and drives every choice: the protagonist examines coffee rings, tunnels to follow the miracle, reads the ivy's scar, and learns from the elm that "repair does not demand erasure." The final transformation—"I will read them in rings" instead of opening—directly answers and reweights this desire. Cost is visible: the protagonist's scar remains open as a book, and the old violent method is renounced. Early signal, drives three beats, closure-essential, irreplaceable. Friction between the desire to learn and the impulse to open without consent is dramatized and resolved with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone "meteor hush" introduced in paragraph 2 ("The world is held in a meteor hush that rings like distant glass") and recurs in paragraph 24 ("The rush is like meteors passing in velvet air, the very pattern of a meteor hush given shape") at the climax when the ivy floods the protagonist with memory. The tone is sustained through lyric diction, soft sensory detail ("green rain, shy and certain," "sap rises like a sigh"), and measured pacing. It modulates slightly under pressure (pain as "stars," the "rush" of memory) but remains coherent. The final image ("tower windows glitter like healed skin") extends the crystalline, quiet register. Tone charges the closure without stasis. High integration through reprise and consistent modulation.</comment>
