<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's interior voice is distinct and sustained—"drink the dark and exhale petals" anchors character-particular perception. However, the protagonist reads more as observer than agent through most beats; choices (gathering chalk, drawing the circle, singing) feel ritualistic rather than forged under competing pressures. The Guard's moment ("eyes wet, and mutters something about his mother and thorns") adds embodied texture, but secondary pressure from the blossoms remains abstract—red "coughs," white "sighs," thorn "clicks"—without individuated resistance that forces trade-offs. The final softening ("Red unfurls a quiet petal; white folds a thorn inward") lands as earned stasis, yet the lack of on-page conflict between the protagonist's want (armistice) and a visible cost (what is renounced or risked to achieve it) keeps this in mid-range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (postcard → chalk circle → lullaby → voices → treaty draft) and the final cadence shift ("buds hold... open when the sun speaks") reweights the dominant stake (ending faction skirmishes). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the armistice is written, the shell "breathes," insomnia "loosens its fists"—a credible endurance that forecloses war without erasing cost. Orientation is solid by the second paragraph (who/where/when), and the two-shard structure (waking → Spiral Choir journey → negotiation) coheres within one window with one visible transition. Cost is present but muted: "no slashing for pride, no exile for color" articulates new rules, yet we don't witness a specific forfeiture on-page (a character giving up armor, a faction yielding territory). The final lines gesture toward ongoing work ("practice sleeping without closing," "joy is a reef with shadows"), which charges the image but stops short of making a decisive price undeniable in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting throughout: "walls remember," "stairs spiral down past murals," "antechamber," "Spiral Choir acoustics bow like trees in a salt wind," and the postcard itself (physical object that pulses heat, fattens into bark) constrains ritual choices. The chalk circle, drum, and hibiscus tint are handled and reused, grounding the negotiation in tactile action. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("drink the dark," "reef-shadow joy," "wind carries notes to balconies"). The final image—constellations on the postcard "flare, then fade, as if breathing, too"—charges closure by making the shell's posture shift legible. Small friction: the exact spatial choreography of the Choir (floor, balconies, vents, guardrooms) is suggested rather than mapped, and the "reef-shadow joy beyond" remains atmospheric rather than a concrete constraint that alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (end the blossom skirmishes) is signaled early and sustained. The postcard's arrival and its instruction ("negotiate a blossom armistice") frame the goal, and the journey to the Spiral Choir tightens spatial pressure. The lullaby sequence ("I sing our history... stitch it with wishes") functions as the peak negotiation beat, and the blossoms' responses ("what of old winter debts," "memory is a knife") introduce conceptual friction. The protagonist's reply ("edges belong, but they must stop craving blood for proof") advances the argument, and the subsequent softening (red unfurls a petal, white folds a thorn inward) reads as earned. However, the escalation is more accumulative than causal: no visible reversal narrows options, and the cost remains abstract—no forfeiture of a specific resource, relationship, or safety on the page. The final image (buds hold, children's shoes flowering) confirms success but doesn't dramatize the price paid to achieve it, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (transmuting pain into beauty, collective wounds into shared peace) emerges organically from the poet's nightly work, the blossoms' faction war, and the lullaby's stitching function. The recurring "shyly unstoppable" phrase and the postcard's transformation (ink map → bark) accrue meaning without overt statement. The final lines—"the ache becomes music, and music becomes food... joy is a reef with shadows"—offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (can beauty resolve violence?) without moralizing. Subtext operates in the Guard's muttered reference to "his mother and thorns" and in the blossoms' layered throats hiding names. The piece resists tidy resolution: "We have not solved everything, but the first morning after, buds hold" acknowledges fragility. Minor penalty: "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is nearly stated in the opening ("My motive is simple and ferocious, to photosynthesize pain into beauty"), which edges toward thematic echo; the line is poetic but borders on articulating the thesis directly rather than letting it arise solely from event and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person singular throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "drink the dark and exhale petals," "crooked as a crab path," "shyly unstoppable as a sprout cracking stone." Diction remains character-particular and lyric without slipping into generic register. The blossoms' voices are differentiated by rhythm (red "coughs," white "whispers," thorn "rattles"), though convergence at closure is acceptable given the armistice frame. Purposeful compression and ellipsis (the journey down the stairs, the gathering of old gardeners) are taught early and maintained; the reader learns to expect summary of transit. Minor friction: in peak beats, elevated diction occasionally strains the voice—"ensconce the galaxy postcard in the pocket above my heart" reads slightly formal for a narrator otherwise rooted in embodied metaphor. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The piece teaches its lyric mode and holds it without line-level voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and image density is high: "galaxy postcard drifted under my door like a tide leaf," "acoustics bow like trees in a salt wind," "sickles turned to harps." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, two artifact patterns lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—e.g., "The song threads the corridor, shyly unstoppable, tugging the wind to duty. / I sing our history..." and "Together we propose a season... / Together we write the blossom armistice"—the repeated "Together" and synonym churn dilute propulsion. (2) Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The" or "We" or "I," creating a drumbeat rhythm ("The wind buries... The wind carries... Together we propose... Together we write... We store... I feel... My insomnia..."). The "shyly unstoppable" phrase recurs three times across the piece; while purposeful, the third instance feels decorative rather than earned. No loops touch the closure image directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for paraphrase/template issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomniac poet, living shell, sentient blossoms, and galaxy postcard as treaty witness is specific and non-obvious; the "blossom armistice" frame transforms familiar peace-negotiation material through sensory and metaphoric density. The lullaby as diplomatic tool and the postcard's physical transformation (paper → bark) feel fresh. Emotional terrain (longing, insomnia, inherited war) is anchored in particular images rather than generic templates. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative beats, lyric compression) heightens thematic resonance without obscuring the closure. Minor friction: the premise (factions personified as flowers, peace achieved through song) has echoes in fantasy/fable conventions; the piece personalizes it through voice and the "photosynthesize pain into beauty" motive, but the armistice outcome follows a predictable arc (resistance → negotiation → tentative peace). The "shyly unstoppable" refrain and "reef-shadow joy" closing image are memorable, yet the resolution—buds opening and closing in harmony—lands near the expected thematic target without a final turn that subverts or complicates it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout, frames the quest, and makes key on-page choices: gathering ritual tools, drawing the chalk circle, singing the lullaby, raising the postcard as witness, and proposing the season "that breathes in and out without war." These choices drive the negotiation sequence and shape the armistice outcome. However, many beats are observational or ritualistic rather than forged under competing pressures—decisions feel more procedural than torn. The poet's insomnia and motive ("to photosynthesize pain into beauty") are signaled early and return at closure ("My insomnia does not leave, but it loosens its fists"), creating a lyric bracket. Cost is implied (ongoing vigilance, practicing "sleeping without closing") but not a visible forfeiture on the page. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is present but not decisive. Score trends toward the upper end of "shapes one key turn" due to closure linkage and early framing, but the choices lack the torn quality or visible price that would push into the "essential across beats" band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in the opening (drifts under the door), is handled and examined ("I pressed my ear to it and heard a voice"), is placed "in the pocket above my heart" before departure, is raised during the negotiation ("I raise the postcard; stars whirl through its paper like seeds unspooled... It is a witness"), and transforms physically ("We store the vow inside the postcard, and the paper fattens into bark"). In the closure, "constellations on the postcard flare, then fade, as if breathing, too," directly charging the final image. The postcard's mechanics (holds a map, pulses heat, carries a voice, serves as treaty vessel) constrain and enable multiple beats. It is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the negotiation's witness function and the final breathing image. Setup, development (pocket placement signals importance; raised at the Choir), and payoff gates are all met. Cost connection is present (the vow is stored, the postcard transforms). The only friction: the postcard's transformation into bark and the final flare/fade moment are narrated rather than dramatized with immediate consequence, so the highest band (indispensable with on-page cost at closure) is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blossom armistice is the dominant stake from the postcard's instruction ("negotiate a blossom armistice") through the Spiral Choir negotiation and into the closure ("We write the blossom armistice as vows any petal can keep"). It shapes tactics: the protagonist gathers hibiscus tint, sings a lullaby to summon the factions, and articulates terms ("no slashing for pride, no exile for color, no hunger for pain"). The concept pressures on-page choices (responding to red's "old winter debts," white's "knife that also carves bowls," thorn's "no edges, no defense") and the outcome (blossoms soften, buds hold, children run splashing) directly reflects the armistice's success. Setup is immediate, development spans the negotiation beats, and payoff is explicit in the final paragraph ("the first morning after, buds hold"). The armistice is causally active and irreplaceable; swapping it for "peace treaty" or "truce" would dilute the floral-faction specificity. Cost is present (ongoing pruning, thoughtful thorns) but conceptual rather than a dramatized forfeiture, which keeps this just below the indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" appears three times: describing the postcard's heat ("shyly unstoppable as a sprout cracking stone"), the wind's action ("shyly unstoppable, tugging the wind to duty"), and the protagonist's final self-description ("I go on writing, shyly unstoppable"). The phrase is signaled early and returns to charge the closure image, creating a lyric bracket. It characterizes the protagonist's persistence and the postcard's subtle power, enabling the lullaby's transmission. However, the trait's constraint or tradeoff is not dramatized—no moment where shyness costs time or where unstoppability forecloses a gentler path. The phrase functions more as thematic label than as a visible force shaping choices under pressure. Setup and payoff gates are met (early appearance, final reprise), but middle development is absent. The lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (the poet's ongoing work mirrors the postcard's initial charge), which allows the score to reach the "shapes one key turn" band via the resonance allowance. Swappability is moderate; "quiet persistence" or "gentle force" could substitute without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears once: "Before leaving, I ensconce the galaxy postcard in the pocket above my heart." The action signals the postcard's importance and its proximity to the protagonist during the journey and negotiation. However, no major turn traces specifically to the ensconcing—the postcard is later raised and used, but those beats do not depend on the placement gesture itself. The action could be replaced with "tuck," "slide," or "place" with minimal edit, indicating moderate swappability. Setup gate is met (first third), and the action primes the postcard's later use, but it does not constrain a middle choice or appear at closure. The verb's specificity ("ensconce" suggests protective care) adds texture but does not alter tactics or outcome. No visible cost is tied to this action. Score trends toward the lower end of "functional but replaceable" because the action is present and logically sound, yet it lacks causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is introduced by the postcard's voice ("Meet them at the Spiral Choir, it said, via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind") and executed on the page: "I start the lullaby, though my pitch is crooked as a crab path. / The song threads the corridor, shyly unstoppable, tugging the wind to duty... The wind carries my half-sung notes to balconies where wounded leaves hide... The wind buries the hush deep, then brings us voices from farther rooms." The method's mechanics matter—the lullaby summons and persuades the blossoms, and the wind's role as carrier shapes the negotiation's reach. The off-key quality ("crooked as a crab path") is dramatized and becomes a strength (honest rather than polished), aligning with the protagonist's voice. Setup, development (singing sequence), and payoff (voices arrive, treaty is written) gates are all met. The method is causally active and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the negotiation's means. Cost is implied (the vulnerability of singing imperfectly) but not a visible forfeiture. The method drives at least two beats (instruction, execution) and shapes the ending's success, placing it in the "essential across beats" band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is established immediately ("inside the gargantuan shell we call home") and recurs throughout: walls that remember, stairs spiraling past murals, the antechamber with the Guard, the Spiral Choir's acoustics, water clicking the outer ribs, and the shell adjusting its posture at closure. The setting provides spatial structure (journey down → antechamber → Choir) and supplies resources (acoustics that "bow like trees," moss that sings, vents where anemones hush). The shell's "breathing" at the end mirrors the protagonist's loosened insomnia, charging the final image. Setup, development (spatial progression constrains the journey), and payoff (shell breathes, postcard constellations breathe) gates are all met. However, the setting does not force a specific tactical choice—no moment where a blocked corridor or unstable room alters the plan. The shell functions more as atmospheric container and thematic mirror than as active pressure. The closure linkage (breathing shell) is strong but metaphoric rather than causal, which keeps this in the "shapes one key turn" band rather than "essential across beats."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" appears in the opening: "They remember the ache that lasted across centuries of longing. / That ache is why I cannot sleep, and why I write." The timeframe establishes the depth of the faction war and the protagonist's inherited burden, framing the armistice's stakes (ending a conflict that has persisted for generations). However, the centuries operate as backstory rather than a live clock—no on-page moment where the duration tightens a decision or alters tactics. The phrase reappears implicitly in the closure ("ache becomes music") but does not constrain the negotiation's tempo or outcome. The timeframe is thematically present (historical memory shapes the blossoms' distrust and the need for the armistice) but not a pressure that changes choices. Setup gate is met (early signal), but middle development and closure participation are absent. The element functions as context rather than constraint, placing it in the "functional but replaceable" band. If the conflict were framed as "decades" or "generations," structural impact would be minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated early: "My motive is simple and ferocious, to photosynthesize pain into beauty. / I drink the dark and exhale petals, or try to." It drives the protagonist's role as poet-negotiator and is dramatized through the lullaby's function (singing history "not pretty, but honest, and stitch it with wishes"). The motive recurs at closure: "the ache becomes music, and music becomes food... I go on writing... because joy is a reef with shadows," which reweights the initial statement with earned complexity (beauty does not erase pain; joy carries shadows). Setup and payoff gates are met. Middle development is present (the lullaby enacts the motive), but friction between want and cost is understated—no moment where the attempt to beautify fails or where the cost of transformation is dramatized as a visible forfeiture. The motivation shapes the armistice's means (song, not force) and charges the final image, placing it in the "shapes one key turn" band. However, the initial statement edges toward thematic echo, and the dramatization, while present, lacks a torn choice that would push into "essential across beats."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears in the closing line: "I go on writing, shyly unstoppable, because joy is a reef with shadows." The phrase names the tone retrospectively and charges the final image by acknowledging complexity (joy coexists with shadow, armistice with ongoing vigilance). Throughout, the piece sustains a lyric, melancholic yet hopeful register: longing and insomnia tempered by small victories (buds hold, children run splashing, insomnia loosens). Tone modulates appropriately—quiet determination in the opening, cautious negotiation at the Choir, tentative relief at closure. However, the tone is more stable than dynamic; no sharp pivot mirrors the escalation. The reef-shadow image is memorable and thematically apt, but it arrives only at the end, so setup and middle development gates are not met. The phrase's closure participation is strong (it reweights the entire armistice by naming the persistence of difficulty), and the tone's coherence supports the accumulative lens. The late introduction and lack of earlier tonal foreshadowing (no "shadow" imagery before the final line) keep this in the "shapes one key turn" band via the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
