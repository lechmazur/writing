<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chaplain's interior life is richly drawn through contradictory impulses—wanting to help Hector while wrestling with whether mercy can be earned. Embodied emotion appears in concrete moments: "hands that quivered but did not excuse itself," the watching for "small bright changes." The apprenticeship plan demonstrates a meaningful choice that forecloses simple advocacy with visible cost (time, reputation risk). Minor slip: Mara's interiority occasionally blurs into the chaplain's perceptual register without clear motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the chaplain crystallizes a plan (apprenticeship, proceeds to counseling, letters without claiming forgiveness) that reconfigures the parole question from abstract mercy to concrete action with legible cost—Hector's labor over time, the chaplain's professional stake. The drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: the broken heart → repair → melody → apprenticeship plan forms a motivated chain. Orientation is clean by the opening beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the heart's repair becomes the template for the board proposal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shop's "drawers of tiny screws and velveted gears" and the ballerina spring supply concrete constraint—repair requires specific parts and steady hands. Rain "ticked the windows like patient fingertips" anchors sensory hierarchy and modulates with pressure. The clockwork heart as micro-setting charges the final image when its ticking becomes the model for sustained work. Spatial choreography remains clear. Dock for minor generic atmospherics: "vibrant hush" repeats without evolving function mid-story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: can the chaplain offer the parole board more than words? Pressure tightens through one meaningful turn—the heart's repair demonstrates that "the first sound is only intention," prompting the apprenticeship structure that transforms apology into measurable deeds. Agency is clear: the chaplain's decision to arrange remote work forecloses simple advocacy and commits time/reputation. Cost is visible: the plan requires sustained coordination and exposes the chaplain to failure if Hector relapses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mercy versus trust, intention versus action, encoded in the clockwork heart that "broke in transit" and requires repair to function. The ending offers a resonant answer—"machines need second opinions, because the first sound is only intention"—that reweights the opening question without moralizing. Subtext operates in Mara's question "how do you decide on a person, when all the songs they played before were knives" and the chaplain's oblique answer via storm-cloud metaphor. Minor slip: "apology has learned to walk" edges toward overt thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: chaplain's lens filters through moral calculus ("mercy is not earned, but we still must deserve trust") and liturgical rhythm. Diction remains consistent—"aptly deliberate," "vibrant hush"—though these phrases repeat without evolving tension. Mara's voice is less developed; her speech carries thematic weight but minimal idiolect. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance is stable. Minor register drift: "proceeds would go to support counseling" reads slightly administrative for a reflective beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives at key turns ("Take it"), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. "Vibrant hush" appears three times; the third use adds "like theater lights held before the curtain lifts," which recharges the phrase, but the second mention is decorative. Light scaffold in "I told her about Hector, about the letter"—the "about" stem could vary. No loops or major artifacts touch closure. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of chaplain + music-box repair + parole hearing is specific and non-obvious; the apprenticeship solution feels earned rather than convenient. The clockwork heart as both literal object and thematic vehicle avoids pat symbolism by breaking and requiring expert intervention. Risk-taking in the quiet, work-plan ending rather than courtroom drama lifts the piece. Dock slightly for proximity to redemption-through-craft templates and for the storm-as-emotional-weather motif, which reads familiar despite fresh phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chaplain present throughout; frames the question, delivers Hector's backstory, and makes the pivotal choice to arrange apprenticeship. That decision alters tactics (from abstract advocacy to concrete work-plan) and shapes closure. Three beats: delivery, conversation, plan articulation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clockwork heart handled in four beats: unwrapping, inspection, repair with ballerina spring, final tick and melody. Its broken state creates the problem; repair supplies the metaphor ("second opinions"); the ticking heart models the apprenticeship plan and charges the final image. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Second opinions" shapes stakes explicitly: chaplain seeks validation for his approach, Mara provides it through craft metaphor, and the concept generates the apprenticeship structure (turning repair expertise into sustained proof). Present in opening, middle repair dialogue, and closure line. Causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" applied to Mara's nodding and her gear adjustments; the trait enables steady repair under pressure and models the patience required for Hector's path. Constrains one action (meticulous spring placement) with visible payoff (heart ticks). Mentioned twice; second use is active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Deserve" drives the central question and three turns: whether forgiveness must be deserved, whether trust is deserved via deeds, and the final plan that structures deservingness through measurable work. The chaplain's report hinges on this verb. Swapping it would flatten the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By the way light breaks through storm clouds" appears as the chaplain's answer to Mara's question about deciding on a person. It provides the evaluative method (watching for steady, non-burning change) and is tied to Hector's tutoring and fund work. Present in middle conversation; shapes one key judgment. Could be more causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shop supplies essential resources (ballerina spring, loupe, felt pad, expertise) and spatial intimacy that enables the conversation. Mara's offer to work while listening structures the middle section. The setting's logic (repair requires parts and skill) becomes the apprenticeship model. Three gates met; drives two beats and closure metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"In the calm before realization" describes the storm-thinning moment when both stand silent; the phrase anchors the midpoint pause before the chaplain articulates his plan. Time pressure is implicit (parole hearing "soon") but not live on the page. Timeframe shapes tone more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Turning apology into action is the chaplain's stated goal in the opening third and generates all choices: asking Hector to craft the heart, delivering it for repair, devising the apprenticeship structure. Friction appears in the tension between intention and proof, and in the risk that the girl may reject the gesture. Cost is visible: time, reputation, sustained coordination. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" recurs three times with escalating function: opening atmosphere, midpoint charged pause ("seemed to glow"), and implicit in the final quiet ending. Tone modulates with storm imagery (ticking rain, thinning storm, unstitched gutters) and supports the contemplative pressure. Charges the final image through contrast of stillness and mechanical tick. Present across structure; integral to closure mood.</comment>
