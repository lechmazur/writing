<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is poetic and specific ("chalking curves along the skirting as if tracing veins"), but the internal conflict lacks genuine contradiction—the narrator moves through discovery without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's choice ("She chose the collection over a man stranded on the stairs") provides retrospective tension, but the protagonist's own stakes feel more observational than agonistic. The final renunciation (letting the knocking become a lull) reads as earned by prior material, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Embodied emotion is present but leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("legacy's burden felt lighter") rather than contradictory sensory experience under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (cartographer), where (ivy-veiled passage), and when (after climate shifts) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (film negative, grandmother's diaries, the man's knocking) that culminates in a cadence shift when the narrator "recharted the echo, letting the knocking become a lull." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with compassion): the corridor closes "like healed skin," forecloses the haunting, and the narrator commits to ongoing listening. Cost is felt in the conceptual burden transformed ("lighter when I carried it as listening, not law") and the physical act of humming until the montage dissolves. The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, flooded museum, and fireplace are vividly rendered with economy ("half-burned pages slumped like wilted fins"). The film negative strip functions as micro-setting: it constrains perception ("I held it to my eye and watched the hallway invert its light") and charges the final act when the narrator uses it to hum and soften walls. Sensory selection reflects the narrator's professional filter (echo, reverberation, tiles as topographies). The tiles and corridor architecture directly enable the climactic choice to "rechart the echo," satisfying the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream and whether to keep inherited hurt—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator encounters the man's knocking still drummed in tile. The tightening is meaningful: asking the wall "if it wished to keep the hurt" forecloses the path of passive preservation and forces a compassionate stance. Cost is legible on the page: the narrator hums until the montage dissolves, and the corridor closes, altering the museum's memory. Agency is clear (the narrator's humming and recharting), and escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens. One micro-turn (the wall's sigh loosening glaze) sets up closure without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: legacy as burden versus listening, maps that comfort versus maps that merely record. The film negative and grandmother's choice crystallize the question without stating a thesis. The final image—"Legacy's burden felt lighter when I carried it as listening, not law"—offers a resonant answer rooted in the specific action of recharting the echo. No moralizing; the resonance is earned through the concrete acts of humming, asking, and letting go. The motif of echoes as memory recurs with escalating meaning, and the closure reweights prior material (the man's knocking, the grandmother's sealing doors) without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices sound topology, reverberation blueprints, and emotional textures in architecture. Diction is purposefully lyric ("exhaling a corridor that should not have existed," "tiles swung from flood journals to rehearsals") and remains voice-consistent under pressure. Free indirect reflection anchors in present stimuli (the film strip, the fireplace) and tilts present stance via micro-choices (placing the strip against the mantel, whispering the man's name). No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates intentionally. Rhythm control is strong: longer sentences during discovery, shorter when the narrator acts to release the haunting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "She chose the collection over a man stranded on the stairs" seeds both backstory and moral calculus). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I discovered a fireplace... Inside its throat, half-burned pages" then immediately "I read the museum's memory through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace" restates the same discovery. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "I said... The wall agreed... I stepped inside... I followed... I realized..." clusters identical stems without pattern-teaching. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure causality. No filter-verb stacks or stock metaphors in peak beats, and the final image is propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—cartography of echoes via film negatives and humming—offers a fresh synthesis of memory, climate aftermath, and sensory labor. The grandmother's specific choice (collection over man) transforms inherited-guilt tropes through moral ambiguity without redemption. The turn from mapping-as-recording to mapping-as-mercy is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars (the man's knocking, the wall's sigh). Emotional specificity (the corridor closing "like healed skin") avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its lyric-conceptual frame without retreating to easier realism, and the transformation test holds: changing names and setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in title/opening ("corridor echo cartographer"), shapes the middle choice (using chalk and microphones to trace echoes), and drives the closure decision (recharting the echo to release the man's knocking). The cartographer role is causally active: the profession's tools and methods enable the climactic humming and echo-dissolution. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (inherited from mother), used in two distinct beats: first to see the inverted hallway blueprint, then placed against the mantel while humming to soften walls and speak to the grandmother. Returns with reweighted meaning in the final third: "a lens and a tuning fork" that glimpses the grandmother's choice and enables the narrator to witness the man's face. Charged reprise when rolled and tucked into sleeve, signaling ongoing practice. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all evident.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Named explicitly ("legacy's burden") and shapes the dominant stake: whether to inherit the grandmother's preservation-at-cost or transform it. Appears in opening third, drives the middle discovery (grandmother's notes and the man's knocking), and reweights at closure ("felt lighter when I carried it as listening, not law"). The burden forecloses the path of passive mapping and enables the compassionate choice. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong; specificity moderate (could be made more particular).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stated early ("sensitively perceptive because silence carries more roads than noise") and enables the narrator to hear the childhood whistle and the man's knocking. However, the trait functions mostly as professional aptitude without visible tradeoff or cost; no on-page moment where heightened perception harms or complicates. Present in two beats (childhood hush, man's knocking) but lacks the friction or price that would elevate into higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The action "glimpse" recurs across key beats: glimpsing the inverted blueprint through the film negative, glimpsing the grandmother sealing doors, glimpsing the man's face "as light through water." Each glimpse narrows options and drives the plot forward. The climactic glimpse of the grandmother's choice precipitates the narrator's decision to ask the wall and rechart. Irreplaceability high: the act of seeing-through defines the cartographer's method. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled in first third ("I discovered a fireplace... half-burned pages"), and the diaries' mechanics matter: they name the narrator as heir, describe the hum-and-negative experiment, and reveal the grandmother's choice. The method enables both the backstory discovery and the tactical humming that dissolves the echo. Present in three beats (discovery, reading, application), shapes middle attempts, and informs closure. Causal pressure and specificity strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames entry and exit, and the study/fireplace supplies the diaries. The corridor behind the study is where the climactic recharting occurs. Setting constrains access (gate groans, ivy as threshold) and the tiles function as memory-storage that the narrator must navigate. Present in opening, middle (corridor opens), and ending (narrator walks back through passage). Causal participation clear but micro-setting (film strip, tiles) does more tactical work than the passage itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Named early ("after the climate shifts") and provides context for the drowned museum and levee failures. The timeframe explains the ivy overgrowth and the grandmother's pre-flood choices. However, the climate shift does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock; it functions as static backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in two beats (opening frame, narrator's explanation to the wall) but lacks escalation or cost tied directly to the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly early ("to discover what walls dream about, and what they fear") and drives the entire quest structure. The motivation faces friction when the narrator discovers the grandmother's choice and must decide whether to perpetuate or release inherited hurt. Desire is dramatized in the acts of listening, chalking, and humming. The final choice to let the knocking "become a lull" shows the motivation evolving from curiosity to compassion. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; cost is conceptual (lighter burden) rather than visceral.</comment>
