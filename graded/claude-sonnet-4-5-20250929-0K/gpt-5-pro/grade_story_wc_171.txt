<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiator's interior life is embodied through gesture (furrowed brow, breath shared with prison choirs, reed on tongue) and weighted by explicit past failure (the ambush/clinic trade-off, twenty-seven silenced). The choice to offer silence as bond—"I will speak no more for any army"—carries genuine cost and forecloses a path. Internal contradiction surfaces when the narrator shelves one truth to save another and loses both, then offers breath as collateral in a second high-stakes gamble. Minor slip: the General and Matriarch remain more symbolic than individually distinct, their gestures (charred wrist, white fist) functional but not voice-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ritualized gestures (water from both banks, steam, breath-clouds on ebony) accumulate pressure toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors cleanly within the first ~15% (ancient terrace, midsummer, negotiator role, two delegations). The closure unit—signing with breath-clouds, leaving the clipboard as seal—reconfigures the accord into shared witness with felt cost (the narrator's vow of silence if peace fails). One meaningful deepening occurs when the General names the ambush and the Matriarch her aunt's death, narrowing emotional terrain before the vow. Cost is legible: the reed as hinge and the public forfeiture of voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace (warm stones, cracked balustrades, lichened bowls) constrains the ritual's staging and charges the ending ("the terrace altar," "the night can press its own seal"). The bowl of river water and the ebony clipboard function as micro-setting tools that alter tactics (steam braiding air, breath-clouds on wood). Sensory selection is purposeful: salt banners, ember shawls, charred scar tissue, and the faint planetary ring filter through a negotiator's lens trained to "adjust a distance without announcing why." Spatial choreography is clean (western edge, stools exchanged, knees knocking). The midsummer celestial dance frames urgency without mechanical countdown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—anchor ideals before the alignment closes—is signaled early and tightens when the General demands the price of the narrator's past ambush. The choice to place a reed across the tongue (vocal forfeiture if accord fails) is protagonist-driven and narrows future options with on-page cost. One meaningful deepening: the Matriarch's recognition of her aunt among the twenty-seven reweights the General's question from abstract to relational. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is modest—ritual gestures accumulate rather than reverse—so the story sits in strong-but-not-exceptional band for this category.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of price (the ambush, the twenty-seven, the reed vow) and redemption's ongoing ledger ("interest gathers in shadows I still visit," "weight remains remembered"). The final image—clipboard left on the terrace, dawn conditional on human survival, weight remembered—offers a non-literal answer to the cost question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: knees knocking as families begin, stools exchanged for swords, breath unowned. The piece avoids thematic echo; "the price of redemption is not paid in one coin" is close but embedded in scene pressure rather than final-paragraph summary. Resonance is particularized through objects (ebony, reed, river water) that shift meaning across beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the negotiator's trained attention to "adjust a distance," the vocabulary of vows and ledgers, and the self-aware admission of shelved truths. Diction is elevated and consistent ("operatively gentle," "muster," "ledger," "seam," "hinge") but occasionally slips into abstract register ("ritual significance," "thread our intentions into the world's quieter memory") that risks workshop-speak. Dialogue is absent; all speech is indirect summary ("The General wants guarantees and the Matriarch wants grace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the ambush confession. Minor deduction: some stems recur ("I ask," "I set," "I tell") in the middle third, creating mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("breath-clouds pressed to the wood, leaving ghost ovals that overlap like small continents," "the terrace…its cracked rail a smile missing teeth") and occasionally muddles clarity under pressure—"steam braid the air" compresses syntax awkwardly, and "breath rattles around the reed like a sparrow in a bell" stacks metaphor on metaphor in the closure beat. Template stems appear in beats 10–20 ("I ask…I ask…I speak…I tell…I set") applying −0.4. Mixed vehicle: "alignment has a seam…the seam will close like a wound" conflates spatial and medical images. Information density is strong elsewhere (each ritual gesture advances pressure), and no paraphrase loops obscure causality. Propulsion is steady but figurative load slows peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of ritual peacemaking, celestial timeframe, and embodied vow (reed on tongue) offers a fresh angle on negotiator-as-witness archetypes. Specific details—salt banners meet ember shawls, breath-clouds on ebony, charred scar tissue bright as lacquer—ground the frame in sensory particulars rather than generic symbols. The turn (General names the ambush; Matriarch her aunt) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in diction and structure (accumulative ritual beats, no dialogue, lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure effect. Minor deduction: the premise (flawed negotiator seeks redemption through high-stakes accord) is recognizable; transformation through tactile ritual and vocal forfeiture lifts it but does not fully escape template familiarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forever-war peace negotiator is present from line 4, frames expectation (+0.6), drives three distinct beats (marshaling delegations, naming the ambush cost, offering the reed vow) (+1.4), and shapes the closure when the clipboard is left as seal and the narrator's voice is wagered (+1.4). The role constrains tactics (trained gentleness, breath as bond) and the past failure (ambush/clinic) supplies causal pressure. Cost is visible: vocal forfeiture if accord fails. Specificity is high; the role is irreplaceable in this story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in line 3, is used in three beats (ink dries slow to remember weight, catches steam sheen to smell of tide, drinks breath-cloud signatures) (+1.4), and is left on the terrace altar as the closure seal (+1.6). Its smooth black face and ability to "drink" marks give it unique material properties that matter (+0.6). Causal pressure: the clipboard's presence shapes the signing ritual and its abandonment signals trust in the terrace's witness. Strong integration; removal would break the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The price of redemption is named explicitly in line 12 and again when the General asks for it in line 26, framing expectation (+0.5). It shapes the narrator's choice to offer vocal forfeiture (line 29–31) as the cost for past failure, enabling the accord (+1.2). The concept charges the closure: "we paid to walk lighter, and that weight remains remembered" (+1.0). Causal pressure is clear; the concept constrains the negotiator's options and forecloses the path of continued advocacy if peace fails (+0.8). Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement in line 12 risking workshop-speak, but the concept is dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears in line 5 as a descriptor of the narrator's hands, trained to "adjust a distance without announcing why." It enables one on-page action (setting the bowl of river water, asking for open hands) and constrains tone (no coercion, ritual rather than threat) (+0.8). The trait is signaled early (+0.4) and present implicitly in the closure (leaving the clipboard rather than enforcing terms). Cost connection is modest: the gentleness aligns with the vow but does not visibly trade off against another impulse. Swappability is moderate; "careful" or "trained" could substitute with minor tonal shift (−0.5). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: line 8 (muster the delegations by the western edge) and line 36 (muster a last request). The first use frames the gathering and enables the ritual's spatial setup (+0.9); the second marks the final beat before the accord is sealed (+0.7). The action is signaled early (+0.5) and shapes two beats. Causal pressure: mustering the delegations is the necessary condition for the negotiation; the final muster closes the tactical loop. Swappability is low for the first use (the term carries military/formal weight fitting the negotiator's role) but moderate for the second (−0.3). Strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through ritual significance" is named in line 14 and again in line 31, framing the method early (+0.6). The mechanics matter: water from both banks, steam, breath as bond, reed as hinge, breath-clouds as signature—each step is dramatized (+1.6). The method shapes three beats (bowl/steam, reed vow, signing) and charges the closure (clipboard left as altar seal) (+1.8). Causal pressure: the ritual's tactile steps enable the accord and distinguish this negotiation from prior failures. Specificity is high; removing the ritual would collapse the story's logic. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is anchored in line 1, supplies the warm stones and cracked balustrades that embody "flawed beauty," and provides the altar where the clipboard is left (+1.2). The western edge (line 8) and the terrace's lean (line 34) give spatial texture. The midsummer timing and celestial alignment create urgency ("if we miss it, the seam will close") (+0.8). The setting shapes two beats (staging the ritual, sealing the accord) and charges the final image (the terrace as witness) (+1.4). Causal pressure is moderate; the terrace enables rather than constrains. Strong presence but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears in lines 2, 34, and implicitly throughout as "midsummer" and "alignment." The timeframe is signaled early (+0.5) and creates a legible deadline ("if we miss it, the seam will close") (+0.6). It shapes one beat (the urgency to anchor ideals before the alignment closes) and is present in the closure (planetary ring appears as the accord is signed) (+1.0). Causal pressure is modest; the celestial dance frames rather than tightens tactics. Time is more atmospheric than mechanically urgent (−0.4). Functional but replaceable with another deadline device (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is stated in line 6 as the narrator's motive, framing expectation (+0.6). The desire is dramatized in three beats: setting terms (resettlements, wells, schools), confronting the ambush cost, and offering the reed vow (+1.4). Friction between the ideal and the cost is clear: the narrator must wager voice to secure the accord (+1.2). The motivation shapes the closure (leaving the clipboard to be sealed by night, "paid to walk lighter") (+1.0). Causal pressure is strong; the motive constrains choices and forecloses the path of continued advocacy if peace fails. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is named in line 7 and embodied throughout: cracked balustrades, lichened bowls, charred scar tissue, the terrace's "smile missing teeth." The tone modulates with pressure (heavy motive, breath as bond, knees knocking as families begin) and charges the final image ("if dawn finds us human, let it be known we paid to walk lighter, and that weight remains remembered") (+1.6). The tone coheres across all beats, from opening warmth to closure's conditional hope. It is irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on beauty coexisting with damage. Strong specificity and closure linkage lift it into high band.</comment>
