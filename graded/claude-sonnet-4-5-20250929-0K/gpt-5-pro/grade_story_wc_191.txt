<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maris is given clear interiority and a distinct role, but her moment-to-moment choices feel reactive rather than genuinely conflicted. The grandmother backstory provides texture but doesn't create on-page friction between competing impulses. The final act—placing her palm on the radio throne—arrives without visible struggle or cost, making the character arc feel complete by declaration rather than earned transformation. No embodied contradictions act simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (waterfall, orchard, murals, ruby flake) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration when Maris places her palm and "stewardship began." The cost is conceptual—accepting a responsibility rather than claiming dominance—and the final image reweights the throne premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the murals reveal ancestors who hesitated, shifting the throne from object to distributed responsibility. Closure lands on the page with felt cost, though the causality between individual beats (scanner → coordinates → root-room → stairway) relies more on accumulative mystery than because/therefore pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard, waterfall, and root-room are vividly rendered with distinct sensory texture: "colors tasted like childhood circuitry," "ozone and apples," sap veins pulsing with coordinates. The ruby flake functions as both tool and micro-setting element, warming to guide Maris and constraining her path. The environment directly enables the climax: the platform rises through the trunk, the aperture opens, and the throne materializes as "a radio made of rain." Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (through waterfall, rows of trunks, root-room crawl, platform ascent). The setting charges the final image without devolving into postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise or lose the throne to algorithms—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through the flake's warmth guidance, the drone's countdown, and the mural reveals, creating one meaningful tightening when Maris must trust "the mural that is still remembering you" and crawl into the root-room. The escalation fits the Accumulative lens: density increases rather than causal reversals. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; Maris proceeds without trade-offs or tactical alterations. The final cost—accepting stewardship—is conceptual but not dramatized as a choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the unclaimed throne becomes a question of stewardship versus possession, "claiming could mean stewardship…spread across a chorus like seeds." The final image—palm on rain-radio, dawn answering—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Grandmother's cassettes as prayer flags, the paint-layer method, and the ancestors' hesitation all build the theme through concrete objects and actions. The piece resists a tidy moral, embracing complexity in "tending" as bravery and the throne as distributed responsibility. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph; the conceptual repricing lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "colors tasted like childhood circuitry," "knees learned again how to bow," "dawn answered." Diction and rhythm reflect Maris's lore-keeper lens, blending archaic phrasing ("made my sally") with speculative texture. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, peak-pressure moments (the final climb, palm placement) compress into summary rather than embodied micro-choices, softening immediacy. The drone dialogue ("I told it to hush") and orchard's clipped syllables work as voice-motivated deviation. Psychic distance is controlled, and the vocabulary stays within the narrator's plausible lexicon throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "ruby flake…shard of heat-fused sand," "throne…a radio made of rain." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is strong across beats. However, multiple lines repeat conceptual content without adding pressure: "the orchard spoke…Go…sally to the root-room" paraphrases the prior flake guidance, and "stewardship began where the unclaimed throne listened" restates the conceptual shift already shown. Template cadence appears in mid-section description: "I set…I pressed…I climbed" across adjacent beats. No paraphrase loops touch the closure image, capping deduction at −0.4. Syntax and openings vary; no filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lore-keeper role, paint-archaeology method, and throne-as-stewardship premise feels purposeful and non-obvious. The "radio made of rain" image is memorable, and the grandmother's cassettes-as-prayer-flags detail is specific. However, the quest structure (magical object → guide → threshold → ascent → prize) follows a familiar template without transformation through character friction or moral calculus. The futuristic-nostalgia tone and Transit Archives worldbuilding add freshness, but the plot could function with different names and setting elements. No close echoes of famous lines; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maris is present throughout and her role as lore keeper frames the quest. She makes procedural decisions (gather toolkit, use scanner, follow coordinates, crawl into root-room, climb), but none create a key turn with visible cost. The trait "stubborn about memory" is asserted but not tested on the page. Her final choice—placing her palm—is the only moment that could alter trajectory, reaching the closure gate minimally. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but low causal pressure −0.6 and swappable with "archivist" or "seeker" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears early (paragraph 8), is handled in the scanner beat (paragraph 17), warms to guide (paragraph 22), and is placed in the platform cup (paragraph 28), reaching three distinct beats. It constrains Maris's path by providing coordinates and enabling the platform's rise. However, its mechanics are described rather than dramatized under pressure, and it could be swapped for any warmth-sensing guide device. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.6, ornamental use in middle beats −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is named in paragraph 5, drives the dominant stake ("until sunrise…or the unclaimed throne would fall to algorithms"), reappears in the murals (paragraph 20), and is realized in the final image as the rain-radio where "stewardship began." It shapes tactics throughout and is causally active at closure. The conceptual repricing—throne as distributed responsibility—emerges from prior particulars. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5, no major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is asserted in paragraph 3 but never tested or constrained on the page. Maris's actions (walking through the waterfall, using the scanner, crawling into the root-room) read as procedural rather than risky or wise. No on-page tradeoff shows the trait enabling or constraining a choice. Label-only −0.7, no beat involvement −0.6, no cost connection −0.6, swappability −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sally" is named in paragraph 8 and paragraph 25 ("Go, sally to the root-room"), framing the journey but not creating a turn. The action is easily swappable with "depart" or "journey" without structural loss. It does not redefine options or narrow tactics; the quest proceeds regardless of the term. Present in two moments +0.6, setup signal +0.4, but swappability −0.7, ornamental use −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The paint-layer method is signaled in paragraph 16 ("through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals"), executed in paragraph 17 (hand-cranked scanner shaving color), and pays off when the murals show the woman with grandmother's hair and the glowing step (paragraphs 18–20). It enables the coordinates that guide Maris to the root-room. The mechanics matter and shape the middle attempt. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.5, but no closure linkage −0.4, late full use (second third) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hidden orchard is present from paragraph 2, provides the paint-layered trunks (paragraph 15), houses the root-room (paragraph 26), and supplies the platform that rises through the trunk to the aperture (paragraph 28). The waterfall is the threshold Maris crosses (paragraph 13) and the throat into which the stairway climbs (paragraph 31). Both locations constrain movement and enable the climax. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, no major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is named in paragraph 5 and visualized by the drone countdown (paragraph 19: "until sunrise, until sunrise, until"). However, time is never tracked tactically; no choice is tightened by the clock running out, and the ending arrives with "dawn answered" (paragraph 33) without showing urgency or trade-off. The timeframe is present but does not alter moves. Setup +0.6, two mentions +0.6, but no causal pressure −0.8, no cost connection −0.6, ornamental middle use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Finding the stairway of ascension is named in paragraph 5, drives Maris's procedural choices (scanner, murals, root-room, climb), and is realized when she reaches the platform and throne (paragraphs 28–33). The motivation is present across beats and shapes the ending. However, it is never conflicted or tested against a competing want; Maris proceeds without friction between desire and cost. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but no dramatized friction −0.8, told more than conflicted −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia coheres through "cassettes like prayer flags," "old radio songs," "antique ears," "before the city learned to monitor dreams," and the throne as "a radio made of rain." Tone remains stable across turns and modulates with the final image, which fuses past (radio, rain, grandmother's legacy) and future (algorithms, drones, Transit Archives). The effect charges closure by reweighting the premise. Present throughout +0.8, coherence across beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, no static mood issue, but no sharp pressure modulation −0.4.</comment>
