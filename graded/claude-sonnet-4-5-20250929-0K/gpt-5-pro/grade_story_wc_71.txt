<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—listening for "displaced objects" and "small attire of misplacement"—and their ritualistic approach (orris root, vial of hush) grounds motivation in action. However, the character lacks genuine internal conflict or contradiction; the work proceeds smoothly without stakes that test commitment or force a difficult choice. The photo discovery and object repositioning feel more like choreographed tasks than moments that reveal competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present but never contradictory or under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early and accumulates pressure through ritualized object-placement that deepens the house's "conversation." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the house and narrator "agree to keep each other company"), with the orris and hush carried back to the water as a final image. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeit or altered tactic on the page. The orientation is clean, the lens holds, but the closure effect is more tonal shift than legible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blue house, bay, and porch are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (salt wicking air, gulls drawing seams, bottles labeled with "days and winds"). The orris root shard and vial of hush function as micro-setting objects that charge the ritual and final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across rooms. The bay's response to the poured southwester bottle ("pushing a ripple against the pilings") shows environment constraining or echoing action, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not decisively altering a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and pursued through the displacement ritual. Pressure accumulates gently as objects are repositioned and the house "softens," but there is no reversal, tightening choice, or moment where the protagonist's agency forecloses a live option with visible cost. The work proceeds without friction; the narrator never faces a trade-off or complication that narrows tactics. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, but the final "agreement" lacks the felt price or foreclosed path required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—houses as ongoing conversations, attention as a form of care—emerges organically from the ritual of repositioning objects and the final image of mutual company. "Some ideas you have to say to hear them…like tides explaining themselves by returning" risks platitude but is anchored in the narrator's action. The orris/hush motifs recur with shifted meaning at the end, and the piece resists moralizing. However, the ending lacks a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure; it settles into a hushed agreement rather than a resonant repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "creeping normality noticer," "shard of hush…the heavier half of quiet," "streetlights daydream" create a consistent lyric texture. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Diction is purposeful and specific ("orris holds the ghosts of violets and paper"), though occasional lines ("inadvertently profound, like tides explaining themselves") edge toward self-aware poeticism that slightly undercuts immersion. Psychic distance and perceptual signature (attention to misplacement) are cleanly maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. However, several lines loop conceptually: "not absence but a presence that crouches" is restated as "the heavier half of quiet," and "houses are conversations that keep going" is echoed in "every displaced cup is a raised hand." Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that tightens pressure. "Inadvertently profound" in the tides line reads as self-label rather than earned insight. Clarity remains high, but momentum occasionally stalls under decorative phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—sanctifying a house through displaced objects and perfumer's ritual—offers a fresh synthesis of domestic care and spiritual practice. The orris root and "shard of hush" are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (house feels posed → house softens → mutual agreement) is linear and tidy, lacking a turn or complication that would deepen risk. The weather-collecting bottles and photo are vivid details but do not transform the trajectory. The piece commits to its vision but plays safely within that frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" character frames the entire narrative and performs the object-displacement ritual across multiple beats (kitchen, upstairs, porch). Setup is immediate, development spans the middle (repositioning bowl, chair, dresser), and the character's action shapes the ending image (carrying orris and hush back to the water). However, observation dominates over decision; no key turn hinges on a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character enacts a process rather than confronting a dilemma. Causal role is present but replaceable with a similar ritualist archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in setup (placed on the sill), returns in the middle when "salt wicks…pulling the scent of old lilies from the orris root shard," is set beside the photo, and is carried back to the water at the end. It anchors the ritual and charges the final image with its "ghosts of violets and paper." However, its use does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a functional tool whose properties shape the protagonist's moves under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is introduced early (the vial on the sill), explained as "the heavier half of quiet…a presence that crouches," and returns in two beats: it "thickens, then thins, then settles" after the southwester is poured, and is carried back at the end. The concept shapes tone and the ritual's stakes (sanctifying through silence), but it does not change a tactical decision or narrow options on the page. It functions more as a thematic motif than a mechanic that alters choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once in the line "Some ideas you have to say to hear them, and when you do they are inadvertently profound, like tides explaining themselves by returning." It is a label-only attribution that does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost. The narrator's insights (houses as conversations, tides as self-explanation) are offered without friction or tradeoff. The trait is ornamental rather than a driver of consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is signaled early ("I sanctify the path each thing suggests"), enacted across multiple beats (placing bowl in sunmark, closing drawer, easing chair, setting photo by orris and hush), and the ending references the house being "sanctified enough to forgive." The ritual structure hinges on this action. However, the sanctification is smooth and unchallenged; no beat turns because the act of sanctifying fails or costs the narrator a visible price. The action is essential to structure but does not redefine options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is introduced immediately ("I read the house through displaced objects"), demonstrated across beats (bowl left of sunmark, chair turned toward door, dresser drawer open, latch pointing to water), and the method directly shapes the protagonist's moves: repositioning objects is the work itself. The mechanics are clear and the method is irreplaceable to the ritual. However, the method does not narrow options or introduce a complication; it proceeds as taught without friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is anchored early, recurs in sensory detail (gulls, waves, pilings, ripple), and the bay "listens" and "answers" when the southwester is poured. The porch, crate of bottles, and yard integrate the setting into action. However, the bay does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it provides atmosphere and lyric echo rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (the house's rooms) does more causal work than the bay itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" opens and closes the story, marking a liminal time (dusk/evening). The frame is poetic but does not create a ticking clock or urgency. The narrator moves through the house at a contemplative pace with no time pressure tightening decisions. The timeframe is consistent and sets tone, but it does not alter tactics or narrow options; the ritual could unfold at any hour with the same outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated early and drives the entire ritual: the narrator listens, repositions, observes the house's response. The desire is pursued on the page through object work and the final realization ("we have agreed to keep each other company"). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested by a competing want or cost. The narrator's inquiry succeeds smoothly without a moment where understanding requires a trade-off or faces friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is invoked early ("a hushed blaze inside my ribs"), echoed midpoint ("not a blaze but a hush that burns inward"), and the final image carries the narrator and objects "back toward the water" with quiet intensity. Tone is coherent and modulates slightly as the house warms. However, the tone remains static in its lyricism; it does not sharpen or break under pressure, and the final image sustains rather than charges the mood with a new cost or reversal.</comment>
