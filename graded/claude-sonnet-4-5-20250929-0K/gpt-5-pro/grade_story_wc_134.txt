<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clairvoyant narrator exhibits consistent internal contradiction ("didn't see it coming") and embodied interiority ("my uncertainty rings like a bowl, sweet and alarming"). The pilgrim's agency at closure—nodding to invite the shadow into the vowel—feels earned by prior material and forecloses a path with visible cost (the shadow becomes resident). Minor: the pilgrim's trait of "traveled here through overlapping shadows" remains ornamental; no embodied emotion contradicts their smooth cooperation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of "everyday magic" magnification builds through cave pearl → organ nest → vowel hum → shadow inhabitance, each deepening the resonance until the final act (inviting the shadow into the syllable) reconfigures the premise with felt cost: the vowel "deepens, not heavier, but kinder." Orientation anchors by ~80 words (pilgrim arrives, clairvoyant guide, musical cave). One meaningful tightening occurs when the listening shadow requests a home, narrowing options to accept or refuse. Cost is legible: the shadow becomes "resident instead of rumor," altering the vowel's weight. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the transformed relationship between sound, shadow, and everyday objects with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cave's sonic properties constrain every choice: the organ of stalactites receives the pearl, the vowel's resonance "chooses a path," and the final tone "lands" to settle the unseen forces. Micro-setting (the hollow where rain used to dream) charges the closure beat by housing the pearl that spins and centers the tone. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: sound dominates, filtered through the clairvoyant's professional lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (under crown of stalactites, beside the pilgrim, vowel walking away and returning).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: teaching seekers to hear the common world ring with hidden metals, tested when the pilgrim asks the clairvoyant to place the pearl and then hum together. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shadow requests to inhabit the vowel, forcing a choice with visible cost (the vowel deepens, the shadow becomes resident). Agency is collaborative but protagonist-owned: the clairvoyant must choose to invite the shadow, and "my uncertainty rings" shows the weight of that decision. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: density increases from cave pearl → organ nest → vowel hum → shadow inhabitance, each beat reweighting the stake of magnifying everyday magic. Minor: the shadow's request feels slightly convenient timing rather than inevitable from prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—everyday magic magnified until the ordinary becomes liturgy—emerges organically from the cave pearl's placement, the kitchen-noise choir (spoons, brooms, slippers), and the final list (doorknob, teacup, traffic, pencil). The closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the shadow "becomes a resident instead of a rumor," reweighting the premise that unseen forces can be domesticated through patient attention. Subtext operates in the clairvoyant's self-aware irony ("funny only if you have never listened to quartz laugh") and the shadow's silent request (reweaving outlines, soft tug). No moralizing; the sweeping-child promise grounds the abstraction in a concrete human gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "the song of the walls bows like a choir greeting a new frequency," "my question comes back like gulls returning, beaks bright with small reflections." Purposeful compression and patterned elision (e.g., "a soft subtraction where light should be") are taught early and charge the closure image. Free indirect style remains clean; psychic distance is stable. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext: "They say their name like a bell dipped in water" embodies rather than reports. Register is consistent and voice-motivated; no filter-verb stacks. Diction under pressure ("sweet and alarming," "the vowel deepen") supports rather than obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and the stake. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "I explain that unseen forces inhabit…" followed by "Still, the cave keeps itself steadily unpredictable" restates mood without added pressure. "They say they promised… / That promise aligns…" loops the promise concept. In the closure sequence, runs of short clauses ("We hum, and the sound walks away… then returns… The thresh of ordinary life has become…") create slight monotony. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6) for loops and template cadence across multiple beats, though none touch the final image directly. No figurative muddle; metaphors remain coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of musical cave + shadow that listens + everyday-magic magnification feels specific and earned. The turn when the shadow requests to inhabit the vowel rather than continue haunting is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars (overlapping shadows, the vowel's resonance, the pilgrim's promise). The closing list (doorknob, teacup, traffic, pencil) transforms the sweeping-child promise into a liturgy, avoiding generic uplift. Minor: the "listening shadow" trope is familiar from fantasy templates, but the story personalizes it through the clairvoyant's ironic self-awareness and the vocalized inhabitance mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: clairvoyant present from opening. Development: the clairvoyant's choice to place the pearl in the organ constrains the next beat (walls ring with kitchen noises). Payoff: the clairvoyant's decision to hum and invite the shadow into the vowel is the closure action. Causal pressure: the clairvoyant's role as guide enables the pilgrim's request and the shadow's arrival; "my uncertainty rings" shows cost. Two distinct beats (pearl placement, vowel invitation) and closure linkage. Cost is visible ("uncertainty rings," the vowel deepens with the shadow as resident). Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, and cost connection present. Band guidance suggests ≥6.0 eligibility with all three gates; causal pressure and cost lift toward 7.0 range. Minor friction: the clairvoyant's "didn't see it coming" trait is more thematic label than on-page constraint (−0.3). Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: cave pearl introduced early ("The pilgrim carries a pouch with a cave pearl"). Development: pilgrim asks the clairvoyant to place it in the organ; the clairvoyant does so, and walls ring with kitchen noises—this beat narrows options and drives the next turn. Payoff: "the cave pearl spins in its nest, centering the tone" during the vowel hum and shadow invitation; it shapes the closure image by anchoring the resonance. Causal pressure: placement enables the magnification and the shadow's request. Three beats (introduction, placement, spinning at closure). Specificity: "smooth sphere birthed by patient drops, the color of clouded milk" and "warmed to their palm" make it irreplaceable. Cost connection: the pearl's centering action is integral to the shadow's inhabitance. Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure linkage, specificity, and cost connection all present. Positive guidance totals ~+4.0 to +4.5 range; no meaningful frictions. Band guidance suggests ≥8.0 eligibility. Final: 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "unseen forces inhabit the draperies and organs of crystal" by second paragraph. Development: unseen forces "gather like dew on glass" when the pilgrim and cave learn each other; they "crest and settle, accompanying our list with harmonies" during the vowel naming sequence—this constrains the shadow's ability to inhabit the vowel and shapes the closure tactic. Payoff: "the unseen forces crest and settle" just before the tone lands, enabling the shadow to become resident. Causal pressure: the concept dictates that breath can set forces whirling and that the vowel can house the shadow. Two distinct beats (gathering, cresting) and closure participation. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage. Minor friction: the concept often operates as atmospheric premise rather than narrow constraint on specific choices (−0.4). Band guidance suggests ≥6.0 with all gates; causal and closure lift toward 7.0 range. Final: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "the cave keeps itself steadily unpredictable, like a heartbeat that refuses to be tamed by any metronome we carry inside" by sixth paragraph. Development: the attribute is reinforced when the clairvoyant says "I should have foreseen such a request, yet I am still the clairvoyant who didn't see it coming, because some futures refuse to be seen"—this moment justifies the clairvoyant's surprise at the shadow's request and the cave's refusal to be controlled. Payoff: the unpredictability is implied in the final settling ("the cave rests its brightness"), but no specific on-page choice is enabled or constrained by this trait at closure. Causal pressure: the attribute motivates the clairvoyant's uncertainty and the cave's autonomy, which frame the shadow's unexpected request. One clear beat (the clairvoyant's realization of unpredictability when the shadow speaks). Early signal and causal pressure present. Frictions: no direct constraint on a choice at closure (−0.5); the trait functions more as thematic reinforcement than tactical constraint (−0.3). Band guidance with setup + development but weak payoff caps near 6.0; causal link and early signal support mid-5 to low-6 range. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: "inhabit" first appears when the clairvoyant explains that "unseen forces inhabit the draperies and organs of crystal." Development: the shadow "wants a host, or rather a home, because it has followed the pilgrim long and does not wish to haunt anymore. It asks to inhabit the vowel we are humming, to live where breath and meaning meet"—this request is the major turn that defines the closure choice. Payoff: "We…invite the listening shadow to step through overlapping shadows into the syllable we warmed. It arrives…and then all the chimes of the cave forgive the weather for changing"—the act of inviting the shadow to inhabit the vowel is the closure action that redefines the story's stakes and reconfigures the relationship between sound, shadow, and everyday magic. Causal pressure: the action is the hinge of the ending; without it, the closure does not occur. Specificity: inhabiting the vowel (not merely entering the cave or following the pilgrim) is the unique resolution. Cost: the vowel deepens, the shadow becomes resident, and the clairvoyant's uncertainty becomes acceptance. Three beats (forces inhabit crystal, shadow requests to inhabit vowel, shadow inhabits vowel at closure). Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure centrality, high irreplaceability, and visible cost. Positive guidance totals ~+5.0 range. No meaningful frictions. Band guidance suggests ≥8.5 eligibility. Final: 8.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "they traveled here through overlapping shadows cast by village lanterns" introduced early when the pilgrim explains their arrival. Development: the clairvoyant acknowledges "That is a good way in…because the cave's corridors braid shadow upon shadow, and voices lace themselves between the strands"—this establishes that overlapping shadows are the cave's architecture and the method of navigation. Payoff: "We…invite the listening shadow to step through overlapping shadows into the syllable we warmed"—the method reappears at closure as the mechanism by which the shadow inhabits the vowel. Causal pressure: the method shapes the shadow's arrival and the final tactic (stepping through shadows). Specificity: "overlapping shadows" is distinct from generic shadow or darkness. Two beats (arrival explanation, closure invitation) and closure linkage. Early signal, causal pressure, closure participation. Minor friction: the method's mechanics are more asserted than demonstrated with visible constraints on attempts (−0.4). Band guidance with all three gates and closure linkage supports ≥7.0. Final: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "musical crystal cave" in opening line; "the song of the walls bows like a choir greeting a new frequency." Development: the cave's organ of stalactites is the site where the pearl is placed, generating kitchen-noise choir; the cave's acoustics shape the vowel's resonance ("the sound walks away from us…then returns carrying echoes of morning bread and bus doors"). Payoff: the cave's brightness rests at closure, and "all the chimes of the cave forgive the weather for changing"—the setting's sonic properties enable and frame the shadow's inhabitance. Causal pressure: the cave's musical structure dictates tactics (where to place the pearl, how to hum the vowel) and charges the final image. Three beats (initial song, organ placement/choir, vowel resonance/chimes at closure). Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure linkage, specificity (musical properties are irreplaceable), and cost connection (the cave's music is integral to the transformation). Positive guidance totals ~+4.5 range. No meaningful frictions. Band guidance suggests ≥8.0 eligibility. Final: 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: title and opening line "After the pilgrim arrives at the musical crystal cave" establish the timeframe. Development: the arrival frames all subsequent action; "Tonight the pilgrim steps under a crown of stalactites" and "Only after the pilgrim arrives do I notice the faint eclipse" reinforce the post-arrival window. Payoff: the timeframe holds through closure; the sequence from arrival to pearl placement to vowel hum to shadow inhabitance occurs within one continuous visit. Causal pressure: the "after arrival" frame constrains the action to this single encounter and implies the shadow followed the pilgrim here. One lyric beat (the clairvoyant's noticing "only after" the arrival). Early signal and coherent frame. Frictions: the timeframe is a static container rather than a tightening clock that alters moves (−0.6); no urgency or countdown shapes choices (−0.4). Band guidance with setup + weak development + static payoff caps near 6.0; early signal and frame coherence lift slightly. Final: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "My work is to guide seekers through the bright darkness and teach them how stones translate intention into sound. They come to magnify everyday magic, not to conquer anything, but to hear the common world ring with its hidden metals" by third and fourth paragraphs. Development: the pilgrim's promise to the sweeping child ("the sound of sweeping could be a cathedral if listened to from within") dramatizes the motivation and "aligns with the cave's oldest wish, which is not to impress, but to magnify everyday magic until it glows like warm coal"—this alignment shapes the clairvoyant's choice to place the pearl and hum. Payoff: "The thresh of ordinary life has become a choir so luminous…" and the final naming of doorknob, teacup, traffic, pencil fulfill the motivation; "the pilgrim…promises to carry this music back to the sweeping child." Causal pressure: the motivation drives the pearl placement, the vowel hum, and the shadow invitation; each beat tests the commitment to magnifying the everyday. Three beats (cave's wish stated, promise alignment/pearl placement, closure naming and return promise). Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure linkage, and cost (the shadow's inhabitance alters the vowel, charging the everyday liturgy). Minor friction: the motivation is more collaborative desire than internal conflict; the clairvoyant and pilgrim cooperate smoothly without competing wants (−0.5). Band guidance with all three gates and strong closure linkage supports ≥7.0; causal pressure and cost lift toward 7.5–8.0 range; smooth cooperation slightly lowers. Final: 7.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: "guide seekers through the bright darkness" by third paragraph establishes the oxymoronic tone. Development: "In that light, the shadow that listens speaks…by reweaving our outlines…a soft tug" and "The thresh of ordinary life has become a choir so luminous that the dark seems lit from beneath, a perfect bright darkness" reinforce the tone through the accumulation of paradoxes (luminous dark, listening shadow, everyday liturgy). Payoff: "the cave rests its brightness, and the shadow within our vowel becomes a resident instead of a rumor"—the tone charges the final image by sustaining the bright-darkness fusion at closure. Coherence: the tone modulates with pressure (sweet and alarming uncertainty, forgiveness of weather) without breaking. Two distinct beats (clairvoyant's stated tone, closure's "rests its brightness") and closure participation. Early signal, causal coherence, closure linkage. Specificity: "bright darkness" is not generic mood but a precise conceptual paradox that the story enacts through sound, shadow, and everyday objects. Positive guidance totals ~+3.5 range. No meaningful frictions. Band guidance suggests ≥7.0 eligibility; closure charge and specificity lift toward 8.0. Final: 8.0.</comment>
