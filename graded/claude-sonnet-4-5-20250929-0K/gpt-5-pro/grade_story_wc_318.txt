<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The conductor's interior voice is vivid and particular ("urgency tastes like rain"), with contradictory impulses embodied through the devotion/eagerness paradox. Emotions are well-embodied in specific gestures (stroking pull cords "as one strokes a horse"). However, the protagonist remains more cipher than character—no genuine internal conflict emerges, and the work proceeds without visible struggle or cost-driven choice that forecloses a path. The ending renunciation ("I take nothing but the unspoken, and I only borrow that") reads as stated principle rather than earned shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors emerge slowly but cohere by the tunnel descent (~150 words). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): the conductor completes the ritual, leaves the tuning fork, and the family's "possibility" crystallizes as the house "remembered." Cost is visible in the conductor's labor and the deliberate withholding ("never to return it all"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the laughter shifts from "skein, brittle as frost" to "almost his laugh," reweighting the stake. Lens holds cleanly through accumulative density and cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as active constraint: its acoustics shape the ritual, oils of hands "pressed against this world" anchor grief's history, and the space forces tactical choices (blower placement, singing into turbulence). The pull cord handles recur with charged specificity, acting as both tool and somatic anchor. The final night smell ("wet iron and pears, the sort that bruise if you stare too hard") charges the closure image with tenderness and cost. Micro-setting (carburetor, manholes, cold pipes) pressure the method and outcome without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled early and tightens once: the thin laughter "thickening" into the child's laugh wavering "like a candle relighting itself" narrows options from failure to conditional success. Agency reads as devotion and method rather than decision under pressure; the conductor executes a known ritual without visible tradeoff or mistake that alters tactics. The withholding choice ("never to keep more than necessary") is stated principle, not dramatized cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient here, but agency remains procedural.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (grief's necessary incompleteness, laughter earned through shadows) emerges from particulars: the harmonica under the pillow, the conductor's refusal to return all the laughter, the family's "uncertain" stance. The final image—"possibility is the first laugh learning how to breathe"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (glasses chiming, picture frame straightening). One late intrusion: "laughter without its shadows becomes brittle and cuts the mouth that holds it" edges toward thesis statement, though it remains grounded in the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "urgency tastes like rain," "sorrow that makes hair stand even on the sleeping," "pears... tender enough to understand what we had asked of it." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (sensory metaphors, atmospheric precision) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's immediacy: "macerate," "skein," "filament of giggle" read studied rather than lived under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping, and the voice modulates purposefully with ritual intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff structure: "syllables macerate in the wet turbulence," "skein, brittle as frost," "dawn" personified as arrival. In peak beats (tunnel laughter emerging), metaphor stacks without clarifying causal pressure, reducing propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: "the tunnel answered... then thickening" restates the same intensification across two beats without added detail. Template cadence: "I [verb]" stems recur across six consecutive lines mid-ritual. Rhythm and clarity are otherwise strong; information density is high when metaphor recedes. No scaffold or loops outside the noted runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief ritual as sonic restoration via industrial tools—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding mystic cliché through concrete method (leaf blowers, pull cords, carburetor whispering). The tunnel as echo chamber and the family's waiting via hourglass are purposeful, particular choices. Emotional truth (laughter must keep its shadows) coheres with the premise. Risk: the lyric density and extended metaphor could obscure, but closure remains legible. One derivative echo: the "unspoken loosens its jaw" gesture appears in contemporary grief literature. Transformation is evident in occupational specificity and tonal restraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conductor present throughout, makes tactical choices (blower placement, singing syllables, cuing sections, whispering to carburetor), and the final act of leaving the tuning fork completes the ritual arc. Two gates met: setup (first line), development (conducts and adjusts), payoff (leaves payment and departs as laughter begins). Causal pressure moderate: choices execute a known method rather than forging under uncertainty. Closure participation clear but procedural. Band guidance and beat involvement (setup, tunnel work, departure) support mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pull cord handles appear in three distinct beats: waiting "like a small spine" before the ritual, one coughed/sputtered and required whispering to steady, and stroked at departure "as one strokes a horse." Each use advances pressure: acknowledgment of weight, repair under crisis, gratitude. Setup early, development (carburetor crisis), payoff (departure gesture reweights the tool as living partner). Causal and closure linkage strong; the handles' somatic and relational charge is specific. Irreplaceability high within the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" structures every tactic: singing names the family cannot say, macerating syllables until "willing to be held," allowing laughter to rest partly with the tunnel, creating "room" for joy without tripping over the dead. Setup (summoned to restore lost laughter), development (method of carrying syllables on wind, withholding portion), payoff (house "exhaled... what came out was not noise but room"). Shapes stakes and all choices; irreplaceable to closure. Cost visible in labor, devotion, and the conductor's acknowledgment of what must remain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" mentioned once early ("I am mournfully eager then, not out of thrill, but because urgency tastes like rain"), frames affect but does not constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff. Setup present, but no middle development or payoff beat where the attribute alters tactics. Label-only use without embodied cost. Lyric seed without charged return. Band guidance: one touch, no causal pressure, no closure linkage → ~3–4 range; purposeful framing lifts slightly to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Macerate" (letting syllables soften in turbulence) appears once at the ritual's core turn: names "macerate in the wet turbulence until they softened into echoes willing to be held." This beat enables the laughter to emerge and directly shapes the outcome. Setup indirect (method signaled via singing), development (this exact transformation), payoff (laughter thickens and rises). Causal role clear; swapping for "dissolve" or "blend" would dilute the specific violence-then-tenderness the word encodes. One strong beat, closure participation indirect but essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Method appears early ("via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind"), executed mid-ritual ("I sang the names... letting the syllables macerate"), and pays off when "the air carried that shape" and laughter emerges. Setup, development (singing and wind combine to transform grief), payoff (laughter "spilling upward through the manholes"). Causal pressure high: without this exact means, the ritual fails. Mechanics matter (off-key wind as carrier, half-sung to avoid brittleness). Two beats minimum; irreplaceability and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunnel pressures every choice: its acoustics enable the ritual ("drank every footstep and returned it as a colder version"), oils of hands anchor grief's history, curve determines blower placement, manholes channel laughter upward to the house. Setup (family leads conductor there), development (placement, singing, carburetor repair all shaped by space), payoff (tunnel "swallowed its own breathing and slept, keeping a vigil"). Three beats, strong causal constraint, closure participation (final vigil image). Environment indispensable; swapping for generic "basement" breaks logic and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled early ("my work begins after the final grain slips through the hourglass. That is the moment the unspoken loosens its jaw") and frames the ritual's start. Setup clear, but no live clock tightens tactics during the work; the passage of time is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Payoff weak: time does not return or reweight at closure. Two gates (setup, implicit during ritual); no escalation or cost tied to elapsed duration. Lyric framing without middle constraint → mid-6 range per band guidance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation dramatized throughout: conductor's devotion ("trained to drink what others will not"), singing names the family cannot say, requesting air to carry the harmonica's shape, withholding portion of laughter to prevent brittleness. Setup (summoned to restore), development (choices reflect this goal under pressure: whispering to carburetor, cueing sections), payoff (leaves tuning fork, departs as possibility arrives). Friction between want (restore laughter fully) and cost (must withhold to avoid harm) creates visible tradeoff. Three beats, strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone ("true haunting without theatrical cruelty") established early and held: tunnel "opened like a throat rehearsing apologies," "sorrowful pitch which makes hair stand even on the sleeping," laughter "wavering, brave, like a candle relighting itself." Modulates with ritual pressure (off-key wind, thin laughter thickening) and charges the final image: night smells "tender enough to understand what we had asked of it," tunnel "keeping a vigil only echoes know." Coherent through turns, no theatrical excess. Setup, development, payoff all strong; tone inseparable from closure effect.</comment>
