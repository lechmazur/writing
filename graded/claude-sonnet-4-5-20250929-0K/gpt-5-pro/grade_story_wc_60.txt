<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist shows clear internal contradiction—testing everything yet carrying a mystical lantern, fearing becoming his father while following his method—and these contradictions drive the journey. The secret told to the statue ("I feared becoming him") earns the panel's opening through genuine vulnerability. Interiority remains concrete throughout ("the taste of river water and a word half-mouthed") with embodied perception under pressure. Minor deduction for the father memory sequence, which tilts toward summary rather than fully dramatized micro-choice in the present frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the box opens, memories fly out, fountains run, and the protagonist wraps the emptied box "so the city would remember where to look next time"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the cycle with visible cost (the city must find it again). Orientation anchors early: luminous skeptic, city of forgotten fountains, waiting from the pause of geese. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumb trail builds density, sidereal patience deepens the wait, and the constellation-key moment provides the decisive intensification. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Heron star aligns with the statue's shadow, narrowing the method to a single instant. Cost is legible: memories scatter, some orphaned, the protagonist releases his own rather than keeping it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains constrains every choice—dry basins guide the search, pitch-stuck panels resist opening, shadows anchor trapped thoughts. The statue's shadow becomes the micro-setting that unlocks the box, a precise environmental constraint that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy filters through the skeptic's testing lens: mica-dusted lantern glow, pitch gummy with age, wind smelling of pepper and lilacs. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from alleys through arcades to the oldest square.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories to wake the city—is signaled immediately and tightens through the breadcrumb trail, the stuck panel, and the alignment wait. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to whisper at dry fountains, prying with the brass blade, offering the secret that unsticks the pitch. The constellation-key moment provides a meaningful deepening that narrows options to sidereal patience. Cost is visible: memories fly toward owners but some remain orphaned, the protagonist must release his own memory rather than hold it, and the city will forget again unless someone repeats the search.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: skepticism paired with mystical tools, testing paired with patience, liberation paired with inevitable forgetting. The stained glass box returns transformed—from trap to key to archive—and the final act of wrapping it back under the base offers a non-literal answer: memory requires both liberation and preservation, wake and sleep. "Defiant hush" coheres across whispers that keep the city from thinking it had died and the quiet chorus promised at the end. The father memory avoids didacticism by staying concrete (pump valves like bones, loving too hard) and the insight—fear born of love—reweights the opening trait without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "realistically imaginative" and "sidereal patience" feel precise to this narrator's idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("the taste of river water") to wider framing ("around me the square filled with murmurs"). The geese motif recurs with shifted meaning—held, then resuming—charging the final image without head-hopping. Minor deduction for one filter-verb stack in the middle passage ("I wanted to liberate," "I learned it," "I went by following") that slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "tiny triangles winked from gutters and stairs, blue, then green, then a shard the color of sunset blood" advances plot, setting, and sensory texture). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening third: "light matters more than water, because water no longer moves" borders on abstract thesis rather than dramatized perception, and the "luminous skeptic" frame is stated rather than discovered. The constellation-key sequence and final wrapping remain clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of skepticism and mysticism through "realistically imaginative" and "sidereal patience" feels specific and non-obvious. The breadcrumb method—glass shards as memory trail—transforms a familiar trope through material specificity (stained glass, constellations, lead seams with fingerprints). The geese timeframe and the statue's shadow-alignment offer fresh constraints that feel inevitable in hindsight. Minor proximity concern: the "bread of glass" phrasing and the concept of telling a statue a secret echo fairy-tale templates, though the execution through thumb-pressure and pitch-sigh grounds it in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The luminous skeptic frames the opening, shapes the breadcrumb method (testing each shard), drives the prying choice, and delivers the secret that unsticks the pitch. The trait "I trust the rules but also bend them slowly" directly enables the sidereal patience tactic. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure participation. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in the cartographer's clue (setup), is discovered under the fountain base, lifted to shift the city's breath, set on the rim, watched as constellations form a key, opened via thumb-pressure, and wrapped back under the base at closure. Handled across at least five beats with evolving function: trap → key → archive. Drives the central turn and charges the final image. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sidereal patience is defined early ("the kind of patience stars keep toward night"), shapes the waiting tactic after the first winter, and directly enables the Heron-star alignment that opens the box. The protagonist "waited with sidereal patience until the Heron star on the lid matched the pocket of shadow cast by the statue"—a specific on-page constraint that narrows the method. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure beat. Strong causal pressure and cost connection (patience forecloses impatient alternatives).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" is defined ("I trust the rules but also bend them slowly") and enables the protagonist to follow breadcrumbs without dismissing them as superstition and to wait for the star-alignment without forcing the lock. It constrains one choice (not prying harder) and enables the closure tactic. Present in setup and applied at the key turn. Moderate irreplaceability—generic "open-minded" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unstick" appears in the pitch-stuck panel ("the panel would not unstick until I told the statue a secret"), the geese unsticking from their held pose, and time itself unsticking. The action is literalized, metaphorized, and integrated into the closure image ("time had unstuck itself"). Drives two major beats and charges the ending. High specificity and cost connection (secret as price for unsticking).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Following breadcrumbs is signaled early ("So I went by following breadcrumbs, not the bread of wheat but the bread of glass"), shapes the middle journey (blue, green, sunset-blood shards through arcades), and delivers the protagonist to the oldest square where closure occurs. The method is taught, applied across beats, and its mechanics matter (triangles winking from gutters, leading through specific spaces). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is named in the opening, supplies the quest logic (which fountain holds the box), provides the dry basins that guide the search, offers the statue whose shadow unlocks the constellation, and frames the closure (fountains running, murmurs filling the square, wrapping the box back under the base). Setting pressures every choice and participates actively in the ending. Environment is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "from the pause of migrating geese" anchors the opening, marks the moment fountains fell silent, recurs when geese are "held...as if pinned" during the box-opening, and resolves when they "lowered from their held pose, circled, and resumed their route." The pause tightens the sidereal-patience wait and the geese's resumption signals time unsticking. Present in setup, middle crisis, and closure. Moderate causal pressure—the pause shapes mood but does not constrain tactics as tightly as other elements.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to liberate trapped memories" is stated early ("I wanted to liberate trapped memories, not out of nostalgia, but because without them the city could not wake"), drives the breadcrumb search, the panel-prying, and the box-opening. Friction emerges when the protagonist must release his own memory rather than keep it—a visible cost. Present in setup, middle actions, and closure consequence. Strong causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is named early, modulates across the whispers at dry fountains ("I whispered in a defiant hush, daring the water to remember itself"), and charges the final image ("murmurs, not loud, not yet, but a defiant hush that promised a chorus"). Tone coheres under pressure and reconfigures at closure from solitary defiance to collective promise. High closure linkage and specificity—the oxymoron drives the emotional texture throughout.</comment>
