<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The performer's interior is richly contradictory—former compliance officer turned sheltering hermit—with embodied emotion in whittling, narration rituals, and the dried bouquet. The moral ambiguity is dramatized through neighbors' wariness and the inspector scene, where he neither smiles nor weeps but offers "faithful" instead of "cheerful." The micro-choices (offering the bouquet, narrating boot removal, planting carved birds) reveal a hierarchy of values scaled to grief work. Minor slip: the "emotional void he tends like an austere garden" risks slight abstraction, though subsequent whittling and narration ground it concretely.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (farmhouse, turbines, post-mandate era, performer alone) arrive within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the inspector's arrival, the performer's deliberately ambiguous show, and the inspector's nod—a "country of approval now"—which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist crystallizes his stance (no more teaching forgetting, only lightness that doesn't deny weight) with visible cost (the regime's metrics cannot capture fidelity, and he accepts the gap). The final image of carved birds on fence posts with tucked petals reweights the bouquet and the hush motif, making the cost undeniable. Closure is on-page, lens holds, one meaningful deepening via the inspector beat and dusk ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Turbines function as atmospheric pressure and metaphor ("trawl the sky like iron scythes"), their shadows rehearse in the glass during the show, and they threshold the dusk walk—constraining the protagonist's sensory world and charging the final image. The whittling station (knife, fence slats, falling shavings), kettle, window, and jars of salt all constrain micro-choices. Spatial choreography is clear: interior (kettle, window, whittling) to exterior (field, fence posts). The "remade hush" is sensory (wind, breath, shavings' applause) and purposeful, supporting tone. Minor gap: the farmhouse interior could have one additional concrete anchor (floor type, wall texture) to fully reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivating lightness in grief without erasure, tested when the inspector measures compliance. The performer's agency is renunciation and performance—he offers the bouquet, narrates tasks with mockery-and-prayer balance, answers "faithful" not "cheerful," and refuses both smile and tears. The cost is legible: his answer "looks similar on paper" but is not the same, and he accepts the gap. One meaningful tightening (inspector's arrival) and deepening (the show as both mockery and prayer) under the Accumulative lens. No second reversal required at this length; the dusk ritual extends the stance with visible cost (birds planted, petals tucked, no applause).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: the turbines' endless harvest, the "remade hush," the bouquet fraying into "soft shrapnel of former celebration," carved birds named "tomorrow," and the discipline of "lightness that does not deny weight." The ending reweights prior material (bouquet becomes many beaks of color, quiet but present) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the inspector's closed clipboard, the nod as "country of approval," and the protagonist's choice of "faithful" over "cheerful." The moral ambiguity resists tidy resolution—he reported one farmer, sheltered a widow, serves neither the regime nor simple rebellion. Minor gap: "which is not the same but looks similar on paper" risks slight over-articulation, though it's filtered through the protagonist's voice and fits the scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, perceptual signature distinct (turbines as scythes, water "agrees to be less than cloud," straw-and-dust duel). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "adhesive kept its ghostly shine," "petals frayed into soft shrapnel," "pale commas." The performer's dramatized narration is quoted directly, creating meta-texture without head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens during the inspector scene, then breathes at dusk. Minimal dialogue (inspector's two lines, performer's responses) is subtext-rich and goal-driven. Slight slip: "morally ambiguous in their stories" and "he does not know either" risk slight tell, though they're filtered through community perception and interior stance. No head-hopping, no filter stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but coherent: "iron scythes that never finish the harvest of sound," "petals frayed into soft shrapnel," "pale commas," "rehearsing a dance we will never master." Rhythm modulates (long accumulative sentences, then short declaratives: "There is no applause…and he prefers it"). Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor artifact: slight template cadence in the "Observe…Witness…First…Next…Then" sequence risks mechanical patterning, though it's voice-motivated as the performer's dramatized narration. One paraphrase near "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" appears twice in close proximity (lines 9 and 23), creating a small loop. No filter stacks, no mixed metaphors, no pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-authoritarian setting, whittling ritual, and "remade hush" feels specific and non-obvious. The performer's moral ambiguity (reported a farmer, sheltered a widow) and the inspector scene's quiet compliance-test avoid stock redemption arcs. The turbines as omnipresent threshing metaphor and the bouquet's transformation into many bird-beaks are fresh inflections. Risk: the piece commits fully to accumulative texture and a quiet ending with conceptual cost. Minor proximity concern: the "happiness mandate" and "prescribed cheer" echo dystopian-compliance templates; the story transforms this through the whittling ritual and the specific "faithful/cheerful" turn, but the premise starts from a recognizable frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer drives the inspector scene (offers bouquet, narrates tasks, answers "faithful"), the whittling ritual (discovers birds inside sticks), and the dusk walk (plants birds on posts). Present early, shapes middle beat (inspector), and charges the ending. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The "blank-faced" attribute is embodied (he does not smile, does not weep) and the performer role constrains his tactics (narration as both mockery and prayer). Cost is visible: he accepts the gap between faithful and cheerful, prefers no applause.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet appears in pocket (line 5), is offered to the inspector as "temporary scepter" (line 19), stains the inspector's palm with pollen memory, and is dispersed at dusk (line 32: "so the dried flower bouquet becomes many small beaks of color"). Used in three beats, returns with reweighted meaning (celebration → shrapnel → quiet presence), and charges the final image. Strong closure linkage and specificity. Cost: Lei's departure and the bouquet's fraying anchor grief; the dispersal is the protagonist's refusal to erase it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is signaled early (line 4: "emotional void he tends"; line 12: "remade hush stitched from wind, breath, and the small applause of falling shavings"), shapes the inspector scene (line 26: "as if the remade hush has taken the shape of ceremony"), and appears in the final third (line 34: "the house holds the new hush, a remade hush"). It alters tactics: the protagonist cultivates lightness without erasing grief, choosing faithful over cheerful. The concept constrains his performance and charges the ending. Cost is conceptual: the hush fits "like a repaired shirt," not new, and he accepts the imperfection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Morally ambiguous" is seeded early (line 13: community perception), demonstrated in two beats (reported weeping farmer, sheltered widow storing tears in salt jars), and informs the inspector scene where the protagonist neither smiles nor weeps. The trait constrains his options (neighbors are wary, bring eggs but stand by the door) and enables his double stance. Cost: he does not know whom he serves, only that the turbines keep turning. Minor gap: the trait is labeled once ("morally ambiguous in their stories") rather than purely shown, though the actions themselves dramatize it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Whittling is the protagonist's central ritual: he "whittles small birds from fence slats" (line 8), the action generates falling shavings that become "pale commas" and "small applause," he narrates it during the inspector scene ("the knife discovers a bird inside this stick, patient as if taught by winter"), and he places the carved birds on fence posts at dusk with petals tucked. The action is irreplaceable (it produces the birds that become "tomorrow" and the many beaks of color) and drives three beats. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. The whittling is the method by which he "cultivates lightness in grief."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is signaled early (line 9), demonstrated in three beats (water/kettle, broom/dust, boot removal/window opening/whittling during the inspector scene), and described as "a voice balanced on the edge of mockery and prayer." The method shapes the inspector encounter (the show "about nothing" that keeps the inspector listening) and the protagonist's evening practice (line 35: "he practices lines for tomorrow"). It is the protagonist's primary tactic for cultivating lightness and testing the gap between faithful and cheerful. Cost: it earns the inspector's nod but not genuine approval, and the protagonist prefers the hush to applause.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse overshadowed by giant wind turbines is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout: turbines trawl the sky, their blades are "iron scythes," their shadows cross themselves in the glass during the inspector scene, they threshold the dusk walk ("turbines threshing the sky"), and they bracket the ending ("only the turbines and the kettle and the small wooden birds"). The turbines supply atmospheric pressure (omnipresent, like law) and constrain the protagonist's sensory world. The farmhouse interior (kettle, window, whittling station) enables the show and the inspector scene. Setting charges the final image but does not directly alter a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the happiness mandate" anchors the timeframe in line 2 and informs the entire piece: slogans peeled from walls, prescribed cheer turned brittle, the inspector's duty "diluted but still present in the long after," the "country of approval now" (a nod, not enforcement). The timeframe shapes the protagonist's stakes (he will teach no more forgetting) and the inspector scene's tone (compliance measurement is vague, the clipboard stays closed). Cost: the mandate's legacy persists even after its formal end. Minor gap: the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten a specific decision within the scene; it provides context and shapes mood more than it narrows tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To cultivate lightness in grief" is stated early (line 7), dramatized through whittling (line 8), the narration ritual (lines 9–11), the inspector scene (offering the bouquet, answering "faithful," the show "about nothing"), and the dusk ritual (planting birds with petals). The motivation conflicts with the regime's demand (erase grief, prescribe cheer) and the community's wariness. Cost is visible: Lei's departure, the neighbors' ambivalence, the inspector's nod that is approval but not endorsement, and the protagonist's acceptance of no applause. The motivation drives all major beats and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Emotional void" is signaled early (line 4: "the smile has slipped…leaving an emotional void he tends like an austere garden") and maintained through the piece: he does not smile, does not weep, narrates with a voice "balanced on the edge of mockery and prayer," offers "faithful" not "cheerful," and at the end "does not smile, and he does not weep." The tone modulates under pressure (the inspector scene tightens, the dusk walk breathes) and charges the final image: "There is no applause, only the turbines and the kettle and the small wooden birds, and he prefers it." The void is not static; it is "remade hush," tended with discipline. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
