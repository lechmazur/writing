<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The burned spy's motivations are clear and embodied through physical markers (scars, the pillbox), micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, writing codes), and the renunciation/late-truth backstory that drives present action. Internal contradiction appears in "prudently daring" and the tension between early courage and late truth. The mysterious stranger's sudden appearance and minimal pushback feel convenient; his role as exposition vessel weakens interactivity. Mina exists only in reflection, but her influence constrains present choices and the pillbox becomes a tactical object, so the reflection anchors adequately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph ("burned spy," "zephyr bluff," "spring"). The Drive Lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture: the protagonist climbs to deliver codes, receives intelligence from the stranger, and proceeds to fix the radio—each beat motivated by prior setup. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the radio speaks, the signal will carry "our small nation of promises," and the cost is visible (the burn erased the tether, enabling solo action). The escalation is modest but present: codes → stranger's vouchsafe → hut repair. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stranger reveals Mina is alive and assigns the radio task, narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, and silver hush ground the opening; the hut and broken radio constrain the final act. The pillbox functions as micro-setting, its engraving serving as key and inventory. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the spy's priorities (wind on scars, snow like "sifted salt," thawing drops as percussion). Spatial choreography is clear across the bluff lip, path, and hut. The environment pressures choice: the codes must be written in snow, the radio repair depends on the coil hidden in the pillbox.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconnect with Mina's network and reclaim agency after the burn notice. The stranger's revelation that "Mina is alive" and the radio assignment constitute one meaningful tightening under the Causal lens. Agency is demonstrated through the climb, code-writing, and radio repair. The cost is legible: "use your burn to fix the breakers" explicitly trades the protagonist's erased tether for operational value. No on-page reversals; escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple pressure points, which fits the length but limits upward scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: fixing broken things (radio, trust, self), late truths versus early courage, and the paradox of safety versus climb. The pillbox and fern engraving recur with shifting function (memento → cipher key → inventory). The final image—"breathed until it spoke"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: repair as reconnection and the static as repository of "unused courage." Subtext operates in the stranger's near-failed voice and the erasure of codes. No overt moralizing; the ending reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is controlled and the perceptual signature is consistent (wind as "careful hand," snow as "sifted salt," mist that "pressed" figures). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe," "small nation of promises") that feels voice-motivated but borders on overwrought during peak beats. The stranger's dialogue carries subtext ("prudently daring, careful with your courage but not stingy") but reads slightly expository. Psychic distance remains appropriate; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with action but some figurative density in the opening slows momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout ("zephyr bluff," "silver hush," "wind a careful hand," "alphabet blossomed," "smiled like a bruise remembering its color") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure; this triggers the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Several lines carry metaphoric vehicles that nearly contradict ("breeze writes," "courage waits," "nation of promises") but remain legible. Information density is high; most sentences advance. Minor paraphrase loop: "codes in accumulated snow" appears three times without meaningful variation (−0.2). Syntax varies; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The burned-spy premise is familiar, but the transformation through fixing/radio repair and the pillbox-as-cipher-key offers a fresh synthesis. The codes-in-snow method and the engraved fern as dual symbol/inventory show specificity. "Prudently daring" and "unused courage" are conceptually interesting but border on abstraction without full grounding in scene pressure. The stranger's convenient appearance and the radio's false-bottom coil feel slightly convenient. Emotional truth in the late-truth/early-courage tension and the isolation of the burn elevate the piece above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The burned spy is present throughout, climbs to the bluff (setup), writes codes and converses (development), and repairs the radio (payoff). Choices create beats: the decision to come "prudently daring," to write the apology line, and to repair the radio. The burn itself constrains and enables ("erased your tether"). Cost is visible (isolation, the risk of watchers). The role is essential but not irreplaceable in structure; another marginalized operative could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pillbox appears in setup (tapping in pocket, Mina's gift), middle (traced with thumb, tapped by stranger), and payoff (shaken to reveal the coil, engraving as inventory map). It constrains the repair action (the coil was hidden inside) and charges the closure (the engraving enabled the fix). The specificity of "concentric ferns and a date that never happened" and the false bottom create irreplaceability. Removing it would break the radio-repair logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fixing what's broken shapes the dominant stake (repair trust, the radio, self) and the final action (soldering the break, "breathed until it spoke"). Mina is described as teaching that "fixing...is a way of walking back into yourself," which anchors the concept thematically. The radio repair is the closure beat; without the fixing frame, the spy's arc loses coherence. The concept is more than echo—it drives tactics—but overlaps heavily with the object (radio) and action (repair).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is labeled once in the opening ("I came prudently daring") and echoed by the stranger ("You always were prudently daring, careful with your courage but not stingy"). The trait shapes the decision to climb early and write the apology, but the cost of this specific combination is not isolated on the page; courage and caution blend without visible friction. The label feels thematic rather than action-constraining. Swappable with "cautiously bold" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears once when the stranger kneels to deliver the truth about Mina and the mission. It redefines the protagonist's options (go where Mina cannot, fix the radio) and enables the closure beat. The action is signaled mid-story and drives the final third. However, "vouchsafe" could be replaced with "confirm," "reveal," or "share" without structural loss; the truth-delivery function matters more than the specific verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Codes in accumulated snow are signaled in Mina's rhyme ("look for codes in accumulated snow"), written in the middle beat ("shaped by the bark into whispers"), and erased before the protagonist leaves. The method shapes one key turn (the meeting with the stranger) but does not recur at closure. The specificity (bark on snow, cipher tied to fern engraving) makes it harder to swap, but the radio repair supersedes it as the climactic method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The zephyr bluff in mist grounds the opening and middle (codes written at the lip, path to the hut). The mist enables the stranger's entrance ("pressed out of the air"). The setting provides the snow for codes and isolates the protagonist from watchers. The hut is functional but minimal. The bluff itself does not constrain a closure choice; the radio and pillbox do that work. The tone (silver hush, mist) is inseparable from setting, which elevates integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"At the tilt of the earth toward spring" appears in the opening line and is never revisited. Time does not tighten decisions; no clock pressure or seasonal constraint affects tactics. Thawing snow is mentioned ("drops") but not as a ticking threat. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than functional. Introduced early but absent from development and payoff; easily removable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find where unused courage waits"—is stated in reflection and echoed in the stranger's line ("find where unused courage waits inside the static"). It drives the climb and the decision to write the apology. The friction between late truth (which burned the spy) and early action (arriving before courage rusts) is dramatized. The final act (repairing the radio, breathing until it speaks) enacts the search. The phrasing is abstract and nearly label-only, but the choices it generates are concrete.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silver hush appears in the opening ("the air held a silver hush") and recurs ("in that silver hush, counting my heartbeats," "his voice nearly failed in the hush"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (quiet expectation → near-failure → restoration as the radio speaks). The mist, careful wind, and soft percussion support the tone. It charges the final image (breath → speech) by contrast with the prior silence. The tone is atmospheric and inseparable from setting and closure.</comment>
