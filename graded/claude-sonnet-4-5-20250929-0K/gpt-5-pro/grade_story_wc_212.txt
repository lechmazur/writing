<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular throughout ("grandmother's voice lives in that braid, all salt and root-cellar"). Embodied sensations anchor pressure: "Every breath I take beads the glass above with slow galaxies," "the kernel...rasps my skin with histories." The final choice to crown the hatchling with the spent cap shows earned transformation with visible cost (the cap "lighter now, because its memory has been spent"). Minor issue: the hatchling remains more symbolic cipher than individuated presence, though this serves the lyric design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening lines (icebound atrium, after hatching, seed-saver narrator). The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered attempts (singing through the cap, threading vowels, forming the unlock phrase) that culminate in the doors opening with "patient click" and the narrator's vow to guide neighbors. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image of marking plantings and reopening town paths crystallizes the inherited duty with felt cost (the spent cap, the vow extracted). The causality is atmospheric rather than mechanical, but the because/therefore chain remains legible under the accumulative lens: grandmother's teaching → egg as timed message → song through cap → entropy decrease → door unlock → continuation of inheritance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice throughout: frost-grain arrangement guides the unlock sequence, the dome's "Maxwell trick" architecture demands song rather than force. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "tannin and story," "smell of stored rain," "fine nap like frost that never melts." The oak cap as recurring object charges the closure image when placed on the hatchling's head. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (glass dome above, seed racks, trays of wheat).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen the seed ark via decreasing entropy) is signaled in the first third and tightens through a single meaningful escalation: from solitary attempt to successful unlock with price (vow required). Agency is clear: the protagonist must sing the correct pattern, co-create the unlock phrase with the hatchling, and accept the ark's terms. The cost is legible on-page: "the oak cap dries in my palm, lighter now, because its memory has been spent" and the vow to stay until dawn and guide neighbors. No antagonist is required under the accumulative lens; pressure coheres through atmospheric resistance (frozen order) and the inherited duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: borrowed time, vortex inheritance, and the grammar of continuation. The oak cap's journey (tool → spent artifact → crown) encodes theme without stating it. The final image—"vortex inheritance moves forward again, not a burden but a choreography we were meant to join"—reweights the premise through concrete particulars (the hatchling crowned, the wheat kernels traced) rather than assertion. "The texture of borrowed time: a fine nap like frost that never melts" achieves resonant specificity. One minor slip: "furiously tranquil" repeats as both description and self-commentary, bordering on thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: botanical precision ("husk," "lambent readiness"), inherited idiom ("all salt and root-cellar"), and synesthetic attention ("air clears its throat"). Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure: "furiously tranquil," "live ember," "commas inviting continuation." Brief elision (grandmother's full teaching) is purposeful and paid off through the unlock sequence. One friction: "I must coax the frozen order into sharper calm" and similar phrases occasionally drift toward elevated abstraction that brushes against but does not break the narrator's plausible register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character knowledge, or the unlock attempt. Rhythm modulates effectively ("The shell parts with a lace of steam, and a small throat finds the night"). Some overwriting in stacked figurative language: "Starlight needles through the cracked dome as the icebound atrium breathes a brittle hush" front-loads three metaphors in one beat. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("I hold...I came...I press...I send") but does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; pronoun references remain clear. The final image ("ridiculous and solemn") earns its tonal complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-ark, Maxwell demon thermodynamics, and vocal unlocking through inherited vortex patterns is specific and non-obvious. "Decreasing entropy" as method and "vortex inheritance" as operating principle transform genre elements (post-crisis seed vault, inherited duty) through lived physical detail (oak cap as mouthpiece, frost-grain self-sorting, kernels as archive). Risk-taking in lyric compression and atmospheric causality heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The hatchling-as-co-singer and the cap-as-crown reprise feel earned in hindsight rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed saver drives every beat: interprets grandmother's message, brings the egg to the atrium, sings the unlock sequence, accepts the vow, and commits to guide neighbors. Present in setup (paragraph 4), middle unlocking (singing through cap), and closure (marking plantings, reopening paths). Causal pressure: without this character's knowledge and action, the ark remains sealed. Cost tied to role: the spent cap, the vow, the duty to continue.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears in at least four beats: nested message vessel, wooden mouthpiece for song, drying spent artifact, and final crown on the hatchling. Setup early (paragraph 10), develops through singing sequence (paragraph 19 onward), and charges closure (paragraphs 45–47). Its specific properties matter: "wood remembers the wind," tannin taste, sound-shaping rim. The transformation from tool to spent relic to crown is irreplaceable and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vortex inheritance is signaled early (paragraph 8) as "the way patterns spiral forward carrying duties, debts, and dreams" and becomes the ark's operating principle (paragraph 21). It shapes tactics: the unlock requires spiral song, the hatchling's cry "threads a braid," and chaff traces vortices. The concept constrains method (entropy decrease via pattern) and charges closure ("not a burden but a choreography"). Specific enough to matter, though occasionally borders on thematic assertion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears three times: describing the hatchling (paragraph 5), the narrator's unlock action (paragraph 36), and implicitly the atrium's "wild serenity" (paragraph 6). It enables the calm focus required for entropy decrease and constrains rash force. The phrase charges the closure mood but functions more as tonal marker than trait with visible tradeoff. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, lifting it into mid-band despite limited causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the core action: stated as goal (paragraph 14), attempted through song (paragraphs 26–35), achieved with "patient click" (paragraph 36), and extended to closure vow (paragraph 51: "reopen the town paths"). Every major turn traces to this action or its sub-steps. The method (decreasing entropy) and cost (vow, spent cap) are inseparable from reopening. Removing it breaks the story's logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Decreasing entropy" is signaled early (paragraph 14: "not by force, but by decreasing entropy"), explained via Maxwell demon reference (paragraph 16), and dramatized through the unlock sequence (paragraph 29: "Ice grains arrange along hidden compass lines, entropy stepping down like a dancer descending"). The method shapes attempts: song must impose order, not smash locks. It constrains tactics and charges the conceptual premise, though the thermodynamic mechanics remain atmospheric rather than procedurally detailed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight frames every beat: opening image, unlock constraint (frozen order must self-sort), and closure warmth ("walk into warmth that has never met the sun"). Starlight needles through the dome (paragraph 1), frost threads the space (paragraph 6), and ice grains guide the unlock (paragraph 29). Environment supplies the resistance (cold, entropy) and resources (frost-compass, Maxwell architecture). The contrast between ice and saved summer charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the egg hatches" anchors the opening and triggers the sequence: the egg was "timed for tonight" (paragraph 9). The hatch initiates pressure and the narrator's presence. Closure extends to "until dawn" (paragraph 51), giving the vow temporal weight. Time does not create a ticking-clock constraint on unlocking itself, but the hatching as catalyst and the dawn endpoint provide coherent boundaries that shape the window of action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated explicitly (paragraph 24) and dramatized through tactile investigation: rubbing the wheat kernel until "its surface speaks" (paragraph 40), feeling "a fine nap like frost that never melts" (paragraph 41). The motive drives the journey to the atrium and the unlock attempt. Friction between inherited duty and personal curiosity adds cost: the discovery requires accepting the vow and spending the cap. The phrase "borrowed time stitched in husk" (paragraph 25) bridges motive and theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" is named in paragraph 6 and sustained through "furiously tranquil" (paragraphs 5, 36), "brittle hush" (paragraph 1), and the closing mood of solemn choreography. Tone modulates appropriately: quiet opening, intensifying song sequence, exhaled warmth at unlock, "ridiculous and solemn" closure. The oxymoron charges the final image (crown on hatchling, calm commitment to guide neighbors) and integrates with the conceptual premise (decreasing entropy as sharpening calm). Coherent across pressure points without static repetition.</comment>
