<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is consistent and lyric-textured, with embodied choices (confessing the old leaving, asking to be taught) that drive the arc. The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" speech feels authentic to her character and creates contradictory impulses. However, the backstory of the "old leaving" and the cart remains abstract; we see the outcome (debt repaid) but not the internal contradiction or mistake that caused the original failure, which would have sharpened the renunciation at closure. The final act of "paying" reads more as thematic assertion than a lived choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (greenhouse, narrator, watch-keeping). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the bead's escalating function (touching glass → singing → teaching → pressing into palm) and the orchard's responses accumulate pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator commits to perpetual tending with the cost felt in "fear of failing her twice" and the endless cycle of "paying." The causal thread from bead to confession to awakening holds, though the debt-repayment mechanism itself remains more asserted than dramatized in a concrete choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective detail (glass aisles, copper grafts, stringed flasks, tubing) and constrains the narrator's choices—coaxing sap through tuning, placing the bead on a graft scar. Sensory selection is purposeful: frost on pears, vapor on panes, chimes in the rungs. The "endless night" and winter-cracked fields frame the stakes spatially. The bead and the grafts function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("we are finally remembered"). The environment is not mere backdrop; it negotiates, remembers, and responds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying a debt to awaken the orchard despite endless night—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the ghost bride's teaching, the narrator's confession, and the bead's escalating resonance, culminating in the grafts shuddering and pears glowing. The narrator's agency is present (asking, confessing, obeying) but leans toward acceptance and endurance rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path with visible cost. The line "the debt is paid when you keep paying" names the perpetual obligation, yet the cost feels stated more than dramatized in a moment where the narrator trades one option for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: memory, debt, grafting as argument with death, oaths binding arguments when light fails. The bead shifts meaning across beats (token → instrument → final weight), and the orchard functions as ledger. The ending offers a non-literal answer—endless tending as both payment and remembering—without moralizing. The phrase "we are finally remembered" reweights the entire arc. Minor slip: "the debt is paid when you keep paying" borders on thematic echo, nearly stating the premise aloud, though it's voiced by the ghost bride rather than narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric diction ("ashen-veil," "venomous," "tuning stringed flasks"), syntactic variety, and POV-specific perception (the bead "a heart calling them to wake"). The ghost bride's speech carries subtext and distinct idiom ("you would drown a seed to teach it patience"). Compression is purposeful and taught early; the reader learns the pattern of alchemical metaphor and ephemeral appearances. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature remains stable under pressure. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (intimate interiority, then wider reflection in the closing lines).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences open differently, and paragraph lengths create visual and conceptual breathing. Information density is high—most lines advance image, atmosphere, or character stance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent within the alchemical-lyric mode taught early. Minor deduction: a few phrases approach ornamental ("ash lifting from her veil like steam off morning bread") without pressing the action forward at that beat, and the line "Her eyes held both graves and bells" stacks metaphor without clear vehicle logic. Propulsion remains strong through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical botany, ghost bride as creditor, and the bead as oath-instrument is specific and non-obvious. The debt-across-lifetimes premise is familiar, but the execution through resonant tuning, graft scars, and "ephemeral cameo appearances" transforms it into lived particulars. The tone ("lovingly venomous") and the ledger metaphor feel organic. The piece commits fully to its lyric-alchemical logic without retreating into easier emotional shorthand. The ending's perpetual-payment recursion is fresh within the frame. Risk-taking in dense figurative mode is controlled and pays off.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride appears early, guides the narrator's fingers and breath across multiple beats (trellis, graft scar, bead placement), and her teaching enables the confession that triggers the orchard's awakening. She presses the bead into the narrator's palm at closure and names the perpetual obligation. Her choices (teaching, revealing the debt, dissolving after payment) create key turns. Strong causal presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bead is handled across multiple beats: clicks against glass, lifted and sung by the bride, dampened and laid on a graft scar, used to mark rhythm during the name-speaking, and finally pressed into the narrator's palm. Its function evolves from emblem to instrument to oath-weight. It constrains choices (the narrator must learn to use it) and charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" shapes the narrator's goal (coaxing the trees to bloom) and tactics (tuning flasks, using the bead to call up memory in roots). The orchard's response (chimes, shuddering grafts, pears glowing) dramatizes the concept. It is present in setup, middle teaching, and closure (sap striking bargains, grafts foaming). The concept changes options by requiring confession and the bead's precise use. Solid integration, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" describes the ghost bride's speech ("every tenderness tipped with a bite") and recurs in her final laughter. It characterizes her twice on the page and colors her teaching method (elation paired with warning). The trait does not visibly constrain an action with cost; it flavors tone but does not alter the narrator's tactics or create a tradeoff. Functional but closer to atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghosting is the bride's mode of being and action: she appears through ephemeral cameo, ghosts between rows, guides the narrator's ghosted touch across a trellis, and dissolves back into the panes. The method enables her teaching and the narrator's learning ("never touching, and the vine rose"). Her ephemeral presence is tied to the debt mechanism and shapes the middle beats and closure. Major turns trace to this action; it redefines the narrator's relationship to memory and obligation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled early (frost on pear, face in pipettes, hand on vapor) and its mechanics matter: the bride can guide but not fully manifest until the name is spoken. The method shapes the teaching beats (brief intrusions, quick edits) and the closure moment when she "stood fully present, not cameo but center." The constraint (ephemeral until debt acknowledged) drives the arc and is paid off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is present throughout, anchors who/where immediately, and its components (glass aisles, copper grafts, stringed flasks, tubing, trellis, graft scars) supply resources and constrain tactics. The "endless night" shrouding it intensifies stakes. The orchard's responses (chimes, roots negotiating, sap bargaining) are causally active. The setting charges the final image ("the orchard remembers us"). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" establishes season and atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or track time causally. The "endless night" is spatial/conceptual (a held breath) rather than a ticking clock. Time feels vague—no urgency pressing choices. The timeframe flavors tone but does not alter tactics or escalation. Functional backdrop, replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The debt is named early and drives the ghost bride's arrival and teaching. The narrator's choices (asking, confessing, obeying) flow from the desire to repay. Friction between want (to awaken the orchard) and cost (perpetual obligation, "fear of failing her twice") is dramatized in the confession beat and the final pressing of the bead. The motivation shapes two major beats and the ending, though the original leaving remains abstract. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is embodied in the bride's smile ("mournful elation, like a wound relieved to bleed") and her laughter that is "lovingly venomous again." The tone modulates: early solemnity (hush, endless night), the bride's bittersweet teaching, and the final mixture of loss and fulfillment ("we are finally remembered"). Tone charges the final image and remains coherent through turns. Not static; it deepens as pressure rises.</comment>
