<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's curiosity and craft identity are concrete and embodied through sketching, pendant handling, and canal manipulation. The mentor's voice and guild warnings provide internal conflict, though the moment of defying them feels more stated than torn. The final choice to release the echo carries weight, but the "learning its own perimeter" beat could show more contradictory impulse. Emotional progression is specific and grounded through craft action rather than label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through pendant use, sluice manipulation, and echo birth, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the protagonist releases the echo despite guild presence—a renunciation that forecloses ownership with visible cost ("I let the echo go"). Orientation anchors quickly (illustrator, rooftop canals, giant beneath). The watcher's arrival and nod provide a micro turn that crystallizes the stakes without undermining the choice. One meaningful deepening is present: the echo's birth reweights the city's rhythm and the protagonist's relationship to both guild and giant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system, sluice gates, hush-basin, and painted infinity tiles constrain multiple choices: lifting the sluice triggers the echo, the basin's geometry requires the pendant's placement, and the giant's twitch raises immediate stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (syrup-thickened air, shimmer like memory, taste of stone and wet feathers) and filtered through the illustrator's perceptual priorities. Spatial choreography across ledges, bridges, and aqueducts remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (pendant on tile, canal mouth) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where echoes are born—is signaled early and tightens when the sluice manipulation risks waking the giant. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: rubbing the pendant, lifting the sluice, placing the pendant on the tile, and releasing the echo are all volitional acts with visible costs (borrowed time repaid as "clumsy pauses," giant's continental twitch, guild scrutiny). One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo's birth forces the choice between caging it for study or releasing it into the city. The watcher's nod reframes rather than resolves, keeping pressure legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of creation across constraint (giant's nap as both clock and crucible, time-borrowing ethics, echoes breeding in mistakes) emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The infinity pendant's loop drinking "pooled secondhand moments" and the final line "some species can only live across a giant's nap, not beyond" offer non-literal resonance without moralizing. The interrupted cadence functions as both craft principle and existential stance. The sketch-to-stay-brave motif charges the ending by linking observation to courage without explaining the connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV control is clean with a distinct perceptual signature: the illustrator notices anatomy ("bones of timing and lungs of space"), natural history details (dead pigeons, ferns, limestone seashells), and craft mechanics. Diction remains character-consistent ("my sketchbook is braver than my hands," "curiosity nibbles through warnings like moss"). Some metaphors stretch plausibility in peak moments ("sound drops a seed there, sprouting a shimmer") but stay within lyric-voice range. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative certainty matches what the focalizer observes and infers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most lines advance setting, action, or thematic charge). Minor template cadence in the middle third: several "I [verb]" stems cluster without taught pattern ("I set," "I caress," "I follow," "I unclasp," "I sketch"). One paraphrase loop: "the city a knot" echoes "weaving between towers" without adding pressure. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "syrup-thickens" and "shimmer like a bubble made of memory" work, though "bright animal pacing inside a cage whose bars are beats" verges on mixed vehicle. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of natural history illustrator, time-sculpting pendant, rooftop canals, and sleeping giant beneath offers a non-obvious premise executed with specific world logic (sluice mechanics, hush-basin geometry, interrupted cadence as breeding condition). The echo's "anatomy" (bones of timing, lungs of space, skin of delay) and the pendant's ethics (borrowing only wasted time) avoid generic fantasy tropes. The watcher's final line—"some species can only live across a giant's nap"—reframes the stakes without telegraphing. Risk-taking in pacing (compressed canal-chase, no dialogue) heightens pressure without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early; drives three beats (sketching to listen, lifting sluice, sketching the echo to "stay brave") and the final release choice. "Drawing is my way of staying brave" ties craft identity to the decision. Missing middle constraint: the illustrator role enables observation but doesn't visibly narrow options between sluice and release. Closure participation is clear but the craft itself doesn't shape the watcher encounter or the let-go moment beyond thematic echo. Causal work is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 7). Used in three beats: rubbing for borrowed time (paragraph 15), placement on center tile to complete the pattern and cradle the echo (paragraphs 28-30), and implicitly referenced in the watcher's acknowledgment (paragraph 38). Its looped metal and time-sculpting function constrain the protagonist's tactics (must borrow time to move unnoticed, must complete painted pattern). Reweighted at closure when the watcher "nods to the pendant," acknowledging the ethics. Visible cost (repayment in "clumsy pauses") is tied directly to its use. Highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 5) and operationalized in paragraph 19: "the ancient rhythm stumbles, a perfect, measurable interrupted cadence" when water strikes stone. The concept drives the protagonist's method (creating the stumble to birth the echo) and appears in the closure unit when "an interrupted cadence become a held chord" enables condensation. It shapes on-page tactics (timing the sluice lift, pendant placement) and the hush-basin's function. The watcher's final line about species living "across a giant's nap" reprises the concept thematically. Specificity and cost are clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 8; operationalized in paragraphs 15-16 when the protagonist rubs the pendant to thicken time and move faster. The trait enables the sluice manipulation without waking the giant and constrains later action: "borrowed seconds will come due at once, collapsing like a miscounted ledger" (paragraph 26). Visible cost appears on-page (paragraph 22: "repaid later, in clumsy pauses"). At closure, the pendant's year of saved moments is consumed to cradle the echo (paragraph 29). Causal pressure and tradeoff are explicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Core turn: paragraph 18, lifting the sluice to "uncage the hesitant slack-water" triggers the interrupted cadence and echo birth. This action causes the shimmer (paragraph 20), the giant's twitch (paragraph 26), and the need to reach the hush-basin. At closure, the protagonist must "scoop the newborn echo and release it" (paragraph 36)—a second uncaging that completes the arc. Swapping "uncage" for a generic "free" or "open" would lose the motif linkage between sluice pocket and echo's bar-cage. Essential to escalation and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 9 via mentor's claim, operationalized paragraph 15 ("I caress the pendant... it lends me a half minute from a future yawn"). The method shapes the protagonist's window to manipulate the sluice undetected (paragraph 21: "by borrowing time, exact and small, so the echo can hatch without the city's pulse noticing"). At closure, the pendant "drinks the pooled secondhand moments I have saved all year" (paragraph 29), supplying the cradle. The ethics (repayment in pauses, paragraph 22) add cost. Two beats plus closure participation; causal and specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 2); the canal system provides the physical stage for all action. Specific mechanics pressure choices: sluice gates (paragraph 18), the blind pocket behind gargoyle (paragraph 18), narrow ledges (paragraph 17), the hush-basin ringed by infinity tiles (paragraphs 27-28), and the canal mouth for release (paragraph 36). The giant's twitch tilts puddles and chains (paragraph 26), raising immediate stakes. The summit basin's painted pattern requires the pendant's exact shape (paragraph 28). Setting drives escalation, constrains tactics, and charges the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The giant's nap bookends the story (paragraphs 3, 34) and tightens decisions: waking the giant collapses borrowed time (paragraph 26), and the watcher's closing line reframes the echo's viability as dependent on "across a giant's nap, not beyond" (paragraph 38). The timeframe constrains the protagonist's method (must act within the sleep cycle) and charges the closure by revealing the echo's fragility. Present in three beats (setup, twitch, watcher's reframe) with conceptual cost legible at the end. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated early (paragraph 4) and dramatized via the climb, sluice manipulation (paragraph 18), and sketch attempt (paragraph 33). Friction between curiosity and guild warning (paragraph 6) creates internal conflict, though the choice to defy feels more resolved than torn on the page. At closure, the protagonist's release of the echo (paragraph 36) enacts a shift from ownership ("to find") to stewardship. The motivation drives three beats and reweights at the end, but the middle stretch (chase to basin) leans on procedure over want-versus-cost tension.</comment>
