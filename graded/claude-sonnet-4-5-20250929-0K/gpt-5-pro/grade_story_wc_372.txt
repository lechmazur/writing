<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistent and textured through voice ("I thought of the apprentices and how their breaths made halos on the glass, their futures tender as moth wings"), with embodied micro-choices in the vow-assessment sequence. The apprentices remain gestural; their presence multiplies the on-page cast without distinct pressure. Internal contradiction appears in the narrator's tension between duty and doubt ("I wondered which promises would carry them, and which would ask to be forgiven"), but the final choice—to keep measuring despite uncertainty—feels more like endurance than transformation with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or therapy phrasing mars the beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (records chief), where (frozen library), and the vow-measurement task by the opening paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the three projections build density and the narrator's own unmeasured vow returns in the final third to deepen the stake. Closure reads as Charged Poise—"we stay, and in the quartz hush we measure and remember"—crystallizing the choice to persist with felt cost (uncertainty, exhaustion, the risk of failure). The cost is legible in "I do not know how long we can hold the passing back" and "meaning keeps arriving like weather," but lacks a sharper before/after image. Escalation is modest—one meaningful deepening when the narrator tests their own vow—sufficient for the length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly rendered ("cathedral of shelves and frost-bitten ladders," "quartz hush," "stairs filled with powder like hourglasses tipped on their sides") and sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The magic lantern, brass sensors, and hoarfrost-laminated catalog cards constrain the measurement method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (Observation Alcove, atrium ice, dome). The setting pressures the narrator's task—cold threatens the library's "lungs," avalanches sigh outside—and the dome's "low glow" answers the narrator's test in the closing beat, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving recoverable vows and deciding what to release—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the three projections: the wedding succeeds, the courtroom pledge fractures, the scribes' vow trembles but is coaxed into coherence. The narrator's own vow (to keep the library awake) arrives late but reweights prior material. Agency is visible in "I revised the metadata to include conditions never spoken, and the tremor softened," a micro-decision that alters outcome. Cost is felt but diffuse: "I do not know how long we can hold the passing back" admits uncertainty without foreclosing a path on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening suffices; the final persistence choice deepens the stake but does not transform it decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—preservation, meaning-making at the edge of oblivion, the weight of promises—emerges organically from the measurement ritual and the narrator's unspoken vow. The quartz hush and luminous vows recur with shifting weight: early as task, late as the narrator's own test. The final image ("our own luminous vows carved across the cold") answers the central question without stating a moral, charging the closure with resonance. Subtext operates in silence ("the apprentices clapped without sound") and in the narrator's unarticulated doubt. No overt thematic statements mar the ending; meaning accumulates through specifics. The piece invites reflection beyond plot without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; psychic distance contracts under pressure ("I whispered, No trace to bind") and expands in reflective beats without head-hopping. Diction is lyric and consistent ("patience of the gale," "shy aurora," "beekeeper… arranging hexagons of data"), matching the narrator's voice throughout. Perception is character-particular: "the dome sometimes answered with a low glow" reflects the narrator's attentiveness to the library's responses. No dialogue appears; the piece sustains a singular narrative texture. Purposeful compression ("we marked it for archive, and a tiny fleck of warmth moved through the room") and figurative density fit the voice and taught pattern, legible at closure. Filter verbs ("I thought," "I wondered") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between noun, prepositional, and subordinate constructions. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, task, or interiority without padding. Figurative language is dense ("catalog cards laminated with hoarfrost curled like tired tongues," "frequency rang true, a steady bell beyond the gale") but controlled and legible, though the accumulation ("magic lantern slide," "luminous vows," "quartz hush," "avalanches sighed," "sky flexed its blue ribs") risks overwriting in the middle third. A minor paraphrase loop: "Sometimes the signal arrived… Sometimes nothing came" echoes structure without added pressure. No template cadence or therapy-speak. The final line ("our own luminous vows carved across the cold") reprises motifs cleanly. Pronoun references are clear; tense is stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—a records chief measuring the persistence of luminous vows via frequency sampling in a frozen sky library—is specific and non-obvious, transforming archival/preservation tropes through the sensory and conceptual particularity of "sampling frequencies of faint light" and "quartz hush." The narrator's gently meticulous voice and the ritual structure (three projections + the narrator's own test) feel organic rather than checklist-driven. Emotional truth (uncertainty, care, exhaustion) grounds the fantastical frame. The ending's turn—testing the narrator's own vow and accepting "the clean blank of survival"—grows from prior material without late rule changes. Risk-taking in dense figurative texture and lyric pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Proximity to archival/librarian fiction is present but transformed through the frequency-sampling method and the sky-borne setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orderly records chief is named early and makes on-page decisions: marking the wedding vow for archive, whispering "No trace to bind" for the courtroom pledge, and revising metadata for the scribes' vow ("I revised the metadata to include conditions never spoken, and the tremor softened"). The narrator tests their own vow in the final third, a choice that reweights prior material. Agency is visible but the final persistence choice is more endurance than decisive alteration. Setup (early), development (three vow assessments), and payoff (own vow tested) are present. Causal pressure moderate; cost felt but not sharply defined on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in the Observation Alcove early, projects the three vow scenes (wedding, courtroom, scribes), and is paused by the narrator ("I paused the lamp and read the oath aloud"). It returns in the final third when the narrator aims the lens at the atrium ice to test their own vow. Setup, development (three uses across distinct beats), and payoff (final test) all present. The slide's mechanics—projecting vows, clicking, humming—constrain the measurement method. Not irreplaceable (another projection device could serve), but the specific "magic lantern" idiom and "luminous vows etched in grains that loved the dark" tie it to tone and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Luminous vows are the story's core stake: the narrator measures their persistence, three vows are tested on-page, and the narrator's own vow ("to keep the library awake while illusions fade to memory") is assessed in the final third. The concept shapes tactics (sampling frequencies, marking for archive, revising metadata) and the closure image ("our own luminous vows carved across the cold"). Setup (wedding vow "luminous vows braided from their breath"), development (three tests), and payoff (final reprise) all present. Cost is legible in "I do not know how long we can hold the passing back." The concept is indispensable; removing it collapses the narrative logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears twice: opening paragraph ("My hands were gently meticulous") and when the narrator revises metadata ("Meaning, I had learned, could be coaxed into coherence without being broken, if one was gently meticulous"). The trait enables the metadata revision that soothes the tremor, a visible on-page consequence. Setup present, development via one key action, payoff implied in the beekeeper metaphor ("I kept each outcome with the care of a beekeeper"). The trait could be swapped for synonyms (careful, precise) with minor edits; specificity moderate. Cost (patience, time) implied but not sharp.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Measure" is the narrator's central task, signaled in the opening ("I worked to conjure meaning"), specified in the method description ("measure the persistence of vows by sampling frequencies"), and executed in all three projection scenes. The narrator tests their own vow by measuring the signal from the atrium ice in the final third. Setup, development (three measurements), and payoff (final test) all present. The action structures every beat and the closure depends on it—"we measure and remember" is the final stance. Removing it would collapse the narrative. Cost is visible in the effort and uncertainty ("I do not know how long we can hold the passing back").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"By sampling frequencies" is described in the method exposition ("measure the persistence of vows by sampling frequencies of the faint light") and demonstrated in all three projection tests. The mechanics shape each assessment: "the vow frequency rang true, a steady bell," "signal broke like thin glass," "frequencies wove a lattice, yet a low tremor gnawed the base." The narrator uses sensors ("I set up the sensors like small brass moths") and the method constrains the narrator's choices (what to archive, what to release). Setup, development (three applications), payoff (final test). Could be replaced with another diagnostic method (amplitude, resonance) with moderate edits; specificity and irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is established in the opening line and pressures every beat: cold threatens the library's lungs, hoarfrost curls catalog cards, wind scrapes the dome, avalanches sigh outside, stairs fill with powder. The setting constrains the narrator's task (keeping the library awake) and supplies the atrium ice and dome for the final test. The Observation Alcove, barometer, and magic lantern are embedded in the space. The dome answers with "a low glow" in the closing beat, making the setting essential to closure. Setup, development (environment shapes tactics throughout), and payoff (dome's response) all present. Irreplaceable; removing the frozen sky-library collapses tone, stakes, and the measurement ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" appears in the opening paragraph ("my task was to measure their staying power while illusions fade to memory") and reprises in the narrator's own vow ("to keep the library awake while illusions fade to memory"). The timeframe tightens the narrator's urgency—vows are halfway gone, the library is at the edge of oblivion—but elapsed time within the scene is unmarked. Setup present, development implied (the three vows are fading at different rates), payoff in the narrator's acknowledgment that persistence is uncertain ("I do not know how long we can hold the passing back"). No live clock alters tactics beat-to-beat; the timeframe functions more as atmospheric pressure than a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated in the opening paragraph and dramatized in the three vow assessments: the narrator decides which promises are recoverable and which warrant farewell. The motivation is conflicted—"I wondered which promises would carry them, and which would ask to be forgiven"—and the narrator's own vow (keeping the library awake) is tested in the final third with visible doubt ("I do not know how long we can hold the passing back"). Setup, development (three choices driven by this desire), and payoff (final persistence stance) all present. Cost is legible in the effort and uncertainty; the narrator persists despite doubt, making the motivation essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" appears early ("In that quartz hush, I kept the minutes") and reprises in the closing line ("in the quartz hush we measure and remember"). Tone is hushed, attentive, and elegiac throughout; lyric density and slow pacing match the stillness. The tone modulates slightly under pressure—when the tremor gnaws the base, urgency tightens syntax—but returns to calm at closure. The final reprise charges the ending image with resonance. Setup, development (sustained through all beats), and payoff (final line) all present. The tone is indispensable; shifting to a different register (urgent, warm, colloquial) would collapse the piece's coherence and the closure's effect.</comment>
