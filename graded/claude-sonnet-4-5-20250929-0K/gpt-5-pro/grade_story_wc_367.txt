<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and concrete—"my laugh betrays me, coming early, a pulse of shadowed elation at the edge of my teeth"—with embodied contradictions throughout. Her relationship with grandmother's legacy and storms shows depth, and the final renunciation (rewrapping the wick "like a child, knowing glass also needs tenderness") reads as earned endurance with visible cost. Minor slip: the fishermen's gratitude and drone courier feel slightly external to her interior arc, diluting the protagonist-centered pressure at the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she completes the ritual, the gyre is steered, and the final image of rewrapping the wick crystallizes her custodial role with felt cost ("older and lighter"). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when her laugh "accidentally" summons the gyre, raising stakes, and the beam-weaving sequence tightens pressure toward the ending. Cost is legible: exhaustion, embodied risk, and the knowledge that tomorrow will call another storm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, its glass lantern wick, balcony, and bay form a micro-setting that constrains her choices throughout: she must "unspool the glass lantern wick, cooling it in brine," and the beam's mechanics (total internal reflection) shape her tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through her custodial lens ("the night smelled like ozone and library paste") and the environment charges the final image when she rewraps the wick. The setting is indispensable to both pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent the gyre from drowning the town while honoring the storm's sentience. Her laugh "betrays" her, pivoting the gyre toward harbor, which tightens pressure; her ritual with the wick and beam forces a single decisive action under stress. Agency is clear—she steers the storm through embodied craft—and the cost (physical toll, recursive responsibility) is visible on the page. One escalation point (gyre pivots) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though a second micro-reversal would have cemented the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—ritual as communion with forces larger than self, joy as technique, memory as navigational tool—emerges through the wick's history, the newspaper clippings, and the protagonist's custodial stance without overt statement. The final image (rewrapping the wick, feeling "older and lighter," knowing tomorrow will call another reader) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: what does it cost to be the intermediary between human need and elemental power? No thematic drift or moralizing; subtext operates in every sensory and gestural choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "storms are like readers, impatient until the first line hooks them." Purposeful compression and lyric diction are taught early and sustained; the elevated register matches the protagonist's mythopoetic frame without jarring. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: a few lines ("I do not panic"; "We do not drown; we drink") verge on summary-tell where embodied action would sharpen immediacy, costing a step into the 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density and vivid figurative language ("a pulse of shadowed elation at the edge of my teeth," "the gyre, pleased, leans back into open water") sustain momentum. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, metaphor density in several consecutive lines ("a choir of prisms, a promise written in rotating glass" immediately followed by more figurative constructions) borders on overwriting without always advancing cause-effect, costing eligibility for 8.5+. Propulsion remains strong, and the final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper as storm whisperer, laughter as frequency, newspaper obituaries as navigational runes—is specific and non-obvious, earning the score. The glass-wick mechanics (total internal reflection as literal and thematic device) and the post-newspaper ritual context transform familiar lighthouse-keeper material. Risk-taking in the lyric-dense style heightens stakes without obscuring closure. A slightly more grounded middle beat (the wick-preparation sequence leans abstract) would have pushed this higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early, drives the inciting pivot (her laugh summons the gyre), executes the central ritual (turning the wheel, tuning her laugh), and anchors the closure (rewrapping the wick, writing the logbook entry). Her choices—cooling the wick, scratching runes, tuning the laugh—create all key turns. Cost is visible: exhaustion, recursive obligation, the knowledge that "tomorrow my laugh will call another reader from the horizon."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early via grandmother's legacy, used in three distinct beats: mention of its secrets, the ritual preparation (unspooling, cooling in brine, scratching runes), and the tender rewrapping at closure. Its properties (helix, total internal reflection corridors) enable the central action and the final image charges it with care and continuity. Removing it would collapse the story's mechanism and thematic axis.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The phrase "otherworldly routine" directly appears in the text and shapes the protagonist's identity ("I made an otherworldly routine of it"). The nightly ritual—climbing, tracing fractures, braiding shadows with light—structures the action and differentiates her role from mere maintenance. It constrains her tactics (she must perform the ritual under pressure) and the closure reaffirms the routine's cost and continuity. Slightly abstract phrasing in the middle keeps this from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("our jokes were accidentally prophetic more often than was comfortable") and drives the inciting incident: "My laugh betrays me, coming early… It is accidentally prophetic; the gyre hears, pivots, and aims to thread the harbor throat." The trait enables the central conflict and the closure acknowledges its recursive cost ("tomorrow my laugh will call another reader"). The prophecy is not passive flavor—it alters the storm's trajectory and the town's fate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action "steer" appears explicitly ("She learned to steer light itself") and governs the climax: "Through total internal reflection the beam will fold itself, steer by echo, and braid the storm into a new shore." The entire ritual sequence enacts steering—turning the wheel, tuning the laugh, guiding the gyre along the harbor mouth. The resolution hinges on successful steering, and the final image (rewrapping the wick) completes the steer-and-release cycle. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("bending it through total internal reflection") and its mechanics matter throughout: "the beam will fold itself, steer by echo" relies on the glass wick's "hairline corridor for light to remember." The method shapes her preparation (cooling, scratching runes) and enables the climax. However, the physics remain somewhat abstract—more vivid mechanical detail in the beam-folding sequence would have anchored this in the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening line and operative in every beat: the balcony exposes her to wind, the lamp is the mechanism of steering, the spiral glass staircase is climbed nightly, and the bay's "old timbers" respond to her laugh. The lighthouse's vertical structure, glass lens, and coastal position constrain all her choices and charge the final image (downstairs radio, rewrapping upstairs). The setting is the story's skeleton.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mentioned early ("After the last print newspaper, our town needed new rituals") and shapes the protagonist's motivation (she salvages obituary-page shadows to map the beam). The timeframe contextualizes her role and the closure nods to it (drone courier, radio). However, the time element does not create a live ticking clock or narrow her tactical window during the storm sequence—it functions more as backdrop than pressure device, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("I do it to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") and dramatized throughout: she uses obituary-page grain to map the beam, steers the gyre to nourish fields, and the closure acknowledges recursive cost ("tomorrow my laugh will call another reader"). The desire drives her ritual preparation and the final renunciation. Slight abstraction in phrasing and the lack of a sharp want-versus-fear friction keep this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherent from the opening ("my laughter carries across the foam like a bell built from thunder") through the inciting beat ("a pulse of shadowed elation at the edge of my teeth") to the closure ("I felt older and lighter"). The tone braids joy and cost without tipping into single-note optimism or dread, and it charges the final image when she rewraps the wick "knowing glass also needs tenderness." Modulates with pressure and defines the voice.</comment>
