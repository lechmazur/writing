<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is clear and particularized through the reactor work, palette choices (Courage, Mercy, Patience), and the choreographed ritual with Lio. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator wants to measure presence but risks destroying its mystery through quantification—this tension surfaces in Lio's question "whether the metrics endanger the mystery." Embodied action is strong (touching the wrist, tipping vials, writing on tiles), but the final choice feels more like completion of a predetermined ritual than a decision under pressure that forecloses a live path. The piece leans heavily on metaphoric interiority ("desire is massful only when mirrored by respect") that borders on thesis-speak, and the relationship with Lio, while textured, serves more as witness than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, metaphoric diction, ritual structure) and builds through a series of calibrations that reweight the experiment's meaning. Orientation anchors who (pocket-sun alchemist), where (ember nexus plaza), and what (reactor experiment) by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the experiment succeeds, presence "compresses, warm as a held breath," and the narrator and Lio walk home with "joy [having] the heft of a carefully placed stone"—the abstract goal has been made tangible with visible cost (the shared secret, the vulnerability of whispering it). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio whispers the secret and the reactor "blooms open like a small dawn," transforming the technical experiment into an emotional one. The cost is legible: intimacy was required to achieve scientific success, and the plaza's ordinary commerce resumes afterward, suggesting the moment was singular and non-repeatable. No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember nexus is anchored early with sensory detail (hums, steam threads, grates, twilight velvet) and remains consistent throughout. The nautilus shell columella curl inside the reactor is a recurring object that charges the final image when it "dims like a yawn," signaling the experiment's completion. The reactor itself constrains choice: the narrator must calibrate it, open the iris, and feed it the vials in a specific sequence. Spatial choreography is clear (plaza center, grate, tiles, drain), and the body's role in the work (palm stained gold, wrist touch, sleeve used to revalue) gives the setting tactile weight. The plaza's shift from experimental hush back to "choreography of merchants" marks the world's return to normalcy and underscores the singularity of the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing presence's density—is signaled in the opening third and pursued through the reactor calibration. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens: the narrator and Lio "have tried before, and our numbers kept evaporating," establishing prior failure and raising the stakes for this attempt. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio whispers the secret, which serves as the catalyst for the reactor to accept the experiment and for presence to "compress." The secret's content is withheld from the reader but its weight is dramatized, and the cost is felt: vulnerability was required. Agency is present in micro-choices (mixing the palette, timing the laps, deciding when to stop), but the escalation feels more like completion of a ritual than a trade-off that narrows options. The resolution is earned by the shared intimacy, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—science as act of intimacy, the paradox of measuring the immeasurable—emerges from the reactor work, the palette of resolve, and the final image of presence holding "like a pebble." The piece resists thesis-speak in most beats, letting the nautilus spiral and the vials carry meaning without overt explanation. The line "Romance in science is not perfume; it is the courage to be precise" borders on direct statement but is earned by the prior dramatization of calibration and vulnerability. The final image—"joy has the heft of a carefully placed stone"—reweights the abstract opening goal with a concrete, tactile answer. Subtext operates in Lio's touch signal, the withheld content of the secret, and the plaza's resumed commerce, which implies the experiment's success is fragile or singular. No moralizing; the ending leaves mystery intact while proving the method worked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person present, distance controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature is consistent (scientific precision layered with lyric metaphor). The voice is distinct in diction ("scientifically romantic," "massful," "sleepy flare") and rhythm, with purposeful compression in lines like "presence would swell around joy, then thin when grief traced its cooling finger." Dialogue is minimal but functional: Lio's lines ("You brought the cobalt vials"; "the moment is almost ripe") feel natural and goal-driven. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("desire is massful only when mirrored by respect") that reads more like thesis than thought under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains close throughout. The narrator's lexicon is consistent—scientific yet poetic—though some metaphoric density borders on opacity without full payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively ("The ember nexus at twilight hums" / "twilight finally exhales, and the ember nexus sleeps"). Information density is high; most lines advance ritual, character, or atmosphere. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without always adding clarity: "spiral draws heat into grammar," "laps tell me the old coefficients cherished fear," "presence compresses, warm as a held breath, dense as freshly poured grain." Mixed vehicles occasionally clash (heat into grammar; coefficients cherishing fear). A paraphrase loop appears in "I want to capture the density of presence, not its rumor. / I want mass you can feel in the wristbones while you speak." Template cadence in the palette sequence ("Another reads Patience... another, Mercy") is minor but present. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the middle third. Applying patterned-artifact baseline −0.6 and figurative density −0.4 for cumulative effect totaling −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual, science, and intimacy feels specific and non-obvious, elevated by the nautilus columella curl and the palette of named virtues. The premise—measuring presence through alchemical experiment—avoids stock plot templates. However, the emotional arc (collaborative experiment succeeds through shared vulnerability) is familiar, and the transformation hinges more on lyric accumulation than a non-obvious moral calculus or embodied trade-off. The final image (joy with "heft of a carefully placed stone") is resonant but not startling. Voice and setting cohere as a singular vision, and the piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk-taking in diction and structure is present but does not sharply elevate stakes; the piece stays within a safe lyric register. Swapping the reactor for another device or the nautilus for another spiral would not fundamentally alter the emotional outcome.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present in opening line, drives the experiment setup (carries reactor, mixes vials, writes coefficients), and makes micro-choices (timing laps, opening the iris, deciding when to stop). Present across all three gates: setup, middle calibration, and closure walk home. However, key turns (the secret whispered, presence compressing) are triggered more by Lio's action and the reactor's response than by the narrator's decisions. The narrator observes and facilitates but does not face a trade-off that narrows options. Causal involvement is moderate; removal would break the ritual but the choices themselves are procedural rather than high-cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Object introduced early ("a nautilus shell columella curl serves as the central spine"), returns in middle ("the nautilus shell columella curl glows, and the spiral draws heat into grammar"), and closes the piece ("I tuck the nautilus spine to sleep, the spiral dimming like a yawn"). Present in all three gates. The spiral's thematic role (spirals remember distance; gathering and releasing) is clear, and its final dimming signals completion. However, the object is more symbolic anchor than causal tool; the story would function with a different core element if the thematic resonance were transferred. It charges the ending image but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Concept signaled early ("We will mix a palette of resolve, and tune the reactor accordingly") and embodied in the three vials (Courage, Mercy, Patience). The palette is handled on-page: "I tip three drops of Courage into the iris, one of Mercy, two of Patience." Present in setup and middle; implicit in closure when the experiment succeeds. The concept shapes tactics (choosing which virtues and in what measure) but does not create a hard trade-off or force a dilemma. The mixing is procedural; swapping the virtues for different named qualities would not fundamentally alter the story's logic. Charges theme more than stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Attribute declared explicitly ("tonight the experiment must be scientifically romantic") and echoed in closure ("Romance in science is not perfume; it is the courage to be precise"). Present in setup and ending but does not constrain a middle action with visible cost. The trait describes the narrator's stance and voice rather than enabling or limiting a choice. It colors tone and theme but remains label-level; the story does not dramatize a moment where being scientifically romantic forces a sacrifice or alters tactics. Could be removed with minor edits to thematic statements without breaking plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Action present throughout: "revalue what matters," "I revalue them in chalk along the tiles," "We revalue again tomorrow." The action is embedded in the two laps around the circle, where each pass "adds a nuance" and "rewrites what the instruments believe." Present in all three gates. The revaluing is causal: it changes the coefficients and enables the experiment's success. However, the mechanics are abstract ("set new weights with my sleeve") and the action could be swapped for recalibrate, retune, or adjust without major structural loss. It shapes the ritual's middle but does not define the closure's emotional turn (the secret does).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("We calibrate by returning differently to the same circle, hand to hand") and dramatized in the two laps around the plaza. The first lap reveals old coefficients; the second teaches the narrator about desire and respect. Present in setup and middle. The method structures the middle beats and enables learning, but the key turn (Lio's secret) does not require iterative return; it arrives in a single moment. The method shapes tactics but does not constrain the closure. Lyric reprise at the end ("Precision lets us return differently, each time more human, each time truer") reweights the concept but arrival is late and thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting anchored in opening line ("The ember nexus at twilight"), described with sensory detail (hums, steam, grates, velvet lines), and closed in final line ("twilight finally exhales, and the ember nexus sleeps"). Present in all three gates. The ember nexus provides the ritual space and its features (grate, tiles, drain) are used in the experiment (reactor placed on grate, coefficients written on tiles, laughter rolls to drain). The plaza's hush during the experiment and resumed commerce after suggest it responds to the work. However, the setting enables rather than constrains; the experiment could occur in a different charged location without major plot changes. It charges atmosphere and closure image but does not force a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled clearly ("Listen, Lio says, the moment is almost ripe. / Ripeness for us means in the moment a secret is whispered between friends") and dramatized on-page when Lio leans and whispers. The timeframe gates the experiment: only when the secret is shared does presence condense ("Only then does presence condense from tendency into bead"). Present in setup (foreshadowed), middle (awaited), and closure (fulfilled and then passed). The timeframe tightens decisions—Lio's signal touch, the narrator's calibration moves—and the story tracks the approach to and passage through this moment. The cost is implicit: vulnerability must be risked at the precise instant. Strong causal role; the experiment's success depends on this exact timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("I want to capture the density of presence, not its rumor. / I want mass you can feel in the wristbones while you speak") and pursued through the reactor work. The desire is particularized (not just presence but its density, its felt weight) and tested by prior failure ("our numbers kept evaporating"). Present in all three gates. The motivation drives the setup, middle calibration, and closure validation ("This is what it means... to capture the density of presence"). However, the desire is more declarative than conflicted; no on-page friction appears between the narrator's want and a competing cost until Lio's question about metrics endangering mystery, which is answered rather than dramatized as dilemma. The motivation is consistent but not pressure-tested with a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone signaled in "We work in directed spontaneity, plans sketched loose, attention held like water" and maintained through the piece's balance of ritual precision (measured drops, lap timing) and improvisational responsiveness (Lio's touch signal, "move, exactly when you feel like pausing"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly from setup (patient anticipation) to peak (intimate vulnerability) to closure (satisfied completion). Present across the arc. However, the tone describes the method more than it charges the final image; the ending's satisfaction is calm rather than dynamically charged. The tone supports atmosphere but does not tighten pressure or create a felt cost. Could be swapped for deliberate improvisation or calibrated intuition without major structural loss.</comment>
