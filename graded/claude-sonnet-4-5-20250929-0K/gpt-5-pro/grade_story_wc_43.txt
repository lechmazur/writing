<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("decisively kind is not a mood but a practice"). Ruth's handling of the vinyl shard shows embodied emotion and contradiction throughout. The reconciliation between Ruth and Lena is earned through prior tension, though Lena's transformation arrives quickly. Minor deduction for the narrator's agency being primarily facilitative rather than conflicted at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure with Causal support). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening beats. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ruth's "flawless goodbye" crystallizes with visible cost (the shard reweighted, sisters reunified, the chord stopped clean). The rooftop journey and Lena's arrival provide causal escalation that narrows options and charges the final image. Cost is legible in Ruth's acceptance and Lena's grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop setting constrains choice (access granted, elevator journey) and charges the final image (sky as witness, fog and gulls). Micro-setting details (blanket, guitar on rails, monitor) anchor spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (orange rind, salt air, dust on vinyl). The shard as recurring object functions as setting-equivalent, constraining tactics and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Ruth's reconciliation with her sister before death, signaled early and tightened by the narrator's call to Lena. One meaningful reversal when Lena arrives and the sisters apologize. The final chord-stopping moment narrows options (the "flawless goodbye" executed with visible cost). Agency is shared between narrator's facilitation and Ruth's choice, which slightly diffuses protagonist pressure but remains coherent under the Hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive reconciliation and the dignity of precise endings emerges through concrete particulars (the shard, the hymning of mundane objects, the stopped chord). The "scent of hope" motif avoids thesis statements and instead accumulates sensory weight (orange rind, unopened rain, salt air). The final image—chord closed "like the lid of a treasured box"—offers a non-literal answer to making endings matter without moralizing. No thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("I hymn the zipper, hymn the knuckle"). Narrative certainty matches what the narrator can know. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Sister, I am here, and I am not leaving this time"). Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure (short declaratives at the chord-stopping beat). Minor deduction for occasional elevated register ("pulsing stillness," "radiant haven") that trends slightly above the narrator's established voice in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines do multiple jobs (the shard is prayer, weapon, memory, pick). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the closure beat. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("sky leans close as witness," "breath poured around it") without full pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the hymning passages ("I sing about…I sing her…") and one paraphrase loop ("pulsing stillness" repeated). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so cap deductions at −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of hospice reconciliation, vinyl shard as catalyst, and "hymning the mundane" as method feels specific and non-obvious. The shard's dual role (wound and prayer) transforms the broken-record trope. The ending's precision (stopped chord, no ragged tail) offers fresh emotional specificity. Risk-taking in the sustained lyric register and unconventional hymning structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, justifying +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The therapist narrator's choices drive key turns: wheeling Ruth to the rooftop, calling Lena twice, using the shard as a pick, and timing the final chord. Present by the first line (setup), constrains middle action (calling Lena, hymning), and shapes the closure (counting three, stopping the chord). Causal pressure is clear; the narrator's facilitation enables Ruth's reconciliation. Specificity is high (decisively kind enacted on the page). Cost is visible in the narrator's emotional labor and the precision demanded at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vinyl shard appears in the first stanza (setup), is used as a pick in the middle (development), and returns reweighted at closure (Lena holds it with Ruth, making "a small, repaired circle"). Drives at least three distinct beats: Ruth's initial clutching, the narrator wrapping it in gauze, and the final shared hold. Causal pressure is strong: the shard represents the sisters' broken past and becomes the agent of reconciliation. Irreplaceable; the story logic depends on this exact object's history and transformation. Cost is tied to the shard's cutting edge and the memory it embodies.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scent of hope appears twice, both in the rooftop scene: first "like orange rind, like hot dust on summer vinyl, like unopened rain," then "brightens again, this time with salt air." Shapes the dominant stake by marking emotional shifts in Ruth's state. Setup is delayed until mid-story, but the concept is signaled through the lyric atmosphere earlier. Development is sensory rather than tactical; it marks emotional progress but does not constrain choices directly. Closure linkage is present (the scent brightens as the goodbye lands). Specificity is high (layered sensory detail). Score in the 7.0 neighborhood but reduced by late setup and limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is named in the second line and enacted on-page: the narrator calls Lena twice despite silence, wheels Ruth to the rooftop, and counts three to execute the precise goodbye. Constrains action (the decision to dial twice, the practice of timing). Development shows the trait under pressure (holding the chord, stopping the sound clean). Closure participation is strong: the final kindness is the flawless goodbye. Cost is visible in the narrator's precision and emotional labor. Irreplaceability is moderate; the trait is specific but could be rephrased without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reunify drives the dominant stake: the narrator calls Lena, Lena arrives, and the sisters apologize and hold hands. Setup is early (the shard "from the record her sister loved, the one shattered the night they fought"). Development is causal (the call, the arrival, the apology). Closure hinges on reunification: "their hands make a small, repaired circle." Irreplaceable; swapping "reunify" for "reconcile" would weaken the specific charge of bringing together what was broken. Cost is visible in Lena's wet cheeks and Ruth's exhale. Three beats involved (call, arrival, hand-holding).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hymning the mundane is signaled early ("I begin hymning the mundane") and its mechanics matter: the narrator sings "coffee stains, a cracked blue bowl, the brave kettle, the grocery list" to calm Ruth and later "the freezer hum, the lemon jar, the Sunday raincoat." Setup is clear. Development constrains tactics (the method soothes Ruth, prepares for Lena's arrival). Closure participation is strong: the hymning continues to the final beats, and the stopped chord is its culmination. Irreplaceable; the specific method defines the narrator's therapeutic approach and shapes the ending's texture. Three beats involved (initial hymning, kettle reprise, final chord).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rooftop ("radiant haven above the clouds") is requested by Ruth, frames the reconciliation scene, and supplies resources (sunlight, fog, gulls) that charge the closure. Setup is early (Ruth asks for it). Development constrains action (the elevator journey, the rooftop access). Closure participation is strong: "the sky leans close as witness," "the sky holds steady." Specificity is high (the setting is Ruth's chosen place, linked to her past smoking). Cost is implicit (the effort to wheel the bed, the final moments above the clouds). Three beats involved (request, journey, reconciliation).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the blood work comes back" opens and closes the story, framing the entire action. Setup is immediate (first line and last stanza). The results ("days, maybe a day") tighten decisions throughout: the urgency to call Lena, the need for a flawless goodbye. Development is implicit (the ticking clock pressures all choices). Closure participation is strong: the final paragraph returns to "after the blood work comes back, this is how we answer." Cost is clear (Ruth is dying, time is short). Irreplaceable; the blood work anchors the medical urgency. Deduction for the clock being implicit rather than dramatized with countdowns or visible passage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ruth's desire to "execute a flawless goodbye" is stated explicitly mid-story and dramatized in the final beats: "She wants to execute a flawless goodbye, she says, no ragged tail of music." Setup is delayed to the second half. Development is strong: Ruth asks the narrator to "pinch the strings at the end and stop the sound clean," they practice once, and the narrator counts three. Closure is the executed goodbye: "The goodbye lands without scatter, gentle as the heel of a sleeping hand." Friction between wants (perfection) and costs (the precision required, the finality) is visible. Irreplaceable; the specific phrasing defines Ruth's stakes. Three beats involved (request, practice, execution).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" appears in the opening ("The morning floor hums with pulsing stillness") and returns at closure ("the stillness keeps pulsing"). The tone modulates with pressure: calm at the start, charged during the rooftop scene, resolving at the final chord. Setup is early. Development is atmospheric rather than tactical; the tone supports but does not constrain choices. Closure participation is strong: the final line invokes "pulsing stillness" to bracket the story. Specificity is high (the oxymoron creates a distinct atmosphere). Deduction for the tone being more thematic than pressure-shaping in the middle beats.</comment>
