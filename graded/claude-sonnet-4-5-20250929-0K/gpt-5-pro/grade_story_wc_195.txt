<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight's interiority is built through embodied perception—visor clouding, armor unsnapping—and his progression from war-bound to possibility-tending reads as earned. However, the internal arc relies heavily on abstraction ("shivering bliss," "loneliness loosened") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to tend possibility feels thematically declared more than dramatically wrestled, and the character's flaws never generate mistakes that compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the knight removes his armor, adopts a murmured oath, and commits to cultivating possibility with visible renunciation of his martial past. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through orchard imagery, the program's blueprint, mirror-pear reflections—culminating in a cadence shift where he becomes gardener rather than warrior. Cost is legible (armor discarded, old allegiance abandoned), though the final image of the hovering pear and his smile edges toward symbolic convenience rather than a sharp, irreversible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is vividly realized through selective sensory detail: citrus constellations, liquid night in canals, quicksilver-glass lattices. The marionette program (vellum that "gleamed like rain") and the bell fruit constrain his choices—he must align with the blueprint, step through the pattern—charging the final image when the pear hovers awaiting his touch. Micro-setting earns the 9+ gate, yet some descriptors ("factually mystical") drift toward ornamental mood rather than spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing possibility versus remaining sealed in martial identity—is signaled early and tightens as he reads the program, follows the shadow-written instructions, and removes his armor piece by piece. Each unsnapping is a small forfeiture, and the mirror pears present credible alternate futures (tyrant, hermit, gardener) that he must choose among. However, no genuine obstacles oppose his progression; the orchard invites rather than tests, so escalation reads as deepening rather than adversarial pressure with visible cost paid under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—possibility versus closure, consent versus command—emerges organically from the knight's choices and the orchard's invitation rather than assertion. The murmured allegiance ("I serve the orchard that serves the possible") and the mirror-pear reflections reweight prior material, offering a conceptual answer without moralizing. The final image (hovering pear, smile, drums "like rain behind glass") resonates as a non-literal answer. Minor penalty: "shivering bliss" and "capture the shape of possibility" verge on prompt-echo abstraction in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent (metaphors drawn from armor, allegiance, performance). Diction remains elevated but stable; however, register drifts into abstract poeticism under pressure ("reality shifts," "meaning" brightening, "votes for the living present") where concrete embodiment would sharpen voice. The narrative certainty about orchard mechanics (what the pears "ask," what the doorway "opens onto") occasionally exceeds what the knight can plausibly infer, reducing POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("syrup," "vines bent like vines," "strings meet finger joints"), but several lines loop or paraphrase: "unsnapped the seal" / "unsnapping old closures" / "unsnap what armor remained" recycles the same image without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("He saw," "He understood," "He realized," "He reached") in the final third, flattening propulsion. Mixed metaphors emerge: "vellum that gleamed like rain" bearing "dust thick as regret," and "air brightened not in light but in meaning" abstracts rather than grounds. Minus −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of knight-renounces-war, alchemical garden, and marionette-as-metaphor is specific and non-obvious, avoiding the tired redemption-through-battle template. The orchard's invitation through "forgotten patterns" and the mirror-pear reflections of possible selves offer a fresh angle on choice and consent. However, the withdrawn-knight-finds-mystical-haven premise is widely used in speculative and lyric genres, and the story does not fully transform it through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus; the orchard never demands sacrifice or tests the knight's resolve with friction. Risk-taking in structure and imagery is present but does not heighten stakes beyond thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The withdrawn knight is present throughout and makes multiple choices: unsealing visor, tracing the pledge, stepping through the pattern, removing armor, touching the pear. His decisions drive beats and the final stance crystallization. However, the knight never faces a genuine obstacle or conflicting desire; the orchard rewards every choice he makes, so his agency shapes the arc without visible cost or friction that his withdrawal might generate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marionette theater program appears early on the workbench, is brushed clean (releasing the insert), read for its pledge and acts, held up to the bell fruit's sound, dipped into liquid night to reveal a blueprint, and carried through the doorway. It constrains his understanding of how to move (blueprint of wrists, hips, stars) and charges the closure by making him an "actor of chances." Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, though its mechanics feel somewhat convenient—dipping it reveals exactly what he needs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"A murmured allegiance" is written in the program's margin, traced by the knight, and then spoken aloud by him in the final third ("I vow to tend what may be"). It reframes his old loud pledges at gates and shapes his final stance toward consent rather than command. The concept drives his choice to remove armor and adopt the gardener role, participating in closure. Cost is felt but somewhat abstract; the allegiance itself is more thematic frame than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" describes the air early on, anchoring the orchard's dual logic of equations and scent. However, the attribute remains decorative label; it does not constrain or enable any on-page action with a visible tradeoff. The knight navigates the space without needing to reconcile fact and mysticism in his tactics or choices. It sets tone but lacks mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unsnap" recurs across multiple beats: unsealing the visor, removing armor buckles ("each click a vote"), and the orchard unsnapping "what armor remained." The action signals his incremental shedding of martial identity and enables the final transformation. Each unsnapping forecloses the possibility of retreat, making it irreplaceable to the closure. The repetition charges the motif, though the third iteration ("let the orchard unsnap") edges toward passive convenience.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns" appears as instruction in the shadow-written text and is enacted when he steps "between vines as if threading a loom." The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—he must align his weight and breath per the blueprint. However, the patterns themselves are never specified or constrained; he simply obeys and the orchard rewards. The method enables but does not test or cost him in a way unique to forgotten patterns versus any ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present throughout, supplying the canal, workbench, star maps, quicksilver lattices, bell fruit, mirror pears, and the doorway. The setting's resources (program, liquid night, blueprint, pears) directly enable his choices and the final threshold. Spatial choreography is clear and the orchard's invitation structures every beat. The "endless night" frames tone and the greenhouse's pressure-free sanctuary allows his transformation, making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" appears in the opening third ("felt the metal hum as reality shifts") and again near the close ("Here, as reality shifts, he would prune"). The timeframe signals a liminal moment and modulates perception (stars move differently after the doorway), but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Time remains vague and untracked; the knight moves at contemplative pace without a clock constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To capture the shape of possibility" is declared in the opening and repeated in his final vow. The motivation drives his presence in the orchard and his choice to adopt the gardener role, shaping the arc. However, the desire is told and thematic rather than dramatized through friction between competing wants or costs. He never risks losing possibility or sacrifices another goal to capture it; the orchard simply grants what he seeks.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears when he unseals the visor ("a shivering bliss that calmed his old wars") and returns in the final lines ("Not triumph, but shivering bliss"). The tone is coherent, modulating from withdrawal through wonder to gardener's calm, and the reprise charges the ending by reweighting his earlier loneliness. The tone supports pressure and the final image, though "bliss" risks sentimentality and the mood remains largely static—awe without friction.</comment>
