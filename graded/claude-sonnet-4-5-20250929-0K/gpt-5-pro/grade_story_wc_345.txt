<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The collective "we" narrator maintains a stable stance with consistent perceptual filters (orchard imagery, texture of survival). Ana's moment holding the bell offers embodied specificity, but most other characters remain undifferentiated from the choral voice. The piece lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values; the community moves as one without friction. Motivation is declared ("strangely trustworthy") rather than earned through dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a ritual pattern (bell relay under arches) and accumulates sensory density toward the nebula's arrival. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the dew arrives, Vine's final chalk message reweights "haunting"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The Orientation Test passes: who (we), where (orchard planet with arches), and when (after strangers become family) anchor by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the sky unbuttoning, the community drinking permission) tightens the dominant stake, but the resolution feels delivered by cosmic timing rather than earned by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock arches constrain the relay choreography and shape the acoustic solution (each arch answers with "a throat"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "woolen body of vapor," "belly of a moth," "dust braiding into faint spirals of silver." The bell itself functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the relay sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax rain from the nebula) is signaled early and pursued through the relay. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening (carrying the bell to the archway at dusk, tilting toward sunset), but the escalation is choreographic rather than driven by protagonist decision under duress. The nebula arrives on schedule; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The resolution reads as cosmic gift rather than earned agency, and no secondary pressure (interpersonal friction, resource scarcity) complicates the attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (collective trust, reweighting "haunting," voices braiding like vines) emerges from image and action rather than statement until Vine's final message—"reexamine what you call haunting"—which borders on direct thesis but is anchored to the chalk artifact and the rain's arrival. The butterfly bell and the arches recur with shifted meaning at closure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (rest returned to mouths, nearer to sleep than dust) without moralizing. No forced thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective focalization with no head-hopping into individuated interiorities; Ana's segment and the narrator's kneeling to read Vine's message are handled as shared witness. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "brambled hope," "voices braid like vines," "unbuttoned" sky. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, though the elevated register ("woolen body of vapor," "throat we had not known it possessed") never degrades under stress. Psychic distance is controlled, but the lack of friction or perceptual shift across the relay flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence runs. Information density is high, with figurative language doing double duty (arches as trellises, bell as vow with wings). Minor loop: "watched the orchards sip and swell, watched children tilt their heads… watched elders sit" recycles "watched" without added pressure. One register drift: "that brambled hope we had learned not to chase" breaks the lyric texture with an abstraction. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high. The final chalk message ("reexamine what you call haunting") risks abstraction but is anchored to the artifact and integrated into the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches, the butterfly garden watering bell, and the altruistic ghost Vine synthesize into a coherent lyric premise. The ritual of bell-relay and acoustic coaxing of rain is fresh and purposeful, not a stock drought-solution. Emotional specificity (Ana holding the bell "as if it were the wrist of a sick friend") lifts generic cooperation into felt detail. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. Risk-taking is present in the lyric "we" voice and the quiet, non-confrontational closure, but the lack of interpersonal friction or a bold turn limits the piece to solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vine (altruistic ghost) is introduced in paragraph 6, present by the ~25% mark. Development: Vine's chalked instructions shape the entire relay sequence (arrows, pairing elders with children, orchestrating collective effort). Closure: Vine traces the final spiral on the sidewalk, and the narrator kneels to read it; the message ("reexamine what you call haunting") reweights the ghost's role and the community's bond. Vine's decisions (what to map, when to warn of rockfall, what to write at the end) create key turns. Causal pressure: Vine's maps enable the relay; without them, the community would lack choreography. Cost connection: Vine remains awake ("only that rest had been returned to our mouths") while the community rests. Specificity: Vine's chalk medium and dawn timing are irreplaceable. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 6), Development (relay instructions across middle), Payoff (final spiral and message at closure). Positive signals: early signal +0.5, two distinct beats (instructions, final message) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4. No frictions. Starting anchor 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, but Vine does not appear on the page as a character making choices under pressure—only as a disembodied author of messages. Vine's agency is indirect; decisions happen off-stage. This lowers beat involvement and causal pressure credit. Adjusted to 6.7 for strong setup/payoff but limited on-page agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Butterfly garden watering bell introduced paragraph 11 (~40% mark). Development: carried beneath each arch, tapped with measured wrists, Ana holds the handle, tilted at dusk to sound across the valley. Closure: "the butterfly garden watering bell" named in the climactic tilt; its note joins the arches' throats and unbuttoned the sky. Beat involvement: four distinct beats (introduction, relay handling, Ana's hold, dusk tilt). Causal pressure: the bell's chime is the instrument that coaxes the nebula down. Closure linkage: the bell's action precipitates the rain. Specificity: "green with age and etched with wings," "dripped and chimed at once," "note slid across the valley"—irreplaceable. Cost connection: the bell is wrapped in "dignity," handled with care, carried through fatigue. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 11, just past first third), Development (relay beats), Payoff (dusk tilt at closure). Positive signals: beat involvement (four beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5. Frictions: late first appearance (second third) −0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 5.2 − 0.4 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nebula of respite introduced paragraph 9 (~35% mark). Development: Vine writes that it is "migrating low this season"; the choreography aims to "loosen the sky and coax the vapor down." Closure: "the nebula of respite slouched over the ridge," met the music, dissolved into threads, and brought dew. The concept shapes the dominant stake (coax rain from nebula) and the tactics (bell relay to ring the soil and call it). Beat involvement: two distinct beats (Vine's announcement, arrival at closure). Causal pressure: the nebula's migratory path and the community's ritual are interdependent. Closure linkage: the nebula's arrival is the climactic event. Specificity: "woolen body of vapor that smelled like old orchards in spring"—vivid and irreplaceable. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 9), Development (implicit in relay planning), Payoff (closure). Positive signals: beat involvement (two beats) +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7. Frictions: late first appearance (second third) −0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 4.3 − 0.4 = 6.9, but the nebula is more cosmic event than manipulable stake; the community cannot fail or succeed in altering its path, only attract it. This passive framing lowers causal pressure credit. Adjusted to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" appears in paragraphs 8 and 18 as a descriptor for the community and Vine. Setup: paragraph 8, "we were strangely trustworthy to one another" (~30% mark). Development: paragraph 18, "the ghost was strangely trustworthy even to the wary." Closure: not explicitly present, though trust enables the relay. The attribute is asserted twice but not dramatized through a moment where distrust is overcome with visible cost. No on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait; it functions as thematic gloss. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 8), Development (label-only), Payoff (absent). Positive signals: early signal +0.5. Frictions: ornamental use (description without action pressure) −0.8, swappability (could be "deeply bonded" or "surprisingly unified") −0.6, label-only trait −0.3. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.5 − 1.7 = 1.8, but the attribute does enable the no-refusal relay dynamic and frames the community's cohesion. Adjusted to 5.2 for thematic presence and structural enablement without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears explicitly in two beats: paragraph 14 (Vine instructs "reexamine our grudges and swap shifts") and the final paragraph (Vine's last spiral: "Reexamine what you call haunting"). Setup: paragraph 14 (~50% mark). Development: the community acts on this instruction by swapping shifts without refusal. Closure: the final chalk message circles back to "reexamine," reweighting the ghost's presence and the community's bond. The action shapes one key turn (shift-swapping enables the relay) and charges the final image. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 14, late but clear), Development (dramatized in relay), Payoff (closure message). Positive signals: beat involvement (two beats) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5. Frictions: late first appearance (second third) −0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 3.6 − 0.4 = 6.2, but "reexamine" is more thematic verb than plot action; it does not create a turn so much as frame reflection. Adjusted to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chalked messages on deserted sidewalks at dawn introduced paragraphs 3–5 (~15% mark). Development: Vine's chalk provides instructions (arrows showing wind carry, pairing relays, choreography, "Ascend the archway at dusk"). Closure: Vine traces "one last spiral on the sidewalk," and the narrator kneels to read before dew erases it. The method is the sole communication channel between Vine and the community; it shapes every tactical decision. Beat involvement: five distinct beats (initial plan, arrows, pairing instructions, dusk instruction, final spiral). Causal pressure: without the chalk, no relay occurs. Closure linkage: the final message is delivered via chalk. Specificity: dawn timing, dew erasure, and the ephemeral medium are irreplaceable. Gate model: Setup (paragraphs 3–5), Development (arrows and instructions across middle), Payoff (final spiral at closure). Positive signals: early signal +0.7, beat involvement (five beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.8. No frictions. Starting anchor 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, but the method is largely instrumental; it does not impose cost or complicate tactics. Adjusted to 7.2 for pervasive presence and strong setup/payoff without friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating rock arches introduced paragraphs 2–3 (~10% mark). Development: the arches' shadows "braided our fields like patient trellises"; the relay carries the bell "beneath each floating rock arch in sequence"; the arches answer the bell's note "each one with a throat we had not known it possessed." Closure: the arches join the sound, enabling the nebula to dissolve into threads that stitch "the arches to the clouds." The setting supplies the acoustic architecture that makes the ritual work. Beat involvement: four distinct beats (introduction, relay sequence, acoustic response, closure stitching). Causal pressure: the arches are the instrument that amplifies the bell and attracts the nebula. Closure linkage: the arches' response is the hinge moment. Specificity: floating, shadow-braiding, throat-possessing arches are irreplaceable. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Gate model: Setup (paragraphs 2–3), Development (relay under arches), Payoff (acoustic response at closure). Positive signals: early signal +0.8, beat involvement (four beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.8. No frictions. Starting anchor 3.0 + 6.2 = 9.2, but the arches do not constrain a choice or impose cost; they enable the ritual without opposition. This lowers the 9+ gate requirement. Adjusted to 7.4 for essential presence and strong closure linkage without friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" appears as the opening phrase and in paragraph 16 ("Because this was after strangers become family, nobody refused"). Setup: paragraph 1 (immediate). Development: the phrase frames the community's cohesion but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Closure: not present. The timeframe is a premise, not a pressure. No live clock; the relay proceeds from dawn to dusk, but elapsed time does not narrow options. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 1), Development (thematic gloss), Payoff (absent). Positive signals: early signal +0.8. Frictions: ornamental use (frames cohesion without action pressure) −0.8, missing closure participation (cap 2.8 waived for early+thematic presence). Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.8 − 0.8 = 3.0, but the phrase does set the emotional stakes and justify the no-refusal dynamic. Adjusted to 4.8 for premise-setting and thematic coherence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To orchestrate collective effort" is Vine's explicit goal in paragraph 14 and implicit throughout the relay design. Setup: paragraph 14 (~50% mark). Development: Vine maps relays, pairs elders with children, grief with patience, muscle with song. Closure: the collective succeeds; the orchards drink, and the final message celebrates voices braiding like vines. The motivation is dramatized through the relay choreography and the community's unified movement. Beat involvement: three distinct beats (Vine's instruction, relay execution, closure celebration). Causal pressure: orchestration enables the ritual's success. Closure linkage: the final message ("your voices braid like vines") reweights the motivation. Specificity: pairing by trait (grief/patience, muscle/song) is purposeful and irreplaceable. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 14, late), Development (relay execution), Payoff (closure message). Positive signals: beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Frictions: late first appearance (second third) −0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 4.4 − 0.4 = 7.0, but the motivation is Vine's, not the protagonist's; the "we" narrator acts without internal friction. Adjusted to 6.9 for strong structural presence without protagonist conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" appears explicitly in paragraph 20 ("that brambled hope we had learned not to chase") and implicitly throughout: "the light pricked with that brambled hope" recurs as a motif. Setup: paragraph 20 (~65% mark, late but purposeful). Development: the tone modulates from caution ("hope we had learned not to chase") to tentative permission ("cool hush that told us to breathe again") to fulfillment ("dew came, soft as the belly of a moth"). Closure: the final message ("rest had been returned to our mouths, and that was nearer to sleep than dust") sustains the brambled quality—relief shadowed by ongoing vigilance. The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image. Beat involvement: three distinct beats (brambled hope declaration, dew arrival, final message). Causal pressure: the tone shapes reader expectation and tempers triumph. Closure linkage: the final line sustains brambled hope without resolution. Specificity: "brambled"—thorned, catching, difficult—is irreplaceable. Gate model: Setup (paragraph 20, late but clear), Development (tonal modulation across dew arrival), Payoff (closure line). Positive signals: beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7. Frictions: late first appearance (final third) −0.8. Starting anchor 3.0 + 3.7 − 0.8 = 5.9, but the tone is taught implicitly from the opening and sustained throughout. Adjusted to 7.6 for strong coherence and closure charge despite late explicit naming.</comment>
