<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is distinctive and embodied through specific perceptual habits ("the way you might interrogate a sleeping house by listening through the window sash"). The tutor remains enigmatic yet consistent, his patiently nimble hands and refusal to blink creating a coherent character signature. The final promise to "carry sugar and questions" emerges from the accumulation of weekly tea sessions and represents a credible commitment with relational cost. Minor slip: the tutor's reveal about being "dead" arrives late and feels more ornamental than causal, though it doesn't undermine the central relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early (garden breathes like a library, meteors as punctuation) and holds it through closure. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the narrator's promise to "practice hospitality for quiet structures" crystallizes a stance with relational cost (ongoing commitment to carry sugar and questions). The seal's impression "cooling on my wrist like borrowed authority" makes the conceptual cost—accepting responsibility for translation—legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator speaks a small truth to the building and it sighs in recognition, narrowing the stance from observation to participation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden constrains the entire encounter spatially and the meteor shower provides temporal punctuation that structures the teaching session. The seal, basil, broken tiles, and parapet are handled concretely and pressure the final act (seal impression on wrist). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "basil smelled like a green encyclopedia after the lights are out" reflects the narrator's bookish perceptual lens. The micro-setting (roof as mapped paragraphs, gutters as commas) charges the closure by making the building's "grammar" a tactile presence that the narrator commits to learning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled in line two and tightens when the tutor demonstrates the seal, then deepens when the narrator must speak a truth back to answer the building. The final promise forecloses casual tourism and commits the narrator to sustained practice with visible relational cost (weekly return, carrying questions). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through recurring ritual (tea, seal-stamping, meteor punctuation) and the narrator's shift from passive observation to active response. The coincidence of the meteor shower complicates timing but does not resolve the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the necessity of "agreed upon lies" as tender coverings that let truth step outside—emerges through concrete ritual (seal, beeswax, whispered permissions) rather than assertion. The final image of "truths...dressed as the gentlest lies" reweights the entire encounter without moralizing: hospitality and courtesy become epistemological methods. The seal as "how a city signs what it is unwilling to admit" provides a non-literal answer to how we authorize vulnerable knowledge. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the closing gesture (buildings speaking in courtesies, interrogation as politeness) organically extends the premise with conceptual cost now visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator thinks in bookish conceits (garden breathes like a library, steam as typesetting, basil as encyclopedia) that remain consistent under pressure. Diction stays within an erudite register without drift; metaphors drawn from texts and architecture cohere with the narrator's stated goal to learn building-language. The tutor's indirect speech ("Do not rush...the past prefers patience") contrasts purposefully with the narrator's image-dense reflection. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during seal-handling, wider during meteor observations. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, relationship, and the learning dynamic simultaneously. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated (garden as library, meteors as punctuation lessons). Minor deductions: some constructions approach ornamental ("streaks like signatures written too fast to be forgery" restates the punctuation metaphor without adding pressure); a few filter verbs ("felt its vowels," "heard the roof sigh") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Rhythm modulates appropriately with scene pressure. Strong propulsion overall despite occasional decorative excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of language-learning, architecture, ritual, and meteor shower as simultaneous translation lesson feels specific and non-obvious. The framing of hospitality and courtesy as epistemological tools rather than social niceties transforms familiar material. The tutor as "dead language tutor" whose deadness "had only hardened recently" offers a fresh inflection on ghost-mentor tropes. The piece commits fully to its premise (buildings speak, seals authorize whispers) without retreat. Risk-taking in sustained metaphor and lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Avoids template structures; the rooftop teaching session could not be trivially relocated or recast.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dead language tutor is present from line three and drives two key beats: demonstrating the seal (middle) and asking for a final translation/promise (closure). His decision to share the seal and its family history enables the narrator's learning. His choices (showing the seal, pressing it to the parapet, asking for reciprocal truth) create the turns that move the narrator from observation to commitment. The reveal about being "dead" arrives late but doesn't shape tactics. Causal pressure is strong; his agency structures the entire encounter and the final promise would not exist without his orchestration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears early (line six), is handled in three distinct beats (unwrapping, pressing into beeswax over candle, touching to parapet; later the narrator receives its impression on the wrist), and returns with reweighted meaning in the closure (borrowed authority that commits the narrator to ongoing practice). Its specific mechanics (cold metal, beeswax softening, cooling impression) constrain the ritual and make the transmission of authority concrete. Removal would collapse the tactile method by which the building "signs" and the narrator receives permission. High irreplaceability; the seal's family history and physical properties are causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core concept "agreed upon lies" is named explicitly (line nine) and shapes the dominant stake: the narrator must learn to speak truths "wrapped in courtesy" to interrogate buildings without violence. The concept constrains the method (polite questions, hospitality as epistemology) and charges the closure when the narrator commits to carrying "truths...dressed as the gentlest lies." It appears in three beats: initial naming, the narrator's apartment admission ("pretends to be temporary"), and the final promise. The concept directly alters tactics—hospitable rather than extractive questioning—and the ending would lose coherence without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is attributed to the tutor's hands in line five and demonstrated twice: threading steam and arranging cups, then pressing the seal into beeswax. The trait enables the ritual precision required for the seal's use. However, no visible cost or trade-off is tied to this specific attribute; the patience could be swapped for "deliberate" or "careful" without structural loss. It characterizes the tutor's manner but does not constrain a key choice or create friction. Functional but mid-replaceable; it enhances texture more than it drives causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Interrogate" is seeded early (line two: "learn the language") and surfaces explicitly in line twelve ("interrogate a sleeping house by listening") and again at closure ("I, politely, interrogated back"). The action defines the narrator's method and the tutor's instruction ("listen for the parts...that are ashamed"). The final promise to "interrogate back" with courtesy completes the learning arc; removing this exact verb would require replacing the epistemological stance entirely. It drives the narrator's shift from passive observation to active, ethical questioning and is irreplaceable in framing the relationship between narrator and buildings.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions" is introduced in line four as the origin of the relationship and recurs in the closure promise ("carry sugar and questions"). It frames the ongoing commitment and the accidental-yet-persistent intimacy that enables the teaching. The method shapes the relationship's texture (informal, accumulative, unfinished errand) and the final promise would lose weight without the sugar-carrying ritual. Present in two beats with thematic resonance, but the mechanics of sugar-borrowing do not constrain a middle choice. Solid integration via setup and closure reprise; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during a meteor shower is established in line one and anchors the entire scene spatially and temporally. The setting supplies the teaching resources (basil, broken tiles, parapet for the seal), and the meteor shower provides the "punctuation lesson" that structures the tutor's instruction and recurs in four beats. The rooftop's openness allows the city's "grammar" to be mapped (gutters, chimneys, ladder as syntax), and the meteors' timing creates the pressure for the narrator to "speak back." Removing the setting would collapse both the spatial logic and the metaphoric framework. Indispensable; the environment actively shapes tactics and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Timeframe: None</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the language of old buildings" is stated in line two and drives every choice: accepting the tutor's invitation, practicing with the seal, speaking a truth to the building, and promising to return. Friction appears when the narrator must reciprocate with a vulnerable admission ("my apartment pretends to be temporary"), creating a cost for learning. The motivation is tested on the page (not merely told) when the building "sighed as if it recognized the performance." The final promise to "practice hospitality for quiet structures until the city admitted me by name" completes the arc with visible relational and temporal cost. Irreplaceable; the entire encounter pivots on this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone of "mysterious familiarity" is established early (garden breathes like a library, sugar-borrowing that "kept forgetting to finish") and modulates purposefully: the tutor's calm patience contrasts with the meteor shower's punctuation, creating a tension between the ordinary (tea, basil) and the numinous (sky translating itself, buildings whispering). At closure, the tone charges the final image: buildings now speak "in courtesies" and the narrator interrogates "politely," blending mystery (city signing what it won't admit) with domestic ritual (carrying sugar). The tone does not flatten under pressure; instead, it tightens the paradox that truth requires agreed-upon covering. Coherent and essential to the ending's resonance.</comment>
