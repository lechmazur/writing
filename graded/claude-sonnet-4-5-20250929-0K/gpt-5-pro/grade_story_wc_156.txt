<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The restorer's interior is vivid and distinct—"exchange certainty for curiosity" anchors motivation—but choices are predominantly observational. The nested-self recognition moment ("I see then that I am in the mural as well") offers conceptual richness yet remains reflective rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The piece establishes a perceptual signature but lacks an on-page decision that forecloses a path under pressure, capping the score despite strong embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through echo-work, nested imagery, and the wall's "reply" that reweights the opening question. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist leaves the coin and departs knowing she will "be inside their listening, waking again"), crystallizing stance with conceptual cost—she trades singularity for perpetual recursion. Orientation is secure by line 3; the lens holds. The cost is legible but oblique, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden, console, hobo nickel, and plaster wall are deployed with purpose: the nickel guides echo, the console filters tone, the garden shapes her exit. Micro-setting (body + tool) constrains method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. Economy is high; no postcard detours. The recurring nickel and echo mechanics lift this into strong territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the mural by listening—is clear early. Pressure accumulates via nested awakenings and echo-mapping, but the protagonist faces no reversal or forced trade-off; the wall's cooperation is assured. The "pause between question and reply" generates atmospheric tension yet no on-page cost alters tactics. Without a tightening that narrows options, escalation remains steady rather than rising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—listening as transformation, curiosity over certainty—emerges organically from echo-work, nested selves, and the mentor's maxim. The final image (protagonist as echo inside another's listening) reweights the opening question without moralizing. The "bewitch impatience through reflected sound" epigram risks didacticism but is grounded in the city's history. Subtext operates cleanly; particulars cohere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-philosophical, consistent and controlled: "patience is a door you open with sound" and "each petal another room where someone wakes" carry syntactic signature. POV is stable first-person, no head-hopping. Diction occasionally tips elevated ("begets," "bewitch," "graphite rain") but remains coherent under the restorer's sensibility. Perceptual signature is strong (sound-tuned observation). The piece teaches its pattern early; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. No paraphrase loops or pronoun drift. Minor overwriting: "nested awakenings, each echo catching the next like a set of hands ready to raise a friend" stacks vehicles without adding pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("cranes unfolding from paper sleep," "time flowers outward"), risking saturation in peak beats. Read-aloud ear test passes; no causality obscured. Modest deduction for decorative metaphor spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—mural restoration via tuned echo, nested-self recursion, listening as bewilderment—feels specific and non-obvious. The hobo nickel as "lens for patience" and the portable console filtering transients show invention. Risk-taking is present (lyric-philosophical register, conceptual closure) and coherent. The premise avoids templates; transformation test holds. No proximity to famous lines. Slight hedge on boldness: the restorer succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the restorer claps, guides the nickel, nudges the console stylus, and signs the wall—four distinct beats. Choices are methodical but not under dueling pressure; the wall cooperates. Closure linkage is solid (leaves coin, steps onto hedge-path). Causal pressure is limited: decisions enable rather than narrow options. Mid-band for involvement without high-stakes trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hobo nickel appears in three beats: opening ("place…in my palm"), mid-scene ("held like a tiny shield"), and closure ("leave the coin pressed where shadow will keep it cool"). Its carved waves and mentor's lesson prime the listening theme. It guides echo physically, constrains method, and charges the ending via symbolic deposit. Swappable with another talisman at minor edits, capping score below 7.0 despite solid reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nested awakenings structure the middle third: "One note begets another," "each echo catching the next," "each petal another room where someone wakes." The concept shapes the protagonist's recognition ("I see then that I am in the mural") and directly informs closure ("I will be inside their listening, waking again"). It alters understanding rather than options, placing it in mid-7s. Irreplaceable for closure's conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is named twice ("hands are methodically playful," "staying methodically playful") and demonstrated via "rehearsing little games with brushes and mirrors" and "nudges the lines to coax." The trait enables technique but does not constrain or generate on-page cost; it describes process without friction. Two-gate involvement (setup, middle) but no closure linkage or visible trade-off. Mid-band for label-plus-action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears in two key beats: "I bewitch the pigments to remember their first astonishment" and the city's caption "We learned to bewitch our own impatience." The action defines method and ties to theme, but could swap for "coax" or "invite" without structural collapse. It enables the wall's response yet does not force a unique turn. Solid causal role, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reflected sound is signaled early (console filters tonality, claps generate echo), deployed across multiple beats (nickel bends sound, echoes lift notes, console traces lines), and integral to mechanics and closure. The method shapes every choice: "transients, the clean pings that map a space when you ask and wait." The garden's final trick (hedge shaping echo into path) recharges it. Removing it collapses story logic. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sound wave garden anchors setting from line 2, supplies resources (hedges hum, fountains sketch ripples, console), and constrains method (the mural is tuned to echo). The garden's final trick—shaping the protagonist's echo into a path—directly alters her exit. Two gates (setup, closure), causal pressure moderate. Irreplaceable for the sound-tuned premise but does not generate mid-scene friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the pause between question and reply" is named once mid-story and functions as atmospheric frame ("the garden inhales and the wall loosens its throat"). The timeframe is not tracked as clock or deadline; no tactic shifts based on elapsed duration. Lyric resonance present but no causal pressure. Late signal, ornamental use, no closure linkage. Low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is declared early ("I came here to exchange certainty for curiosity") and reprised at closure ("what I came for was the trading"). The desire shapes her method (filtering tone to hear transients, staying playful) and final understanding. No on-page friction tests the trade-off; curiosity does not cost her certainty in a visible beat. Two-gate involvement, thematic weight, but no dramatized conflict. Mid-6s.</comment>
