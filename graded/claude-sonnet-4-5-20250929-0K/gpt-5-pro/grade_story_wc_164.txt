<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's occupation and method are established through vivid particulars (crater glass, transliteration), but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bright sorrow," "cheerful gloom") without embodied contradiction acting in scene. The promise to the bird and the final stance feel asserted rather than earned through a visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (brushing seeds, pressing glass) but the protagonist's internal conflict never dramatizes competing impulses simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and motifs through seed-constellations and transliterated glyphs, achieving a cadence shift at closure when the cave "winks" and leaves ribbons. However, the Orientation Test fails: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~15% in), and the narrative window remains hazy throughout. Cost is implied in the agreement with the bird but not made undeniable on the page; the protagonist's options do not visibly narrow. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap downstream.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The geode's iridescent ribs, quartz corridors, and mica mirrors are vivid and voice-filtered through the recollectionist's metaphoric perception. Spatial choreography holds across moves (climbing, walking ghost-bridges, meeting the bird at the heart). The crater glass functions as micro-setting, constraining the transliteration method and charging the final ledge placement. Cap applied per orientation debt in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover why paths disappear before memory fades) is signaled early. The seed-scattering and thread-mapping constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights the cave's behavior from erasure to compromise. However, the bird's arrival and the protagonist's promise feel coincidental rather than protagonist-driven; no visible price is paid—stamina, risk, or social credit—that alters later tactics. One tightening present but agency and cost remain underlit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between preservation and access: "the cave protects the softest stories by vanishing them" versus "missing pieces make them fall in puzzlement." The final image of ribbons and seed-threads offers a resonant answer without moralizing—kindness can hide and still be found. The recurring motif of transliteration reweights meaning at closure. No thematic echo or sermon in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: "light grins sadly," "foam forgets," "cobweb math." Diction is consistently lyric and metaphor-dense, voice-motivated and legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but do not flatten immediacy. No dialogue present. Distance is stable. However, the heightened register risks alienating clarity under pressure; some readers may find the figurative density excessive in peak beats without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating density that enriches texture but occasionally muddles propulsion. Mixed-vehicle moments: "eats footpaths like a tide eats castles" works, but "corridor blinked, then slid sideways with a sound like turning pages" conflates visual and auditory vehicles. Paraphrase loops are minimal; template cadence absent. Overwriting penalty (−0.4 for density in high-pressure beats) and one mixed-metaphor instance (−0.3) applied; no artifacts touch closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist role, crater-glass transliteration, and seed-constellation navigation form a non-obvious synthesis specific to this narrator's logic. The premise (a cave that hides paths to protect them) transforms familiar "guide" and "memory-keeper" tropes through grounded world rules and lyric specificity. Risk is present in the layered metaphoric frame, which heightens stakes without obscuring the core tension. The transformation test holds: swapping names/places would strip the piece's integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sea-foam recollectionist: setup (first line), development (brushing seeds, pressing glass at junctions), closure participation (promise to the bird, tracing final glyphs). Decisions (reading via seeds, singing to constellations, setting the glass on a ledge) shape the middle arc and the ending compromise. Causal pressure moderate; specificity high. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, specificity +0.5 = base ~7.2; swappability concern (a different guide could perform similar steps) −0.6, cost not tied to role −0.5 → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crater glass: setup (paragraph 7, ~12% in), development (held to ear for beach speech, held to cave for glyph transliteration, tasted by seed-patterns, pressed at junctions), closure (set on ledge, final glyphs traced). Present in at least four beats with evolving function. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.6 = base ~7.8; late first touch (second paragraph after opening) −0.0 (within tolerance) → 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Missing pieces: setup (paragraph 5–6, "missing pieces paper over the centuries"), development (drives the inquiry, the cave lifts trails "like stencils, leaving negative corridors"), closure ("which missing pieces want to be paths and which want to be songs"). Shapes stakes throughout and reconfigures the ending's logic. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, specificity +0.4 = base ~7.0; strong thematic integration and irreplaceability +0.3 → 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transliterates emotions: setup (paragraph 9, crater glass "transliterates emotions into glyphs of pale soot"), development (paragraph 18, "transliterates emotions into travel instructions"), closure (paragraph 28, "transliterate their happiness and fear"). Mentioned across three beats but function is mostly descriptive; no visible tradeoff or constraint shown (the glass always works). Early signal +0.6, three mentions +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure +0.4, specificity +0.5 = base ~5.7; label-only use in beats −0.3, ornamental at closure +0.5 → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Conjecture: appears once (paragraph 21, "I made a conjecture, cheerful as a bruise: that the cave protects the softest stories by vanishing them"). Does not drive a turn; instead it articulates a theme already enacted. Could be removed with no structural impact. Late appearance (mid-story) −0.3, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6, summary-only −0.5 = base ~2.1; thematic resonance +0.4, lyric reprise (linked to "cheerful gloom") +0.3, closure echo in final paragraphs +1.4 → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Via scattered seeds: setup (paragraph 13, bird drops seeds through geode wound), development (paragraph 15–16, seeds take up glow, point where paths nodded; brushed into patterns), middle intensification (paragraph 22, seeds crack and sprout translucent threads mapping absences), closure participation (paragraph 26, bird promises to drop seeds wisely as signposts). Drives the method across four beats with evolving mechanics. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = base ~8.7; slight swappability (another marker could work) −0.5 → 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Iridescent cave inside geode: setup (paragraph 2), development (corridors blink and slide, crystal ribs, heart of geode where bird pecks mica), closure (cave sheds laugh, winks, leaves ribbons). Environment constrains the inquiry (paths vanish, cave rearranges) and supplies the challenge the protagonist solves. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.6 = base ~7.3; postcard-description moments (mica mirror) −0.2 → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Before memory fades: mentioned once (paragraph 4, "before memory fades"), then echoed thematically ("the cave forgets in motion"). No on-page clock tightens decisions; the bird met at the heart does not force urgency. Late setup (paragraph 4, ~7%) −0.2, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6, no middle constraint −0.0, thematic echo +0.3, lyric resonance (links to recollectionist role) +0.5, closure participation (keeping memory intact) +1.6 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Discover why paths disappear: setup (paragraph 4), development (drives the seed-reading, transliteration, and thread-mapping), closure (paths become "half visible, half song" and ribbons guide travelers). Desire is enacted across beats but internal friction (cost of preservation vs. access) is told more than dramatized. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.4 = base ~7.0; told-only interiority −0.3 → 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cheerful gloom: setup (paragraph 3, "cheerful gloom that suits my work"), development (paragraph 21, "conjecture, cheerful as a bruise"; paragraph 27, cave says "Cheerful gloom" without a mouth, narrator agrees "sadness is beautiful when it helps"), closure (final tone of quiet resolve and shadowed smile). Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (cheerful resolve shifts to shadowed acceptance), and charges the final image. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cadence modulation +0.6 = base ~7.1; strong thematic integration and tonal consistency under pressure +0.8 → 7.9.</comment>
