<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's role as "cast lots decision maker" is clear and specific, with embodied detail (coins clicking, breathing rituals). Interior contradiction appears in "quietly enthusiastic even as doubt flowers" and "stellar doubt keeps one finger on my heart," showing simultaneous impulses. The final choice—to sing a patient hello rather than other options—is earned by the coin pattern and carries visible cost (distilling last drops, trusting pattern over certainty). Minor weakness: some interiority leans abstract ("wavelength align with purpose") rather than concrete sensation, and the change reads more as ritual completion than profound transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the narrator stands "forward, held by the amber, quiet, and angled toward beginning" with cost visible in exhausted resources ("last drips") and sustained doubt. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of ritual, prophecy decoding, and coin-pattern interpretation until the final song crystallizes stance. Orientation anchors who (decision maker), where (observatory deck), and when (after contraction) by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the backwards prophecy reveals "we already sang" and the narrator translates coin patterns into the choice of "patient hello," narrowing options with cost (gentleness over amnesty, guidance after announcement).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck constrains multiple choices: amber residue becomes coolant, the railings provide distillation material, the deck floor hosts coin patterns that determine antenna configuration. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through ritual attention: "room brightens to old honey," "tastes of metal and honey and leaning possibility." The micro-setting (console, receiver, coil, velvet bowls) functions as active equipment that responds to inputs and shapes the final song attempt. Spatial choreography remains coherent across casting, listening, distilling, and singing moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tuning the newborn field's note via honest scatter—is signaled early and remains coherent. One clear tightening: initial casting identifies the need (lullaby/hello balance), prompting the narrator to "turn the dial until the static bursts tighten into a single ribbon" and commit to the patient-hello choice. Agency is decision and renunciation (keeping scatter honest, not steering longing) with visible cost: exhausting coolant reserves and sustaining unresolved doubt. The backwards prophecy acts as external pressure forcing the narrator to translate rather than impose meaning, and coincidence (where coins land) complicates rather than resolves—the narrator must interpret and act on the pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: faith as "waiting with tools, letting lots fall where they must, and trusting pattern where certainty failed." The final image—standing forward, held by amber, angled toward beginning—offers a resonant answer to how choice survives contraction without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the tension between control (decision maker role) and surrender (democratic scatter), and in the backwards prophecy that reveals future kindness without guaranteeing present success. No late moralizing; the story commits to its premise that tuning requires honest randomness, not intention. The amber motif charges closure by exhausting its supply while holding the protagonist in place.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: technical ritual details (impedance, antenna arrays, static bursts) filtered through metaphoric compression ("stellar doubt," "warm gravity"). Diction stays consistent—lyric, compressed, concrete—under pressure: "The receiver gasps into song, not forward, but peeling backward, syllables swallowed into consonants, then to breath, then to pulse." Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (many clauses beginning with "I," parallel phrase structures) teach a ritual cadence that supports the accumulative lens. No head-hopping; narrator knowledge stays bounded by what static and coins reveal. Brief elision (how exactly the song transmission works) imposes cost (uncertainty) that pays off in the final "leaning possibility."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, prophecy decoding, or choice. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: amber as trapped time, coins as tuning geometry, static as backwards speech. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "stellar doubt threads everything like the echo of burned chimes" stacks metaphor without clear payoff, and "our voices carried in amber breath" mixes registers. Template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" openings across multiple paragraphs, reducing rhythmic variation. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but the syntactic uniformity and occasional mixed metaphors ("lowering its lonely hum" anthropomorphizes then drops the effect) pull the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-contraction ritual democracy via randomized coin patterns interpreted through backwards audio—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of common tropes (prophecy, last survivor, cosmic reset) through procedural ritual grounded in distillation and antenna tuning creates freshness. The backwards-prophecy mechanic is integrated causally: it teaches that the note must arise from "democratic scatter," forcing the protagonist to honor randomness rather than impose will. Risk-taking in voice (compressed, lyric-technical fusion) and structure (accumulative rather than causal plot) heightens stakes without obscuring the closure effect. Minor limitation: the post-contraction premise shares DNA with many "survivors tune the new cosmos" templates; transformation via specificity (coins, amber, static decoding) restores range but does not radically subvert the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: role established in opening lines. Development: casts coins twice, interprets patterns to narrow choices (lullaby vs. oath vs. hello). Closure: final casting determines the song's note and the narrator stands "forward, held by the amber" in the role. The character's decisions create both major turns (which promises to seed, committing to patient hello). Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; the role shapes every beat and the ending stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in first paragraph. Development: used in two distinct beats (initial cast identifies receiver hum response, second cast translates promises into hello choice) with mechanics detailed (gold hums left, tin whispers, pattern determines impedance). Closure: gathered and translated into the final song choice. Each coin's specific properties (hole, edge, anthem) matter, and removal would break the decision mechanism. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure; cost is implied in the exhaustion of options (last casting).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("last recording from old spectrum priests"). Development: constrains method (must throw then listen then learn, song runs backward) and reveals stakes (future sang kindly, note must be democratic). Closure: prophecy's instruction shapes the final patient-hello choice and standing-forward stance. The backwards audio mechanism is specific and irreplaceable; it redefines the task from composition to interpretation. Moderate causal pressure; the prophecy instructs more than it pressures, but the cost is visible (must honor scatter, not intention).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: declared in opening ("quietly enthusiastic even as doubt flowers"). Development: the trait appears as label more than action; enthusiasm is stated but not dramatized in a choice with visible cost tied specifically to this quality. Closure: doubt persists ("keeps one finger on my heart") but quiet enthusiasm does not charge the final image or constrain the choice. Present and coherent but largely ornamental; swapping for "cautiously hopeful" would require minimal edits. Label-only usage and lack of distinct cost lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("I distill coolant from amber residue"). Development: distillation enables receiver operation (first use), then becomes a limiting resource ("last drips") that pressures the timing of the final attempt. Closure: pouring the last coolant into the wells completes the array's readiness and the action's arc; the song finishes and the story ends. The action is causally indispensable (no coolant = no song), appears in three distinct beats, and the resource limit imposes visible cost. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("learned understanding static bursts the way sailors learn swells"). Development: used to decode the backwards prophecy ("counting intervals until letters assemble from crackle") and tighten the broadcast ("static bursts tighten into a single ribbon"). Closure: the clearing of static signals success, but the method itself does not transform in the final image. Functional across two beats with causal role (decoding enables choice), but the mechanics could be swapped for another signal-parsing method with moderate edits. Moderate causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: title image, established in opening lines. Development: deck supplies amber residue for coolant, railings provide distillation material, floor hosts coin-pattern geometry, console houses controls. Closure: the protagonist is "held by the amber" and standing on the deck in the final line, and the deck's sunset-trapped state frames the timeless ritual. The setting is irreplaceable; every key action depends on the deck's unique properties. Strong beat involvement, constraint provision, and closure charge. High integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: framing device in opening line. Development: contraction aftermath supplies the stakes (tuning the next beginning) and the material constraints (collapsed worlds, starless dark, amber residue from "exploded winters"). Closure: "angled toward beginning" completes the temporal arc. The timeframe is more premise than active pressure; it sets conditions but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat like a countdown would. Lyric reprise (after → toward beginning) reweights meaning with moderate cost. Functional but not urgent; score reflects successful thematic bookend without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: articulated early ("the newborn field wants a human voice to set its note"). Development: dramatized through conflicting sub-wants (which promises to seed, whether to steer or scatter) and coin-pattern interpretation that narrows to "patient hello." Closure: wavelength alignment achieved ("we wavelength align with purpose like tuning forks"), with cost visible in exhausted resources and sustained doubt. Desire faces friction (honesty vs. longing, guidance vs. announcement) and the final choice forecloses other options. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; moderate irreplaceability (goal could be rephrased).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "stellar doubt threads everything" appears mid-story. Development: doubt modulates across beats (flowers in dark, keeps finger on heart, taps soft rhythm) as pressure increases, balancing enthusiasm and uncertainty. Closure: "standing forward, held by the amber, quiet" sustains doubt without resolving it, charging the final image with unresolved tension. Tone is coherent and purposeful, but "stellar" as modifier feels somewhat ornamental. The doubt constrains confidence and colors the ending, earning solid integration; minor dock for late first mention of the exact phrase and mild abstraction.</comment>
