<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's archival motive is clear and her commitment to "truth in tension" drives the decryption effort, but her internal contradiction never forces a costly choice—she agrees to Esteban's terms without dramatized struggle. The retrocognition device provides visceral access to Alma's world yet functions more as atmospheric overlay than constraint that complicates present action. Esteban's confession about the courier's betrayal lands with embodied weight ("closed his eyes, and the gondola rocked"), but Mara's final stance feels pre-formed rather than earned through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and teaches an accumulative-textural lens by the first third: layered historical recovery through cipher, debris-pattern, and lagoon reflection. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mara commits to preserving contradiction rather than flattening the record, and the cost is conceptual (accepting moral complexity) with the final image of Esteban "lowering himself into a sentence he could finally finish" charging prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lagoon's reflection supplies the second half of the cipher, reweighting the entire decryption method. However, the decision to "parley with pain instead of prosecuting it" is articulated rather than tested by a dramatized choice with visible forfeit, leaving cost more conceptual than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The zeppelin library, obsidian lagoon, and beach debris function as active setting elements: the gondola's sling-lift choreographs Esteban's arrival, the lagoon's reflective doubling unlocks the cipher, and beach arrangement under "shouted coordinates" grounds the decryption experiment spatially. Sensory selection is purposeful—brine/tobacco, dry glue, sand heat—and filtered through Mara's archival lens. The micro-setting of the reading room and the physical manipulation of bottles/shells/twine constrain the parley and cipher-solving, charging the final image when debris "settled into their patient grammar."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering encrypted truth without flattening moral complexity—is signaled early and tightens when Esteban offers the full key only if Mara preserves his contradictions. The lagoon-reflection discovery meaningfully deepens the decryption, narrowing options and forcing reliance on Esteban's testimony. However, Mara's agreement to his terms lacks on-page friction; she accepts instantly with internal narration rather than a dramatized trade-off. The retrocognition "tightening like a tourniquet" supplies visceral cost, yet the final choice—to "parley with pain"—is more conceptual stance than action that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the encrypted diary, debris-cipher, and the courier's compromised loyalty: truth requires preserving contradiction, not flattening into victor's narrative. The obsidian lagoon's doubling and the phrase "breathing the lagoon backwards" operate as non-literal image-work that reweights the premise without overt moralizing. The final image—Esteban descending "as though lowering himself into a sentence he could finally finish" and debris "settled into their patient grammar"—resonates with the story's question about record-keeping and complicity. Mara's articulation "truth needs friction to shine" edges toward thesis-statement but is anchored in prior scene work (tourniquet, parley, decryption struggle) enough to avoid full didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct archival voice ("solemn," "dry glue," "unfinished sentences") and perceptual signature filtering setting through document-handling metaphors. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with compression like "gathered the first stars, each a pinprick confession" and "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes held night even at noon" maintaining lyric coherence. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into essayistic abstraction—"righteousness without listening becomes another uniform" and "truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move"—that reads more like thematic summarizing than lived thought under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with many lines doing double duty (e.g., "He could not climb the gangway, so we lowered a sling, and he rose toward the zeppelin like a stubborn buoy refusing to sink" fuses logistics and characterization). Clarity is sustained across the complex decryption sequence. However, decorative figuration saturates several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move," "the past stopped shouting and started humming," and "truth needs friction to shine" stack metaphor-as-thesis in high-pressure moments, reducing propulsion. Minor template cadence appears in paired participial constructions ("smelling of brine…smelling of dry glue…both smelling of"), and the phrase "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" recurs as an unvaried anchor four times, edging toward loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of zeppelin archive, beach-debris cipher, lagoon-reflection doubling, and retrocognitive device synthesizes into a fresh frame for examining historical complicity. The cipher's two-part mechanism (beach arrangement + mirror lagoon) is specific and non-obvious, and the moral calculus—preserving the courier's betrayal alongside his motive—avoids tidy binary resolution. The retrocognition conceit and the floating library setting carry genre-adjacent decorative risk, yet both integrate causally (retrocognition grants access to Alma's experience; zeppelin enables aerial coordination). The phrase "parley with pain instead of prosecuting it" and the closing "truth needs friction to shine" echo common workshop vocabulary about complexity, slightly lowering the singularity of voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara frames the story, pursues decryption across multiple beats (diary discovery, cipher attempt, Esteban parley, final key acceptance), and makes the closing commitment to preserve contradiction. However, her key decision—agreeing to Esteban's terms—is narrated as instant alignment rather than a choice that alters prior tactics or forecloses a path. Early signal present; two beats (decryption discovery, parley); closure linkage via final stance; but weak causal pressure and minimal visible cost lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in four distinct beats: opening atmosphere, midpoint cipher clue ("the mirror was the second half of the cipher"), debris-reflection doubling during the experiment, and final image gathering stars as "pinprick confession." Its reflective property is causally essential—unlocking the diary—and it charges the ending by holding the debris messages. Early signal, strong beat involvement, closure linkage, irreplaceability (mirror function cannot swap), and cost connection (decryption depends on it) all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early, drives the decryption sequence, and supplies the revealed names/betrayals that shape Mara's final stance. It appears across three beats (discovery, cipher attempt, full decryption) and participates in closure when "the diary folded open like a throat" and Mara copies the lines. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure (diary contents compel the parley and the ethical choice), and closure linkage all present, pushing into the 7+ range despite being a passive object.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trapping is introduced early ("became retrocognitively trapped inside scenes the text insisted were present") and recurs in three beats: initial entrapment, mid-story sharpening ("the retrocognition sharpening: Alma stooped at dawn"), and release ("the trap weakened, and the past stopped shouting"). It provides atmospheric access to Alma's experience and the cost is named ("tightened like a tourniquet"), but it does not constrain Mara's present choices in a way that alters tactics—she continues decryption regardless. Early signal and beat involvement present; causal pressure and cost connection weak; closure linkage via release image but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Parley structures the central encounter: Mara requests it via radio, Esteban is lifted aboard, the reading-room negotiation yields the cipher key, and the agreement to preserve contradiction shapes closure. It drives two major beats (summons and negotiation) and the final ethical stance. Early signal (requested at dusk), causal pressure (parley enables decryption), closure linkage (Mara's commitment is the parley's outcome), and specificity (face-to-face negotiation of terms) all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Beach-debris arrangement is seeded in oral-history marginalia early, demonstrated in the retrocognitive vision of Alma ("spelling justice with wreckage"), executed on-page when Mara and watermen arrange bottles/shells/twine under shouted coordinates, and supplies the cipher solution via lagoon reflection. It drives three beats (historical mention, vision, experiment) and is causally essential to decryption—removing it breaks the cipher unlock. Early signal, strong beat involvement, high causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability, and cost connection (requires resources, coordination, and the lagoon's doubling).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is present in the opening, supplies the gondola for Esteban's sling-lift, and enables aerial coordination for the debris experiment ("angled the zeppelin to send a wind," "shouted coordinates"). It appears across three beats and provides logistical constraint (Esteban cannot climb; the experiment requires aerial vantage). Early signal, beat involvement, and modest causal pressure present; however, a ground-level archive with a crane or tower could substitute with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability. Closure linkage is weak (final image centers on lagoon and debris, not the zeppelin).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters were found" anchors the story's starting point and the phrase recurs in line four, but elapsed time within the scene is vague—"by dusk" for the radio call, "before full dark" for Esteban's descent—and does not tighten decisions. The decryption and parley unfold without a clock that alters tactics or forces trade-offs. Early signal present but no meaningful temporal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "uncover truth in tension, not flatten the record into the easy coin the victors spend" is dramatized through her pursuit of the cipher, her parley with Esteban, and her acceptance of preserving contradiction. It drives three beats (initial framing, negotiation, final commitment) and shapes closure. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, and friction between her archival mission and Esteban's demand for mercy all present. However, the acceptance lacks on-page cost—she agrees instantly—reducing the visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone is established early with "searing reverie rising from the sand like breath against glass" and sustained through lyric compression ("obsidian lagoon held night even at noon," "past stopped shouting and started humming"). It modulates with pressure—retrocognition sharpens, tourniquet tightens—and charges the final image when debris "settled into their patient grammar" and stars become "pinprick confession." Early signal, coherent through turns, and closure linkage present; however, occasional essayistic drift (e.g., "truth was a muscle") slightly disrupts the lyric register.</comment>
