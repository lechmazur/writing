<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's synesthetic trait and professional identity are well-established, and the pursuit of the "fracture-note" provides clear internal motivation. The father's revelation near the end creates a charged moment, though the emotional contradiction could be sharper—the protagonist's reaction to the father's admission stays somewhat muted. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("the thinning was a frequency"), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice to "set the orchard to grow" feels more symbolic than earned by a visible renunciation or cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist confronts the father, registers the "faultline" via the hearing aid, and accepts the truth ("held that truth and set the orchard to grow"). The lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered images (forge, organoids, wrecks, aurora) that converge at the ending. Cost is felt but oblique—holding the truth implies emotional resolution, yet the on-page price (what is forfeited or altered by this acceptance) remains understated. Causality is consistent; the device's training and the father's presence are both well-seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is vividly realized and integral to the protagonist's work: kelp, shipwrecks, aurora-filtered light, and the ashen forge all constrain action and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("greens whispered tin," "aurora hummed a soft, cracked teal"). Spatial choreography across forge, orchard rows, and shipyard cavern remains clear. The setting directly enables the protagonist's organoid cultivation and device testing, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that environment constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the sound of trust breaking"—is signaled early and drives the protagonist's experiments. Pressure accumulates through the device's iterative tuning, from collecting absences to the climactic test with the father. The confrontation provides one meaningful tightening when the device registers the father's retreat, but the escalation is more additive than a dramatic narrowing of options. Cost is present (the protagonist must accept the father's betrayal) but the visceral trade-off or forfeited path is understated, keeping the piece shy of the 8.5+ threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's quest: trust, memory as absence, and the "fine contour where closeness loosens." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth delivered as "thin ice singing, honest and cold"—without moralizing. Synesthesia and the aurora serve as charged motifs that reweight at closure. The piece resists simple binaries and embraces complexity, though the final line ("set the orchard to grow") leans slightly abstract, pulling back from full embodied resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, with a consistent lyric-technical register ("cochlear organoids beside apple scions," "spectral notch of retreat") that reflects the protagonist's audiology expertise and synesthetic perception. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter obscures immediacy. The father's brief dialogue ("trusted me… trusted himself") carries subtext without over-explanation. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist notices sound-as-color, absences, and auroral hues in character-specific ways. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the confrontation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information-per-sentence ("coils wound from salvaged filaments and apple wire, each loop tempered by polar light"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; sentence openings vary naturally. Minor overwriting appears in the middle section—figurative density ("cochlear organoids," "sapbeats," "metronome for patience") occasionally slows momentum without a taught pattern. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Clarity remains high despite the lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, audiology, and underwater salvage feels fresh and specific; the premise is non-obvious and fully committed. The device's training via "collecting absences" and the ashen forge under aurora are memorable particulars. Risk-taking in the lyric-technical voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details. Minor constraint: the emotional arc (confronting a parent's broken promise) is familiar, though the execution through sound-design particulars elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hearing aid designer identity drives the protagonist's choices across multiple beats: building the forge, seeding organoids, tuning the device, and testing it on the father. The profession is not ornamental—audiology expertise enables the entire quest and shapes the closure. The protagonist's decisions (loading the forge, teaching the device, confronting the father) create key turns. Cost is visible: the protagonist must accept the father's betrayal via the device's honest tone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ashen forge appears in three beats: initial description, warming the oilskin note, and implied presence during device creation. It enables the protagonist's work (casting the prototype shell, burning the promise) and carries thematic weight (an "altar to new listening"). However, the forge's specific properties (why ashen, why under aurora) do not constrain a choice with visible trade-off—it functions more as atmospheric setting than causal pressure. Closure linkage is indirect; the device it produced is active, not the forge itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept "impact of memories" shapes the protagonist's entire quest: memories as "absences," the father's broken promise, and the device's training on gaps and retreats. The protagonist's methodology (imprinting via absence) is driven by this concept. Cost appears when the protagonist burns the promise note and later accepts the father's explanation. The concept is not merely thematic; it alters tactics (what to record, how to train the algorithm) and reweights the ending when the device reveals the "faultline."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia ("hears colors faintly") is seeded early and colors the protagonist's perception throughout: "greens whispered tin," "aurora hummed… cracked teal," "color draining… a whitening hiss." It informs the device design ("the color of a bud tingled like a distant chime") and shapes the protagonist's attention. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it enriches texture but remains observational rather than causal. No moment where the synesthesia enables or blocks a key action with trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Imprint" anchors the protagonist's method and drives multiple beats: imprinting cochlear organoids, recording absences, burning the promise note to capture its "whitening," and teaching the device the "contour of a promise emptying out." The action is not swappable; the entire closure depends on the device learning this imprint and then applying it to the father's words. The final turn—recognizing the father's retreat—traces directly to this action. Cost is present: the protagonist must confront an uncomfortable truth the imprint reveals.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method "by collecting absences" is signaled early ("memories… imprint by collecting absences") and its mechanics shape the protagonist's attempts: recording "the hush after the night pump cut," placing mics "where brass was missing," and profiling absence. The algorithm learns to "sift for the spectral notch of retreat." The method is not merely decorative; it structures the protagonist's experiments and determines what the device can detect. The ending applies this method when the aid registers the "soft notch that means retreat" in the father's speech.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks anchors every beat: it houses the forge, the organoid trays, the testing grid, and connects to the shipyard cavern where the father works. The setting enables the protagonist's work (underwater cultivation, aurora light for tempering) and provides resources (salvaged filaments, wrecks for mic placement). Spatial choreography is clear across forge, orchard rows, and cavern. The setting's specificity (why sunken, why orchard, why shipwrecks) directly affects the protagonist's methodology and the closure's charged atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while cells divide" appears in three mentions: initial seeding of organoids, warming the forge "while cells divide," and implied ongoing cultivation. It suggests duration and parallels growth with the protagonist's iterative work. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no moment where cellular timing pressures a choice or alters tactics. The phrase adds thematic texture (patience, biological rhythm) but remains loosely tracked rather than a live clock that shapes moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sound of trust breaking" is stated early, dramatized through the protagonist's experiments, and drives the entire arc. The backstory (father's broken promise during salvage) establishes the wound; the present-tense pursuit (building the device, collecting absences, testing it on the father) enacts the desire. Friction between wanting the truth and the cost of hearing it charges the ending: the device delivers "a kindness, a tone like thin ice singing, honest and cold." The protagonist's choice to "hold that truth" accepts the motivation's cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone "battered marvel" is established early via the aurora ("a battered marvel") and sustained through imagery: "ashen forge," "slagged anchors," "tired curtain, a weary miracle still shining." The tone coheres across turns—wonder and damage coexist without contradiction. Under pressure (the father confrontation), the tone modulates: the device's output is "honest and cold," and the protagonist's acceptance carries both exhaustion and resolve. The final image ("set the orchard to grow") charges the tone with tentative hope, reweighting the "battered marvel" motif without abandoning its duality.</comment>
