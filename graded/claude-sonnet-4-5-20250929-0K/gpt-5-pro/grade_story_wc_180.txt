<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's interiority is concrete and textured—"quartz because a shard sits where my left eye once looked"—and micro-choices (kissing the air before using the ribbon) reveal values under pressure. The motivation to bridge generational wisdom threads through repair work and the remembered daughter without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional duty and personal grief, embodied in the pocket ribbon. The kids function as secondary pressure that forces on-page demonstration rather than abstraction, though their voices occasionally blur together.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered repair work, generational echoes, and the deciduous-vows frame, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the ribbon darkens and the leak "speaks." The closure image—teaching the leak its accent—reweights the opening breach with felt cost (the ribbon sacrificed, the guild contract abandoned for immediate care). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the breach/cathedral/orchard opener. The single-scene window with interleaved reflection holds coherent pressure and pays off the vows metaphor through the repair's visible compromise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybridity constrains the repair task (bellwater, broken irrigation, fruit-bearing rafters) and charges the final image when water returns to roots. Spatial choreography is clean: pew, bag, pipe joint, ribbon tourniquet. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—citrus humming with bees, chalk on clay, beadwork gathering—filtered through the mender's craft priorities. The micro-setting (the joint, the ribbon as soft clamp) directly alters tactics and outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: repair the irrigation line without guild wages or proper tools. The pressure tightens when the joint "weeps," forcing the protagonist to sacrifice the daughter's ribbon with visible cost (the kiss, the darkening silk). Agency is demonstrated through improvisation and the explicit choice to use the ribbon after other methods fail. The kids' questions and the mender's teaching deepen thematic weight without derailing conflict. One meaningful escalation—failed wire wrap → ribbon tourniquet—narrows options and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The deciduous-vows frame emerges organically from repair work and seasonal metaphor, resisting direct statement until the kids ask and the mender answers through lived example. The ribbon's transformation from memory-keeper to functional clamp to water-darkened speech teacher offers a non-literal answer to generational continuity. Subtext operates strongly in the mender's refusal to chase the daughter, the pocket carry, and the teaching moment that replaces guild wages. The ending image—learning the leak's accent—reweights the breach premise without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing with emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and compression is purposeful: "which is just a committee of need," "listening mends louder than any tool." The mender's perceptual signature filters everything through craft and loss—water "giggles," repairs "confess," promises "get heavy on tiny backs." Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally between repair instruction and memory. Dialogue from the kids is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext about trust and vows. The purposeful aphoristic turns ("my mistakes, which is a school that never expels anyone") are voice-consistent and earned by the repair context rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high—most lines layer action, memory, and metaphor without padding. Figurative language is dense but mostly legible: "bark" for the daughter's feistiness, "deciduous vows," "breach grown leaves." Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("arguments bright and brittle as new leaves") and a few filter-verb clusters ("I said," "they asked"). The ribbon beats are propulsive and concrete. Two adjacent lines near the middle paraphrase the vows concept without added pressure (−0.2), and template cadence in dialogue tags appears briefly (−0.3). No loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard premise and deciduous-vows frame offer a fresh synthesis of repair-as-metaphor for generational bonds and institutional failure. The transformation of guild work into improvisational care with forgotten objects feels specific and non-obvious. The ribbon's triple function (memory, tool, teacher) and the final image of learning the leak's accent avoid sentimental templates. Risk-taking in the sustained metaphorical register and elliptical time structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise transforms familiar repair/memory material through the vows logic and the daughter's absence as motivating presence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender is present from the title opener, drives the repair choice (wire, washers, ribbon), and makes the key sacrifice at the ribbon beat. The trait "quartz-eye" signals craft authority early and the decision to use the ribbon alters tactics with visible cost. Two distinct beats: choosing to stay after the breach, deciding to tie the ribbon. Closure linkage is strong—teaching the leak to speak grows from the mender's philosophy. Causal pressure and specificity are high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in the pocket early, returns as repair tool mid-scene, and is reweighted in the final exchange when it darkens and "we were already learning its accent." Three beats: carried memory, kissed and tied, darkened teacher. Closure participation is direct—the ribbon enables the repair and charges the ending image. Cost is visible (sacrificed keepsake, water damage). High irreplaceability: no generic cloth would carry the same pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Deciduous vows are introduced early ("guild practiced deciduous vows"), constrain the protagonist's stance after the breach, and shape the teaching moment with the kids about promises and seasons. The concept alters the mender's decision to work without pay and frames the repair as seasonal offering. Two beats: breach response, teaching moment. Closure linkage is thematic—learning the leak's accent mirrors the vows' seasonal flexibility. Specificity and causal pressure are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty and full of bark" is a retrospective label for the absent daughter; it colors the mender's memory but does not constrain an on-page choice. The daughter herself is off-page. The trait is mentioned once without dramatized cost. Ornamental use trends low under the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Persist" is signaled early ("I persist for them, for my daughter...") and drives the mender's choice to stay, improvise, and sacrifice the ribbon. The action is present across the repair sequence and charges the teaching moment. Two beats: staying after breach, completing repair. Closure linkage: persistence enables the final wisdom exchange. Causal pressure is clear—without persistence, no repair or teaching occurs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Using forgotten bag contents is signaled early ("we opened my bag, which I have never cleaned"), structures the entire middle repair sequence (spoon, wire, washers, buttons, chalk, ribbon), and is reweighted when the ribbon becomes essential. Three beats: bag opened, items tested, ribbon sacrificed. Closure participation is direct—the method enables the repair and the final leak-teaching image. High specificity: the exact contents matter. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lush orchard in the cathedral rafters is present from the second line, supplies the broken irrigation as the repair task, and is reweighted in the closure when "bellwater giggled along the nave and into the roots above our heads." Three beats: opening description, broken line discovery, water restored. The setting constrains the repair method (cathedral materials, improvised tools) and charges the final image. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the breach of contract" is signaled in the opening line and motivates the mender's unpaid presence. It shapes one key choice—staying to work without wages. The breach is mentioned again mid-scene and frames the deciduous-vows teaching. Two gates: setup and development. Closure linkage is thematic but not action-direct. The breach enables the story but does not tighten decisions during the repair itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to bridge generational wisdom is signaled early ("I had not come for wages but to bridge generational wisdom") and drives the teaching exchanges with the kids. Two beats: repair as demonstration, explicit vows teaching. The desire is conflicted with the daughter's absence and the broken contract. Closure participation: the final leak-teaching image embodies the bridging. Visible cost: the ribbon sacrifice literalizes the transfer. Strong causal link and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom operates consistently: the mender offers insights ("listening mends louder than any tool," "mistakes, which is a school") that arise from repair work rather than planned instruction. The tone modulates with pressure—pragmatic during the repair, reflective in the teaching beats—and charges the final image when wisdom becomes "learning the leak's accent." Coherent through turns, present in three beats, and integral to the closure effect's conceptual repricing.</comment>
