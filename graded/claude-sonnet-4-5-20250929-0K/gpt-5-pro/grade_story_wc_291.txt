<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's prosopagnosia drives a distinct perceptual signature—mapping voices, gaits, grief temperatures—that shapes his investigative method throughout. The captain's motivations arrive through dramatized breath patterns and body language rather than exposition, and the final choice (sitting, holding his wrists, confessing) is earned by Lio's methodical pressure. Internal contradiction appears when Lio "does not forgive and does not condemn" yet engineers confession through portraiture, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the captain's arc compresses rapidly in the final third, and his pivot from denial to confession could have been spread across one additional beat to deepen the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the captain sits holding his wrists while the portrait creates "a chamber where both guilt and love could breathe the same air," crystallizing options with undeniable pressure even though the legal cost is deferred off-page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density (mist, ribbon, metronome clicks) builds until the captain's breath "stumbles" and the painting unifies opposites, reweighting the dominant stake. Causality holds through motivated ellipsis (the ribbon's "rescuer's knot, reversed in panic" becomes the hinge), and one meaningful deepening occurs when Lio shifts from investigation to portraiture that traps the captain in a moral chamber. Minor penalty: the metronome and ribbon mechanics sometimes blur—"letting ribbon sway, letting steps count their distances"—requiring inference about how these tools extract confession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quarry functions as crucible: its "silted water without breaking the surface mirror" and submerged branch constrain Lio's investigation method and charge the final discovery. Micro-setting elements (the collapsible ash pole, the metronome, the canvas roll) are handled across multiple beats and shape tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's prosopagnosia—he notices breath arrangement, boot tapping rhythm, and the "sweetness of algae" on fabric rather than faces. Minor gap: spatial choreography of the captain's descent and final position ("just beyond the metronome's click" then "stepped closer") could be sharper, and the quarry's physical properties (depth, rim layout) remain slightly vague when they would help anchor the girl's disappearance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken empathy to solve the cold case) is signaled early and tightens when the ribbon snags and the captain's rehearsed story unravels. One meaningful deepening occurs: Lio's question "which side of the ribbon should face the wind to find her" forces the captain from observer to accomplice, narrowing options. The painting itself becomes the pressure instrument that forecloses the captain's escape, creating a visible cost (confession, legal exposure). Agency is clear: Lio's methodical choices (metronome pacing, ribbon testing, portrait construction) drive the turn. Minor deduction: the captain's internal resistance is compressed—his "no, then yes, and then nothing" could sustain one additional beat to show the calculus of surrender rather than rapid capitulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (unifying opposites to awaken dormant truth) emerges through the ribbon as tether/wound, the doubled figure in mist, and the portrait chamber where "guilt and love could breathe the same air." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Lio does not forgive or condemn but "kept unifying opposites until a path formed," reweighting justice as a third position beyond punishment and absolution. The concept integrates with theme through Lio's prosopagnosia—inability to see faces forces him to unify what habit keeps apart. No thematic echo or moralizing; insights arise from concrete particulars (the reversed rescuer's knot, the ribbon's texture alphabet). The ending avoids resolution arithmetic, leaving moral complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lio with controlled distance; perceptual signature is distinct (textures, breath cadences, "temperatures of grief"). Diction stays within Lio's plausible register—"woolen quiet of fog," "metrical logic," "sorrow's pulsation"—with vocabulary consistent for a trained artist and former river kid. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the captain's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit. Deductions: some elevated constructions ("the metrical logic that his eyes had always withheld," "the quarry's slow alphabet on fabric") occasionally drift toward lyric register that feels authorial rather than Lio's internal voice under pressure. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he heard," "he understood") cluster in the captain's confession sequence, dulling immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show range. Information density is high in the investigation beats (ribbon texture, knot identification, breath arrangement). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "He tied…and let it test," "He drew…and pressed…naming," "He could not know…but he heard" stack similar syntactic stems without variation. The phrase "by unifying opposites" recurs verbatim three times as a conceptual placeholder rather than embodied action, creating synonym-churn effect. "Furrowed hush" bookends the piece (opening and "the quarry held a furrowed hush") but the repeated exact phrase feels mechanical rather than transformed. Minor scaffold: "It was careful, trained, the cadence of…" introduces the captain with a construction that tells competence rather than showing breath pattern. Artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure image, so penalty remains within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—face-blind portraitist who paints absence to solve cold cases—feels specific and non-obvious, and the method (unifying opposites through art that traps the guilty in empathy) offers a fresh moral calculus. The ribbon fragment as forensic and emotional hinge, plus the "doubled figure" portrait technique, transforms the investigator archetype. However, the core "artist solves crime through unique perception" premise echoes familiar templates (Longmire's Henry Standing Bear, procedural savants), and the piece does not fully escape the "special skill reveals hidden truth" formula. The captain's arc—volunteer who caused the accident he searched for—lands as ironic but not wholly surprising. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the refusal to deliver courtroom closure elevates within band. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's prosopagnosia is introduced early (first third), shapes investigation tactics across multiple beats (mapping voices/gaits, ribbon testing, portrait construction), and drives the closure choice: his inability to see faces forces the "unifying opposites" method that creates the confession chamber. Removing this exact trait would collapse the story's logic—a sighted investigator would pursue different forensics. Cost is visible: his methodical compensations (metronome, pole, counting steps) impose time and expose him to the captain's arrival. Causal pressure is strong; the trait enables the final turn. All three gates present; closure participation direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears early (first third: "masquerade mask ribbon fragment still rasped in memory"), is handled physically in the middle (tied to pole, tests air, pressed to cheek, textures named), and returns reweighted at closure (the "rescuer's knot, reversed in panic" becomes proof and the ribbon in the portrait functions as "nerve, both tether and wound"). Three distinct beats; strong closure linkage. Cost connection: the ribbon's forensic evidence exposes the captain. Minor swappability concern: another fabric token (scarf, glove) could perform similar forensic work with edits, preventing a top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Cold cases" is introduced early ("hunted cold cases after the evidence disappears") and frames the dominant stake: solve a case the town abandoned. It constrains tactics—Lio arrives "after the evidence disappears" because "absence drew the outlines"—and appears in closure context (the story resolves a cold case on the page). However, the mechanics of cold-case work (re-interviewing, timeline reconstruction, motive triangulation) are largely absent; the case solves via art and confrontation rather than investigative method. The concept shapes theme more than on-page tactics. Two gates (setup, closure thematic); middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is signaled early ("He worked in a very methodical way, counting steps and breaths"), constrains multiple actions (metronome to pace memory, tripod setup, ribbon testing, portrait construction "with breaths for brushstrokes, with clicks to mark sorrow's pulsation"), and enables the final confession by imposing a ritualized pressure the captain cannot escape. Cost is visible: the method is slow, exposing Lio to interruption. Removing the trait would break the investigation's texture and Lio's compensatory logic. All three gates present; strong beat involvement. Minor deduction: "very methodical" occasionally reads as label rather than enacted constraint (e.g., no moment where haste would help but method forbids it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lance" appears early in tool description ("lance the edges of silted water without breaking the surface mirror"), is used in a key middle beat ("they lanced the fog, gentle jabs, until the ribbon snagged"), and the snagged branch triggers the memory bell tone that unravels the captain's story. The action enables discovery and constrains method (Lio respects "what slept in mud"). However, "lance" could be replaced with "probe" or "test" with minor lexical edits; the verb's martial/surgical connotation adds texture but is not mechanically indispensable. Two strong beats; closure participation indirect (the action precedes confession but does not appear in the final image). Causal role present but replaceability lowers ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is mentioned early in thematic declaration ("by unifying opposites that habit kept apart"), recurs verbatim mid-story ("The question slid between blame and plea, by unifying opposites until the answer could emerge"), and appears at closure ("he kept unifying opposites until a path formed"). It names the method that creates the confession chamber. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what does "unifying opposites" look like as embodied action? The portrait shows "the doubled figure," and Lio names contradictions (guilt/love, light/shadow), but the method is asserted more than dramatized. The phrase functions as thematic label rather than tactical constraint. Present in three beats but largely ornamental in execution; closure participation is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry is introduced in the opening line, provides investigation resources (submerged branch, water as evidence cache, mist for atmospheric pressure), and charges the final image (the "furrowed hush" bookend). Spatial details constrain Lio's method (the pole respects what "slept in mud") and the overlook/rim layout stages the captain's arrival. Sensory particulars (drips, fog, "black glass" water) modulate with pressure. Strong setup and closure participation; middle beats use setting to pressure choices. Minor gap: the quarry's exact geometry (depth, distances, the girl's location) remains vague when forensic specificity would deepen the investigation's credibility and raise the stakes of the snagged branch discovery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is foregrounded early and structurally: Lio "hunted cold cases after the evidence disappears" and "visited after the evidence disappears, because absence drew the outlines." The timeframe premise justifies the method (portraiture replaces forensics) and explains why the town moved on. However, elapsed time since the girl's disappearance is unspecified, the urgency is ambient rather than clock-driven, and no on-page deadline tightens the confession window. The concept frames stakes more than it pressures tactics. Setup strong; closure participation thematic (the past is recovered) but not mechanical. No live timer or countdown; time as constraint is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy" is stated early ("He wanted to awaken dormant empathy in a town that had learned to look away") and drives the portrait's design: the painting creates "a chamber where both guilt and love could breathe the same air," forcing the captain to inhabit both positions. The motivation is dramatized through choices (returning to the quarry, constructing the doubled figure, refusing to forgive or condemn) and tested by the captain's arrival. Friction between goal and cost appears: Lio's method extracts confession but cannot guarantee justice. However, the motivation is declared more than conflicted—no moment where Lio doubts the portrait's power or considers abandoning the case. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development present but friction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears in the opening line ("the world held a furrowed hush") and returns verbatim mid-story ("the quarry held a furrowed hush"), creating a tonal signature. Tone modulates under pressure: the mist "curled and uncurled like breath over the mouth of a secret," the metronome clicks create rhythm, and the captain's confession is framed by "an emptied minute." The quiet, methodical atmosphere coheres through turns and charges the final image (the captain sits in silence; the portrait speaks). Strong setup and closure participation. Minor deduction: "furrowed hush" recurs as an exact phrase rather than evolving, and some beats (e.g., the bell-tone memory) briefly break the hush without clear recovery, creating slight tonal drift.</comment>
