<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's interior life is embodied through concrete sensory engagement—listening to bronze quiet, feeling diaries tremble, aligning his spine to the displaced axis. His motivation (collecting wall-stories) drives each micro-choice: setting the tapestry, reading aloud, probing with sentence edges. However, the character remains more vessel than agent; his perceptual acts accumulate texture but he faces no genuine internal conflict or foreclosed path with visible cost. The final move (inscribing to let walls rest) feels like fulfillment rather than transformation earned through contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered acts of listening, reading fragments, and decoding dragons until the final inscription reconfigures the historian's task from collection to release. Orientation anchors (silo, historian, post-dream timeframe) appear early. The closure—writing so "the walls could rest and the world regain its ear"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the historian's stance crystallizes from probe to scribe) with conceptual cost legible in the image of restored listening. One weakness: the middle third loops similar perceptual beats (grain dust, wind, echoes) without a clear tightening or narrative turn that narrows options before the final writing act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The silo's curved ribs, spiral ladder, hearth, and corrugated exterior are rendered with lyric specificity and consistently filter through the historian's ear. The tapestry fragment and half-burned diaries function as micro-setting objects that constrain his method (probing via charred margins, aligning by dragon nodes). The final beat—"building leaned a little farther east" and spine alignment—directly charges the closure image, making the displaced axis tactile and the environment indispensable to the ending's reweighting of attention and tilt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (collecting what walls remember) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through density of sensory probe and fragment-reading rather than causal reversals; this fits the Accumulative lens. The middle deepens via the diaries' names and the tapestry's grammar, narrowing focus from general listening to specific inscription. The cost at closure is conceptual—walls rest, world regains ear—but the historian's agency feels more fulfillment than trade-off; no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt sacrifice on the page, only a task completed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (lost sleep, displaced axis, what masonry remembers when humans stop overhearing themselves) emerges from concrete particulars: the final dream date kept by walls, grain dust as seed-husk, dragons as measure-instruments. The ending offers a resonant answer—writing inscribes bronze quiet so "the world regain its ear"—without moralizing, reweighting the historian's collection as a restorative act. Subtext operates in image (serpent biting tail as hinge-doorway) and the shift from probe to release. One slip: "the axis has fallen through us like a spear" risks overt thematic statement, though it's voiced by townsfolk and absorbed into the historian's interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, formally elevated, and sustained across all beats with consistent diction ("coin-clink," "bruised by smoke," "tiny rainstorms"). POV remains stable single-perspective with deep access to the historian's perceptual signature (sensitively perceptive ear). Psychic distance is controlled; the historian's knowledge and inference stay within his expertise. One friction: under the accumulative pressure of the ending, the syntax maintains identical formal register without modulation—"bronze quiet shifted, deepening like a bell beginning to understand"—where compression or rhythmic break might sharpen the closure moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line does double duty (e.g., "carbon dust marking his fingertips like new fingerprints" ties tactile detail to axis-shift motif). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no major loops appear. Two frictions: several beats use similar template cadence ("It spoke of…" x3 in close succession); figurative language is dense throughout ("ribs become vocal cords," "field lines buckled," "tilt changed the stories like rain slanting") without pattern-teaching or consistent vehicle logic, risking overwriting. The closure beat—"inscribing bronze quiet into paper so the walls could rest"—remains clear despite elevated diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-sleep historian decoding wall-memory via tapestry dragons and charred diaries in a silo—feels specific and non-obvious. The displaced axis as both literal tilt and metaphor for lost nocturnal overhearing offers conceptual freshness. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation and sustained metaphor heightens thematic charge. One limiting factor: the emotional arc (collection → inscription → release) follows a contemplative template without unexpected resistance or trade-off, and the historian's interior journey lacks the friction that would make the synthesis feel inevitable rather than allegorical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Historian present throughout; his choices (setting tapestry, reading aloud, aligning spine, beginning inscription) drive each beat and the final writing act. Setup and development clear; closure participation strong. However, his decisions feel more like methodical steps in a known process than choices that narrow options or impose cost—observation trends high, but genuine decision with trade-off is limited.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tapestry appears early (setup), is interpreted mid-story ("dragons not monsters but diagrams"), pinned above hearth (development), and its dragon-neck alignment cues the closure writing (payoff). Two distinct beats plus closure linkage. Cost: without it, the historian lacks the "grammar" to complement diary "names," and the final alignment image would lose specificity. Swappability: another symbolic object (star-chart, rune-stone) could serve with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Displaced axis frames the premise (post-dream world, tilt away from night), appears in diary accounts ("axis has fallen through us"), and governs the historian's final alignment and writing. Setup, development (teacher mapping dragon nodes, rain drilling ground), and payoff present. Causal pressure: it shapes what the historian seeks and how he probes. One friction: much of its work is thematic rather than tactical; it doesn't narrow on-page options as sharply as it reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Labeled early ("sensitively perceptive") and demonstrated throughout (hearing masonry's thrum, coaxing seeds with breath). Setup and payoff present. Development: his perceptual acts enable collection but do not constrain or cost him visibly—no trade-off shown (e.g., exhaustion, overwhelm). Label-only friction lowers the score; the trait enables action but lacks dramatized price or friction that would show its limits under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Probe appears in title action ("probe the walls...with the remembered edge of a sentence"), unfolds across multiple beats (reading margins aloud, angling lantern, coaxing sounds), and culminates in writing as probe-turned-inscription. Setup, development (two+ beats), closure linkage all present. Causal role: the method structures his engagement. Swappability: "decipher" or "listen" could replace with edits; the verb's specificity (medical/investigative connotation) adds texture but isn't structurally indispensable, capping score mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries introduced early (hearth discovery), used across multiple beats (reading charred margins, learning names, trembling in hands, burn-slashed words casting shadows), and their materiality (carbon dust, scalloped pages) charges tactile detail and informs the closure grammar. Setup, development (three+ beats), closure contribution present. Causal pressure: without them, the historian lacks "names" to pair with tapestry's "grammar." Specificity: the fire-damage and hearth origin are irreplaceable details that tie to the displaced-axis cold and refusal-of-mercy motif.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silo present throughout: rolled ear metaphor, spiral ladder coin-clink, curve where child slept, ribs as vocal cords, corrugations summoning bronze quiet, eastward lean altering stories. Setup immediate, development across four+ beats, closure (building leans, historian aligns spine) directly tied. Causal pressure: the architecture enables and constrains his listening method; the curve and tilt are indispensable to the final alignment image. High irreplaceability; another setting (cathedral, archive) would break the grain/harvest/ear metaphor chain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Timeframe stated in opening phrase, echoed when walls "kept" the date without calendars, and informs the thematic stakes (lost sleep/dreams). Setup clear; thematic resonance present. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions or create urgency—no countdown, no clock pressure. The historian's work unfolds at contemplative pace unaffected by temporal constraint. Functional as premise but replaceable with minimal edits ("after the last song," "after the last fire").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("to collect the stories walls have heard"), drives each beat (listening, reading, probing, inscribing), and shifts at closure from collection to release (writing so walls rest). Setup and payoff strong; development across multiple beats. One friction: the desire is fulfilled rather than conflicted—no competing want, no cost of collection dramatized on the page. The shift to "let walls rest" feels like completion rather than a choice that forecloses another path with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bronze quiet appears in opening paragraph, recurs as wind-summoned tone, guides historian to hearth, "shifted, deepening like a bell" when tapestry is pinned, and is inscribed into paper at closure. Tone coherent across turns, modulates with density (settling → summoning → shifting → inscribed), and charges final image. Setup immediate, development (three+ beats), closure linkage strong. The specific color-texture ("bronze") and its acoustic-material duality (metal ribs, bell) make it irreplaceable; another tone descriptor (silver hush, iron silence) would break the silo's materiality.</comment>
