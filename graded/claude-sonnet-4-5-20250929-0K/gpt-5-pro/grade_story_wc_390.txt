<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and profession-specific, filtered through lighthouse-engineer perception. The Collector's transformation feels slightly telescoped—his weeping arrives without sufficient prior micro-choices to earn the scaffolding collapse metaphor. The protagonist's own shame ("miswired the beacon") surfaces cleanly but resolves too tidily within the hum without visible cost or ongoing friction. Embodied contradictions are present but the final renunciation by the Collector lacks the ambivalence that would deepen the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for the protagonist, Charged Poise for the Collector); the final line reweights trust and cooling metal as an earned repricing of guardianship. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by line 6. The hum sequence constitutes one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake (protect the artifact vs. grant absolution), and the Collector's withdrawal forecloses theft with visible emotional cost. Cost is legible in "eyes cleared by a labor no coin could buy" and the protagonist's locked vault, though the internal price for the narrator remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina pressures every choice: brittle chimes, iron pilings, and the vault's "fleshly ethereal" air anchor both atmosphere and tactical constraint. The crypt keeper's key recurs with reweighted meaning (warmth → trust, brass heartbeat → cooling metal), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (skiff approach, hatch descent, hand on knuckles) and sensory detail modulates with urgency—salt, kelp, limestone singing. The micro-setting (vault, key, crystal cradle) functions as active constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the artifact) is signaled early and tested when the Collector demands proof. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist opens the vault and tunes the Lens-Heart, narrowing options to demonstration or refusal. The Collector's emotional collapse and withdrawal constitute a reversal driven by protagonist agency (the choice to hum and match vibration). Cost is visible—"leave the harbor its listening"—but the protagonist's internal trade-off (risking misuse to prove efficacy) could be more explicitly foregrounded in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness as vibrational labor, not commodity) emerges through the sonic-absolution mechanics and the contrast between the Collector's transactional desire and the protagonist's stewardship. The final image—"key cooling to the temperature of trust"—offers a non-literal answer to whether absolution can be shared without being sold. Subtext operates cleanly in "a coin under a tongue, and it mints nothing" and the Collector's weeping as "collapsing scaffolding." Minor slip: "clarity, which is sometimes the only kindness" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains embedded in the hum's effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature distinct (lighthouse-engineer diction: "brass heartbeat," "vibrational matching," "narrative clock"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("I call it a cure that sells" / "it is not for sale"). Distance control is consistent, though brief filter-verb clusters ("I felt," "I told him") slightly dull immediacy in two mid-scene beats. Purposeful compression in the hum sequence ("adapt to the sorrow without swallowing it") is voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; internal voice coheres under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Template cadence appears in three consecutive "I [verb]" openers during the descent ("So I opened… I placed… I hummed"), triggering a −0.4 baseline deduction. Minor figurative density in the hum sequence ("time like wet hair," "ribs with equal courtesy," "dust of decades") verges on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: "sonic absolution" is defined twice (lines 9 and 25) without added pressure. Proofreading is clean; no loops or scaffolding obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic-absolution mechanics, and the drift-ice setting feels specific and non-obvious. The hum as therapeutic labor (not magic wand) and the Collector's withdrawal (not theft-and-chase) transform familiar guardian-vs.-thief tropes. Risk-taking in the vault sequence (embodied vibrational matching rather than combat) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor friction: the phrase "fleshly ethereal" and "logically emotional" read slightly prompt-adjacent, reducing the sense of inevitable discovery. The transformation test passes—plot and arc would not work unchanged in a generic dungeon.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The azure-coat lighthouse engineer frames the opening, makes the key decision to demonstrate the Lens-Heart (middle beat), and locks the vault at closure. All three gates met; causal pressure is strong (the choice to open the vault narrows options and enables the Collector's transformation). Specificity: the profession shapes perceptual signature and the vibrational-matching method. Cost: risking misuse to prove efficacy; the final act (locking the vault, trusting the cooling key) forecloses shared guardianship with visible restraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is introduced early (line 4), used at the hatch (line 15), and returns in the final line with reweighted meaning (cooling to "the temperature of trust"). Two distinct beats; closure linkage is strong. The key's warmth/coolness contrast charges the ending image. Moderate friction: mid-scene involvement is minimal; the key does not constrain choices during the hum sequence. Lyric reprise elevates the score into the 6+ band, but lack of middle causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is seeded early (line 9), defines the stakes (the Collector wants to sell it), and the demonstration sequence (vibrational matching, the hum) is the story's structural hinge. The concept constrains tactics: the protagonist must tune breath to the Collector's, the water, the wood. Closure cost: the Collector's transformation and the protagonist's renewed guardianship both depend on the absolution's success. High causal pressure, specificity (not generic magic), and irreplaceability. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is glossed in lines 12–14 ("Logic, because metal and crystal… Emotion, because the town once sang its dead"). It frames the protagonist's dual motivation but does not visibly constrain an on-page choice with cost. The trait is present in the protagonist's decision to demonstrate (balancing risk and proof) but the label itself remains somewhat ornamental. Two gates (setup, implicit in middle choice); no explicit closure participation. Swappability moderate; "principled and reverent" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Adapt" is seeded in the teacher's instruction (line 37: "ends when you adapt") and enacted in the hum sequence (line 38: "Adapt to the sorrow without swallowing it"). The action defines the mechanics of sonic absolution and is causally necessary for the Collector's transformation and the protagonist's renewed stewardship. All three gates met; causal pressure is strong. Minor friction: the action is somewhat internalized and abstract, reducing the visibility of the cost compared to a more concrete physical turn. Still, it redefines options and the closure depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Through vibrational matching" is introduced early (line 36), mechanics are demonstrated on the page (line 39: "I tuned my breath to his breath, then to the water, then to the wood"), and the method shapes the resolution (the Collector's collapse and hand withdrawal). The method is irreplaceable—removal would break the story's logic. All three gates met; high specificity and causal pressure. Cost: the protagonist must expose the artifact and risk mistuning (line 11: "rupture a harbor"). Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors the opening and recurs at closure ("the last light slid off the ice"). The setting supplies tactical resources (the hatch, the vault, the skiff approach) and atmospheric pressure (brittle chimes, cold salt, fleeting sunset). Two gates (setup, closure); middle involvement is moderate—the vault's "fleshly ethereal" air and the ice around the pilings shape the hum's pitch. Causal role is present but not indispensable; a stone tower or coastal crypt could substitute with edits. Lyric reprise (ice/gold imagery) charges the ending, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The fleeting golden sunset is introduced early (line 3) and recurs in the Collector's challenge (line 27: "the sky that was shedding gold") and at closure (line 50: "the last light slid off the ice"). Setup and closure gates met; middle development is weak—the sunset does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The Collector's "you are early… the sunset is almost gone" suggests time pressure, but elapsed time is not tracked and the hum sequence feels temporally unmoored. Swappability high; "under gathering storm clouds" could replace with minor edits. Lyric function only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To protect a sacred artifact" is stated in line 6, dramatized when the Collector threatens to take it (line 28), and tested in the protagonist's choice to demonstrate rather than refuse. The motivation drives all three beats and the closure (locking the vault, preserving "the harbor its listening"). Friction between wants (share absolution's proof) and costs (risk misuse) is visible on the page. All three gates met; high causal pressure and irreplaceability. Minor slip: the protagonist's internal conflict could be more contradictory—the decision to open the vault feels slightly too assured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is realized in the vault's atmosphere (line 34: "salt sweat and limestone singing a thin, forgiving note") and modulates during the hum (line 41: "a body-deep ribbon that combed time like wet hair"). The tone charges the final image (cooling key, quiet shudder of gold). Setup and closure gates met; middle coherence is strong. Minor friction: the phrase "fleshly ethereal" feels slightly imposed rather than emergent, and the label appears only once on the page. Tone supports the concept (sonic absolution as embodied labor) and intensifies under pressure without static mood. Good integration, just shy of essential.</comment>
