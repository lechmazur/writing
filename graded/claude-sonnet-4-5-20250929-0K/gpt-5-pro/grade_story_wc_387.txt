<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The philosopher's choices—pinching the fray, tracing cut patterns, whistling to guide them to the widow—drive key beats with embodied perception ("brewed field tea," "puckered his lips"). The widow Yazhen's mercy-driven net-cutting is given embodied grief ("creekbed of careful grief") and a clear hierarchy of values. Minor slip: Li's interiority remains functional but less distinct under pressure. The final teaching moment (moon loops) emerges from prior causality with visible cost (the widow's apology, the elders' surprise).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal support. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the community learns a gentler knot, the philosopher's wage becomes "to appreciate hidden effort," and the whisk dries with "bristles remembering the foam's brief constellations." One meaningful deepening occurs when the whistle reveals the widow, then the teaching scene reweights the net-mending from theft to mercy. Cost is legible: the widow's apology, the elders' ache, Li's sardine pouch waved away. Orientation is clear early. One micro turn (discovery of the widow) sets up closure without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet anchors action (tea-brewing, whistle bouncing, mesh inspection) and the sluice provides spatial grounding for the discovery. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining the philosopher's teaching method and charging the final image (drying on a nail, bristles remembering foam). Sensory detail—"stones still sweated," "slugs wrote cursive," "fireflies rose"—is filtered through the philosopher's perceptual bias (hidden patterns). The whisk and net materials shape the teaching demonstration and closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repair the nets and identify the "thief" before dawn while addressing hunger and debt. Pressure tightens when Li brings torn meshes and his father's demand; the philosopher's choice to investigate (whistle, follow moon paths) narrows options. The widow's revelation adds moral complexity (mercy vs. survival), and the teaching scene reweights the conflict from blame to compassion. One meaningful escalation (discovery) and one tightening choice (teach rather than condemn) with visible cost (elders' surprise, Li's pay refused). Agency is clear; coincidence (fireflies rising) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—compassion built into restraint, hidden effort, mercy vs. efficiency—emerges through the foam-map teaching, the widow's clandestine rescue work, and the moon-loop knots without statement. The final image (whisk drying, bristles remembering constellations) offers a non-literal answer: craft and memory encode mercy. Subtext operates in the widow's palm gesture, the philosopher's wage refusal, and the elders' surprised ache. The recurring net/water/moon pattern charges the closure without becoming a checklist. No thematic echo or moral summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with the philosopher as anchor; perceptual signature is consistent (hidden patterns, moon paths, foam gyres). Diction is elevated and lyric ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") but remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout. Dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext (Li's hunger-driven urgency, the widow's quiet apology). Minor slip: the widow's brief line "I cut where the river knots drown the slow ones" is slightly over-articulate for the moment's stress, though it remains within character. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most sentences do two jobs). Overwriting density issue: figurative language is dense throughout ("soft bead slid along string," "silk scraped from a chrysalis," "ink poured into water") without always advancing pressure, triggering −0.4. A few near-loops appear ("whispered" / "whispering," "demure audacity" repeated from opening to widow's gesture) but do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Closure beat ("bristles remembering the foam's brief constellations") is clean and propulsive. The elevated register is consistent and voice-motivated, so no register-drift penalty applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher-as-net-mender solving a "theft" through empathy and craft—offers a fresh synthesis. The foam-map teaching and moon-loop knots are specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric density and metaphoric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band). The widow's mercy-cutting transforms a simple mystery into a meditation on hidden effort and systemic redesign. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse with generic names/places. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher: present early (brewing tea, examining mesh), drives two beats (investigation via whistle, teaching the moon loops), and shapes closure (rinsing the whisk, wage statement). His choices narrow options (follow rather than condemn) with visible cost (refused payment, elders' surprise). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slightly below 8.5 because the teaching demonstration, while essential, shares agency with the widow's prior revelation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk: introduced early (frothing tea, blooming "like a small wooden sea anemone"), used in two distinct beats (tea-brewing, teaching foam-map loops), and charged at closure (hung to dry, "bristles remembering the foam's brief constellations"). Its properties (bristles, foam-making) enable the teaching tactic. Causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (+0.7). High irreplaceability: no other tool could demonstrate release-loops via foam.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hidden patterns: frames the philosopher's approach early ("eyes tuned to hidden patterns," "a net is a map of water's intentions"), constrains tactics (tracing diagonal bites, whistling to reveal the widow's work), and shapes closure (appreciating hidden effort as wage, moon loops as built-in release). Changes options: shifts conflict from theft-and-punishment to mercy-redesign. Causal pressure (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.6). Slightly below 8.5 because it operates more as a lens than a physical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Scintillatingly somber: anchors tone in opening and closing paragraphs ("every drop made a sound... scintillatingly somber," "Under the scintillatingly somber sky"). Constrains the philosopher's demeanor (tentative brightness, quiet whistle, wage refusal). Enables the widow's apology gesture and the elders' ache. One beat (discovery) and closure participation, but more ambient than causally decisive. Lyric reprise reweights the stake by framing the resolution. Mid-7s for purposeful tonal constraint without hard causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whistle: introduced mid-story, drives the discovery beat (bounces along parapet, fireflies rise, leads to widow at sluice), reappears at the teaching (pulses, Li learns cadence of give/catch/let-go), and shapes closure tactics (teaching rhythm). Causal pressure (+1.5): the whistle is the means of investigation and pedagogy. Closure linkage (+1.4). High irreplaceability: no other action could summon fireflies and teach rhythm simultaneously. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>By following moon paths: signaled mid-story ("following moon paths"), used once (descent to sluice where moonlight pooled), and reprised at closure ("by following moon paths their stride home mirrored the stream"). Shapes the investigation tactic and charges the final covenant image. Causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.2). Slightly below 8.0 because the mechanics (following moonlight) are more poetic than tactically constraining; the whistle does the heavier causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain: anchors opening and closing, supplies resources (wet stones for tea, puddles for descent, echoes for whistle, slugs' cursive), and frames the teaching demonstration (dusk gathering, lanterns). Micro-setting: the parapet's acoustics enable the whistle's propagation. Closure image: "the whispering parapet after rain kept its counsel, satisfied and still." Causal pressure (+1.1), closure linkage (+1.3). Strong integration; slightly below 8.5 because the sluice/channels do equal spatial work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>During firefly season: present early, used once (fireflies rise to meet the whistle, guide the descent), and implied at closure (fireflies thread like living commas). Constrains timing (season for fireflies) and enables one tactic (natural lanterns). Setup (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), closure reprise (+0.9). Mid-6s because the timeframe enables rather than tightens; no countdown or narrowing window alters decisions. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To appreciate hidden effort: present early ("appreciate hidden patterns"), dramatized in the philosopher's investigation (tracing bites, whistling to reveal the widow's work), conflicted with Li's hunger and the elders' demands, and crystallized at closure as the philosopher's wage. Changes options: shifts resolution from punishment to pedagogy. Causal pressure (+1.3), closure linkage (+1.6). High integration; the motivation drives every choice and reweights the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Demure audacity: coherent through turns (philosopher's tentative brightness, widow's quiet apology "charged with the demure audacity of stubborn mercy," elders' surprise). Modulates with pressure: restrained early, charged at discovery, resonant at closure. Shapes the philosopher's approach (no condemnation, teach instead) and charges the widow's gesture. Tone constraint (+1.0), closure charge (+1.2). Strong but slightly below 8.5 because it operates more as tonal coherence than a forcing function on tactics.</comment>
