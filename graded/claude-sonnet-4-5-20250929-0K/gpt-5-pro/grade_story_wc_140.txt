<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is strongly embodied through their unique perception ("filters reality differently, sifting noise for texture") and contradictory impulses—simultaneously gathering others' stories while losing their own name. Micro-choices appear in beats like pinning the label "to the wind with my gaze" and choosing silence over naming. The final teaching moment with the woman carries visible cost (giving up sole ownership of the method). Minor slip: the "death certificate error survivor" status remains more premise than internalized wound shaping on-page choices under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered fragments early and maintains it; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to shared practice) when the protagonist teaches the woman to "build our own ears from rust," reweighting solitary collection into collaborative witness with visible cost—the protagonist surrenders uniqueness. Orientation anchors (nameless narrator, container labyrinth, port city) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poison-bottle label connects to the woman's father's death, tightening personal and systemic erasure into a single thread. Cost is legible on the page in the final lines: "returning what it gathered" forecloses the prior stance of hoarding fragments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains movement ("wedged between two rusted walls") and provides the archive the protagonist reads (dents as consonants, scrapes as vowels). The poison-bottle label, tide-worked pilings, and barred-window office all appear in goal-directed action and modulate pressure. Micro-setting (tarps, cranes, mud at low tide) charges the closure image: "moving across the rhythm of tides, gathering what the water returned." The recurring container-as-text motif reweights at the end when shared listening replaces solitary decoding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the texture of memories/validating erased histories) is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist follows the label to the clerk, confronts official erasure, and chooses to teach rather than hoard. One meaningful turn: moving from solitary collection to collaborative witness forecloses the prior solitary stance with visible cost (loss of exclusive method). Agency operates through renunciation and attention; the protagonist's decision to teach the woman reconfigures tactics. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via density of overheard fragments building to the decision to share the method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (erasure and alternate archives) emerges entirely through concrete particulars: the death-certificate error, poison-bottle invoice, father's dock-code death, container dents as language. The final image offers a non-literal answer—collaborative witness as counter-archive—without stating a moral. The poison label's return in the protagonist's sleeve and the woman's "build our own ears from rust" line reweight the opening solitary stance. Subtext operates in silences (the clerk "could not say my name") and the protagonist's choice to "trade silence for a place to listen." No thematic echo; the piece resists summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is highly specific and stable: lyric-compressed syntax, maritime/archival diction ("diesel sheen," "hieroglyphs," "scribe rubbing away letters"), and a perceptual signature that translates containers into language. Psychic distance remains intimate first-person throughout with no head-hopping. The two brief dialogue moments ("the machines never listen") carry subtext and feel natural. Purposeful compression ("I do this by collecting fragments") is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor strain: "a murder that had learned to bathe" risks purple without clear payoff, but the line stays within the narrator's metaphor-dense idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Every snippet is a shell pressed to my ear" advances method, voice, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences in reflection and shorter beats in action ("I left him with silence"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two minor slips lower the score: "a code, too, a letter flicked sideways" repeats the code-as-cause motif without adding pressure, and "the hush of rain" after "hum of backdoors" risks stock poetic pairing. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated, though "diesel sheen, thin yet stubborn" and "murder that had learned to bathe" approach overwriting in adjacent beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic erasure, container-labyrinth as archive, and sensory-difference-as-epistemology feels specific and non-obvious. The poison-bottle label as physical evidence that官方records deny transforms the "erased histories" trope through concrete investigation. The turn to collaborative witness rather than solitary hero-archiving avoids the safety middle. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise without retreat. Minor deduction: the "death certificate error survivor" frame, while well-integrated, echoes bureaucratic-Kafkaesque templates common in contemporary literary fiction; transformation through the container-archive and tidal rhythm lifts it above derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout; introduced paragraph one. Drives two key beats: following the label to the clerk (middle), teaching the woman (closure). The death-certificate status enables the nameless stance and motivates the search for alternate validation, narrowing options (cannot use official records). Causal pressure is visible: the error creates the problem the protagonist solves by building a shadow archive. Closure participation: the protagonist's choice to teach hinges on shared outsider status. Specificity: "ghost with legal breath" makes the error concrete. Cost: teaching forfeits sole ownership. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Object introduced at ~25% ("wedged between two rusted walls"), reappears in the clerk scene as evidence, and returns in closure ("tucked the label into my sleeve where the pulse lives"), reweighting from clue to talisman. Drives one beat causally (leads to the clerk) and charges the final image by linking physical evidence to embodied witness. Not swappable; the poison-bottle label's specific text (rodentless nights, almond scent) connects to the father's death via container code. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Cost connection: the label's survival despite official destruction becomes proof that "drowners do not write" yet traces remain.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concept shapes stakes on every page: the protagonist collects erased histories because official records killed them legally, the woman's father vanished from ledgers, the clerk "corrected" the past. Drives two major beats: the label investigation (middle) and the teaching turn (closure). Narrows options throughout—no legal recourse, only underground assembly. Closure hinges on the concept: building "ears from rust" is the method for preserving what officials erase. Setup (paragraph two: "erased histories, scuffed from ledgers") + Development (label/father death linkage) + Payoff (collaborative counter-archive) gates met. Irreplaceable; swapping "erased" for "forgotten" would flatten the bureaucratic violence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attribute introduced early ("My mind filters reality differently, sifting noise for texture") and enables the method (hearing container dents as language, layering fragments into tides). Constrains choice once visibly: the protagonist cannot process information normally, must "trail and layer" instead. The trait justifies the unique perceptual mode but does not create a visible tradeoff or cost on the page—no moment where filtering differently fails or exacts a price under pressure. Setup + Development gates met; Payoff weak (mentioned in closure teaching but not charged). Functional but borders on label-only in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Action (layering overheard fragments) introduced paragraph two, executed across multiple beats (whistle→cousin→town→clock; dockworker's song; customs clerk's whisper), and drives the closure turn when the protagonist teaches the woman to layer. The method narrows tactics—no direct confrontation, only accumulation—and the decision to share it forecloses solitary mastery. Not swappable; "layering" is mechanically specific to the tidal/sedimentary metaphor and differentiates this from simple "listening." Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Cost: teaching the method dilutes its scarcity and the protagonist's unique role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Method introduced paragraph two ("I do this by collecting fragments of overheard stories"), executed in multiple beats (dockworker's brother, clerk's drowners, sailor's joke, woman's rumor), and drives closure when the method becomes shared practice. Mechanics matter: the protagonist must be present, must translate, must layer without writing. Shapes attempts throughout—the protagonist cannot demand testimony, only overhear and trail. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Specificity: "overheard" (not interviewed) and "fragments" (not full accounts) constrain the archive's nature and the protagonist's stance as ghost-witness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting introduced paragraph one, pressures choices throughout (wedged between walls, walking rows, sitting within the labyrinth), and charges closure ("moved across the rhythm of tides"). The container labyrinth supplies the archive (dents, codes, drum locations) and constrains movement, forcing the protagonist to "trail" rather than confront. The specific geography (cranes as metronomes, stacked iron corridors) enables the container-as-text conceit. Micro-setting (tarps, pilings) alters tactics in multiple beats. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Irreplaceable: a generic "dockyard" would lose the vertical maze and bureaucratic container-code system.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled early ("everyone keeps time across the rhythm of tides") and structures the narrative via tidal cycles (low tide mud archive, high tide hull choir, dawn whistle, evening crane rites). The rhythm organizes the protagonist's method (gathering what water returns) and charges the final line ("moving across the rhythm of tides, gathering what the water returned, and returning what it gathered"). Does not tighten decisions with urgency or create a live countdown; functions as pacing metaphor and thematic frame rather than tactical constraint. Setup + lyric Payoff gates met; Development (middle pressure) weak. Borders on atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("I came here to discover the texture of memories, the weave that holds a life when names unravel") and tested in the clerk confrontation (seeks official acknowledgment, receives only code) and closure (shifts from discovering to teaching texture). Drives one key choice—teaching the woman is an answer to the quest. Friction between wanting texture and losing one's own name is present but not dramatized as an on-page dilemma under pressure. Setup + Payoff gates met; Development (conflicted choice in middle beat) thin. Borders on premise rather than lived want with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone (nameless, ghostly witness stance) established paragraph one ("I walk unnamed," "My nameless identity floats like diesel sheen") and held throughout via diction (no proper self-reference, container codes replace names, "the card that failed machines"). Modulates purposefully: lyric compression in reflection, sharper syntax in confrontation beats. Charges the final image: the protagonist remains unnamed but now shares the nameless method, reweighting isolation into community. The tone is coherent and does not break under pressure. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Strong integration; removing the nameless stance would collapse the ghostliness and the bureaucratic-erasure stakes.</comment>
