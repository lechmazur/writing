<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's traits are embodied through concrete micro-choices: testing the stamp's grain, closing the lamp to use algae light, refusing to "let rage propel the index." Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between family quarrel knowledge and professional restraint ("I called him wrong without having the proof to earn it"). The final choice to leave the headlamp off and mark the arrow toward beginnings feels earned by prior pressure. Minor deduction: the "tranquilly perceptive" label appears once without dramatized cost in that beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator stamps four final notes and repositions the chalk arrow, crystallizing a commitment to truth over rage with visible cost (restraint, methodical honesty). The escalation reads as density increase—pattern recognition of the serrated crescent deepens stakes from catalog work to exposing forgery. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (narrator, library, blackout, assignment). One meaningful tightening occurs when genuine versus counterfeit crescents are tested, narrowing options and reweighting the dominant stake with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library's physicality constrains every choice: brine ticking against mosaics, algae veins supplying light, the dome flexing with tide. The antique stamp as micro-setting object charges the closure when its serrated crescent becomes proof. Sensory hierarchy fits POV (salt-scoring on brass, soot and balm ink pad). Minor slip: "dappled resolve flowing over stone" momentarily elevates diction without clear POV anchor, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: trace honest origins in warped records. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator discovers the smooth crescent lacks teeth, exposing forgery and implicating the harbor judge. Agency is decision and renunciation—refusing to let rage drive the index, drawing an alternative hypothesis tree, stamping notes with visible cost (methodical restraint forecloses immediate accusation). The blackout as coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: "revenge writes crooked, and crooked writing is another way water wins."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from stamp grain, crescent teeth, and the arrow pointing toward beginnings rather than exits: truth resides in forensic particulars, not declared morals. The final image—headlamp off, reclaimed stillness as colleague—offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to resist corrupt erasure) without stating a thesis. The eye-frond motif shifts meaning (inward curl before the break, outward stare after) and the line "They had made a room for thinking in a city that would later forget thinking" reweights prior material with undeniable cost. No thematic echo or sermonizing at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: vocabulary (indexer's "charter," "die," "allotments"), syntax (inverted "Such staring belonged"), and rhythm modulate with pressure (short bursts when testing the stamp, longer accumulative breath when reflecting). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and biased (notices salt-scoring, gnawed brass, angles of fronds). Diction under peak pressure stays character-particular without register drift. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression ("I was a tranquilly perceptive worker when quiet returned") is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every line advances pressure (stamp mechanics, crescent test, family history, hypothesis tree). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; openings avoid template stems. Minimal scaffold or loops. One brief cluster: "I readjusted the indexed order" echoes "readjust my habits" and "alternative hypothesis" recurs, but each instance advances knowledge without paraphrase. Figurative language is controlled ("algae stars," "tide flex of the dome") and consistent with narrator's technical-poetic register. Proofreading clean; action sequence clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of forensic indexing, flood-drowned civic memory, and the stamp's serrated crescent as proof feels specific and non-obvious. The premise (forgery detection via brass wear) transforms a familiar archival-mystery frame through tactile specificity (grain count, salt-scoring) and a moral calculus that refuses revenge. Risk-taking in quiet closure and the choice to point the arrow "toward beginnings" heightens stakes without gimmickry. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight once the smooth crescent is revealed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The logical page indexer frames expectation early, drives two distinct beats (testing the stamp, drawing the hypothesis tree), and their methodical restraint ("I would not let rage propel the index") shapes the closure action (stamping four notes, leaving the headlamp off). Choices alter tactics: closing the lamp to use algae light, repositioning the chalk arrow. Cost is visible: renouncing immediate accusation for documentary proof. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears across setup (waterproof satchel, kelp frond circling an eye), development (inking and pressing to test grain, discovering the serrated crescent), and payoff (stamping four final notes). It constrains choice (requires testing with soot and balm, counting grains) and charges closure (the honest stamp becomes the promise to carry truth upstairs). Unique properties matter: salt-scoring gnawed the brass decades before the flood, creating the diagnostic crescent. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reclaimed stillness shapes stakes early ("the blackout offered a listening grace I had long needed") and reappears at closure ("letting reclaimed stillness accompany me like a colleague"). It enables tactics (working without grid glow, hearing the books breathe) and reweights the dominant stake: the narrator reclaims thinking in a city that forgot thinking. Cost is conceptual (choosing patience over rage). Lyric reprise with clear stake connection, though middle development is implicit rather than dramatized in a distinct beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive appears once as a label ("I was a tranquilly perceptive worker when quiet returned") without enabling or constraining an on-page action with visible cost in that beat. The trait is embodied elsewhere (noticing salt-scoring, testing grain) but not under this exact phrase. Present and logically consistent but largely ornamental as labeled.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Readjust appears three times with escalating function: readjusting habits from catalog to fieldwork (setup), readjusting the indexed order to follow kelp imagery (key turn that reveals the pattern), readjusting the chalk arrow at closure. The middle instance drives the major turn: reordering by imagery rather than alphabet makes the frond's inward-to-outward shift visible, exposing forgery. Removing this exact action would break the story's causal logic. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Alternative hypothesis is signaled early ("my assignment demanded an alternative hypothesis") and its mechanics shape the middle beat: the narrator draws a hypothesis tree, branches mapped by dates and pigments, testing salt crescents and stroke weight. This method enables the discovery (smooth crescent versus serrated) and charges the closure (the tree becomes the documentary proof). Mechanics matter and are dramatized, though the phrase itself is used twice with slight redundancy.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city pressures every choice: brine ticking against mosaics supplies the metronome, algae veins provide light when the grid fails, the dome flexing with tide anchors time, and the drowned stacks hold the contested records. Setting supplies the stamp (civic receipts from before the flood) and the constraint (working in darkness). Closure linkage is strong: the library "already awake, pages queued" when the grid returns. High irreplaceability and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>During the blackout frames the entire action, tightens decisions (no grid glow forces algae light, timers and seals are hazards), and supplies the tactical window (the drone fails, allowing unobserved work). Time is tracked: "some hours later" the grid wakes. The blackout enables the listening grace and reclaimed stillness that shape the narrator's approach. Closure ties directly to time: lights will return to find the work already done. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To trace honest origins is signaled in the first third ("my charter was simple and exacting, to trace honest origins"), drives the middle beat (testing for genuine versus counterfeit crescents), and charges closure (stamping notes that mark where the honest eye ended). Desire is dramatized through friction: family knowledge versus professional restraint, rage versus methodical proof. The cost is visible: renouncing immediate accusation for documentary truth. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dappled resolve appears once as a phrase ("blue algae veins seep their muffled luminance through ceiling fractures, a dappled resolve flowing over stone") and the tone is coherent throughout: patient, methodical, quietly determined. Tone modulates with pressure (short syntax when testing the stamp, longer accumulative lines when reflecting) and charges the final image (headlamp off, stillness as colleague). The phrase itself is slightly elevated but the tonal effect is sustained and purposeful across turns.</comment>
