<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("gravitationally lighter when happy" embodied through ship mechanics), and the shadow work creates genuine internal contradiction ("how gently spoken neglect had bruised me into silence, and how I had bruised others by echo"). The pacifist oath drives micro-choices under pressure (declining the warhead, choosing patience and stitching). Minor slip: the midwife's smile as happiness trigger feels slightly convenient, but the final renunciation—sleeping "not victorious but kept"—carries visible cost and forecloses triumphalism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator commits to ongoing shadow work and care with the cost made explicit ("promising to stay open so long as we kept doing the work"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered acts (navigation, shadow work, stitching, threshold crossing) that reweight the stake from escape to caretaking. One tightening occurs when the door resists and the narrator must process their own complicity to proceed, narrowing options and raising emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship supplies concrete constraint: artificial gravity braids to prevent drift, maintenance shafts become accessible only when the narrator lightens, and the waste reclamation ring houses the dimensional lock. The kwan yin's tear functions as both navigational tool and threshold key, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (gallery wall, cot, suture plates) remains clear. Minor limitation: some details (funerary scaffolds, observation dome origin) enrich atmosphere but don't constrain a second choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension without violence—is signaled early and tested when the warhead software argues for impact. The door's resistance forces shadow work with visible cost: confronting "how gently spoken neglect had bruised me" before the seam yields. Escalation reads through Accumulative lens as the narrator layers navigation, confession, and stitching until the threshold opens. The final bargain ("to hold what we could not heal") forecloses triumphalism and commits to ongoing labor, making the cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—gentleness as both method and moral stance—emerges through concrete acts (declining warhead logic, stitching with patience, the tear as navigational gift) rather than assertion. The locked dimension "asking for a vow" and responding to shadow work integrates premise with theme. The final image ("promising to stay open so long as we kept doing the work") offers a non-literal answer that reweights the journey from escape to caretaking covenant. Minor slip: "gravitationally lighter, happy to be spared collapsing into despair" edges toward thematic statement, though the prior stitching earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: compressed poetic syntax ("a droplet of patient glass," "roomness itself"), metaphoric consistency (stitching/suturing throughout), and stable first-person present reflective mode. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the narrator notices tears, seams, structural vulnerability. Minor artifact: occasional elevated diction ("phosphorescent threads," "interstice") slightly exceeds plain speech but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close embodiment ("my joy loosened me") and wider reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines layer action, setting, and emotional charge (e.g., "I pricked my thumb on a bent suture needle and let one drop fall, then began to stitch a seam of light"). Rhythm varies and propulsion is clear. Two friction points: "We built the vessel from broken stations and funerary scaffolds, then seeded it with archives, soil, and a midwife who delivered the only sleeper before dying" compresses backstory efficiently but slightly stalls momentum in the opening third. Figurative language is dense (most sentences carry metaphor) but remains coherent and pattern-taught, avoiding the density penalty since the lyric mode is established early and sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—mapping coordinates through tears on photographs read via a glass droplet, navigation requiring shadow work to lighten gravitational load—is specific and non-obvious. The pacifist-versus-warhead conflict and the stitching-as-threshold method transform familiar tropes (locked door, final journey) through embodied particulars. Risk-taking in compressed poetic prose and the Accumulative structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limit: the "after the last human is born" frame is evocative but underutilized in shaping present choices beyond the cot's presence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steadfast pacifist identity drives the key turn: declining the warhead's impact solution and choosing patient stitching instead. This choice narrows tactics and raises cost (shadow work, slower method, vulnerability). The oath appears early, constrains the climactic approach, and the final vow to "keep doing the work" renews the stance with visible cost. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kwan yin's tear is handled in multiple beats: decoding the star map, threading through hatchwork, pressing against microetchings to yield reality, lifted above portraits to tease back the map, and held against the chest at closure. Its dual function (navigation tool and threshold key) is irreplaceable; removing it would break both journey and access. Early signal, middle use, closure charge, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shadow work shapes a pivotal choice: the narrator must "unspooling the terrified knots I hid from myself" because "the door would not tolerate a liar's weight." The on-page confession ("how gently spoken neglect had bruised me") enables threshold passage. Setup implied early, executed in middle beat, and echoed at closure ("so long as we kept doing the work"). Functional across beats but slightly abstract; more concrete dramatization would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravitational attribute constrains two on-page actions with cost: enabling access to an unreachable maintenance shaft when remembering joy, and later risking drift ("the ship braids artificial gravity to keep me from drifting into fans"). At closure, lightness during the vow ("we hovered a little, gravitationally lighter") charges the final image. Setup, middle enablement, closure reprise. Cost is bodily and tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stitching is the method for the climactic turn: "I pricked my thumb… then began to stitch a seam of light between two humming plates." The action is irreplaceable (patience versus impact), shapes the threshold opening, and recurs in the final vow ("left the door laced with threads of forgiven memory"). Early signal via "stitch our torn trajectory," peak use, closure callback. Swapping for another gentle method would require full structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shimmer method is signaled early ("learned where to try via the faint shimmer"), its mechanics detailed mid-story ("held to the gallery wall, kwan yin's tear bent starlight into phosphorescent threads, and the residue of grief became a star map"), and used again at the climax ("I lifted the tear above the portraits and teased back the map"). The photographs' spent tears at closure confirm the method's cost. Setup, repeated use, closure consequence; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship provides tactical resources: artificial gravity prevents drift, the maintenance shaft becomes accessible via lightness, the waste reclamation ring houses the lock, and "every patch sang" after stitching. The vessel's cobbled nature mirrors the narrator's self-assembly and charges the final image ("no longer felt cobbled but quilted"). Setup, middle constraints, closure transformation. Strong integration but slightly below indispensable; the journey could occur on a different vessel with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last human is born") establishes finality and the nursery's emotional weight. The child's presence as "the only sleeper" raises stakes (caretaking duty) and appears at closure when carried through the threshold. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Functional but doesn't tighten decisions beat-by-beat; more explicit temporal pressure would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "push open a locked dimension without wounding anything" is declared early, tested when the warhead argues for force, and drives the climactic stitching choice. Friction between the pacifist oath and the door's resistance creates visible cost (shadow work, self-confrontation). Setup, middle conflict, closure fulfillment ("the door breathed, promising to stay open"). High causal pressure; the motivation is irreplaceable and shapes all tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve is coherent throughout: quiet determination in "kept vigil," patience against the warhead, tenderness during stitching, and the final "not victorious but kept." Tone modulates with pressure (shadow work brings vulnerability, threshold crossing brings cautious hope) and charges the ending image. The tone is consistent, intentional, and integral to method and theme. Strong execution; just shy of indispensable since the tonal palette could shift slightly without breaking structure.</comment>
