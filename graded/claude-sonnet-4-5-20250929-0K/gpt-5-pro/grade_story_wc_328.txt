<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete objects (arrowhead, phone) and physical action (scraping flint to willow). Interior voice maintains specificity ("do not anthropomorphize rocks" self-talk), though the backstory about Marko—while anchored in present grief—occupies substantial text without altering present choices until the final pun moment. The metamorphosis at closure (vow replacing cover) reads as earned stance-shift, but the protagonist's agency leans observational through much of the middle, with pressure supplied more by the cryptid's dialogue than by protagonist micro-choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure (cryptid encounter forces stance crystallization). Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—the researcher's false cover metamorphoses into a vow, teaching laughter as communal healing—with felt cost (abandoning pure research posture, accepting a cosmic-joke pedagogy role). The phone-mediated dialogue and arrowhead-singing create a taught pattern that pays off when the arrowhead becomes "a tongue." One meaningful deepening occurs when the pun releases the cryptid, reweighting bitterness into method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly particular: "roots dangled from brick ribs," "pollen began to orbit Dani's jars," spores with "gravitationally playful" rings. The setting constrains choice—the herbalist's space permits the arrowhead-singing ritual and houses the phone that translates the cryptid. Micro-setting objects (clay jar, willow branch, valerian sacks) are handled on the page and enable the final release. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single continuous scene, and the frostbitten/breath-under-ice motif charges the atmosphere without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: trace the harmony untamed, transform bitterness over Marko's loss. Pressure accumulates through the phone voice's challenges ("bring stone to leaf," "turn your bitterness into a cosmic joke"), and the protagonist's pun—initially self-mocking—becomes the hinge that unspools the cryptid and reweights the grief into pedagogical vow. One clear tightening: the cryptid's appearance and directive force the narrator to abandon observational cover. Cost is felt (giving up revenge-research, accepting a teaching role), though the escalation leans more on external revelation than protagonist-driven tactical shifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete image and action: grief as soil to be composted, laughter as the method to "remember without breaking again." The arrowhead's journey from inheritance to "tongue" and the bad pun's genuine power avoid overt thesis statements. The cryptid's directive—"teach them to laugh where it hurts"—feels earned by the prior arrowhead-singing and Marko backstory, offering a non-literal answer to the question of how to metabolize communal trauma. The final vow and Dani's compost promise charge the ending without moralizing, and the recurring frostbitten-hope motif reweights without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive: compressed lyric syntax ("winter had stitched silence," "fruit roll toward it laughing"), character-specific diction ("do not anthropomorphize rocks"), and purposeful fragments. POV remains stable first-person; psychic distance is consistent. The phone-voice dialogue carries subtext and goal-pressure, though some lines edge toward prompt-echo ("harmony untamed waits for your arrow to become a mouth"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("metamorphose... the joke you clutch") in peak beats, but the arrowhead-pun turn and the narrator's self-aware humor restore ground-level texture. Free indirect handling of the cryptid's speech through the phone is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in places ("the missing return changed everything, we went below"), but several lines loop conceptually: "bitterness into a cosmic joke" appears three times with slight variation, and "harmony untamed" recurs without added pressure after the first mention. The phrase "gravitationally playful" is used twice in identical contexts. Figurative density is heavy throughout ("city itself was a drum," "weather apologizing," "doorway carved by words"), occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent lines without clear vehicle coherence. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the mid-section carries template cadence in reflection passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid-researcher-as-grief-worker, underground herbalist sanctuary, and flint-arrowhead-as-tongue is specific and non-obvious. The pun as ritual release and the phone as translation medium feel fresh within the urban-cryptid frame. The emotional truth—using humor to metabolize trauma rather than exorcise it—anchors the fantastical elements. The piece risks lyric compression and succeeds in making the arrowhead's transformation feel inevitable in hindsight. Marko's "broken radio" speech and the city's "returning people who were not themselves" premise read slightly stock, but the closure's pedagogy-of-laughter turn transforms the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher is present throughout and their undercover posture frames the narrative. Setup is clear in the opening paragraph. Middle development: the researcher chooses to scrape the arrowhead and engage the phone voice, which narrows options. Closure: the vow to "teach them to laugh" and the acknowledgment of "true name and false one" represent a stance-shift from observer to participant. The role is essential across all three gates, though much of the middle leans observational. Two beats of active choice (arrowhead-singing, pun utterance) plus closure participation and early signal place this solidly in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears in beat one (inheritance, "only inheritance that knew when the earth itself was a drum"), is used actively in beat two (scraped against jar to sing, then against willow to spark scent), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("keep the arrowhead dry, because it is a tongue now"). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (the scraping wakes the phone and later releases the cryptid), and closure linkage. The object's transformation from tool to tongue is irreplaceable and charges the final image. Early signal, multiple touches, and thematic payoff justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "harmony untamed" is introduced in the first quarter as the rumor the researcher is tracing. It recurs in the phone voice's line ("a harmony untamed waits for your arrow") and is named again when the cryptid appears ("the singer of a harmony untamed"). Setup is clear. Middle development: the concept motivates the researcher's presence and actions. Closure: the cryptid embodies it and delivers the pedagogical directive, but the phrase itself does not alter tactics or constrain a choice—it functions as thematic label. Two gates met (setup, closure participation), but swappable with "the song" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The attribute "gravitationally playful" is applied twice: first to the spore rings in the garden's atmosphere, then to the pollen orbiting jars after the arrowhead-scraping. Setup is present early. Middle development: the second use signals the cryptid's response and creates a pattern that the narrator notices. Closure: the attribute does not reappear or directly shape the final vow, but it marks the threshold between mundane and cryptid presence. The trait enables recognition rather than constraining action. Two gates (setup, middle), label-only at closure, and swappable with "weightless" or "floating" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "metamorphose" is introduced mid-story via the phone voice's command ("Metamorphose... not your body, but the joke you clutch"), then explicitly named at closure ("I felt my cover metamorphose into a vow"). Setup arrives after the first third (late penalty applies). Middle development: the command drives the protagonist to attempt the pun. Closure: the vow-formation is the enacted metamorphosis, redefining the researcher's role from observer to teacher. Two gates met (middle, closure), causal pressure at the ending, but late introduction and summary phrasing at closure ("felt my cover metamorphose") rather than fully dramatized transformation lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced in beat one (woken by the arrowhead-singing), used actively in beat two (the narrator "cradled the receiver" and converses), and returns at closure ("the phone clicked as if satisfied"). Three beats, early signal. Middle development: the phone mediates the cryptid's instructions, shaping the protagonist's attempts. Closure: the click registers the cryptid's satisfaction and closes the communication loop. The method is irreplaceable (the cryptid's jaw does not move; translation is required). Mechanics matter and are taught on the page. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is established in the opening line and remains the single setting throughout. Setup is immediate. Middle development: the space provides the willow branch, jars, and soil that the protagonist uses for the arrowhead ritual; Dani's return and the cryptid's emergence from "fern shadow" are enabled by the location. Closure: Dani's promise to "feed the choir with compost and quiet" roots the vow in the garden's resources. The setting constrains choice (only this sanctuary permits the cryptid encounter) and supplies the micro-objects that enable the ritual. All three gates met with strong causal ties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the missing return changed everything" is established in the opening paragraph as backstory anchor. Setup is clear. Middle development: the phrase does not recur or tighten decisions; the narrative unfolds in a continuous present without time pressure. Closure: no reference to the timeframe or its stakes. One gate only (setup). The timeframe contextualizes the protagonist's grief and the city's crisis but does not constrain tactics or alter the pacing of the encounter. Swappable with any prior trauma marker. Late-arrival cap does not apply, but missing middle and closure gates limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated early ("why I was here") and tied to Marko's loss. Setup is clear. Middle development: the phone voice echoes the phrasing ("if you can turn your bitterness into a cosmic joke"), and the protagonist's attempt (the sedimentality pun) enacts it. Closure: the cryptid names the motivation again and reframes it as pedagogical mission. Three beats, but the phrasing recurs nearly verbatim without evolving pressure. The pun moment dramatizes the desire with visible cost (self-forgiveness, release of the cryptid), but the motivation is told more than it generates friction between wants and prices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone "frostbitten hope" is established through imagery in the opening paragraph ("bubble of breath under ice," "kept my frostbitten hope alive") and sustained through phrases like "winter had stitched silence," "pale, eyes bright like frostflakes," and the recurring cold/warmth duality. Setup is strong. Middle: the tone modulates with pressure (the phone voice's challenge warms into possibility, the cryptid's appearance thaws the garden's stillness). Closure: Dani's compost promise and the protagonist's vow carry both chill (acknowledgment of grief) and warmth (pedagogical mission). Coherent across beats and the final image is charged by the tonal duality.</comment>
