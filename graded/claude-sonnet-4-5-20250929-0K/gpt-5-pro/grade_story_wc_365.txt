<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's occupation and method are vividly specific—sensory mapping through taste, smell, vibration—grounding the character in consistent perceptual habits. Interior life remains abstract and diagnostic at key moments: "weight of unsaid names bending my balance" and "I know now the origin of my cycles" lean toward philosophical summary rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to unseal the crate and redirect voices arrives smoothly but without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose another path. Micro-choices exist (pocketing the shard, tapping it, climbing) but the peak decision feels frictionless, lacking the competing impulse that would earn the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (sensory map maker) and where (abandoned spaceport repair bay) early; the "murmur of half-remembered dreams" timeframe remains atmospheric but does not create concrete temporal pressure. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory braiding, parallel-universe layering, and the climactic unsealing/redirection that distributes withheld voices across speakers. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the weight lifts and spreads) with felt cost legible in the line "It is lighter because it can be carried by many rather than anchored by few." One tightening (discovering the sealed crate, unsealing it, redirecting the voices) is sufficient for this length and lens. The cost is conceptual and social—voices released into public address—but the protagonist's personal stake or visible price remains oblique, preventing higher entry into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is rendered through evocative, POV-filtered detail: "ribcage," "rusted gantries," "thermal tides," coolant smelling of "mint and burned dust." The green glass shard functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice—wedged into a seam, it refracts a beam that reveals the log and enables the unsealing. Spatial choreography (concrete lip, maintenance cradle, gantry climb) remains coherent and the sensory hierarchy (taste, smell, vibration) reflects the protagonist's professional priorities. The setting directly enables the climactic action and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering and measuring the weight of withheld truth—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through sensory investigation, log discovery, and the crate unsealing; the protagonist's agency drives each beat. The climactic redirection narrows options (voices now public, weight distributed) but the cost remains conceptual and oblique: no visible trade-off, injury, or foreclosed personal path is dramatized on the page. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, and the weight-lifting image reweights prior material, but the lack of a felt personal price or visible trade-off prevents 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—withheld truths exert gravity, distribution lightens collective burden—emerges through action (unsealing, redirecting) and the final image of weight spreading "like a shallow, luminous tide." The closing lines ("bridges do not hoard weight; they distribute it") risk stating the thesis but remain grounded in the protagonist's occupational metaphor. The green shard and the voices-as-cargo recur with shifting meaning, and the piece avoids moralizing while offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor thematic echo in "I know now the origin of my cycles" leans toward articulation but does not dominate the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric, compressed syntax ("Every cycle, my leaps come unbidden, cyclically spontaneous as if time itself breathes in patterns") with sensory diction that reflects the protagonist's profession. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and held. Filter verbs ("I feel," "I taste") appear frequently but read as voice-motivated occupational habit rather than opacity. The piece teaches its pattern—sensory metaphor, parallel-universe shifts—and pays it off at closure. Perceptual signature (taste, smell, vibration) is selective and character-specific, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q6.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful: "routes braid like threads," "bay opens like a ribcage," "taste like sea glass thawing on the tongue." Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("braid shows three faint paths, each slightly offset, like fingerprints pressed from parallel hands") where vehicles multiply without added clarity. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "I [verb]… I [verb]… I [verb]" across multiple lines. Minor paraphrase loop: "I split my attention and slip where the scents diverge" followed immediately by three parallel-universe descriptions that restate the same split. Information density is high but artifacts in non-closure beats prevent 8+ entry. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.6 for template cadence and minor loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—sensory cartographer who navigates parallel universes to redistribute suppressed refugee voices—is specific and non-obvious. The spaceport-as-archive and voices-as-cargo premise transforms familiar "withheld truth" material through occupational specificity and the parallel-universe method. Emotional arc integrates with theme (bridge, not hoarder) without retreating to safety. The piece commits fully to its lyric, sensory mode and follows through at closure. Risk-taking (compressed syntax, parallel-universe layering, no antagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning within-band adjustment of +0.3 for bold structural choices that remain legible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character (sensory map maker) is present early, shapes investigation beats (tapping shard, climbing gantry, unsealing crate), and drives the climactic redirection. Occupational method constrains tactics and charges closure. All three gates met; two distinct beats; causal pressure; closure linkage; irreplaceability high. Swappability low—removing this exact profession would require major rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Object (green glass shard) introduced early (paragraph 8), used in three beats: pocketed for tactile mapping, tapped against cradle to map hollows, wedged into seam to refract beam that reveals log and enables unsealing. Returns at closure ("dims to a calm ember," left "set in the seam, a bead in the loom"). All three gates; three beats; causal pressure (refracts beam, enables discovery); closure linkage; specificity high (hums, refracts, dims). Cost connection present (becomes tool, then anchor for future menders).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Core Concept (weaving between worlds) shapes tactics: protagonist "slips where scents diverge, through parallel universes," passes through versions to chart fear, and redirects voices across adjacent bays in each universe. Present early, constrains method in middle beats, integral to climactic distribution. All three gates; causal pressure; closure linkage. Specificity moderate—parallel-universe method could be replaced by other exotic means with moderate edits, but the "weaving" metaphor ties to sensory braiding and "bead in the loom" payoff, raising irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attribute (cyclically spontaneous) mentioned early ("every cycle, my leaps come unbidden") and revisited at closure ("I know now the origin of my cycles," "let the breath tip me outward again"). Does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost; functions as thematic frame rather than tactical limiter. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. Lyric reprise reweights meaning (protagonist as bridge), but no on-page cost tied to cyclicality. Cap at 6.3 per lyric allowance; ornamental use and lack of middle constraint lower score within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Action (redirect) is the climactic turn: protagonist redirects voices from sealed crate to public-address channels across parallel bays, fulfilling the mission and distributing weight. Present at closure, defines resolution, and traces directly to prior setup (log discovery, unsealing). All three gates; closure linkage maximal; causal pressure high; irreplaceability high—swapping "redirect" for another verb would break thematic and occupational logic. Cost connection present (weight lifts and spreads). Strong closure participation elevates score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method (through parallel universes) signaled early ("split my attention and slip where the scents diverge, through parallel universes that overlay this hall"), used in middle investigation (three versions of the bay), and integral to climactic redirection ("I pass through parallel universes again… guide them by flavor… speakers crackle" in every universe). All three gates; two distinct beats; causal pressure; closure linkage. Mechanics visible (slipping, passing through, matching breath). Swappability moderate—could be replaced by other exotic traversal with effort, but the sensory-braiding method ties to protagonist's profession, raising irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting (abandoned spaceport repair bay) anchors early, provides resources (gantry for climbing, cradle for listening, seam for wedging shard), and houses the sealed crate. Micro-setting elements (concrete lip, maintenance cradle, gantry) constrain tactics. All three gates; causal pressure; closure linkage (protagonist leaves shard "set in the seam" as anchor). Specificity high—spaceport repair context enables the cargo/refugee premise and the nerve-wire prism device. Irreplaceability moderate to high; other industrial settings could substitute but would require reweighting thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("in the murmur of half-remembered dreams") functions as atmospheric opening and closing frame but does not create ticking-clock pressure or constrain middle choices. Setup and payoff gates met (opening and closing lines); development gate absent. Ornamental use; no on-page cost tied to dream-time. Cap at 4.6 per missing-development gate. Lyric reprise present but does not reweight stake with pressure. Score within low band for frame-only participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation (to discover the weight of a withheld truth) is dramatized early ("I arrived because a whisper from a machine said the truth I seek grew heavy here"), drives investigation beats (following coolant scent, tapping shard, reading log), and is fulfilled at closure (unsealing and redistributing voices, measuring weight's lift). All three gates; causal pressure; closure linkage; cost connection (conceptual—voices released, weight distributed). Friction between want (discover weight) and method (sensory attunement, patience) is implicit but not visibly conflicted. Swappability low—removing this exact motivation would hollow the occupational premise.</comment>
