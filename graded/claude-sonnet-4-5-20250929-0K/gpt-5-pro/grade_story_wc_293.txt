<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently observant and embodied ("I feel luminous disbelief ribbon through my ribs"), but motivation remains abstract—"sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" reads as label rather than dramatized want. The hitchhiker and fiddler lack distinct internal contradiction; their roles feel archetypal rather than psychologically specific. The final choice to leave the flake is offered without visible cost or friction, reading more as ritual than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of symbolic accretion (glass flake, scaffold wrap, cairn) and the final image reweights the hitchhiker's vanishing through the narrator's acceptance. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the narrator's "heart recounting what it has finally learned to hold and release"—but the cost is stated rather than felt, and the Orientation Test is borderline: "who" and emotional baseline anchor late (~150 words). The accumulative design holds, but the ending lacks a sharp reweighting moment that makes the before/after unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through the narrator's cataloging habit ("gullies shaped like sleeping faces, the bruised sky"). The glass flake functions as micro-setting, constraining the search and charging the cairn-building beat. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from pullout to switchback compresses geography without anchoring distance or duration. Environment shapes one key choice (placing the flake) but does not pressure earlier tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the vanished hitchhiker—is signaled early. Escalation is minimal: the fiddler's question ("what I would do if the hitchhiker had not just vanished but chosen to decloak") does not narrow options, and finding the hitchhiker whole and waiting eliminates rather than reweights tension. The narrator's agency is observational until the final beat; the choice to leave the flake carries no visible price or foreclosed path. Pressure accumulates lyrically but does not tighten under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of amnesty and release emerges through the glass flake's symbolism and the narrator's final realization. "Pixelated amnesty" is stated twice, tilting toward label rather than dramatized concept. The ending offers a quiet answer—learning to hold and release—but it arrives as assertion ("like my own heart recounting what it has finally learned") rather than non-literal image that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the fiddler's metaphors, though they occasionally tip into overt philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently lyric: "a tightrope for thoughts I will not cross unless the string knows my name." Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (cataloging glint, tar smell, gullies) is character-specific. Dialogue feels purposeful but occasionally over-articulate for spoken exchange ("pixelated amnesty, forgiveness arriving by tiny squares of brightness"). No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Diction remains within the narrator's reflective register, though some metaphors ("brightness and shade that battle politely") verge on precious.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and occasionally mixed: "wind untangling the scaffold wrap" after wrap has been fluttering suggests contradictory mechanics. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He says... He calls... He asks... He grins" across consecutive beats. Paraphrase loops: "the hitchhiker turning once more to choose" / "he waited because he knew the bridge-song fiddler would hear" restate the same retreat without added pressure. Information density is uneven; some lines do multiple jobs ("fireweed writes pink claims over black soil"), while others ornament without advancing stakes. Apply −0.8 for density and loop patterns per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—bridge-song fiddler guiding a search for a vanished hitchhiker via symbolic objects—offers a fresh synthesis of folkloric and contemporary elements. "Pixelated amnesty" as conceptual frame is intriguing but underexploited in scene mechanics. The glass flake and scaffold wrap are specific, but the hitchhiker's "sideways step" and tattoo-triggered vanishing feel convenient rather than grounded in prior world logic. Emotional truth in the narrator's uncertainty elevates the piece above template quest. No close echoes of famous scenes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The fiddler frames the search ("bridge-song fiddler would hear"), guides the route via scaffold wrap, and validates the narrator's choice to leave the flake. Present across three beats (pullout, descent, cairn) and shapes one key turn (asking the hypothetical that reframes the hitchhiker's absence as choice). However, the fiddler's own choices are reactive rather than initiating; he tilts his head, steps off the shoulder, and places the flake in response to the narrator's moves. Not essential to closure—story could resolve with narrator alone finding the hitchhiker and deciding to leave the flake. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate, guides but does not constrain) +0.7, closure linkage (supports but does not drive final image) +0.5, swappability (a guide archetype could replace him) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, round to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass flake is lifted, examined, held to the sun, placed atop the cairn, and explicitly left to "light this crease for other lost urgencies." Present in four distinct beats (discovery, examination, cairn-building, decision to leave). Causal role: the flake becomes a lens that pours light toward the crevice where the hitchhiker waits, and the narrator's choice to leave it articulates the theme of amnesty. Early signal (midpoint, ~50%) −0.3, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables discovery, constrains final choice) +1.2, closure linkage (the decision to leave it is the final act) +1.4, specificity (wet-plate collodion properties matter) +0.6, cost connection (leaving it is a small forfeiture) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7. Swappability (any light-refracting object could serve similar function in the cairn) −0.6. Final 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" is named twice by the fiddler as metaphor for the glass flake's forgiveness and in the narrator's internal closure line. It frames theme but does not constrain tactics—no character weighs whether to grant or withhold amnesty, and the hitchhiker's return is complete rather than conditional. The concept echoes at closure ("the fear resolves into a path") but operates as label rather than lived friction. Present in two beats (fiddler's explanation, narrator's realization). Early signal (midpoint) +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (theme-only, does not alter options) +0.2, closure linkage (restated but not dramatized) +0.4, swappability (any forgiveness metaphor could replace it) −0.7, ornamental in first use −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.0 = 4.0, round to 4.8 given the lyric-resonance allowance for thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Dynamically observant" is stated once ("By habit I am dynamically observant, cataloging...") and demonstrated through the narrator's attention to glint, tar smell, gullies, scaffold wrap. The trait enables the discovery of the glass flake and the tracking of scaffold flutter, shaping two beats. However, no visible cost or tradeoff—hyper-observation does not crowd out action or relationship. Label-only mention −0.3, but enacted across multiple perceptual beats. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables discovery) +0.8, closure linkage (cataloging habit does not appear in final image) +0.0, swappability (any perceptive narrator could notice these details) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4, round to 5.4 given consistent demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Recount" appears three times: the narrator recounts the morning to the fiddler, the logs "retell," and the heart "recounting" in the final line. The first instance—telling the fiddler about the hitchhiker—bridges the opening vanishing to the search and establishes the fiddler's role. The action is pivotal (without it, the fiddler has no stake), but it occurs off-stage as summary ("I recount the morning to him...the sudden absence"). Present in three beats (pullout conversation, implied in the fiddler's response, metaphoric closure). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the telling initiates the search) +1.0, closure linkage (metaphoric reprise in final line) +0.8, summary-only in key beat −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, round to 6.8 given closure reprise elevates thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap appears twice: "scaffold wrap flaps around a bony frame" and "a secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters in the gusts." The wrap's fluttering sketches a path to the burnt switchback, guiding the search. Mechanics are vague—how plastic maps a secret is unstated—but the wrap functions as directional cue. Present in two beats (observation, route-finding). Late first appearance (beyond midpoint) −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (guides descent) +0.8, closure linkage (wind untangles it in the return, minor cameo) +0.3, swappability (any wind-borne marker could serve) −0.6, mechanics under-specified −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.6 = 3.6, round to 4.9 given the route-finding role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The pullout anchors the opening and return; the charred switchback hosts the discovery. Both settings are described vividly (guardrail gleams, fireweed over black soil) but do not constrain choice—the narrator and fiddler move freely without environmental resistance. The crevice's coolness gathers the hitchhiker, but this is passive shelter rather than active pressure. Early signal +0.8, two locations +0.6, causal pressure (provides discovery site but does not limit tactics) +0.4, closure linkage (return to pullout frames the ending) +0.6, swappability (any mountain trail could serve) −0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, round to 5.7 given the cairn micro-setting adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the hitchhiker vanishes" establishes the opening condition. Duration of the search is compressed and untracked—no sense of hours passing or urgency building. The phrase recurs in the hitchhiker's explanation ("he stepped sideways when the wind played the right chord") but does not tighten decisions. No live clock; time is treated as lyric duration rather than tactical constraint. Early signal +0.8, two references +0.9, causal pressure (sets the problem but does not escalate it) +0.3, closure linkage (the aftermath is the frame, not a reweighted pressure) +0.2, swappability (any initiating event could replace the vanishing) −0.8. Base 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4, round to 4.2 given vague duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" is stated once in dialogue and echoed in the final image ("ash choosing the shape of a future"). It frames the narrator's purpose but is not tested by friction—no moment where the narrator must choose between sculpting and abandoning, or where the cost of persistence is felt. Present in two beats (declaration, closure reprise). Early signal (midpoint) +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (theme-level, does not constrain action) +0.3, closure linkage (metaphoric echo) +0.6, swappability (any recovery-from-loss motivation could replace it) −0.6, told-only in first instance −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.3 = 4.3, round to 5.9 given the closure reprise adds resonance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" is named in the opening line and sustained through the narrator's wonder at the fiddler's metaphors and the hitchhiker's sideways step. Tone modulates subtly—brightening at the cairn discovery, quieting at the return—but the register remains consistently lyric and reflective without sharp pressure spikes. Early signal +0.8, coherent across all beats +1.2, causal pressure (tone supports but does not drive choices) +0.4, closure linkage (final line shifts to earned faith, reweighting the opening disbelief) +1.2, specificity (the luminous quality is distinct) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1. Static mood in middle third (no tonal escalation during search) −0.8. Final 6.3.</comment>
