<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's interiority shows embodied emotion ("breathe the wet metal ozone that tastes like bitten nails") and the grandmother's teaching functions as motive. However, the protagonist's agency is mostly receptive—gathering, holding, following—rather than forcing difficult choices under contradictory impulses. The final decision to "reimagine the delivery" and "ask who has rope" is stated but not dramatized with visible cost or internal friction. Motivation remains consistent but lacks the layered contradiction and on-page struggle that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with disorientation (storm, GPS failure) and anchors who/where by the archway paragraph; orientation passes. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist internalizes the shelter-building lesson and commits to collaborative work in the village, reweighting isolation into alliance. Cost is conceptual—shifting from solo sculptor to community facilitator—but legible in the final image of holding the slide "to bless the bolts with memory." One meaningful deepening (shelter-building under the arch) tightens the stakes. The lens holds, though some causal ellipsis (how exactly the slide "throws hints" that enable construction) blurs mechanical linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-tossed basalt archway supplies concrete constraint: the protagonist builds shelter *under* it, using its geometry ("curved seam," "shadow now a gate"). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("salt-white world," "foam-lit sand," "drowned organ tone"). The magic lantern slide functions as micro-setting object, constraining the final act by "throwing hints" that guide construction. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though "angle the slide so moonlight through cloud finds it" introduces slight physics ambiguity (moonlight in storm cloud). The archway charges the closure by transforming from threat to gate, satisfying the Q3 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survival and meaning-making after GPS failure. The storm complicates, then the archway discovery tightens options to one location. Building the shelter is one meaningful on-page turn that narrows choices and forecloses passive waiting. Cost is visible (physical effort: "hammering pebbles with palms," "curl inside") and the shelter holds by dawn. However, escalation is gentle—pressure comes from environment rather than protagonist wrestling contradictory goals—and the final village plan is declared rather than tested. Agency at closure (deciding to "reimagine the delivery") shifts stance but lacks a dramatized trade-off or second complication that would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of collaborative resilience emerges through the shelter-building process and the grandmother's "perpetually learning" creed, not through statement. The magic lantern slide recurs with shifting meaning: first as heirloom, then projector/guide, finally as blessing tool. The ending image—holding the slide aloft to "bless the bolts"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "how do we build across storms?" without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "timewoven alliances" motif and the archway's transformation from "threat" to "gate." Minor slip: "what matters is how my new map handles the human currents" veers toward abstraction, and the final paragraph's didactic tone ("No one needs a lecture...") edges close to thesis-stating, though it remains within the protagonist's practical voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms out for reverie, in for tactile detail). Diction is lyric and distinct ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances," "weatherproof"), matching a poetic sculptor's perceptual signature. No dialogue to judge. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with urgent survival context: "through layered meanings only patience sorts" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" read more like craft-essay phrasing than embodied thought under storm pressure. The final long expository paragraph shifts into didactic mode ("No one needs a lecture when the sea is memory") that, while voice-consistent, flattens urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("salt-white world hummed like turbines," "crib for shelter shaped like a listening ear"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, patterned overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor or poetic inversion, creating a relentless lyric texture that occasionally obscures action sequence (e.g., "hammering pebbles with palms until nails remember their purpose" is evocative but mechanically vague). The final third contains mild paraphrase loops ("perpetually learning to scaffold complexity" appears twice in close succession) and the closing paragraph's repeated exposition of the village plan recycles concepts. No grammar errors; clarity holds at closure, so artifact penalties stay moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of driftwood sculptor, magic lantern slide, and storm archway as collaborative teaching-moment is specific and non-generic. The "timewoven alliances" concept and the shift from solo art to community building offer a fresh inflection on survival narratives. Emotional specificity (grandmother's lighthouse legacy, tactile shelter-building) grounds the lyric mode. However, the central insight—"scaffold complexity with simplicity"—is articulated rather than fully dramatized, and the final village-invitation feels more like a thematic promise than an earned structural surprise. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative design, which is bold, but the closure's didactic turn toward communal blueprinting follows a familiar arc of isolation-to-connection without a sharp counter-reading or ambiguity that would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 3) and named throughout. The sculptor's identity motivates gathering driftwood and building the shelter frame, which is a key middle choice. The trait appears in the final image (planning to build with the village). However, "spirited" remains label-only; the actual sculpting practice is gestured at ("coax them toward listening shapes") but not shown in a beat where aesthetic choice pressures survival. The role is functional and integrated but somewhat replaceable—any maker/craftsperson could perform the same beats without major rewrites. Two of three gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 7) as the grandmother's heirloom, then held to the car light (paragraph 9), angled to moonlight and set in the archway as projector (paragraphs 13–14), flares during lightning (paragraph 21), shows the final guiding image (paragraph 27), and reappears in the ending promise to "hold aloft the magic lantern slide to bless the bolts." Four distinct beats, strong closure linkage, and irreplaceability (its projected "ghosts" and images guide construction). The slide drives the shelter-building tactic and charges the ending. Cost is implied (reliance on fragile glass in storm, emotional weight of inheritance). All three gates met; causal pressure and closure participation are high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The phrase "timewoven alliances" appears three times as a thematic label (paragraphs 10, 12, 21) but does not function as a dramatized on-page mechanism. The concept is invoked to describe the projected ghosts and the protagonist's collaborative intention, yet no specific alliance is negotiated or tested within the story window—the village collaboration is promised in the ending, not executed. Setup is present; middle and closure are summary-only. The element remains abstract and swappable with "intergenerational wisdom" or "collaborative legacy" without altering the plot. Late label use in the final third cannot lift integration above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is named as the grandmother's and protagonist's creed (paragraph 12), appears again in the reverie (paragraph 25), and frames the final paragraph ("perpetually learning to scaffold..."). It motivates the protagonist's receptive stance (listening to the sea, following gull prints, trusting the lantern slide's hints). However, the trait is more thematic gloss than visible constraint—no beat shows the protagonist choosing to learn at a cost (e.g., abandoning a familiar method or enduring failure). The element shapes tone and interiority but does not narrow options or create friction. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reimagine" appears explicitly in paragraph 16 ("reimagine navigation as listening") and again in paragraph 29 ("reimagine the delivery"). The first use is tied to the map/constellation lesson from the slide; the second anchors the protagonist's shift from solo sculptor to collaborative facilitator, which is the closure turn. The action drives the ending choice and is causally linked to the shelter-building experience. However, it arrives late (second half) and is more cognitive shift than physical decision under duress. All three gates met (setup in navigation paragraph, middle via shelter attempt, payoff in village plan), but causal pressure is moderate and the action could be replaced with "reframe" or "reconsider" with minor edits. Closure linkage and cost (forgoing solo delivery) keep it in mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is named twice (paragraphs 14, 29) as the method by which the lantern slide's images are interpreted and the protagonist's new collaborative work will proceed. The phrase describes the slide's projected lessons but does not specify a procedure that visibly alters tactics—how "layered meanings" differ from simple observation is not dramatized. The method is ornamental to the slide's function and could be swapped with "through patient study" or "by attentive reading" without plot change. Present at setup and payoff but undeveloped in the middle; no clear cost or mechanics. Cap at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "storm-tossed archway of basalt" is introduced early (paragraph 5) as the location the gulls lead the protagonist to. It supplies the spatial frame for the shelter-building (paragraphs 13, 20: "under the archway," "curved seam," "shadow now a gate") and its transformation from threat to protective structure is the closure image (paragraph 27). The archway constrains the protagonist's choice (only viable shelter site) and provides resources (basalt ribs, wind-shadow geometry). Three beats (discovery, construction, dawn reappraisal) with strong closure charge. The arch is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the plot. All three gates met; causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage are high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" anchors the inciting event (paragraph 4) and establishes the constraint that forces the protagonist to "turn by feel." The timeframe tightens choice by removing technological navigation, pushing reliance on the lantern slide and environment. However, after the opening, elapsed time is vague—storm duration, shelter-building time, and overnight passage are untracked—and no ticking clock pressures the middle beats. The dawn arrival (paragraph 27) bookends the night but does not escalate tactics. Two gates met (setup incites, payoff at dawn); middle development is implicit. The timeframe enables the plot but does not actively narrow options after the first beat. Lyric reprise (first → last) and causal role in setup keep it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is named explicitly (paragraph 18) as the protagonist's understanding of the task and reappears in the closing line (paragraph 36). The desire motivates the shelter-building tactic (paragraph 18: "lay the obvious strong plank first, then sing the fastenings") and the village collaboration plan (paragraph 30: "simple enough to carry, strong enough to hold growing difficulty"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in friction—no beat shows the protagonist wrestling between over-complication and reductive simplicity, or paying a cost for choosing one over the other. Two gates (middle, payoff) met; setup is late (past midpoint). The element shapes the protagonist's rationale and final stance but lacks visible constraint or trade-off. Closure linkage and thematic resonance keep it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" is named in the opening line and recurs as "turbines" in paragraphs 11, 23, 32, anchoring the sonic/meditative atmosphere. The tone modulates with pressure: dreamlike in the opening, practical during shelter-building, then expansive in the final village vision. The turbines' "low growl" steadies the protagonist's breathing (paragraph 11) and "hum as if agreeing" at closure (paragraph 32), charging the final image with ambient presence. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens. However, "reverie" competes with survival urgency in the middle beats, creating slight tonal friction. All three gates met; tone shapes perception and closure resonance, reaching high mid-band.</comment>
