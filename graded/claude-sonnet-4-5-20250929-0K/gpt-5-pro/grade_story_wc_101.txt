<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization shows consistent traits (gently persistent, careful) and her decisions shape the story's tactics. Internal contradiction appears in the Noor/Farid tension but not within Mara herself. The collective "we" POV diffuses individual stakes and micro-choices; Mara's motivations are told more than tested under pressure. The final choice—continuing the system—feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible renunciation or forfeiture with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through the sanctions backdrop, the bell's shifting contents, and the food-run choreography. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the community persists with the anonymity rule intact, and "our quiet amplified across the ridge like weather" reweights the opening arbor scene. Cost is felt in the persistence itself—"sanctions stayed, but so did we"—though the price could be more visceral. Orientation is solid; the pattern is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors the opening and closing, and the bell functions as micro-setting (held, passed, catches moonlight) that constrains the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("moon was a rind," "amplified quiet"). The sanctions period colors perception without overwhelming the frame. The arbor's role in the ending charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but spatial choreography during the midnight run blurs—individual doors and thresholds are not tracked distinctly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survival through anonymous mutual aid under surveillance. The Noor/Farid accusation creates one meaningful tightening; Mara's braided-run plan narrows options and forces the youth and elder to carry each other's burdens. The resolution—bell empty save a note, anonymity reaffirmed—lands with conceptual cost (continued risk, no credit) but the watchers vanish from the frame after the threat is established, reducing felt danger. Escalation is textural (density increases) rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust and protection through anonymity, intergenerational solidarity—emerges organically from the bell ritual and the food runs. The final note ("We give and receive as the same hands; please let it stay nameless") and Mara's closing declaration avoid overt moralizing by embedding the insight in action. The widow's lullaby and the boy's steadied hands provide specific, non-obvious texture. Minor slip: "amplified quiet" and "intergenerational support" echo prompt language, but the image of the bell holding only flour-smudge and a folded note reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") is controlled as a single collective stance; no head-hopping into individuated interiorities occurs. Perceptual signature is consistent: lyric, compression-heavy, and metaphor-dense ("stars floating in it like distant coins," "breath and echo"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext. Psychic distance is stable. Under peak stress (the food run), diction remains voice-consistent. One minor filter-verb cluster ("watched the stars tremble," "listened," "looked") in the arbor scene does not materially dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Metaphor coherence holds except for one mixed vehicle: "antique silver bell that shivered even in sunlight, as if homesick"—metal shivers from cold, not warmth; the homesick vehicle is emotionally apt but physically contradictory. Light paraphrase loop: "No names would be thanked, no names would be shamed" / "we will keep it nameless" recurs without adding pressure. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly voice-motivated and legible. Minor deductions for the mixed metaphor and loop; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous mutual aid under sanctions—is not novel, but the bell as donation vessel and the braided elder/youth food run offer specific, grounded inflection. The emotional particulars (lullaby, steadied pencil hands) avoid generic templates. Risk is present in the lyric compression and collective POV, which heighten voice without obscuring clarity. The ending's quiet persistence is earned but does not surprise; transformation of the premise is modest. No close echoes of famous lines; conceptual integrity is solid.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is introduced early, sets the bell ritual, declares the anonymity rule, and designs the braided run that resolves the Noor/Farid tension. Her choices create the key turn (the shared route) and she appears in the closure beat, reaffirming the motive. She is not swappable. Minor deduction: her decisions are presented more than tested under pressure; the story tells us she is gently persistent rather than dramatizing resistance to that trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bell appears in the opening (set on the bench, stars in it), middle (holds donations, tapped as reminder, passed cup-to-cup during the run, catches moonlight as signal), and closing (holds flour-smudge and note). It functions as donation vessel, ritual anchor, and signal device. Removing it would collapse the story's central ritual. Its mechanics and evolving contents (flour chits, insulin, ring, note) shape tactics and charge the final image. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Anonymous donations are signaled early (bell as donation vessel, Mara's rule), constrain tactics (no names thanked or shamed), and drive the Noor/Farid conflict (youth craves credit, elders protect anonymity). The concept reappears in the closure note ("let it stay nameless") and Mara's final declaration. It shapes the dominant stake and alters options (the braided run preserves anonymity while proving the system works). Removing the anonymity frame would fundamentally break the story's logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is labeled early ("never pushing, always returning like a tide") and demonstrated in Mara's repeated listening, her plan to braid the run, and her breath across the bell instead of ringing it. The trait enables her leadership approach and constrains her to indirect persuasion rather than command. It appears in the closure ("we will keep it nameless") but the cost of gentleness versus force is not dramatized; the trait is more illustrative than tested under opposing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Declare" appears twice: Mara's rule declaration ("No names would be thanked, no names would be shamed") and her closing motive declaration ("Today I declare our motive clean and stubborn"). The first sets the ritual constraint; the second reaffirms it post-run. Both are speech acts that frame the system but neither creates a major turn—the braided run and the food distribution do that work. The declarations are thematically resonant but functionally ornamental; swapping "declare" for "announce" or "state" would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Midnight food runs" are signaled early (paragraph 14), detailed in the middle (pairs moving through alleyways, Noor and Farid delivering soup and rice), and referenced in the closing (paragraph 38: "Through midnight food runs we had learned each other"). The method shapes the dominant stake (survival under surveillance), creates the Noor/Farid learning arc, and constrains tactics (darkness, paired movement). Removing the food-run mechanics would collapse the story's action and closure. The method is integral and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is introduced in the opening line ("terra-cotta arbor on the ridge") as the gathering site and returns in the closing ("Under the arbor, the bell held only a smudge"). It anchors the ritual space and the final image. The arbor does not actively constrain choices during the food run (which moves away from it), but it functions as lyric framing: the community leaves and returns to it. The arbor's role is more symbolic than tactical; it is present in setup and payoff but does not pressure middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sanctions period is signaled early ("During a sanctions period, sound travels dangerously"), shapes the stakes (rationed shelves, watchers with cold eyes, hunger as obedience tool), and tightens the midnight-run tactics (silence, careful routes). It persists through the closure ("The sanctions stayed, but so did we"). The timeframe constrains the system and adds urgency without requiring a ticking clock. Removing it would weaken the stakes significantly. Minor deduction: the watchers vanish after being introduced, reducing the felt pressure of surveillance in the climactic run.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To build intergenerational support" is stated explicitly only in Mara's closing declaration (paragraph 35). The desire is dramatized earlier through the Noor/Farid conflict (youth versus elder tension) and resolved through their shared route (Noor learns the lullaby, Farid steadies the boy's hands). The motivation shapes the braided-run tactic and the closure reaffirmation. However, the label "intergenerational support" arrives late and reads as prompt echo; the motivation would be stronger if the elder/youth friction appeared earlier and more sharply.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is introduced early (paragraph 5: "Mara's tone was amplified quiet"), recurs during the food run (paragraph 27: "The city answered with amplified quiet"), and closes the story (paragraph 39: "our quiet amplified across the ridge"). The tone modulates with pressure: whisper-like ritual at the arbor, held-breath tension during the run, weather-like persistence at the end. It is voice-consistent, constrains behavior (no ringing the bell, silent clapping), and charges the final image. The phrase risks preciousness but remains coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
