<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("quietly rebellious even against grief"), with embodied emotion throughout. The drumming method evolves into a fully realized micro-choice system that channels grief and agency simultaneously. Internal contradictions appear ("I would accept the blur that spelled our names together" versus survival instinct), and the final renunciation—accepting outline blur for shared presence—carries visible cost. Minor slip: Jonah remains more echo than person; his characterization lives primarily in memory rather than present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density builds through sound-garden mechanics, drumming beats, and layered memory fragments until the final image crystallizes Charged Poise ("I left carrying auroral sorrow like a lantern, drumming tomorrow on ribs"). Closure lands on-page with felt cost—the narrator accepts permanent outline blur to sustain shared dream, foreclosing solo embodiment. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. One tightening choice at midpoint (consent to deeper coherence) narrows options and charges the ending. The experimental garden's rules remain consistent and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: drumming surfaces answer with frequencies, the lagoon's auric sheet becomes the tactile interface for memory entanglement, and the system's rail-pulsed warnings force consent decisions. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's synesthetic attention ("metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea"). The garden's acoustics charge the final image when the narrator promises to "be the beat that lets us return." Spatial choreography (walkway, railing, lagoon surface) remains coherent across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: revive Jonah through entangled memories. The midpoint consent ("tapping yes with two knuckles") is protagonist-driven and narrows options by accepting deeper coherence with visible risk ("we might wake neither in flesh"). The final choice—carrying auroral sorrow and promising return despite outline blur—forecloses solo survival with on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through drumming repetition and memory layering until the hour thins and the narrator must choose endurance over safety. The garden's systematic warnings frame agency throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the drumming habit borrowed and amplified becomes a promise encoded as rhythm, grief transforms into "auroral sorrow...beautiful and breaking," and the shared dream's oxygen matters more than fear. The final image—"drumming tomorrow on ribs"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether love survives institutional boundaries without stating a moral. "Quietly rebellious even against grief" integrates organically with the experimental premise. The auric lagoon returns with reweighted meaning (from clinical tool to cathedral of shared presence), charging closure without symbol-chasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt; the narrator's perceptual signature (synesthetic attention to sound, metallic taste, rhythm as language) remains consistent under pressure. Purposeful compression ("security drones drifted like drowsy moths," "the garden dimmed back to ordinary miracle") creates lyric density without obscuring causality. Diction stays within the narrator's poetic-technical register; metaphors remain coherent and voice-motivated. Minor friction: occasional elevated phrasing ("auroral sorrow," "cathedral patience built from singing molecules") edges toward ornament in peak beats, though it stops short of distancing the reader from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and propels forward; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Figurative language is largely coherent ("sound wave garden," "drumming on everything," "auric lagoon under starlight"). Deductions: mild overwriting in the middle third where metaphor density approaches saturation without pattern-teaching ("as if the plants remembered a lost song and were shy to sing" adds texture but slows momentum slightly). Two brief paraphrase loops appear ("I kept drumming...telling him" → "His pulse found the tempo" recycles the same content). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of clinical neurotech, sound-garden mechanics, and drumming-as-protocol is specific and non-obvious; the piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (outline blur, consent warnings, memory collision). Emotional truth anchors the speculative frame: grief as "quietly rebellious" choice, the borrowed habit returned amplified, the refusal of safety-hedging ("I would accept the blur"). The entangled-memory concept transforms familiar "revive the comatose lover" material through acoustics and rhythm rather than miracle science. Risk-taking (lyric compression, experimental setting) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limit: the sound-garden's mechanics lean slightly toward convenient magic when the auric sheet "touches" and enables instant shared memory navigation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "experimental treatment guinea pig" frames the narrator's choices throughout: signing despite risk, learning the abandoned drumming method, consenting to deeper coherence mid-garden, and accepting outline blur at closure. The role enables every beat and directly shapes the final renunciation. Early signal, causal pressure across multiple beats, and closure linkage all present. Felt cost: becoming a "chord the garden remembered" rather than returning to flesh.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "auric lagoon under starlight" appears in at least four beats: initial description, the narrator perching above it to drum, the midpoint consent when the gold sheet lifts toward ribs, and the final fade to "gentlest gold." It evolves from clinical pool to memory interface to charged closure image. Causal pressure: the lagoon's brightening signals Jonah's presence and the system's aurora provides the tactile moment of coherence. Removing it breaks the story's sensory and symbolic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" shapes stakes (braiding living storms with sleeping currents), drives the protocol's mechanics (overlapping minds, shared dream terrain), alters tactics (drumming to map what words cannot), and charges the climax ("Jonah's memory river met mine in bright collision"). The concept is dramatized through specific actions—tapping consent, walking the garden, shared kitchen scenes—rather than theme-only. Cost: the risk of waking as neither flesh nor individual. Appears early, constrains middle choices, and anchors closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is stated twice and demonstrated three times: signing for the protocol despite risk, continuing alone after the previous patient abandoned the method, and choosing to carry "heavy brightness" despite outline-blur cost. The trait enables the consent choice at midpoint and the final endurance. It constrains by rejecting institutional caution and fear-driven retreat. The final phrase "quietly rebellious even against grief" ties it directly to closure. Visible tradeoff: accepting experimental danger for love's oxygen.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Perch" appears in three functional beats: "perch on the walkway above the auric water and drum," "perched on the railing, toes curled," and the final perch after the hour thins. Each instance coincides with a decision point (initiating drumming, consenting to coherence, promising return). The physical position—elevated, vulnerable, poised—mirrors the narrator's stance between worlds. Removing "perch" for a generic sit/stand would lose the image of precarious commitment that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Drumming on everything" is signaled in paragraph nine, demonstrated across six beats (benches, railings, lagoon surface, stone, bridge planks, ribs), becomes the method the previous patient abandoned, transforms into borrowed habit from Jonah, and culminates in the promise "to be the beat that lets us return." Mechanics matter: rhythms map what words cannot, the garden answers with phrases, Jonah's countertempo rises, and the final "drumming tomorrow on ribs" encodes the closure choice. Indispensable—remove it and causality, closure, and the entire entanglement protocol collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is introduced in the opening line, structures every beat (hedges carry frequencies, pools are auric lagoons, air vibrates into petals), supplies the resources for memory overlap, pressures the consent choice via rail-pulsed warnings, and becomes the "cathedral patience built from singing molecules" at closure. Setting mechanics drive the protocol: sound blooms into terrain, surfaces answer drumming, and the garden remembers their shared dream. The narrator's tactics (where to perch, what to drum, how to respond to warnings) depend entirely on the garden's acoustic architecture. Story logic fails without it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"At the hush of the universe inhaling" frames the opening and returns at the midpoint consent ("At the hush...the sheet touched"). The phrase evokes a liminal temporal window—security drones drowsy, clinic lights dimmed—that enables unsupervised access. It subtly tightens the final choice: the hour thins, implying limited session time and forcing the decision to return tomorrow. The timeframe shapes mood and stakes more than it imposes a live clock; it trends high for lyric resonance and setup-to-closure reprise but lacks tick-by-tick pressure in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"To breathe life into a shared dream" is stated early as the protocol's goal, dramatized through on-page choices (signing, drumming, consenting to deeper coherence), conflicted with cost ("we might wake neither in flesh"), and charged at closure when the narrator accepts outline blur and promises to "carry the heavy brightness." Desire friction: wanting Jonah alive versus fear of dissolution. The motivation drives every beat and the final renunciation makes the tradeoff legible—shared dream's oxygen matters more than solo embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is seeded early ("auroral sorrow, beautiful and breaking"), modulates through the memory collision and glass-corridor accident walk, charges the consent moment ("I felt the ache of auroral sorrow"), and anchors the final image ("carrying auroral sorrow like a lantern"). Tone is coherent through turns: grief remains luminous and breaking rather than resolved. The oxymoron—beauty within sorrow—mirrors the story's central tension (love sustained through experimental risk) and elevates the ending by making emotional cost radiant rather than merely tragic. Indispensable to the closure's affective register.</comment>
