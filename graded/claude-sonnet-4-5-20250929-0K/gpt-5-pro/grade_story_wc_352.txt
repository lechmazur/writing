<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to recover forgotten combinations is clear and drives the journey, with embodied details like "pressed my boots to the ceiling" and "tucked the folio inside my jacket." However, interiority remains abstract—phrases like "prism-minded" and "latent blaze" function as labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to return is stated rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring images (grotto, tokens, doodle) and a density shift at the inverted chamber. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (who, mist-grotto, hour of inversion). Closure is Charged Poise—the protagonist exits with tokens and the promise to return, reweighting the dominant stake of recovery with the cost of incompleteness ("what remained nested in the upturned lake"). The cost is conceptual and felt but not dramatized in a decisive on-page action. One meaningful deepening (reaching the chamber, grasping tokens) is present, sufficient for this length, though the because/therefore linkage between beats is loose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail: "ferns pressed to the vault swam with spores," "grooves like the ribs of a sea creature turned to stone." Spatial choreography during the inverted walk is coherent. The grotto constrains choice—only accessible during gravity inversion, the protagonist must drum a cadence to open the panel—and the tokens' location in the upturned lake charges the final image. Minor gap: the folio's physical handling is mentioned but its constraint on action remains thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover forgotten combinations) is signaled early and drives the journey. The inverted hour provides urgency, and the panel-opening sequence tightens options briefly. However, escalation is mild—the protagonist encounters obstacles (mist, threshold, panel) but each yields without meaningful trade-off or failed attempt. The tokens are grasped without cost beyond the time limit, and the return is promised rather than tested. One tightening (reaching the chamber) is present, but the cost at closure is conceptual rather than a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance and recovery emerges through concrete images—margin doodle, spores, tokens—that recur with shifting weight. The "seeds of vigilance" motif structures the piece, moving from received wisdom to enacted practice. Subtext operates in the grotto's physical resistance and the protagonist's resolve to return. The ending offers a non-literal answer: cataloging tokens as "clandestinely luminous" entries embeds vigilance in the archive's structure. Minor slip: "so that nothing vital would ever drift beyond reach again" edges toward theme statement, though the prior image of "quiet bells" cushions it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV throughout with a distinct lyric register: "the hour the world would turn itself upside down," "borders between stone and sky rearrange the rules." Perceptual signature is consistent—archivist's attention to margins, grooves, tones. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("prism-minded," "threshold effects") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess. The piece teaches its compression pattern early (elliptical, image-dense) and sustains it, though some filter constructions ("I could only enter," "I would learn") dull immediacy in spots.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied, with strong imagery ("stalactites rose like candles," "lake of smoke"). However, synonym loops and paraphrase chains appear: "clandestinely luminous" recurs four times without causal escalation; "seeds of vigilance" appears three times in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence in the middle third: "I [verb], and [noun] [verb]" runs across multiple beats without taught pattern. Figurative density is high but occasionally muddles ("threshold effects" remains abstract; "prism-minded" is never concretized). These artifacts touch the mid-section but not the closure image, warranting deduction without disqualifying 9+ globally. Applying −0.8 for loop/cadence issues and −0.3 for figurative abstraction in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion mechanic and the archivist's quest combine familiar fantasy-archive and puzzle-dungeon tropes but execute them with lyric specificity: the "manuscript margin doodle" that brightens peripherally, tokens that "emit bell tones," the inverted lake. The synthesis feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. However, the emotional arc—determined archivist retrieves tokens, vows to return—follows a predictable shape. The piece takes mild risk with its elliptical, image-dense structure, which heightens atmosphere without obscuring the dominant stake. Transformation is present but modest; swapping the grotto for another hidden archive would leave the emotional logic intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prism-minded archivist is the POV and agent throughout, making the decision to enter (setup), navigate the grotto (middle), and grasp tokens before exiting (closure). However, "prism-minded" remains a label; the trait does not demonstrably alter a choice under pressure. The character's role as archivist is functional—cataloging, decoding—but the specificity of "prism-minded" does not constrain tactics or charge the ending beyond general attentiveness. Present in all three gates but swappable for "meticulous archivist" or similar with minor edits. Deducting −0.3 for label-only trait and −0.4 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The manuscript margin doodle appears in setup (paragraph 4: "cracked folio, its manuscript margin doodle"), middle (paragraph 12: "held the folio at my chest, and the manuscript margin doodle pulsed faintly"), and is referenced at closure (paragraph 19: "drummed the cadence the doodle suggested"). It guides navigation and informs the rhythm used to open the panel, a causal beat. However, its mechanics remain vague—what cadence? how does a doodle encode rhythm?—and it is not handled or reweighted at the ending. Present across all three gates with causal pressure in one beat, but specificity is thin and closure linkage is indirect. Applying +0.8 for setup, +0.4 for one causal beat, +0.3 for closure relevance, −0.5 for vague mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" appears three times: paragraph 6 (mentor's lesson), paragraph 15 (listening until numbers rustle), and paragraph 28 (planting in catalog). It frames the thematic arc but does not constrain a choice under pressure—no on-page moment where vigilance itself alters tactics or forecloses an option. The phrase recurs as a motif and shapes the ending's thematic claim, but the concept remains abstract rather than embodied in a trade-off or cost. Present in setup and closure but not middle development. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use, applying lyric allowance but capping at ~6.0 range; subtracting −0.5 for ornamental middle, −0.4 for swappability (any attention-based concept could substitute), −0.8 for summary-only closure work, −0.2 for label-only in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" appears four times: doodle (paragraph 5), spores (paragraph 13), catalog entries (paragraph 28), and dimming spores (paragraph 27). The trait enables navigation—spores reveal letters, doodle brightens peripherally—in at least two beats (paragraphs 5, 13). It charges the ending image (catalog "clandestinely luminous when a careless hand approached"), reweighting the recovery work. However, the attribute is ornamental in two mentions (paragraphs 27, 28 recap without new pressure). Setup, middle, and closure gates met. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.3 for two ornamental mentions, −0.2 for slight swappability (any covert-signal trait).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reenter" structures the piece: paragraph 3 promises entry, paragraph 10 dramatizes it, paragraph 23 commits to future reentry, and paragraph 32 reaffirms it. The action opens the grotto (middle), and the vow to reenter shapes the ending's Charged Poise. Two distinct beats (initial entry, commitment to return) and closure linkage are clear. The concept of return reweights the recovery as incomplete, a visible cost. However, the mechanics of "reenter" do not constrain—any repeat visit would function similarly. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.5 causal pressure (incompleteness as cost), −0.5 for moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through threshold effects" appears in paragraphs 8, 14, 20, 24, and 31. The method is named but mechanics remain abstract—what are threshold effects? The phrase signals transitions (entering, panel-opening, exiting, future return) but does not constrain tactics; the protagonist moves through thresholds without visible cost or adaptation. Present in setup, middle, and closure but functions as atmospheric label rather than a specific means that shapes attempts. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one functional beat (panel), +0.3 closure mention, −0.8 for swappability (any transition method), −0.5 for ornamental repetition, −0.3 for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto in mist is the sole setting, anchored early (paragraph 2) and present throughout. It constrains access (only during inversion), navigation (coiling drafts, thresholds), and chamber layout (upturned stalactites, floating tokens). The grotto's structure forces the panel-drumming beat (paragraph 19) and the inverted-lake encounter (paragraph 21), two distinct causal moments. The mist and coils shape the exit (paragraph 27) and charge the ending vow to return. The setting is indispensable—remove it and the plot collapses. Applying +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats (entry, panel, chamber), +1.2 closure pressure (return vow), +0.8 specificity (serpentine, inverted), +0.6 cost (incompleteness tied to grotto's scale).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inverted-gravity hour is signaled in paragraph 2, dramatized at entry (paragraph 9: "my weight fell upward"), tracked at mid-point (paragraph 23: "inverted hour hollowed itself toward its end"), and drives the exit (paragraph 26: "gravity fell back"). The timeframe tightens the decision to leave and seeds the return vow. However, the exact duration and countdown are not tracked beat-by-beat—no moment where the clock forces a hard choice mid-scene. Present in all three gates with one causal beat (exit urgency). Applying +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage (return vow), +0.5 causal pressure (exit urgency), −0.4 for vague tracking, −0.3 for moderate swappability (any time limit).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where forgotten combinations hide" is declared in paragraph 3, pursued through navigation and panel-opening (paragraphs 12–19), realized when tokens are grasped (paragraph 22), and extends into the return vow (paragraph 32). The desire drives two beats (panel, tokens) and informs closure. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no moment where the archivist weighs abandoning the quest, fearing the grotto, or sacrificing another value. Told rather than tested under pressure. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.6 for lack of on-page friction, −0.4 for summary-only at closure, −0.3 for swappability (any recovery goal).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears in paragraphs 7, 31, and thematically throughout as "smoldered," "heat," "warming the ache." The tone of restrained intensity is coherent and modulates with pressure: quiet watchfulness at setup, focused urgency in the grotto, rekindled resolve at closure. The blaze metaphor charges the ending ("licked higher with every recovered pattern"). However, the tone is consistent rather than dynamically shifting—no moment where the blaze flares or dims in response to a beat's reversal. Present in setup and closure with thematic layering but thin middle development. Applying +0.8 setup, +0.7 closure charge, +0.3 coherence, −0.4 for static middle, −0.4 for moderate swappability (any restrained-intensity tone), −0.4 for label-reliance without embodied action.</comment>
