<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mural artist's interiority is grounded in concrete observation—watching glass, arranging postcards, waiting for moonlight—but the choices remain largely observational rather than high-stakes decisions. The motivation ("understand why flowers bloom at night") is treated more as contemplative quest than urgent need, so agency reads as passive witnessing. The final walk to the pavilion and the decision to "paint without asking for permission" arrives as epiphany rather than a choice forged under contradictory pressures. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures (paint-stained fingers, holding the lantern low) but the protagonist's internal conflict never sharpens into simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric-essayistic pattern early (postcards as bridge, glass as guide, flowers as teachers) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the protagonist realizes "love…not a blaze but a tender shadow" and walks home "ready to paint without asking for permission"—a stance crystallization with felt cost (renouncing certainty). Orientation is clear by ~100 words (crypt walls, cathedral, cloister gardens, winter's end). The closure reconfigures the opening question through layered observation rather than causal reversal, which fits the inferred lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist recognizes "my question had been, which was not knowledge, but a way to speak without harm," tightening the stake from intellectual to ethical. Cost is legible: the protagonist leaves behind the postcards and the certainty of a map, accepting practice over mastery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and selective: etched glass with "scenes ghosting over scenes," cloister gardens, melting snow, amber pavilion among maples. The cathedral's materiality—stone, glass, lead, walls—constrains the artist's work and guides perception through refracted moonlight. The pavilion's "soft geometry of amber" charges the final image, and the recurring object (postcards on the sill) functions as micro-setting that anchors reflection. Sensory hierarchy reflects the artist's professional bias (light paths, color tones, graphite scratching). Minor slip: the river bend and pavilion appear late without prior spatial grounding, creating slight disorientation before the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand why flowers bloom at night"—is signaled early and sustained through observation, experiment, and realization. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each phase (postcards, glass, night blooms, pavilion) deepens the question from botanical curiosity to ethical stance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the question "was not knowledge, but a way to speak without harm," narrowing the goal to restraint and relational care. Agency is present but passive-adjacent: the protagonist arranges, watches, paints, walks—decisions that advance understanding but rarely foreclose competing paths with sharp cost. The final renunciation ("paint without asking for permission") carries felt cost (relinquishing maps and certainty) but arrives as contemplative acceptance rather than forced choice under external pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: flowers opening "not outward but inward," glass teaching restraint, love as "tender shadow" rather than blaze. The piece resists tidy moralizing; the artist's final stance ("ready to paint without asking for permission") is earned through layered observation of cathedral, glass, flowers, pavilion. The closing image—stars touching water, walking home—offers a resonant answer to the opening question without explicit thesis. One slip: "Meaning is what closes when you force it" edges toward direct statement, though the protagonist's uncertainty ("I had no certainty, only practice") tempers the didacticism. The night blooms and cathedral whisper function as recurring motifs that constrain the artist's approach and charge the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; distance and focalization remain controlled throughout. Voice is lyric and contemplative with a distinct perceptual signature: "winter's last snow thinned into lace," "umbral tenderness that gentled the stone," "moon lifted her shoulder." Diction elevates consistently without register clash; the narrator's lexicon fits an artist attuned to light and form. Psychic distance widens during reflection and tightens during observation, supporting the accumulative design. One minor slip: "I reckoned this was love" in the penultimate paragraph tilts toward authorial summary rather than dramatized realization. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not applicable. The prose rhythm matches emotional intensity: longer, layered sentences during contemplation; shorter beats at the pavilion and closing walk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; lyric cadence fits the reflective lens. Information density is high: most lines advance observation, setting, or thematic layering. Clarity is generally strong, though some figurative density approaches overwriting: "the whole place filled with an umbral tenderness that gentled the stone" stacks metaphor without muddle but nears saturation. Two minor loops: "opening" recurs across several beats (flowers opening, glass opening paths, petals opening inward) without always adding new pressure. No major scaffold or template cadence; no filter-verb stacks. Propulsion slows slightly in the middle third as the artist cycles through postcards and dawn/dusk observation without escalation, but the closure image recovers momentum. Proofreading is clean; no pronoun drift or tense errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks to understand nocturnal flowers via cathedral glass and old postcards—offers a fresh synthesis of art-making, botanical mystery, and architectural meditation. The execution avoids cliché through specific detail (graphite paths, etched layers, moon as teacher) and the ethical turn from knowledge-seeking to restraint. The final realization ("love…not a blaze but a tender shadow") feels earned in hindsight by the flowers' inward gesture and the glass's layered instruction. Minor genericness: the artist-as-seeker archetype and the cathedral-as-teacher motif are familiar; transformation comes through particulars (postcards, lead scratching, pavilion) rather than structural surprise. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric-essayistic mode and quiet closure elevate stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting within-band acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mural artist is present throughout and makes several on-page choices: setting the ladder, arranging postcards, holding the lantern low, painting with restraint, walking to the pavilion. Setup is early (first paragraph). Development: the artist uses the postcards to angle gaze and align vision (middle beats). Closure: the artist walks home "ready to paint without asking for permission," a stance shift tied to the character's evolving understanding. However, most choices are observational or preparatory rather than high-stakes decisions that narrow options under pressure. The character's occupation (mural artist) motivates the setting and method but does not create acute conflict. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle involvement is functional but passive. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, two beats +0.9. Frictions: observational rather than decisional agency −0.6, swappable with "artist" or "painter" −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.1 − 1.0 = 4.1; round to 4.1. However, the closure stance shift ("ready to paint without asking for permission") is causally earned by prior observation, lifting score to mid-5s. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The postcards are introduced early (first third: "collection of old postcards…edges curled like petals") and handled across multiple beats: the artist studies them, sets them "like a paper altar," aligns them to the window at dawn, uses the graphite path to angle gaze. Setup is early. Development: the postcards guide the artist's method and supply historical context (previous artists' notes about shadows, perfumes, mathematics). Closure participation: "the postcards ran out" marks a transition, and the artist's final walk beyond the town to the pavilion (featured on one postcard) reweights the object's role as map and permission. Three gates met. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (guides method and timing) +1.0, closure linkage (the pavilion postcard frames the final quest) +1.0. Frictions: the postcards' specific properties (curled edges, graphite scratching) matter less than their existence as a set; near-swappable with "sketches" or "notes" −0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.0 − 0.5 = 6.5; round to 6.5. The closure linkage to the pavilion and the "ran out" moment add weight, lifting to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept "dawning hush" appears explicitly ("the city held a dawning hush like a breath") and recurs thematically: the cathedral's quiet, the night blooms' silence, the protagonist's restraint. Setup is early (first page). Development: the hush shapes the artist's approach (painting with "tones that held back," guiding visitors' eyes without forcing). Closure: the artist recalls "the dawning hush that held its breath before revealing anything" and walks home in readiness, echoing the opening image. Three gates met. However, "dawning hush" operates more as tone and thematic echo than as a concrete stake or constraint that alters tactics. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.5, two beats (opening, closure reprise) +0.9, thematic coherence +0.4. Frictions: primarily atmospheric rather than causal −0.7, swappable with "quiet" or "stillness" −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.2 = 3.6; the closure reprise reweights the opening image, lifting to ~6.0. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed → final reprise with pressure), reaching 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The attribute "quietly driven" is signaled in the opening line ("quietly driven by a question that refused sleep") and reflected in the artist's patient, observational approach: waiting for moonlight, aligning postcards, painting with restraint. Setup is early. Development: the quiet drive shapes tactics (no forcing, listening to flowers, leaving spaces). Closure: the artist's final stance ("ready to paint without asking for permission") reflects a deepened quiet confidence. Two gates met (setup, closure). Positive adjustments: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, causal shaping of approach +0.6. Frictions: the trait is asserted more than dramatized with visible trade-off; no on-page moment where "quiet" drive costs the artist speed, recognition, or completion −0.8; label-only in opening −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.1 = 3.7; closure stance shift adds weight, lifting to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "reckon" appears throughout: "reckon from the refractions," "I began to reckon with what my question had been," "I reckoned this was love." Setup is early (first third: "reckon from the refractions"). Development: the artist uses reckoning to interpret the glass, flowers, and pavilion. Closure: "I reckoned this was love" crystallizes the thematic shift, and the final readiness to paint flows from that reckoning. Three gates met. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal linkage (reckoning produces the insight that changes the artist's stance) +1.0, closure linkage +0.9. Frictions: "reckon" is somewhat replaceable with "understand" or "realize" without structural loss −0.6; the action is cognitive rather than physical, reducing visceral stakes −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.8 − 1.0 = 5.8; the closure line ("I reckoned this was love") is pivotal, lifting to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method "through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window" is signaled early (first third: "the glass was etched in hidden layers…each panel retelling a story") and used across multiple beats: the artist climbs to the window, waits for moonlight, watches the glass catch and channel light, uses the graphite path to angle gaze. Setup is early. Development: the glass's layered mechanics guide the artist's understanding ("the etched glass caught it, turning drawings into channels where the light walked"). Closure participation: the artist guides visitors along "the moon paths fading into day" and later recalls the method when recognizing love as "tender shadow." Three gates met. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the method produces the key insight) +1.2, closure linkage (method is referenced and its lesson applied) +1.0, high specificity (etched layers, lead, refractions are unique to this method) +0.7. Frictions: none significant. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0; the method's mechanics matter and shape the ending, but the final image does not rest entirely on glass (pavilion and flowers also teach), capping at 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion appears late (final third: "an amber pavilion waited among maple leaves") but is seeded earlier via postcard mention. Setup is deferred; the postcard reference provides minimal early signal. Development: absent; the pavilion does not shape middle choices. Closure: the pavilion frames the final question ("whether I could offer my colors without telling them where to look") and the artist's stance shift. Two gates met (seed via postcard, closure). Positive adjustments: closure linkage +1.2, the pavilion's "soft geometry of amber" charges the final image +0.8. Frictions: late first appearance (final third) −0.8, no middle involvement −0.5, setting is postcard-descriptive rather than tactically constraining −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.9 = 3.1; the closure weight and the postcard seed (lyric-resonance allowance) lift to ~5.5. The pavilion's role in reframing the question adds another +0.4, reaching 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the melting of winter's last snow" is signaled early ("winter's last snow thinned into lace") and tracked through seasonal progression: winter → spring (postcards run out) → summer (visitors come) → autumn (pavilion visit). Setup is early. Development: the timeframe structures the artist's work phases and the flowers' bloom cycle. Closure: the autumn pavilion visit marks the final phase of the quest. Three gates met. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats (winter, spring/summer transition, autumn) +1.4, the passage of time creates the condition for insight (seasons as teacher) +0.8. Frictions: time is more atmospheric than tactically urgent; no live clock that forces a choice −0.7, the melting snow itself does not constrain decisions −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.8 − 1.1 = 4.7; the seasonal arc provides structure and thematic resonance (growth, opening, release), lifting to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why flowers bloom at night" is stated early ("I wanted to understand") and drives the protagonist's actions: hiring as mural artist (cover story), studying the glass, watching the flowers, visiting the pavilion. Setup is early. Development: the desire guides method and observation across multiple beats. Closure: the motivation is reframed ("my question had been, which was not knowledge, but a way to speak without harm") and resolved when the artist accepts "practice" over certainty. Three gates met. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the desire structures all choices) +1.0, closure reweighting (the question itself changes meaning) +1.0. Frictions: the motivation is primarily intellectual rather than urgent; no external antagonist or deadline creates friction −0.6, the protagonist's want and fear do not visibly conflict on the page −0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.1 − 1.1 = 6.0; the closure reweighting and the ethical turn add +0.6, reaching 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "umbral tenderness" is established early ("the whole place filled with an umbral tenderness that gentled the stone") and sustained through diction: "thin silver," "silvering the air," "tender shadow," "soft geometry." Setup is early. Development: the tone modulates with pressure—hushed observation, restrained painting, quiet realization—without flattening. Closure: "tender shadow" and "promise to be seen only when it was ready" crystallize the tone and charge the final image. Three gates met. Positive adjustments: early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, middle, closure) +1.4, tone charges the final image ("tender shadow" as love) +1.2, coherence through turns (tone deepens rather than breaks under reflection) +0.6. Frictions: "umbral tenderness" as phrase is somewhat decorative; the tone operates more through accumulation than tactical constraint −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.9 − 0.4 = 6.5; the closure crystallization of tone as thematic answer lifts to 7.1.</comment>
