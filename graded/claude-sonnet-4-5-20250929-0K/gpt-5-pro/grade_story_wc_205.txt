<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Neris exhibits consistent motivation rooted in past revolutionary ideals, with embodied reflection ("defunct heart considers revolt again") and micro-choices that reveal values (presenting the shard in a sling, matching breath to storm). Internal contradiction is present but understated—revolutionary identity versus custodial duty—and the final shift feels more thematic than earned by dramatized cost. The piece leans heavily on reflective interiority; while anchored to present stimuli (the shard, the tribunal), the ~40% reflection load flattens some urgency, though it does not obscure present options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (baroque asteroid, visible time, burnished sorrow) and the tribunal device, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the judge declares the city an open conservatory. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Neris, Lattice Vault Seven, tribunal context by ~10% mark). The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost—Vark bows "annoyed but alive to history," Neris drapes the last mirror, and the final lines reweigh prior material ("defunct heart considers revolt again"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard's second tableau mirrors the present tribunal, reframing the Ancients' choice as craft unfinished rather than decadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: "cherubs cut into ore," "gilt veins rise like liturgy," "walking seconds" trailing "comet hair." The shard is handled twice (cradled in wire sling, tilted to reveal tableaux), directly constraining the tribunal's judgment and charging the closure when Neris returns to drape mirrors. Sensory hierarchy reflects Neris's poetic lens—visual and auditory dominance (humming shards, banging window seconds)—and the environment subtly mirrors internal states (storms, burnished sorrow) without becoming overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining the Ancients' civilization versus reducing it to decadence—is signaled early and sustained through the tribunal. One meaningful tightening occurs when Neris tilts the shard a second time, revealing the Ancients' council mirroring the present dispute, which forces the judge's decision. The resolution is protagonist-driven (Neris's calibration and argument) and forecloses Vark's claim with visible cost (Vark leaves with "a thin smile that promises grudges"). Agency reads as attention and rhetorical strategy rather than decisive action, fitting the Accumulative lens, though the final personal cost ("touch its ache," "considers revolt again") lands more as thematic echo than tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—whether craft and attention constitute decadence or transcendence—emerges organically from the shard's tableaux and Neris's argument, avoiding explicit thesis statements until the closure, where the judge's declaration ("open conservatory, not a quarry") reframes prior material with conceptual cost. The motif of covering mirrors recurs purposefully, constraining action (dimming lamps mid-tribunal, draping the final mirror at home) and charging the ending image. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer: "burnished sorrow turning warm" synthesizes mourning and hope without moralizing, and "defunct heart considers revolt again" implies that stewardship itself is revolutionary practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistently poetic and architecturally dense, with a distinct perceptual signature: "time strings itself like harp wires," "visible seconds settle, like fish in a clear bowl." Diction remains within Neris's plausible lexicon—elevated, museum-custodian register—though the compression occasionally risks opacity ("folding it into patterns like brocade"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The rhythmic control under pressure is strong: the storm sequence accelerates syntax ("the storm strikes, making the window seconds bang like shutters"), then breathes into the resolution. Minor elision (the precise mechanics of the "calibration" Neris devises) is taught early via "a rhythm of breath matched to the storm" and paid off when the group dims lamps and covers mirrors, so no withholding penalty applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Density is high with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "defunct revolutionary" anchors both backstory and present stance). Sentence openings vary and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. However, the piece exhibits mild paraphrase loops: "poetically inclined" appears three times with near-identical framing, and "burnished sorrow" recurs four times without enough functional shift between uses. Template cadence is absent, but the figurative load is heavy in peak beats (the second shard tableau, the storm sequence) with stacked metaphors that occasionally blur clarity ("time strings itself," "seconds walk like tame animals," "histories bloom into luminous scripts" within ~8 lines). Apply −0.6 for loops and metaphor density in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The baroque-asteroid-as-museum premise is fresh, and the visible-time concept generates specific constraints (covering mirrors, watching seconds walk). The tribunal structure transforms a familiar "lost civilization" trope through Neris's lens—revolutionary turned custodian arguing for craft over decadence. The nested mirror (Ancients' council debating the same question) is an elegant, non-obvious turn earned by the shard's prior setup. Emotional specificity avoids templates: "defunct heart considers revolt again" feels particular to this voice. Minor friction: the "poetically inclined" label and the repeated "burnished sorrow" phrase risk stock phrasing, and the resolution leans slightly toward thematic wish-fulfillment (the sympathetic judge grants "time") without sharper tactical cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Neris ("defunct revolutionary") is present throughout and makes key choices: presenting the shard in a wire sling, devising the breath-calibration method, tilting the shard twice to reveal tableaux, and speaking plainly to the judge. These decisions alter tribunal tactics and drive the judge's ruling. The character's past as a revolutionary informs present rhetoric ("kneeling can be strategy"), and the final lines show a micro-turn ("defunct heart considers revolt again"). Setup early, development in middle beats, payoff at closure. Causal pressure moderate; the role could plausibly be filled by another custodian archetype with edits, but the "defunct revolutionary" framing charges Neris's argument with lived authority.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard is handled in two distinct beats: cradled in a wire sling to reveal the first tableau (Ancients arranging time into brocade), then tilted again to show the nested council. Both uses narrow the tribunal's options and drive the judge's decision. The shard's facets "veined with slow amber wind" and its hum during storms are specific properties that matter. It appears in closure participation (the judge grants "the shard to the children") with visible cost (denying Vark's traders). Early signal, strong beat involvement, decisive closure linkage. Minor swappability: another Ancients' artifact (a scroll, a lens) could serve similar narrative function with moderate edits, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute (House Vark's "decadence" versus the Cooperative's "transcendence") frames the entire story's stakes and drives on-page conflict. Neris's tribunal role, the shard presentation, the breath-calibration tactic, and the judge's ruling all hinge on adjudicating this dispute. The concept is signaled immediately ("my task is to arbitrate an archaeological dispute") and shapes every beat. The nested tableau—Ancients debating whether to bury or weave their works—directly mirrors and intensifies the present dispute, generating the conceptual repricing at closure. Essential across beats and ending; removing it collapses the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is mentioned three times and enables Neris's metaphorical argument ("choreography," "ethics of attention") and the breath-calibration method. The trait constrains rhetoric—Neris cannot argue in purely legal terms and must "speak plainly" under storm pressure. However, the label recurs without enough distinct functional cost across beats; it reads more as voice marker than tactical friction. Setup early, development in middle argument, mild payoff when the baroque prose style itself persuades. Functional but partly replaceable with "lyrical custodian" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Devise" appears twice: Neris devises "a calibration the old poets hinted at" (the breath-rhythm method that quiets the visible seconds), and in closure, "I write a few lines that devise a future." The first use enables the second shard tableau and shifts the tribunal's interpretive frame; the second reweights Neris's custodial role as generative rather than archival. Both beats matter, but the action itself is somewhat abstract—other verbs ("craft," "tune," "choreograph") could serve similar thematic work with moderate edits. Early signal, two beats, closure participation. Causal pressure moderate; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is introduced early as an "old method" to prevent memory multiplication, then enacted twice: mid-tribunal ("We dim the lamps, cover our mirrors with velvet") to quiet the chorus and allow the shard to sing, and at home in closure ("I return to my quarters and drape the last mirror"). The method shapes a key tactic (enabling the second tableau) and charges the final image ("to steward time is to touch its ache"). Setup, development, payoff all present. The mechanics matter—covering mirrors is the condition for the shard's revelation. Moderate irreplaceability: another ritual (dimming lights, chanting) could serve, but the mirror motif ties to memory and reflection, adding thematic specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly described ("cherubs cut into ore," "gilt veins rise like liturgy," "nickel cliffs") and provides the tribunal vault setting. It pressures choices indirectly—the "window seconds bang like shutters" during the storm, forcing the group to cover mirrors—and the setting's aesthetic (baroque excess) mirrors the dispute's stakes (decadence versus craft). The asteroid "listens when words are chosen with care" and "answers with faint harmonies" at closure, recharging prior material. Setup early, mild development (storm sequence), closure participation. Could be another ornate space-ruin with moderate edits, but the baroque-asteroid combination is specific enough to add tactical and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After time becomes visible" is the premise anchoring every beat: visible seconds "walk like tame animals," storms "comb through the galleries," and covering mirrors quiets "the chorus." The timeframe enables the shard's hum and tableaux, drives the tribunal's interpretive method (watching time settle "like fish in a clear bowl"), and charges the closure when Neris writes lines "to steward time." The concept shapes all tactics and the final image. Setup immediate, beats throughout, strong closure linkage. High irreplaceability: removing visible time collapses the story's central conceit and mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Neris's motivation—"to reimagine an entire civilization"—is dramatized through on-page choices: presenting the shard, arguing against Vark's "decadence" frame, devising the calibration, and speaking plainly to the judge ("I want liberty to reimagine…"). The desire conflicts with institutional constraints (salvage law, Vark's claim) and costs are visible (Vark's grudge, the personal ache of stewardship). The motivation drives every beat and is restated at closure with renunciation and acceptance ("to steward time is to touch its ache," "considers revolt again"). Setup early, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong. The final shift reweights reimagining as ongoing practice rather than tribunal victory, adding conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears four times and coheres through turns: it names the glow over ruins, ripples across faces during the second tableau, turns "warm" at closure. The tone modulates with pressure—elegiac in exposition, tense during the storm, resigned-then-hopeful at the end. The phrase charges the final image ("burnished sorrow turning warm") and supports the Accumulative lens by creating a cadence shift that reweights prior melancholy. Setup early, recurrence across beats, payoff at closure. Moderate deduction for near-repetition without enough functional shift in middle uses; the tone is coherent but slightly static until the final modulation.</comment>
