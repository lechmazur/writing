<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vendor protagonist demonstrates clear interiority through transactions with moonlight and measured absence, with micro-choices visible in the act of "quantifying absence" and trading silences. The first customer's page-scar and chapter-parole setup create embodied stakes, and the protagonist's final self-incision earns the closure moment. However, the attribute "mindfully scattered" remains label-only without constraining action, and the internal contradiction between vending and seeking origin never generates visible friction or costly mistakes on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (glass fruit, moonlight rivers, incised absences) and a cadence shift at the protagonist's self-incision that reweights the opening hunger. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist leans over the opened door, hears their own "glimmering parole," and the final image—"beginning again"—crystallizes the cost (his father's silence traded) with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors early (dawn, floating library, booth), and the two-customer structure (woman's transaction, then protagonist's parallel act) provides one meaningful deepening. Minor cost-legibility slip: the line "It sounded like..." offers metaphoric reprise but the immediate emotional or tactical consequence of the self-incision could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library, cloud sea, and moonlight jar anchor the setting vividly and early. The counter itself becomes micro-setting: moonlight pooling creates a "silver river" that the protagonist pours "into any gap," and later the incised line on the counter opens a door—both constrain and enable key choices. The booth's spatial choreography (customer rising from clouds, counter transactions, jar corking) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold grammar, frost seal, wet absence), filtered through the vendor's professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled in the opening third and drives both transactions. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist mirrors the customer's trade, incising his own absence (father's silence) and narrowing options by committing his saved blank. Agency is visible: the protagonist chooses to measure, incise, and trade, each act foreclosing retreat. The customer's arrival and request create external pressure, but the piece leans heavily on Accumulative design; the escalation reads more as deepening than as a causal reversal that raises immediate cost. The final trade's price (father's silence) is legible but arrives late without prior friction over that specific absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: clean slates purchased with honest absence, parole as both promise and breath, beginnings measured by what is subtracted. The moonlight jar, page-scar, and incised line recur with shifting weight, and the final image—"our small store breathed, beginning again"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the vendor's parallel hunger and the customer's chapter-shackle. Minor slip: "glimmering parole" is explained on the page ("Parole as in promise...") rather than fully trusting the reader to infer from context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("glass fruit heavy with unread sugar," "cold grammar"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the incision beats. However, purposeful compression and fragmentation ("I was mindfully scattered, inventorying the hush") occasionally slip into opacity—"mindfully scattered" reads as decorative rather than a perceptual signature that shapes what the vendor notices. The customer's dialogue ("she said she had been on parole") is clean and advances plot, but the narrator's explanatory asides ("Parole as in promise...") reduce subtext. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("silver bow, then right itself, like a reed after wind"), with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is solid; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "I wanted to find the place where stories begin" is restated as "What absence could I offer, to purchase my way into the place where stories begin?" without added pressure; "It sounded like..." is repeated across two adjacent lines with synonym variation but no causal advance. Template cadence appears in the stack of "Parole as in..." constructions mid-story. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third and touch near the closure zone ("It sounded like..."), triggering higher penalties per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of clean-slate vending, measured absence as currency, and a floating library is specific and non-obvious, with the core premise (quantifying absence to purchase beginnings) carried through in both transactions. The final self-incision feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the fragmented, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the story commits fully to its metaphysical commerce without retreat. Minor friction: the "glass orchard library" and "bottled moonlight" lean on fantasy-template aesthetics, and the emotional truth—trading named silences for voice—could be grounded in one more concrete, verifiable lived detail to elevate specificity further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The clean slate vendor is present throughout, makes key choices (measuring absence, incising the counter, trading his own silence), and drives both transactions. Setup by first paragraph, involved in the customer transaction and the protagonist's parallel trade (two beats), and shapes closure by opening the door to "glimmering parole." Causal pressure is moderate—choices narrow options but the cost arrives late without sustained friction. Closure linkage is strong; the protagonist's final action (incising, leaning over the door) is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in the opening inventory, is uncorked and poured to "clarify the gaps" in the customer's chapter-shackle (first transaction), and returns when the protagonist pours it into his palm and then into the counter incision to open the door (second transaction). Three distinct beats with evolving use, early signal, and closure participation. The jar's "tidal pulse" and the moonlight's behavior (bowing, righting, stopping at the door) create specificity and irreplaceability. Minor cap: the mechanics of how moonlight enables incision remain slightly abstract, reducing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Glimmering parole is named early, explained mid-story ("the moment a tale is released to speak"), and returns in the customer's facial transformation and the protagonist's final breath ("glimmering parole of first breath"). It shapes the thematic stakes—release from chapters, permission to speak—and the customer's page-scar dramatizes constraint. However, it operates more as theme and resonant image than as a mechanic that alters on-page tactics; the protagonist's choices (measuring, incising) would function under a different label. Lyric reprise with cost at closure earns mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Mindfully scattered appears once as a self-description ("I was mindfully scattered, inventorying the hush") in the opening third but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The vendor's behavior (measuring, incising, listening) does not dramatize scattered attention, and no tradeoff or mistake arises from this trait. Label-only mention without beat involvement or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Incise appears twice with distinct causal weight: the protagonist incises the customer's page-scar barnacles to "open their seams" (enabling her clean slate), then incises the counter to let moonlight run into the cut and open a door (protagonist's closure action). Both beats are indispensable—removing "incise" would require a different mechanic for opening and release. Early signal (customer transaction), middle development (protagonist's parallel preparation), and payoff (door opens). Specificity high; the act of cutting to open rather than erase drives the logic of "glimmering parole."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Quantifying absence is named early ("by quantifying absence, I said, because subtracting is the only tool gentle enough for roots"), demonstrated in the customer transaction (moonlight measures the weight of her unspoken name, "numbers surfaced... in wet absence"), and implied in the protagonist's final trade (measuring his father's silence). Setup, middle development, and closure linkage present. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how moonlight quantifies, what the numbers mean—reducing irreplaceability; a similar metaphor (weighing, counting) could function with minor edits. Two beats of involvement and thematic charge earn solid mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating upon clouds is established in the opening line, provides vivid atmosphere (glass fruit, humming aisles, listening clouds), and the cloud sea "leaned up like a listener" during the customer transaction. However, it does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics—the booth interior and counter become the active micro-setting. The library's float and the clouds' drift frame the story but remain largely postcard description. Early signal and one mild beat involvement (clouds listening) without closure constraint or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "lull on a store's very first opening day" is named in the opening and reprised at closure ("beginning again"), creating thematic resonance. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics—no live clock pressures the protagonist's choices, and the "lull" allows leisurely reflection and transaction. The first-day framing contextualizes the newness but remains atmospheric rather than a constraint that narrows options. Setup and lyric closure reprise present; missing middle development and tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to find the place where stories begin is stated in the opening third, dramatized when the protagonist questions "What absence could I offer, to purchase my way," and fulfilled in the closure action (incising the counter, leaning over the door, hearing first breath). The desire drives both the vending (observation of the customer's beginning) and the protagonist's parallel trade. Friction between the want and cost is visible—the protagonist must offer his father's silence, a "deferred" promise. Setup, middle questioning, and payoff present. Minor swappability: another metaphysical desire (finding origin, reclaiming voice) would function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Integrated fragmentation reads as purposeful: the prose layers images (glass, moonlight, absence, breath) without traditional causal connectives, teaches the pattern early ("mindfully scattered"), and modulates under pressure—sentences tighten and clarify at the incision beats ("I took a small knife and began to incise..."). The tone charges the final image ("the library floated, and our small store breathed, beginning again") by crystallizing the accumulation. Coherent through turns, no static flatness. Minor slip: mid-story explanatory asides ("Parole as in promise...") briefly flatten subtext, reducing tonal consistency.</comment>
