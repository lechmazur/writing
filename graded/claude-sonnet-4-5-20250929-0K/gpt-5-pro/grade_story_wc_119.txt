<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei shows clear interiority and purpose-driven choices (seeding fortunes, arranging the lighthouse gathering), but her inner contradictions remain underexplored. The secondary cast (ferryman, schoolteacher, constable) lacks individuated pressure; they arrive as summoned witnesses rather than sources of friction. The final tea-pouring lacks visible cost or a credible path foreclosed; Mei orchestrates without personal trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mei seeds fortunes → lighthouse gathering → dot-message reveal → shared exhale. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (lighthouse, island, after last orders). However, the closure lacks felt cost: the "open secrets" are affirmed without consequence, and no option is visibly foreclosed. The final image (folding the booklet, staying until the wick dies) reweights atmosphere but not stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse functions as both setting and lens: the Fresnel apparatus charges the dot-fortunes into legible messages, directly enabling the climax. Spatial choreography (basalt steps, catwalk windows, beam swing) remains coherent. Sensory detail is purposeful (oilskin smell, citrus memory, steam rising like staff lines) and filtered through Mei's perceptual bias. Minor: the island's "open secret" culture is asserted more than dramatized through environmental cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transposing the island's open secrets into acknowledged music—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative structure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dot-fortunes bloom into sentences, but the scene lacks a price: no character resists, no social friction materializes, and the constable's complicity is revealed without tension. The escalation reads as affirmation rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action: open secrets, lighthouse as amplifier, dots as patient orchestration. The "transpose life into a new key" motif threads through without sermonizing, and the final image (sea practicing the new melody on stones) reweights prior material with quiet resonance. The piece avoids stating its thesis directly and earns its conceptual close. Minor: the "open secrets thrived" assertion in the middle leans expository.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mei's perceptual signature (seeing flow, dots, orchestration) is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a lyric, oracular cadence that modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext ("Your light again" / "Mine too"). Distance control is clean; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage. The voice texture (staff lines, metronome, glass cathedral) sustains specificity and rhythm throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density (metronome beam, glass cathedral, staff lines of steam) enriches without obscuring. Several template stems recur ("They told how..."), and synonym churn appears in adjacent lines ("orchestrate arrival by directing flow" / "arrange the standing by directing flow"). Paraphrase loops in the middle third ("open secrets" rephrased across three paragraphs) trigger −0.4. No major opacity at closure, but tightening would lift momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of spycraft microdots + fortune cookies + lighthouse lens is specific and non-obvious, earning freshness. The "open secrets" frame transforms familiar refuge-narrative tropes through the dot-message mechanics. Risk: the lyric mode and patient accumulation fit the material. Minor: the island's complicity is asserted rather than tested; adding one skeptic or external threat would deepen the premise's stakes and make the final chord feel more earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mei drives setup (seeding fortunes), middle action (taping dot-fortunes, orchestrating arrivals), and closure presence (pouring tea, folding booklet). Her choices enable all three gates. However, her role at the ending is facilitative rather than decisively transformative; she arranges rather than confronts a cost. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure lift the score, but lack of personal trade-off caps high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The booklet appears early (diner pantry discovery), returns at the lighthouse (Mei taps it, references it), and is folded under the tea tin at closure. Its mechanics (microdot specs) directly enable the dot-fortune message, shaping the climax. Three distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Swappability friction applies (any technical manual could serve), preventing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Open secrets" shapes stakes (the island's complicity is known but unspoken), tactics (Mei uses dots to make secrets visible without accusation), and the climax (the room exhales as the lighthouse "makes it music"). The concept drives the ferryman, teacher, and constable's arrivals and the final reconfiguration. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Swappability is low; the logic depends on this exact duality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is seeded early (diner reputation, Mei's self-denial) and returns at closure ("accidentally prophetic because people already knew where to stand"). It frames Mei's method but does not constrain a visible choice or create on-page cost. The trait functions thematically rather than tactically. Two gates (setup, closure) with lyric reprise, but middle development and causal pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" appears early (Mei's intent to "orchestrate arrival"), drives middle beats (seeding fortunes, taping dot-messages, arranging the gathering), and is reprised at closure ("arrange the standing by directing flow"). The action shapes two key turns (fortune distribution → lighthouse gathering) and the ending's logic. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure. Minor swappability (could be "convene" or "summon") and lack of visible cost at closure prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Directing flow" is introduced via the booklet's teaching ("orchestrate attention by directing flow rather than force"), demonstrated through fortune-seeding and the tide-arranging-driftwood image, and reprised at closure ("directing flow rather than forcing steps"). The method shapes tactics (Mei chooses patient nudges over coercion) and the ending's conceptual frame. Three gates with thematic and tactical integration, but the mechanics remain abstract; no on-page choice where "flow" vs. "force" creates visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse appears in the opening line, provides the Fresnel lens mechanism that transforms dot-fortunes into messages (climax beat), and supplies the beam's final swing carrying the message outward (closure image). The rocky-island isolation enables the gathering without external interference. Three gates, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceable specificity (the lens optics are load-bearing). Cost connection is conceptual (the island "choosing its chorus") rather than felt, preventing top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After last orders" frames the opening and is reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("After last orders would come again tomorrow"). The timeframe signals when the island's actors are free to gather, but it does not tighten decisions or create time pressure on the page. Two gates (setup, closure lyric reprise) without middle constraint. The phrase functions as atmospheric marker rather than tactical element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transpose life into a new key" is introduced mid-story ("wanted to transpose life into a new key"), drives Mei's lighthouse plan, and is reprised at closure ("turning the island from a minor chord to a major"). The desire shapes the gathering's purpose and the final image. Two gates (middle, closure) with thematic weight. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost; Mei's want faces no friction on the page, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" is seeded early (Elias's voice "carried a familiar enigma, like a riddle told around the same hearth") and sustained through the lyric, oracular cadence and the island's open-secret culture. Tone modulates under pressure (the room exhales, the beam swings) and charges the final image (sea practicing the new melody). Coherent across beats and integrated into voice texture. Strong execution but conceptual rather than tactically load-bearing, preventing top-band entry.</comment>
