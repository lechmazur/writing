<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is consistent and embodied ("jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke"), with clear motivation through confessed past acts. However, the character remains somewhat abstract—the fire confession arrives late and the brother appears only in thought. Micro-choices (steering by the ball, pouring the vial) show agency, but the transformation from dirty past to empathy-seeker lacks intermediate friction on the page; the procedure erases memory yet conscience "stayed wired awake" without dramatizing that contradiction's cost in a choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (bioluminescent lake, baseball, newspaper-line navigation) and accumulates pressure through confessional exchange and vial-release. Closure arrives on-page when the protagonist pours the lake's glow into the fountain and "felt my ribs open a little and shut, a door practicing its hinges"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost: the protagonist is not absolved, only beginning repair. Orientation anchors (underground lake, post-procedure, boat journey) land clearly. The causal chain from confession to vial to fountain release is motivated under the lens, though the time-traveler's map mechanics remain somewhat opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered ("light algae and stone-bred patience," halos recalling fingerprints) and actively constrains choices: the sentinel demands confession as payment, the algae reply with a chorus, and the ball's seams match eddies to guide navigation. The market fountain at closure provides a concrete anchor for the vial's release. Spatial choreography (cracked boat, midlake dome, city shore) remains legible throughout. The lake's glowing water charges the final image when it sparks recognition in strangers, fulfilling the micro-setting test for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—kindle empathy where none remains—is signaled early and held. Pressure tightens at midlake when the sentinel demands confession "not polished, not forgiven, just true," forcing the protagonist to narrate the fire and who slept above the store; the water "bruised bright" in response, a visible cost. The vial-release at the fountain narrows options (no absolution, only repair) and the final image shows people "hands twitching toward strangers' coats," demonstrating the stake's partial fulfillment. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (confession → vial → release) suffices, though the brother's locked-door gaze and planted headline remain reflective rather than on-page confrontations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as repair, not erasure—emerges from the lake's mechanics (confession receipts, algae flourishing under pressure) and the protagonist's incomplete transformation. The final image of the child kicking water and drawing "another map, delicately robust, toward better choices" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the sentinel's line "you owe yourself something you cannot name yet" and the protagonist's ribs opening/shutting. The piece resists tidy absolution: "It was not absolution, only the start of a long repair." Minor slip: "delicately robust" recurs as both trait and theme label, bordering on echo rather than fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm." POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (confession beat, vial-pour). The sentinel's dialogue carries subtext ("He owes me a raincheck") and advances plot. Filter verbs appear occasionally ("I thought of my brother") but fit the reflective register. Minor pattern: several lines open with coordinate constructions ("So I took," "So I told") in the middle third, creating slight template cadence, though not enough to obscure clarity or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("stubborn constellations," "wire core," "hollow-eyed and steady, the lake's veteran, a sentinel of hush"), risking overwriting in a lyric mode. Most metaphors cohere, but "jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm" strains vehicle logic. Several adjacent lines paraphrase: "After the procedure" appears twice in opening paragraphs; "delicately robust" recurs four times. Read-aloud rhythm varies well, but the elevated register occasionally drifts from the protagonist's stated dirty past. Information density is generally strong (lines do multiple jobs), yet the abundance of figurative language in peak beats (confession, vial-release) approaches −0.5 overwriting threshold without crossing it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—underground empathy reservoir accessed by time-traveler's map and paid for with confession—is specific and non-obvious. The headline-negative-space navigation and baseball-as-compass offer fresh angles. Emotional specificity (ribs opening/shutting, door practicing hinges) avoids generic templates. However, the "clean slate seeker" frame and empathy-quest premise trend toward familiar redemption arcs; transformation is partial (the lake, sentinel, and confession mechanics are original; the protagonist's arc of seeking forgiveness through magical means is less so). Risk-taking in lyric structure and figurative density is high, though not all metaphors land cleanly. No close echoes of famous works detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is present throughout and motivates the journey. Early signal: "clean slate seeker with a dirty past" in paragraph two. Development: confession choice at midlake alters tactics (earns the vial). Closure: protagonist pours vial and feels ribs open/shut, demonstrating partial repair. The fire confession provides specificity, though it arrives late (past midpoint). Cost is visible (no absolution, only "start of a long repair"). Swappability: any guilt-driven seeker could replace this exact formulation with minor edits, capping upper range. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Object appears in five distinct beats: carried early, held up to sentinel, used to find exits via seams/eddies, held "like a reliquary" at fountain, and the final child's map-ripple echoes it. Early signal (paragraph four). Development: its spin "settled toward passages of less regret," guiding navigation. Closure: held during vial-pour, contributing to the ritual frame. However, its specific time-traveler signature and map mechanics remain abstract; the ball's unique properties (signature loops as map, spin/lie connection) are told rather than dramatized in a choice. Cost connection weak. Causal pressure present but moderate; irreplaceability moderate (any magical compass could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Concept is named early ("labyrinth of choices, each tunnel promising salvation and repeating my worst mistakes") and shapes the journey: multiple tunnels test the protagonist, passages narrow by the ball's guidance, and the sentinel notes the time-traveler "found the end of his labyrinth of choices, which was only the beginning of ours." Closure: the child's ripples "drew another map...toward better choices," reprising the concept. However, the labyrinth functions more as metaphor than on-page constraint—we see one tunnel with a brother-thought, but no dramatized fork that forces a trade-off. Development beat weak; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong via reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute first appears describing the water (paragraph eight: "delicately robust, a humming matrix"), then the sentinel explains algae "flourish under pressure...balanced on turbulence, like feelings outliving facts," and the final child-ripple map is "delicately robust, toward better choices." Early signal present. Development: the trait characterizes the algae's empathy-source, but does not constrain a choice. Closure: the phrase reprises, reweighting the stake thematically. However, it remains label-only—no on-page action hinges on being both delicate and robust simultaneously. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-band; lack of causal pressure or dramatized trade-off caps upper range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Journey is the story's spine: boat across the lake, confession at midlake, navigation by ball, arrival at city shore, walk to fountain. Early signal (paragraph sixteen: "began the journey across the glassy black"). Development: each leg introduces pressure (oars drawing light-sentences, currents testing, tunnel thoughts). Closure: journey's end enables vial-release and people's recognition. All three gates met. Causal pressure strong (without journey, no access to city or closure). Irreplaceability moderate (a pilgrimage or descent could substitute, but this exact lake-crossing to city fits tightly). Cost visible (protagonist arrives changed but not absolved). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage push toward upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Method appears in paragraph five ("found this place by reading between newspaper lines...forecasts inverted into coordinates") and recurs late (paragraph thirty-two: "kept steering by reading between newspaper lines formed by ripples"). Early signal present. Development beat weak: the method is told as backstory and the ripples-as-headlines moment is metaphorical rather than a navigation choice. Closure: absent from vial-pour or fountain scene. Two touches, but ornamental—the protagonist uses the ball's spin, not newspaper decoding, to navigate on-page. Swappability high (any cryptic instruction could replace it). Cap at 4.8 for missing causal middle and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is introduced in the opening line and constrains every choice: the lake's bioluminescence replies to touch, the algae chorus heats ribs, confession is required for payment, the vial holds lake-glow that later sparks empathy in fountain-goers. Early signal strong. Development: water tests protagonist in narrow throats, whispers headlines, and the sentinel's skiff anchors the exchange. Closure: vial from lake charges the fountain and strangers' recognition, making the setting indispensable to the final image. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability high (no other setting offers empathy-charged water harvested by confession). All three gates met with strong specificity and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timeframe is named in the opening line ("After the procedure") and recurs in paragraph twelve. Early signal present. The procedure creates the premise (memory erased, conscience awake), but the "after" does not tighten decisions—no ticking clock or deadline pressures choices. Development and closure: time remains vague (journey duration unspecified, no urgency). The procedure's effects (memory/conscience split) matter thematically but do not constrain tactics on the page. One causal link (procedure → seeking empathy) justifies mid-4s; lack of active time pressure or deadline caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early (paragraph three: "kindle empathy where none remains") and reprised at midlake ("I had come to kindle empathy...starting with the spark in me"). Development: confession and vial-harvest serve this goal. Closure: vial-release into fountain demonstrates partial success ("people blinked, hands twitching toward strangers' coats"). All three gates met. Causal pressure moderate (goal drives choices but no on-page friction between empathy and another want tests it). Cost visible (repair without absolution). Swappability moderate (redemption or atonement could substitute). Solid integration across beats with closure payoff, but lacks internal conflict that would push into 7.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("jaded wonder climbing my throat") and modulates: weary cynicism ("do not trust headlines...but the gaps"), confession's bruised brightness, and the final "jaded wonder" reprise that "forgot whether to warn or warm." Coherent through turns. Closure: tone charges the image when the protagonist's ribs open/shut and the child's laughter draws a new map—wonder tinged with jadedness persists. However, the tone is more asserted through phrase than enacted through syntax or rhythm shift under pressure. Strong setup and closure reprise with thematic reweighting qualify for mid-6s; lack of syntactic embodiment or cadence modulation caps upper range.</comment>
