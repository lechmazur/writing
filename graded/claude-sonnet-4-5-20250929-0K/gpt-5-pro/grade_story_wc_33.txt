<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mailman's interiority is concrete and embodied through selective perception filtered by occupation and family history ("my mother, who listened to weather"). Motivation intensifies across the arc, from routine delivery through measured escalation to the charged final gathering. The micro-choices under pressure—unsealing the storm, trading lists with the guide, maintaining courteous defiance—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Minor slip: the boy's quiet dignity and the woman's blue ledger lean slightly toward symbolic type rather than idiosyncratic behavior, but the narrator's texture remains consistent and the closure choice is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph ("disputed territory mailman," "cobalt arcade at twilight," "day's lone mail drop"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated motifs (absences, the storm bottle, the arcade) that tighten into the seventh-night gathering where "the border hums a smaller song." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crowd is "large enough to scare the border, small enough to pass for a vigil," crystallizing sustained pressure with visible conceptual cost (the commander's threat met with "receipts, signatures, and a politely amplified silence"). The inferred lens holds; cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it is the agreed meeting point, the visible border space, the site where rain and crowd pressure converge. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: "bricks sweat with salt from the long-evaporated sea," "drones beaded by a sudden, polite rain." Spatial choreography is coherent across the mailman's routes, the bridge crossing, and the gathering. The arcade's recurring presence charges the final image where the storm rises "on its own" and fills the space with "rain and laughter and careful tears."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: repair broken connections across a militarized boundary. Escalation accumulates through meaningful deepening: the boy's missing letter, the crossing negotiated with the guide, the crowd growing over seven nights, the commander's threat. Agency is clear—the mailman's decision to release the storm, to trade lists, to persist despite loudspeaker warnings—and each choice forecloses safer paths with visible cost. The final night's "storm rises on its own" delivers a charged poise where pressure crystallizes without resolution, fitting the Accumulative lens. One tightening intensification is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: repair versus prohibition, patience as resistance, absences sketching truer maps than borders. The thunderstorm bottle functions as a non-literal object that reweights across the arc—sealed constraint, tactical tool, finally unnecessary as "a storm rises on its own." The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration without a stated moral: the hush holds, the border hums smaller, and the gathering persists as "half law and half pledge." Subtext operates cleanly in gesture and implication ("courteous dodge," "politely amplified silence"). The piece invites reflection through earned ambiguity—repair is underway but incomplete, the cost ongoing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: the mailman notices through occupation ("sort the letters by linking absences"), through family inheritance ("my mother, who listened to weather"), and through tactical necessity. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated: "respectfully rebellious," "promises heal," "a thunderstorm in a bottle sealed with wax." Psychic distance modulates with purpose—close during storm release, wider during summary transitions. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. The prose carries a consistent texture in syntax and rhythm: compressed, lyric, specific. Register fits the focalizer's idiom without drift into corporate or academic phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs (character, world, pressure). Rhythm varies naturally with sentence length and syntactic structure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor pattern artifact: "I do not open it without need" followed by "She taught me to foster patience" leans slightly toward scaffold phrasing, but the effect is marginal and does not touch closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs ("the border hums a smaller song"). Clarity and momentum are sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Core synthesis—mail delivery as resistance choreography across a militarized border—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation is grounded in concrete detail: the bottle's tactical use, the traded lists, the crowd calibrated to pass for vigil. Tropes (borderland, contraband, weather magic) are reconfigured through lived particulars and moral calculus (courteous defiance, repair without smuggling claim). Risk-taking in structure (mosaic accumulation, lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Within-band adjustment: +0.3 for bold structural choices that support closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present by paragraph two, drives multiple beats (the missing letter prompts the token, unsealing the storm enables crossing, negotiating the gathering with the guide, persisting through seven nights). Decisions alter tactics and narrow options with visible cost. The mailman's agency is the spine of escalation and closure participation is direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("a thunderstorm in a bottle sealed with wax"), handled in at least three beats (carried in the bag, unsealed at the bridge to bewilder drones, recorked with a promise, rendered unnecessary when "a storm rises on its own" at closure). Meaning reweights across the arc from sealed constraint to tactical tool to symbol of repair's momentum. Irreplaceable; the storm's properties matter causally and thematically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled in the title and paragraph five, the drone lattice shapes stakes and tactics on every page: it forces the side path, the narrow bridge, the need for the storm's interference, and the commander's threat. The border is the antagonist pressure and its "smaller song" at closure measures the story's gain. Causal role spans the arc; closure hinges on its reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The trait "respectfully rebellious" is dramatized in multiple beats: saluting loudspeakers while walking forbidden paths, bowing to the drone lens then stepping aside, answering the commander's threat with receipts and "politely amplified silence." Visible tradeoffs: courtesy enables passage but limits speed; rebellion invites reprisal. The trait enables key turns and charges the final stance. Present throughout with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action "foster" is named explicitly ("She taught me to foster patience," "foster a crossing that is not one body, but an agreement") and drives the plot: the mailman fosters patience in waiting, fosters the crossing by trading lists and choosing the arcade, fosters the gathering that grows over seven nights. The method is irreplaceable—repairing rather than smuggling depends on this verb's connotation of gradual nurture. Major turns trace to this action; it redefines the stakes from delivery to repair.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The method "by linking absences" is signaled early ("I sort the letters by linking absences, tracing who did not write") and its mechanics shape the middle beat where the mailman and guide "trade our lists and begin to foster a crossing...by linking absences, matching the households that never receive with the couriers who never return." The method is specific, irreplaceable, and drives the discovery of the arcade solution. It constrains tactics (no direct address possible, must infer location from gaps) and charges the thematic claim that absences map better than borders.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Introduced by paragraph three, the arcade is the story's spatial anchor and closure site. It pressures choices: the mailman stands there daily, the guide and he choose it as the meeting point, the crowd gathers there over seven nights, and the commander's threat targets it. The setting's properties matter: "halfway between checkpoints," visible, public enough to pass for vigil. The final image fills the arcade with "rain and laughter and careful tears," charging it with undeniable emotional and conceptual weight. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the day's lone mail drop" anchors the opening and recurs as the chosen gathering time. It tightens decisions: the mailman must be there daily, the crowd assembles at twilight (transitional hour that escapes full surveillance), and the repetition over "the first evening...the third evening...the seventh night" tracks escalation. Time is not a live countdown clock but functions as ritual cadence that shapes tactics and makes the gathering's persistence legible. Solid integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where broken promises heal" is named mid-text ("What keeps me walking is simple and dangerous, the need to find where broken promises heal") and dramatized throughout: the boy waiting for his father's letter, the mailman searching the night for shifted addresses, the traded lists that locate the courtyard "where both sides can hold open pockets for words," the reunions and apologies at the gathering. Desire is conflicted with cost (patience hurts, the storm is dangerous, the commander threatens). The final image delivers partial healing—the border hums smaller—without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tone "brittle hush" is established in paragraph three ("the city holds a brittle hush") and sustained through diction and rhythm: "quiet dignity," "hesitant faces," "polite rain," "a smaller song." Tone modulates under pressure (the loudspeaker threat, the crowd's growth) without breaking into noise; the climactic night holds "rain and laughter and careful tears" within the hush. The tone charges the final image where "the hush holds" even as repair begins. Coherent across turns and integral to the ending's effect.</comment>
