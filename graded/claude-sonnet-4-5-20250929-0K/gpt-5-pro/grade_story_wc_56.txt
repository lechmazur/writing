<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"train your darkness to measure light" shapes perception, and micro-choices like leaving the sundial visible and winding the siren reveal hierarchy under pressure. Embodied emotion surfaces in "I felt older than the river and exactly its age," a paradox that avoids diagnostic labels. The watchman's morphine dependency and the foreman's final deflation add secondary pressure. However, the protagonist's competence rarely stumbles; a moment of genuine miscalculation or hesitation would sharpen the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational overlay. Orientation anchors (narrator, skiff, canal, dawn) land within 120 words. The piece accumulates evidence—scratches match ledger initials, crates confirm fraud—and the closure crystallizes in "We poled away while paperwork crossed town like a weather front," a Charged Poise where the cost (exposure, retribution risk) is felt and options reconfigure. One meaningful deepening: the sundial's scratches reveal deliberate timing of the flood. Cost is visible in the watchman's morphine-pawned badge and the narrator's choice to leave evidence in plain sight, inviting pursuit. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canal constrains choice: the sluice gates hide fraud, the skiff limits cargo ("all we could salvage"), and the viaduct's sightline forces the tactical rearrangement. The sundial's shadow "cut a thin black verdict across the corporate logo"—a micro-setting detail that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is sharp: "loaf wrapper clung to a piling, a calendar of hunger fluttering," filtered through the narrator's errand-legend idiom. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff to hatch to rail. The canal breathes like a character, yet the physical mechanics of poling a laden skiff under duress are gestured at, not tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: expose the flood's architecture and secure proof. One meaningful tightening: photographing evidence and leaving the sundial visible narrows options—escape becomes impossible once the foreman arrives. Agency is decision and staged provocation: "I rearranged the scene to speak." The watchman's siren blast forces public witness, escalating from stealth to open accusation. Cost is legible: the narrator trades safety for accountability, and "steady and inescapable" paperwork implies institutional pursuit. The foreman's deflation—"like a man placing a heavy bucket down"—registers defeat without requiring explicit consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "architecture of lies" is not declared but shown through stacked sandbags, erased ledgers, silenced sirens. The sundial recurs with shifted meaning—first a compass, then a seal/verdict on fraud. The final image, "paperwork crossed town like a weather front," offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth moves with the canal's own slow force. No moralizing. The mentor's instruction, "train your darkness to measure light," primes the narrator's method and is paid off when shadow cuts the logo. Subtext operates in the watchman's question, "you still reading the sun underground?"—doubt and hope layered without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval," "the sun writes marginalia"—the narrator filters crisis through a reflective, slightly archaic idiom. POV is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext: "the sun was open" counters the foreman's authority with poetic defiance. Compression is purposeful and taught early: "fate does not stack sandbags only on one side." However, diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure—"jealous archivist," "verdicts"—in ways that feel more authorial than character-urgent. The watchman's voice ("laughed like rope sliding over wood") is texturally distinct but brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance image and stake. Rhythm modulates from opening hush to the siren's "blast cut the day clean." No paraphrase loops. However, some figurative language stacks without clear payoff: "witnesses exhaled from every plank and rivet" and "listening threaded by balconies" blur slightly under their own ornamentation. Template stems appear: "By the silence" opens twice, "I said/He said" punctuate dialogue without variation. The final line's "weather front, steady and inescapable" delivers propulsion, but three mid-story beats could trim one modifier each for tighter momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sundial used as forensic tool and moral seal transforms a familiar trope (whistleblower investigation) through concrete specificity—scratches align with conduit angles. The mentor's aphorism, "train your darkness to measure light," could verge on fortune-cookie wisdom, but earns its keep by governing the narrator's method on the page. Emotional calculus—rage versus "colder patience"—avoids the safety middle. The closure resists tidy resolution: paperwork moves, consequences hover. Risk: leaving evidence visible invites danger without guaranteeing victory. One note: the "architecture of lies" frame and flood-as-erasure premise echo investigative-fiction templates; the sundial's repurposing and the tonal restraint lift it above the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The errant legend seeker frames the narrator's goal and method from the opening. Choices create turns: photographing evidence, leaving the sundial as seal, rearranging the scene to speak, and winding the siren all trace to this role. The character's stance—reflective yet decisive—shapes every beat and the closure hinges on salvaging "the truest stories" with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial appears in at least four distinct beats: against chest as compass, scratches align with conduit angles, placed on crates as seal/verdict, raised as proof alongside the key. Its physical properties (scratches, noon line, shadow) enable the investigation's key turn—revealing deliberate flood timing. The final image ("I raised the sundial") charges the closure with moral and tactical weight. Removing it breaks the investigative logic and symbolic closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is signaled early ("I had come to understand"), dramatized at the midpoint ("Hindsight clarity arrived like a heron landing"), and operationalized when the sundial's scratches reveal the flood's timing. It shapes tactics: the narrator methodically accumulates proof rather than confronting blindly. The closure relies on assembled evidence making the crime legible. However, the concept is also invoked as theme label in one line, diluting its causal purity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" is signaled twice: "My thinking had to be thoughtfully clear, or else the water would rewrite me" and the narrator speaks "not loud, but thoughtfully clear" at the climax. The trait enables the methodical proof-gathering and the calm, public accusation under pressure. Cost: clarity requires patience over rage. However, the trait is more label than constraint—there is no moment where lack of clarity tempts a mistake or where excess clarity forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Salvage governs the entire arc: "I came to salvage the truest ones," the narrator photographs and hauls crates, and leaves the sundial as a salvaged-truth seal. The action drives at least three beats (skiff approach, hatch discovery, crate extraction) and the closure—"We poled away while paperwork crossed town"—depends on salvaged evidence triggering institutional response. Removing this action collapses the plot. The concept is integral, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is seeded in the mentor's note ("train your darkness"), explicitly named ("I took that as instruction by training instincts"), and demonstrated when the narrator rearranges the scene instead of fleeing ("By training instincts, I did not run fast"). The method shapes two key choices: using the sundial to decode scratches and staging evidence for maximum witness. However, its mechanics are slightly abstract—instinct blurs with deliberation—so the constraint feels softer than a tool or rule would.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal pressures every choice: it hoards stories, limits cargo ("all we could salvage"), exposes the skiff when the foreman car appears, and its acoustic properties ("echoes traded names") enable the siren blast to summon witnesses. The sluice gates hide the fraud; the viaduct sightline forces tactical visibility. The canal breathes, narrows, and listens—setting as active constraint and thematic anchor. Removing this exact setting disintegrates spatial logic and symbolic closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"By the silence of morning radio" opens and recurs once midway, framing the timeframe as a charged hush before the day wakes. The dawn window creates urgency—limited stealth time before the foreman arrives—and the siren blast breaks the temporal silence, summoning public witness. However, elapsed clock pressure is not sharply tracked; we do not feel minutes ticking. The timeframe shapes tone more than tactics, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to understand the architecture of lies is signaled early ("I had come to understand"), tested in the choice to gather proof methodically, and dramatized when the narrator names "dates, parts, and routes" publicly. Friction surfaces in "a tug between rage and a colder patience"—the cost of understanding is restraint. The closure depends on exposing the lie's structure with evidence. The desire governs every beat and forecloses impulsive confrontation, demonstrating visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Serene upheaval is introduced in the opening ("Serene upheaval fluttered through the reeds") and recurs as the narrator's self-instruction ("serene upheaval will move more water than any one shout"). The tone coheres through the piece: reflective lyricism under rising pressure, calm accusation despite threat. The final image—"paperwork crossed town like a weather front, steady and inescapable"—charges the closure with that paradox. The tone is purpose-driven, not ornamental, and modulates without breaking.</comment>
