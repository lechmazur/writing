<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lys's motivation to unmask the pretender is declared but her interior life remains thin; we get no embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure—she simply executes her plan. The pretender's final resignation ("I suppose you will keep the dust") feels unmotivated by prior interiority; he steps from shadow fully formed without prior character work. The gardener is label-only ("regally unpretentious") without choices that test the trait. Lys's agency is real but her emotional stakes never conflict with her tactics, flattening what should be a fraught unmasking into a procedural exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens; closure arrives when Lys draws a line through the pretender's title and "books breathed open, coughing up alternate margins." That image reweights prior material with conceptual cost (the pretender's lacquered history shatters), satisfying Conceptual Repricing. However, orientation remains hazy past 120 words: who Lys is, her physical presence, and the library's concrete geography drift in metaphor without spatial anchors. The middle accumulates texture (iron gall, cryptic messages, constellation pauses) but causality is loose—readers arrive, the ledger appears, the pretender steps out—without clear because/therefore links. Cost is legible in the final image (the pretender's smile falls, his signet flakes) but the path there feels more summarized than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The library as setting supplies atmospheric texture (dust as "thoughtful constellations," shelves in "graceful collapse"), and the rune of drift functionally shifts corridors, gating access to the sealed ledger. The iron gall ink and bowls of starlight constrain Lys's method (forgery ink "sulks purple" under starlight, revealing truth). However, spatial choreography is vague—where Lys stands, how readers navigate the mosaic, and the ledger's physical location remain abstract. The setting pressures choices at closure (the rune hums, the corridor opens) but earlier beats treat it more as mood than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation is textural rather than causal: Lys leaves cryptic messages, gathers the faithful, and finally confronts the pretender when the pause settles. The ledger's appearance and the pretender stepping from shadow feel coincidental rather than earned by Lys's prior moves. The gardener's naming of the river-name is the first reversal with cost (the ledger stiffens, minnows snap to bones), but it arrives late and depends on off-page preparation. One meaningful tightening is present, but agency is diffuse and the cost (the pretender's title crossed out, his signet flaking) reads more as symbolic than a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between lacquered forgery and iron-gall truth; the final image of the signet flaking "like pantry salt under the first honest rain" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (the pretender's linen smile, the gardener's threadbare coat) and the iron gall ink functions thematically as bitterness the paper craves. However, the piece leans toward overt symbolism: dust knows "true names," letters hover "like moths," and Lys's cryptic marginalia whisper when lanterns dim. The gardener's bow "without ceremony, regally unpretentious" in the final beat risks thematic echo, though it stops short of thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narration holds a lyric, elevated register throughout ("a diminutive titan, regally unpretentious," "corridors slid to new alignments nobody but Lys could map"). POV remains stable in third-limited on Lys, and the diction—archaic, dense, metaphor-heavy—suits the timeless library. However, under peak pressure (the confrontation with the pretender) the prose does not modulate; it sustains the same ornate texture when urgency might compress. The pretender's dialogue ("I have improved our story, sanded it smooth") and Lys's silence create contrast, but other characters (historian, gardener) speak in narration's voice rather than distinct idiom. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the issue is tonal uniformity that flattens beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often mixed: "dust moved like thoughtful constellations testing their own patience" pairs abstraction ("thoughtful") with concreteness awkwardly; "letters in the margins unstuck from paper and hovered like moths waiting for wrists to open" stacks vehicles without clear tenor. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "She wrote…Each pellet…Lys seasoned…" runs parallel stems across contiguous paragraphs. Paraphrase loops surface ("He had been revising blood with footnotes, smoothing centuries into obedient paragraphs" / "He had a smile like linen, well laundered, promising a reign without wrinkles") where adjacent lines restate control imagery. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third. Clarity is mostly intact, but overwriting slows propulsion and some metaphors ("letters…waiting for wrists to open") obscure rather than sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of manuscript forensics (iron gall ink, marginalia) with celestial drift and genealogical forgery is specific and non-obvious. The "rune of drift" and "pause of shifting constellations" as a temporal device is fresh, and the ledger whose entries "moved like minnows when readers hesitated" offers memorable texture. However, the emotional arc—librarian unmasking usurper—follows a familiar template, and the confrontation resolves without significant friction: the pretender steps forward, is named, and capitulates gracefully. The pretender's lack of resistance and the gardener's off-page preparation reduce the sense of earned ingenuity. Risk-taking in prose style (lyric compression, archaic diction) elevates the piece but does not fully compensate for predictable plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lys ("diminutive titan") is present throughout, signals the plan early, guides readers, and performs the decisive act (drawing a line through the pretender's title). However, her choices are procedural rather than conflicted; she executes without visible cost or tactical alteration. Two beats (writing messages, guiding readers to the mosaic) plus closure involvement satisfy basic integration, but removing "diminutive titan" and leaving "librarian" would not fundamentally break the story's logic. Swappability and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in three beats: brewing and writing with it mid-story, revealing forgery via starlight bowls, and dipping it in starlight to draw the final line. Its chemical property (tannins vs. counterfeit herbals) matters on the page and enables the unmasking. Setup is clear, middle use is functional, and it shapes the closure beat. However, the ink's specificity is chemical rather than emotional—Lys could have used any truth-revealing substance with minor edits—and the cost tied to the ink itself is conceptual (truth bites) rather than visceral. Strong integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "rune of drift" drives two key beats: it shifts corridors when constellations pause (middle), opening the sealed corridor to the ledger, and it hums at closure when Lys crosses out the title, facilitating the final reveal. Setup is present ("anchored by a rune of drift scribed across the central mosaic"), middle use alters tactics (readers must walk the mosaic), and closure depends on it (the rune hums, books breathe open). Removing the rune would break access to the ledger and the story's temporal mechanism. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is applied to Lys early ("a diminutive titan, regally unpretentious") and echoed in the gardener's final bow ("bowed without ceremony, regally unpretentious"). The trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates how unpretentiousness constrains or enables a choice with cost. The gardener's humility is mentioned ("wore humility like an heirloom coat") but does not alter tactics. Late reprise without causal work; swappable with "modest" or "humble."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears twice with escalating stakes: Lys can "sunder a sentence so precisely it bled accurate silence" (her capability, mid-story), and at closure the rune of drift begins "to sunder the pleasant lacquer from his history," triggering the ledger's reveal and the pretender's collapse. The action is irreplaceable—only "sunder" (split, break apart) captures the precise unraveling of forgery. Setup, middle echo, and closure use are present; the final beat's logic depends on it. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lys's method—leaving cryptic messages in margins—is signaled early ("Lys answered through cryptic messages left in library books"), demonstrated in middle beats (atlas of funerary ships, cookbook with salt instructions), and shapes the gathering of the faithful who follow her hinted routes. The method enables the plan but does not constrain it under pressure; readers could have been summoned by other means. Two beats plus setup; functional but replaceable. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient temple library supplies the marginalia medium, the mosaic with the rune, the clerestory that opens during the pause, and the sealed corridor. Setting enables Lys's method (books as message vessels), constrains access (corridors shift), and provides the ledger's hiding place. Setup is immediate, middle beats use the library's rules (starlight bowls, drifting corridors), and closure depends on the mosaic and ledger. Removing "temple library" and substituting "archive" would require major rewrites. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"The pause of shifting constellations" is introduced early, explained as a held breath when the rune exhales, and recurs at closure ("when the pause settled"). The timeframe gates Lys's ability to arrange meetings and open the clerestory, shaping middle tactics. However, the pause's duration and urgency are vague—no ticking clock pressures decisions. It functions more as a ritual window than a live constraint. Setup, development, and closure participation are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lys's motivation to unmask the pretender is declared early ("Her charge was to unmask a pretender to the throne") and drives every beat: writing messages, gathering readers, guiding them to the ledger, and drawing the line through his title. The desire is consistent and goal-directed. However, it is never conflicted—Lys does not weigh costs or face friction between the unmasking and another want. The motivation is functional and pervasive but lacks the internal contradiction that would elevate it. Setup, development, and closure involvement are strong; friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" anchors the tone from the opening image ("shelves leaned, a graceful collapse arrested between breaths") through the pretender's final moment ("his smile fell without panic, like a curtain at dusk, a graceful collapse of practiced ease into vacancy"). The tone modulates across beats—reverent in the library, charged during the pause, elegiac at closure—without breaking coherence. The final image reweights the opening motif, making the collapse both literal (the pretender's authority) and tonal (inevitability without violence). Strong setup, middle consistency, and closure charge. The tone is indispensable to the story's register.</comment>
