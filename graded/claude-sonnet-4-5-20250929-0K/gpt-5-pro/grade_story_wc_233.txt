<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivation to "unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" drives her ascent and binds her to the closure act, but interiority remains largely abstract—dreams "ransacked" her sleep, yet we see little embodied cost shaping micro-choices along the path. The mapmaker's presence adds pressure but his thin characterization ("night weather in his eyes") leans decorative. The final act of naming the fire and loosening the crown carries renunciation weight, yet the emotional contradiction (hypocrisy, self-deception) that would elevate the choice into the high 7s is absent; the decision reads more as ritual acknowledgment than struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (queen, hall, ridge, after the final warning). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery of "bleeding starlight" and two-grotto breathing culminates when the queen presses her palms to basalt, cools the ember grotto, and prompts the cobalt vault to "ring once like glass"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the two lungs synchronize and a steady wind begins. Cost is conceptual (she unmakes her wedding crown) but legible on the page. The connector tissue between dream-summons and the physical closure ritual feels slightly underbuilt; one more causal beat linking starlight wound to the coronation fire would tighten escalation into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto "above clouds" and the ember grotto on the ridge function as paired micro-settings that constrain the queen's journey and supply the closure's "lung" metaphor. Bleeding starlight inside the cobalt vault becomes tactile liquid that "cut her palms with cold," and the ember grotto's basalt absorbs her whispered bird-names to complete the breath-cycle. Spatial choreography (treeline → cobalt vault → descent to ridge) remains clear, and the grottos charge the final image when the wind begins "between them." One more sentence anchoring the physical distance or elevation differential would push this firmly into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping the bleeding starlight and restoring breath between the grottos—is signaled early and tightens when the queen enters the cobalt vault, sees her own history braided in light, and realizes the wound traces to her wedding fire. The climactic beat (palms to basalt, naming birds, cooling the ember grotto) narrows options and produces the wind, but the mapmaker's passive witness role and the queen's unopposed success leave the escalation curve gentle. One visible friction or trade-off (fatigue, resistance from the grotto, a cost paid beyond the circlet) would raise this into the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation of past fire and present wound, unmaking to restore breath—emerges through the two-grotto structure and the queen's renunciation of her crown without a stated moral. The bleeding starlight shifts from nightmare to summons, and the final wind between grottos answers the thematic question with embodied particulars (palms, basalt, bird-names). "Lacy menace" and "softly commanding" recur as voice texture that charges key moments. The coronation-hawk detail feels slightly ornamental; tighter integration of the north's revenge into the closure act would elevate resonance past 7.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person close POV remains stable; perceptual signature (vows "stirring like moths," starlight as "liquid cloth") is consistent and voice-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer in the cobalt vault, wider during the ridge descent). The two brief dialogue exchanges ("Your dreams match our oldest contour lines," "Walk with me") carry subtext and goal pursuit without over-articulation. Diction ("filigree that weighed like threat," "dusk polish the stones") controls rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping or filter stacks; the prose stays clean and immediate throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (advance atmosphere and character state). A handful of figurative overlaps in the cobalt-vault passage ("bleeding starlight," "liquid cloth," "filigree that weighed like threat") cluster without full causal payoff, and "lacy menace" appears three times across the arc but does not constrain a mid-story choice, reducing propulsion slightly. Grammar and tense remain clean. The final image ("simply watched the dusk polish the stones") lands with quiet authority but sacrifices kinetic momentum for lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The paired-grotto "lungs" conceit and the bleeding-starlight summons offer a fresh angle on quest-and-reconciliation material. Voice texture ("disenchanted, meaning both honest and empty") and setting detail ("cloud cranberries," "bones of lightning") feel specific rather than generic. The coronation-fire backstory and north's engine-pierced sky add mythic texture but remain slightly under-integrated at closure. The mapmaker's thin presence and the unopposed final ritual trend toward safety; bolder risk (a second reversal, a price paid mid-climb) would push this past 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen frames expectation early, drives the climb, and performs the closure act (naming the fire, loosening the crown, pressing palms to basalt). Her choices alter tactics across three beats (leaving the hall, entering the cobalt vault, cooling the ember grotto). Cost is visible (crown renounced, palms cut) and tied to her agency. Swappability is low; a different protagonist would require different dream-logic and wedding-fire backstory. Late first-person "I unmake my unmaking" is the only moment of direct speech from her POV, limiting interior contradiction slightly below the 7+ threshold.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in setup (queen "set her feet toward the ridge, where the ember grotto kept the old heat of meteors"), development (mapmaker's contour-line comment seeds its paired role), and closure (queen presses palms to basalt, cools the grotto, prompting the cobalt vault to ring and the wind to begin). Its causal role—cooling the ember lung to synchronize breath with the cobalt lung—is indispensable to the ending's logic. The grotto's "red mist" and "coughed sparks" show state change. Minor swappability (any heat-source cave) and the absence of a middle-beat constraint keep this below 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight seeds in the opening ("recurring dreams of bleeding starlight dripping through stone"), becomes tactile in the cobalt vault ("the walls wept a sheen… only bleeding starlight"), and directly shapes the closure when the queen "lifted the bright wound and pulled its edges together" and it "slowed, then pooled, then rose as a patient mirror." The concept redefines the dream as summons rather than curse and requires the queen to name the originating fire. Cost is legible (palms cut by cold, crown removed). The concept's mechanics (starlight as wound-tissue) are irreplaceable; the ending fails without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears in setup ("habit of a softly commanding voice that opened doors"), development ("her tone was softly commanding, as if velvet could draw blood"), and closure ("I unmake my unmaking, she said, softly commanding her own heart to loosen the crown"). The attribute enables door-opening and self-renunciation but does not constrain a choice with visible trade-off; it functions as consistent voice texture rather than a tactic-altering trait. Swappability is moderate (any authoritative voice could substitute). Lyric reprise charges the final beat slightly, lifting this into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire narrative: setup frames the ascent to the cobalt grotto, development dramatizes the treeline and vault entry, closure requires descent to the ridge. Two major beats (entering the cobalt vault to see the braided history, descending to the ember grotto to cool it) depend on the climb. Removing the climb collapses spatial logic and the two-lung metaphor. Swappability is low; a different action (flight, tunneling) would require different setting and constraint. The climb itself does not redefine options mid-story (the queen meets no obstacle), capping this below 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shared exhale appears only once, in the cobalt vault: "They made a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer… As their breath left, the grotto brightened, and the bleeding starlight braided itself into a door." Setup is absent (no prior signal that breath-sync matters), and the method does not recur at closure (the final wind arises from palm-press and bird-naming, not exhalation). The firefly image is ornamental. Functional in one beat but highly swappable (any ritual gesture could open the door), and the mechanics are not revisited.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds anchors setup ("the mountain wore its cobalt grotto like a calm blue pupil"), development (queen and mapmaker enter, walls weep bleeding starlight, the grotto brightens to show her history), and closure (the grotto "rang once like glass" when the ember grotto cooled, completing the breath-cycle). The setting supplies the starlight wound, houses the vision-gallery, and participates in the final synchronization. Removing this exact grotto breaks the two-lung structure. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; specificity (cobalt, above clouds, paired with ember ridge) is high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the final warning" anchors the opening and recurs once ("They moved when the moon thinned, after the final warning had been spoken in the courtyard"). The timeframe signals urgency but does not constrain on-page choices; the queen's ascent and ritual proceed unopposed, with no live clock altering tactics. The warning's content (mirror crack) is atmospheric rather than mechanical. Swappability is moderate (any departure catalyst could substitute). Functional setup and brief reprise lift this into mid-5s, but lack of middle or closure pressure caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams"—is named in setup, drives the climb and vault-entry, and is resolved at closure when the queen learns the dreams are summons and names the fire. The motivation is dramatized through three beats (leaving the hall, entering the vault, performing the ritual) with visible cost (palms cut, crown removed). Want versus cost creates friction (she must confront her wedding fire to stop the bleeding). Swappability is low; a different motivation (political escape, revenge) would require different closure. Minor deduction for told-only articulation of the mystery in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears in setup ("corridors… trailing whispers that promised gentle harm," "hush, as if lace tightened around her throat"), development ("his voice tested edges the way rain tests silk, with lacy menace"), and closure ("lacy menace of reborn wind curling around their knees"). The tone modulates from corridor threat to mapmaker's voice to the final wind, charging the ending's breath-restoration with lingering danger. Coherence is strong, but the tone does not constrain a choice or shift stakes; it functions as atmospheric texture. The reprise lifts this into the 6+ band, but lack of causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>
