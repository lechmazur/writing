<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's role as memory keeper is established through concrete actions—peeling mica, weaving threads, humming scales—yet motivation remains abstract until late. Interior contradiction appears weakly: the narrator carries "a line of fear" but this tension doesn't meaningfully complicate choices during the climactic weaving. The final release moment ("emptied and full, bound to their recovered days") gestures at earned transformation, but the cost feels more declared than dramatized through specific foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it through closure: density builds via layered images (mica flakes, song fragments, woven threads) that converge in the climactic sky-raising. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, endless night, mica window) land by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn "unknots" and the realm breathes—with conceptual cost visible in "my scattered memories fly toward their owners" (the keeper empties to restore). One meaningful deepening occurs when the last village arrives and their collective song enables the final weaving, reweighting the lone keeper's work into communal restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains action throughout: mica must be "peeled gently," roots "braid faster" under song, trees "curl into themselves" when the window fails. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the keeper's craft—"sap brightening," "fruits exhaling cold sugar," "smell old seaweed and gun oil." The mica window functions as micro-setting, returning at key beats to enable the climactic thread-gathering. Spatial choreography remains clear (inside greenhouse, doors open to village, cloth climbs rafters and spills outward), and the endless-night constraint charges the final image when "the horizon shakes off its winter cowl."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled in the opening and tightens through escalating collective need: individual memories, then village grief, finally "the last village" with "fires gone to salt." Pressure accumulates through song-gathering that "knits communities together," and the climactic weaving forecloses the keeper's solitary holding ("I am emptied"). Agency is clear: the keeper chooses to "open the doors," "begin their song," and "raise the woven dawn," each act narrowing reversibility. The cost is legible on the page: "My scattered memories fly toward their owners" makes the emptying concrete and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between holding and release, crystallized in "Release trembles inside the bind, a bound release that holds us while letting light through." The motif of breaking-as-repair returns purposefully: the cracked mica window's "cracks are threads now, proof that breaking can be a seam for light to return." The ending reweights the keeper's isolation into communal restoration without stating a moral, and the final line "ready to sing again" opens futurity without closure, maintaining thematic complexity. Insight is earned through specific craft (peeling mica, weaving on trellis, swaddling in song) rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The first-person voice is stable and carries a distinct perceptual signature: alchemical-craft diction ("lamina," "hoarfrost unbuttoning," "warping vine to vine") filtered through the keeper's embodied work. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure: shorter clauses during the village arrival ("I open the doors and smell old seaweed and gun oil"), expansive syntax during the weaving climax. Some figurative density ("a murmuration of sparks stitching hearth to hearth") risks slight overwriting in the final third, but the voice remains character-specific and the final image coheres.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high and sentences frequently do multiple jobs: "The laugh is gold; it coats my tongue, and the mica window shivers, yearning" advances sensory texture, object state, and readiness for the next beat. Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Minor template cadence emerges in the village-song sequence: "The parents answer," "Grandmothers hum," "grandfathers murmur" uses parallel stems but serves the collective accumulation. One register drift in "a murmuration of sparks" briefly elevates beyond the keeper's established idiom. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "dawn threads spume out like rivers tasting day" mixes liquid and sensory metaphors without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-keeping through physical craft (weaving dawns from mica and song) offers a fresh angle on familiar restoration arcs, grounded in specific mechanics: peeling flakes to release flickers, swaddling memories in scarves, lattice-by-lattice loomwork. The "bound release" paradox charges the ending without neat resolution. Risk is evident in the sustained lyric-craft register and the choice to foreground communal ritual over individual confrontation. The transformation test holds: changing setting or keeper's method would collapse the logic. No close echoes of famous lines detected, and the piece commits fully to its alchemical-orchard premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening ("I am the scattered memory keeper") and drives at least three beats: gathering flickers through song, swaddling village memories, and the climactic emptying ("my scattered memories fly toward their owners"). The keeper's choices—to peel mica, begin the village song, raise the woven dawn—create key turns. The final cost is tied directly to this role: restoration requires the keeper's dispersal. Highly irreplaceable; removing this character collapses the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mica window appears in beat one (description and method), beat two (when it "failed" under storm of breath), and beat three (climactic opening: "rises on its hinge like a moon, half broken, half brave"). Its evolving state—intact, cracked, finally yielding flakes—constrains and enables action. The closing reprise ("Its cracks are threads now") reweights the earlier failure into purposeful seam. Removing it would eliminate the mechanism for gathering dawn threads. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Woven dawns shape stakes from early setup ("the last medicine our realm still craves") through climactic execution (lattice-by-lattice loomwork, cloth climbing rafters and spilling over the village) to closure image (sky "drinks every thread" and "horizon shakes off its winter cowl"). The concept defines the keeper's method, the village's need, and the realm's transformation. Removing it leaves no mechanism for rekindling. The final lines depend entirely on this concept's success. Indispensable across setup, escalation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("grief knits communities together") and returns at the village-song beat ("these low notes knit communities together across the shivering paths"). The attribute enables the climactic collective song that powers the final weaving. However, it functions more as recurring thematic language than a trait that visibly constrains action with cost. Removing it would weaken thematic coherence but not break plot logic. Functional but nearing replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Swaddling appears twice with causal force: "I swaddle their memories in tendril scarves, lay them beneath curing lamps" (mid-story tending) and "I catch them, swaddle them in the shawl of our song, and begin the loomwork" (climactic gathering). The action bridges collection and transformation, enabling the weaving. Replacing it with generic "gather" or "wrap" would weaken the embodied craft texture. Contributes to two beats and the closure sequence, but not wholly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Forgotten songs are signaled as method in beat one ("I can only gather flickers through forgotten songs") and executed climactically when the keeper "begin[s] their song with a child scolding thunder," layered with village voices. The songs enable the mica to release dawn threads. Removing this method collapses the gathering mechanism. Present in setup, drives the climactic beat, and participates in closure (the final line: "ready to sing again"). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse supplies resources (roots, fruits, trellis for weaving, curing lamps) and constrains action (mica must be handled carefully, trees react to song, "the greenhouse answers with a tremble"). Present continuously from opening to closure ("In the greenhouse, buds open like eyes"). The setting's alchemical properties enable the keeper's craft and the final dispersal of woven dawn. Removing it would require a complete re-anchoring of method and stakes. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mirror world and endless night are setup conditions (opening lines) and the closure reverses the night ("horizon shakes off its winter cowl"), but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or supply a live clock. No urgency tied to elapsed time; the "last village" signals finality but not deadline pressure. The frame functions as thematic backdrop rather than tactical constraint. Functional reprise but replaceable temporal logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to rekindle the realm is dramatized early ("To rekindle a dying realm, I must gather them") and tested at closure when the keeper raises the woven dawn and the realm "take[s] a breath." Friction appears in the fear the keeper carries ("a line of fear, as thin and cutting as mica") and the cost of emptying. The final paragraph shows the realm's restoration and the keeper's dispersal as direct consequences of this desire. Present across setup, complication, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bound release is coherent from setup ("Release trembles inside the bind, a bound release that holds us while letting light through") through climactic paradox ("I am emptied and full, bound to their recovered days, released from the ache of holding"). Tone modulates with pressure: reflective in the opening, urgent during the village arrival, expansive at the weaving climax. The final image charges this exact tension: cracks become seams, breaking enables repair. Tone is indispensable to the thematic and emotional closure.</comment>
