<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Fractal weaver's interiority is present but remains abstract—"boundarylessly trapped" and "orienting properly" are repeated without embodied stakes or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The widow's absence and the boy's tremor are told, not dramatized, weakening their felt cost. The valley figure's arrival offers a potential turn, but the protagonist's response is contemplative rather than conflicted, and no micro-choice forecloses a path with visible price. Motivation stays conceptual; we do not see the weaver struggle against a competing desire or limit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. Closure reads as Earned Stasis or Charged Poise—"I accepted the circle" crystallizes the stance—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible on the page. The piece accumulates images (whalebone, shingles, calcified grief) and declares a binding choice, yet I cannot point to an exact sentence where the price of staying is felt rather than described. One meaningful deepening occurs when the valley figure lays down its burden, but the closure image drifts into abstract declaration ("freedom here is a circle") without a concrete sensory or emotional anchor that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and dripstone are vividly anchored and return with purpose. Sensory detail is rich—"salt, pine pitch, and old rope"—and the lamp's blue flame is handled twice, shaping the middle beat and the ending stance. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with felt cost at closure; the grotto lengthens and the shingles shift, but these remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is slightly opaque during the valley figure's arrival and departure. The micro-setting qualifies (lamp, beads, cord), lifting the score above mid-band, but it does not charge the final image decisively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting burdens versus staying bound—is signaled early and persists. Pressure accumulates through the valley figure's question, but escalation is conceptual rather than action-driven: the protagonist listens, reflects, and accepts without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The widow's absence and the boat's grief are collected off-page; the boy's tremor is mentioned but not tested. One tightening occurs when the lamp and star align, yet the resolution ("I accepted the circle") feels asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that alters tactics or costs. No antagonistic friction forces a renunciation or shift with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the work of burden-bearing and the paradox of "boundarylessly trapped" freedom. The whalebone reverie and calcified grief function as recurring images that shift slightly across beats, and the final cord image offers a non-literal answer to the cost of staying. However, the ending articulates theme directly—"freedom here is a circle so wide it feels boundarylessly trapped"—where an image alone would resonate more. The valley's map coat and the protagonist's net of service gesture toward earned wisdom, but the insight is stated rather than shown through a concrete particular at closure. Strong thematic coherence; minor over-articulation at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; distance and focalization remain consistent. The perceptual signature is distinct—"shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped"—and the diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, voice-motivated by the weaver's profession. No head-hopping. Rhythmic control is present, with sentence lengths varying purposefully. However, the register occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("the binding was a ribbon that traveled every way at once") without grounding in a sensory anchor, and some figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Overall, voice is coherent and purposeful; minor register slips under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or lyric compression—without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure. "Boundary-lessly trapped" and "orienting properly" recur as conceptual anchors but loop without progression; "shingled hush" appears in varied phrasings but does not escalate. Syntax varies, and rhythm supports the meditative pace, but information density is uneven: the widow, boy, and boat are summarized rather than dramatized. No severe loops or template cadence, but the closure beat leans on abstract declaration ("freedom here is a circle") where a concrete image would sharpen propulsion. Minor overwriting in peak beats; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—Fractal weaver threading burdens into weights—is specific and fresh, and the bronze grotto setting is particular. The whalebone reverie and shingled hush offer memorable images, and the valley personed as a figure in a map coat is an inventive turn. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: protagonist enters liminal space, collects symbolic objects, accepts a binding role. The transformation is asserted rather than earned through a non-obvious choice; the final acceptance feels like a median resolution. Risk-taking is present in the lyric compression and the abstract profession, but the central conflict does not surprise in hindsight. Solid originality in texture; conventional in emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Fractal weaver: present throughout as profession and lens. Shapes two beats—unscrewing the lamp burner and tilting it to reveal weights—but these are observational rather than decisional. The final acceptance ("I accepted the circle") is the only clear choice, but it feels contemplative rather than causal. No visible cost tied to being a weaver versus another role; the profession colors voice but does not constrain options. Functional; replaceable with "burden collector" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp burner: handled in two distinct beats—unscrewing to coax blue flame, then tilting to align with the north star—and returns in the ending ("set my burner low"). The flame respects the grotto and reveals weights, enabling middle tactics. However, it does not charge the final image with reweighted meaning; the closure centers on accepting the circle, not the lamp. Contributes to escalation; not indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Shingled hush: named early, recurs across beats, and is described as "layering," "clicking," and "lifting slightly" when the lamp and star align. Functions atmospherically and signals the grotto's nature. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the hush is read and experienced but does not force a trade-off. Present in the ending ("I will keep reading roofs of Shingled hush") as thematic reprise, but the concept remains textural rather than causal. One key turn (alignment moment); swappable with "layered silence."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Boundary-lessly trapped: appears early and recurs as thematic refrain. Describes the protagonist's state—"trapped…by the way paths folded back"—and is echoed at closure ("freedom here is a circle so wide it feels boundary-lessly trapped"). However, it remains a label rather than a visible constraint; no on-page action is enabled or foreclosed by being trapped. The acceptance of the circle is stated, not dramatically tested. Functional as theme; does not shape tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Calcify: used once in a key beat—"I set that grief where the dripstone could calcify it into a pale bead"—and the beads return in the ending when stitched onto a cord. The action embodies the weaver's work and enables the final object (cord of beads). However, calcification is one step among many (collecting, weighing, setting); easily swappable with "crystalize" or "harden." Present in closure as the cord image, but the verb itself is not irreplaceable. Shapes one major beat; contributes to ending without being indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>By orienting properly: signaled early ("By orienting properly, I could tilt the glow") and used twice—tilting the lamp to reveal weights and aligning lamp with star to lift the shingles. The method shapes middle tactics and the valley burden's resolution. However, the mechanics are vague (what does "orienting properly" entail beyond tilting?), and the ending restates it without new application ("I will keep…orienting properly"). Present across beats; method is more thematic than mechanically specific. Functional; not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bronze grotto under starlight: anchored early, supplies resources (dripstone for calcification, bronze seams that tell stories, starlight for alignment), and shapes the weaver's work throughout. The grotto "lengthens like a map" and "kept breathing," pressuring the protagonist to stay. Starlight enables the lamp-star alignment beat. The setting is essential to tactics and tone, and the final image ("the grotto will keep breathing this whalebone reverie") charges closure. Removal would collapse the story's logic. Strong integration; minor: starlight's role could be slightly more specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the first snowmelt: present in the opening line ("After the first snowmelt, I found the bronze grotto") and implied thematically ("the valley shed as it thawed"). However, timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; no seasonal pressure or deadline. The widow left her absence "last spring," but this is backstory without present consequence. Snowmelt sets atmosphere but is functionally inert. Mentioned; replaceable with any seasonal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To collect the weights of different burdens: stated early ("I came to collect the weights") and dramatized in beats—widow's absence, boy's tremor, boat's grief. The valley figure's question tests this motivation against staying bound. However, the friction is conceptual rather than embodied; no on-page choice where collecting conflicts with another desire (escape, rest, self-preservation). The protagonist accepts both collecting and staying without visible cost between them. Shapes premise and one key turn (valley's question); desire is told more than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Whalebone reverie: anchored early ("The air shone with a whalebone reverie") and returns in the ending ("the grotto will keep breathing this whalebone reverie"). Establishes tone—pale, tensile, elegiac—and modulates slightly with pressure (lamp "turned into a small sun," breezes "smelled of salt, pine pitch, and old rope"). However, tone remains consistent rather than shifting decisively at closure; the final line restates the opening mood without reweighting it. Coherent and purposeful; charges the final image but does not transform it. Strong integration; not indispensable.</comment>
