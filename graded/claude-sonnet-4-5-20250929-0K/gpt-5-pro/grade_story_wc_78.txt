<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tide prophet's interiority is consistent and embodied—his listening to sap, touching the mallet, reading clouds—but agency remains thin: observation and ritual performance dominate, with no moment where contradictory impulses force a choice with visible cost. The vow anchored in loss ("unable to console a storm that took his father") arrives late and remains backstory; it does not complicate present action. Micro-choices (assigning labor to trees, adjusting to cloud tempos) exist but never foreclose a path or reveal a hierarchy of values under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across multiple paragraphs without deliberate disorientation serving closure, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build toward the wave's passage, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ring becomes a "corridor," pressure reads "as music, not conquest"). Cost is implied—relief, scent, posture loosening—but the final image does not reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure; the wave "passed through" feels more like atmospheric completion than decisive change or conceptual repricing with legible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The driftwood ring, bottles, trees, and sea are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dry drum note, bellish apples, foams applauding). The orchard-as-instrument setting constrains the prophet's tactics (assigning labor to trees, spacing bottles) and charges the closure image when the ring "did not break but became a corridor." Spatial choreography is coherent, and the micro-setting of body and tool (mallet, bottles, sailcloth) drives choices across beats, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning the swell's threat into tuned passage—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (mapping, striking, adjusting) rather than narrowing options, and the wave's cooperation ("seemed to" listen, then passes) lacks friction or tradeoff. No moment where the prophet's choice forecloses a path or faces a credible loss; the resolution feels atmospheric rather than earned by agency with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: conversation with weather versus conquest, naming as tuning, fractal repetition as patience. The vow-as-bassline anchors the arc without moralizing. The final image—"music that would not sleep," the prophet thanking the wave and clouds—offers a resonant answer to the central question (bartering with weather) without stating a thesis. The closure reweights prior material (the harbor-wall memory, the sketched diagram) with quiet coherence, though the emotional cost remains oblique rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, consistent, and rhythmically controlled: "xylophone mallet in hand," "dubbed the sea with timed delays," "a garden of pulses." Perceptual signature is clear (interpreting clouds like bar lines, listening to sap) and remains stable under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("restless euphony," "sketched resonance"), but the effect is voice-motivated and legible, and no elision obscures causality or closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("orchard floated on a circle of driftwood," "wave remembered another shape"). Minor issues: template cadence in mid-paragraphs ("He listened… He set… He began…") and paraphrase loops ("a pulse that kept his nerves awake" / "a bassline, restless and sure") that do not quite obscure causality but accumulate to −0.6. Information density is strong; no major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating orchard, tide prophet as conductor, dub and fractal patterns against a wave—is specific and non-obvious, with lived-in detail (bottles filled to different throats, sailcloth diagram, crabapple versus pear assignments). The premise transforms the "calming the storm" trope through acoustic bartering and musical vocabulary. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, extended metaphor) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passed: plot and emotional arc depend on this exact constellation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present across all three gates (setup, middle mapping/striking, ending thanks). Drives two distinct beats (diagram sketching, fractal striking) and shapes the closure image (the prophet keeping watch). However, choices are observational and ritualistic rather than dilemma-driven; no moment where his decision narrows options with visible cost. Band: functional causal involvement without high agency pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 2), handled across three beats (touching the rim, striking fractal, final knock), and present in the closure gesture. Causal: enables the dub method and appears in the final line ("tapping once with the mallet"). Swappability: any percussive tool could serve similar function with minor edits, capping irreplaceability. Band: essential across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Framed in paragraph 8 ("Sketched resonance") and governs tactics: mapping arcs from knot to nail, layering echoes at scaled intervals, adjusting to cloud tempos. Shapes the closure image ("sketched resonance taking shape from chalk lines into wood, bark, and brine"). Causal pressure is strong; the concept defines the method and reweights the final image. All three gates met with specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup early (paragraph 5), enables middle choices (reading cloud stagger like bar lines, adjusting strikes to cloud tugs), and recurs at closure (thanking clouds as "stern teachers"). Constrains tactics under pressure. All three gates met, but the trait could be replaced by another interpretive skill without breaking story logic, limiting irreplaceability. Band: shapes two beats and closure with moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 10 ("dub the sea with timed delays"), drives the central method (striking, layering, filling intervals with cousins), and defines the closure effect ("the dub he wove tonight was not a defiance but a conversation"). Present across three beats (naming the ring, striking fractal, final thanks). Causal: the action creates the resolution; removing it breaks the plot. Band: essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 9 ("fractal generating"), defines the striking pattern (cascade of repeating strikes, smaller likenesses filling intervals), and shapes the closure image ("fractal generating would teach them patience"). Enables the wave's passage and appears in the sailcloth record. All three gates met; causal pressure is clear. Swappability is low; the method's recursive specificity matters to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, pressures all choices (assigning labor to trees woven through lashings, spacing bottles along the rim, walking the creaking rim under wave threat), and charges the closure image (the ring as corridor, the orchard choir). Indispensable: removing the floating orchard breaks the stakes, tactics, and final image. All three gates met with high causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Anchored in opening and closing paragraphs ("blue hour," "dusk between day and night"). Creates atmospheric urgency but does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics on the page; the prophet's actions unfold without visible time pressure. Setup and closure participation present, but middle development is weak. Band: lyric reprise that reweights atmosphere but not options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stated paragraph 4 ("turn obstacles into instruments"), drives the dub method and fractal approach, and is restated at closure ("the instrument he had coaxed from trouble"). Present across setup, middle tactics, and ending. However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized in conflicted choices; no moment where the desire to transform rather than destroy costs him a credible alternative. Band: shapes beats and closure with moderate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Established paragraph 3 ("restless euphony threaded the salt wind"), modulates through the striking sequence (dry note, bellish apples, foams applauding), and charges the final image ("a music that would not sleep"). Coherent across turns; tone matches the accumulative lens and intensifies without static repetition. All three gates met; the restless-yet-harmonious register supports pressure and closure effect.</comment>
