<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-particular—crescent scars from failed glyphs, the red thread reminder—yet the embodied emotion often leans lyric rather than contradictory impulse. The moment "My fingers faltered remembering a rooftop fall" shows embodied emotion, and the choice to press the sugar pebble under the bowl's foot is a micro-choice that alters present options. The final agency (shedding the fear that words would trap) is earned by the reflective arc and the ritual pressure, though the internal conflict reads more as hesitation overcome than simultaneous contradictory drives. Interiority remains specific and avoids therapy-speak; the ending's earned stasis (accepting scars as shorelines) forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece accumulates pressure through layered sensory ritual and reflective fragments until the hinge rune reweights the central question (scars as cures versus bridges). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts the scars as shorelines rather than failures, and the cost is legible in the breath-holding ordeal and the final image of "new weight and new buoyancy." Orientation anchors who (budding rune scholar), where (floating platform), and stakes (inscribe hospitality runes before thunder) within the first ~100 words. The single-scene, reflection-interleaved design teaches its pattern early; the reflective blocks (mother's silver thread, grandmother's laughter) anchor in present stimuli and tilt the present stance via on-page micro-choices (sugar pebble, touching the earstone). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice loosens and the rune "began to breathe," narrowing options and changing the protagonist's approach to the hinge rune.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating platform, porcelain bowls, and stormleaf tea constrain the ritual choreography; the crow quill and the held breath serve as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (saturated hush, the way heat blurs the room to watercolor, frost on the lattice) reflects the protagonist's urgency and perceptual priorities. The environment subtly guides choice: Elder Nam's tapping the rim twice offers a rhythm of mercy that alters the protagonist's next move. Spatial choreography remains clear (leaning over the bowl, tools in satchel, chains anchoring the platform). The stormlight and rising wind at closure evolve the setting in step with the protagonist's internal shift, and the platform's tilt with the wind adds embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—inscribe three runes during a held breath before the storm arrives—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the lattice thickening into frost when fingers falter (a reversal), Elder Nam's rim-tap offering a path, and the protagonist's micro-choices (counting heartbeats, pressing the sugar pebble) that loosen the lattice and allow the rune to breathe. The final hinge rune reweights the central question ("scars as bridges") with visible cost: the held breath drying out at the edges, the fear shed on the page. Agency is present (the protagonist chooses to shed the last fear and let the quill listen forward), and the resolution is earned by the prior ritual and reflective arc. One friction: the reversal at the lattice-frost moment feels slightly convenient (Elder Nam's tap arrives precisely when needed), though the cost (breath held, silver ache) remains legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of scars into stories, renunciation of the fear that words trap—emerges organically from the ritual's particulars (crow quill, sugar pebble, names of lost kites) without moralizing. The central question ("What if my stories were not cures, but bridges, and the scars were shorelines") is dramatized in the protagonist's micro-choices and answered non-literally in the final image: the scars warming and glowing like tiny harbors. Subtext operates in gesture (Elder Nam's nod "the way mountains nod to rivers"), silence (the chains forgetting to clink), and the image of the door swinging inward. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration without stating a moral; the conceptual cost is legible (new weight and new buoyancy both brewed here). No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close; perceptual signature is distinct (the way the protagonist notices red thread, crescent scars, the quill's shaft). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "raincrow's eye," "history leaned close," "shorelines that taught me the shape of the sea." Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; inference reads as inference ("as if listening forward"). Psychic distance shifts are intentional (zooming in to the quill tip, pulling back to Elder Nam's eyes on the horizon). Free indirect style is clean; internal thought formatting is consistent. Elder Nam's speech carries subtext and goal-pursuit ("the opening rune must be written as if spoken to a child, not an army"). One friction: the phrase "by revisiting youthful superstitions" in the mid-section reads slightly expository, though it anchors the reflective turn and does not flatten voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the ritual's stakes). Figurative language ("saturated hush," "lattice that crystallizes when stressed," "stories stepped through and found perches") is vivid and mostly coherent, though density approaches the threshold in the mid-section without quite crossing into overwriting. One register drift: "I reached backward through time, by revisiting youthful superstitions" leans slightly expository and academic for the protagonist's voice under peak stress, though it remains legible (−0.3 in Q7). Clarity is high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the motif of storms and the crow quill. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual, breath-holding, and scar-reweighting offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives; the floating platform and stormleaf tea feel particular to this voice and world. The turn at the hinge rune ("scars as bridges, not cures") is earned in hindsight by the prior reflective fragments (mother's silver thread, grandmother's laughter). Emotional specificity (the silver ache of held breath, the delighted shaking at release) avoids generic templates. One friction: the core premise (ritual transformation of scars into stories through breath-held inscription) leans toward familiar writing-workshop tropes (scars as metaphor, breath as threshold), though the execution transforms it through specific world logic (the tea that crystallizes when stressed, the sugar pebble offering) and the protagonist's earned micro-choices. The ending's conceptual integrity (new weight and new buoyancy both brewed) follows the premise's implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The budding rune scholar's choices drive all three runes: the decision to press the sugar pebble (middle), the choice to count heartbeats and whisper kite names (middle), and the final choice to shed the fear and let the quill listen forward (ending). Present in all three gates; causal pressure narrows options at each rune; closure linkage is strong. Early signal ("I was a budding rune scholar, tasked with inscribing hospitality") frames expectation. Cost is visible (held breath, silver ache, the scars warming as harbors). The character's role is indispensable; the story would fail without this exact focalizer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The crow quill appears in setup ("I unpacked my satchel and lifted the crow quill trimmed tip"), middle development (used to draw the first curve, second stroke, hinge rune), and payoff ("The crow quill trimmed tip dried clean, as if it too had heard a story"). Present in all three gates; beat involvement spans three distinct moves (first curve, second stroke, hinge rune). Causal pressure: the quill's narrow kiss and red thread reminder constrain the protagonist's hand and enable the inscription. Closure linkage: the quill drying clean "as if it too had heard a story" recharges the object with new meaning. Specificity is high (trimmed the night before, black as a raincrow's eye, red thread wrap). Cost connection: the quill's use is tied to the breath-held ordeal and the final transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept "a breath between storms" shapes the ritual's urgency (inscribe before the next thunder) and the final image (stormlight, descending with new weight and buoyancy). Present in setup ("before the next thunder prowled"), middle (the held breath's silver ache), and payoff ("between tempests"). The breath-holding tightens decisions and the storm's approach frames the time constraint. The concept reweights the ending: the protagonist gains "new weight and new buoyancy, both brewed here between tempests." One friction: the concept operates more as thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint (the storm does not force a mid-ritual choice or complication); the breath-holding itself does the mechanical work. Still, the lyric reprise at closure elevates the concept's charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The attribute "crystallizes when stressed" appears early ("stormleaf infusion whose surface crystallizes when stressed") and constrains the protagonist's action twice: when fingers falter, "the lattice thickened into frost, choking the lines," and when the protagonist revisits youthful superstitions, "The lattice loosened, and the frost shed itself back into bright water." Present in all three gates (setup, middle reversal, middle resolution). Causal pressure: the attribute creates the central obstacle (frost choking the rune) and the protagonist's micro-choices (sugar pebble, counting heartbeats) directly respond to it. Cost is visible (the held breath, the silver ache, the protagonist's decision to shed fear). The story's logic would break without this exact trait; the crystallization mechanic is indispensable to the ritual's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The action "shed" appears in middle development ("the lattice loosened, and the frost shed itself back into bright water") and at the hinge rune ("Instead I shed my last fear that words would trap me"). Present in setup (implied in "transform scars into stories"), middle (twice: lattice shedding frost, protagonist shedding fear), and payoff (the scars warming as harbors, the shedding complete). Two beats: the lattice's physical shedding enables the rune to breathe, and the protagonist's volitional shedding of fear enables the hinge rune. Causal pressure: the first shedding is a reversal that alters tactics; the second is the decisive move at closure. Cost is visible (the held breath, the fear explicitly named and released). The action is not easily swappable; "release" or "let go" would lack the physical/metaphorical parallel that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method "by revisiting youthful superstitions" is signaled mid-ritual ("In that narrow urgency I reached backward through time, by revisiting youthful superstitions") and its mechanics matter: counting five heartbeats, touching the cup's earstone, whispering names of lost kites, remembering the mother's silver thread, pressing a sugar pebble. Present in setup (implied in "scars from failed glyphs and a childhood fall"), middle development (the method is enacted and loosens the lattice), and payoff (the stories step through and find perches along the arms where "old crescents warmed and glowed"). The method shapes the protagonist's attempts and enables the lattice to loosen. Cost is visible (the breath-held ordeal, the protagonist's willingness to reach backward). Early signal is implicit but the method crystallizes clearly in the middle third. Specificity is high (silver thread, lost kites, sugar pebble).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea ceremony platform anchors the setting early and shapes choice: the platform's precarity (chains anchoring it, the tilt with rising wind at closure) and the tea ceremony's constraints (porcelain bowls, stormleaf infusion, the ritual's timing) pressure the protagonist's moves. Present in all three gates: setup ("On the floating rock tea ceremony platform"), middle (Elder Nam's rim-tap, the bowl's earstone, the sugar pebble pressed under the bowl's foot), and payoff ("I felt the platform tilt with the rising wind"). The setting supplies the ritual's resources (tea, bowl, quill) and the spatial constraint (floating in air, exposed to the storm). Cost connection: the platform's tilt at closure adds embodied consequence. Micro-setting elements (bowl, quill, sugar pebble) charge the final image. One friction: the platform's floating nature does not constrain a mid-ritual choice (it could be a grounded platform without altering the core moves), though its precarity adds atmospheric pressure and the tilt at closure adds resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "during a held breath" is signaled early ("the rune must be born entirely during a held breath, or so the practice claims") and tightens every decision from the first curve to the hinge rune. Present in all three gates: setup (the rule is stated), middle development (the breath-holding is enacted, the protagonist "could not breathe again," the breath "dried out at the edges, a silver ache"), and payoff ("Release, he murmured, and I gave my breath back to the air"). The time constraint alters tactics: the protagonist counts heartbeats, presses the sugar pebble, and sheds fear all within the held breath's narrow window. Cost is visceral and visible (silver ache, the breath drying out). The timeframe is indispensable; without it, the ritual's urgency and the protagonist's ordeal collapse. Causal pressure is high; closure linkage is strong (the release coincides with thunder and the protagonist's "delighted shaking").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to transform scars into stories" is signaled early ("I had come to this height to transform scars into stories") and dramatized in the protagonist's choices: pressing the sugar pebble, counting heartbeats, shedding the fear that words would trap. Present in all three gates: setup (stated explicitly), middle (the protagonist's micro-choices enact the transformation), and payoff (the scars warm and glow like tiny harbors, the stories step through and find perches). Friction between want (transform scars) and cost (the breath-held ordeal, shedding the fear) is visible. One friction: the motivation is told more than it is conflicted on the page; the protagonist's internal debate about whether stories are cures or bridges arrives late and is resolved quickly without a prior counter-pull. Still, the final image reweights the motivation with felt cost, and the protagonist's micro-choices show commitment under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tone "saturated hush" is established in the opening line ("the air pooled in a saturated hush that tasted like rain") and modulates with pressure: the hush thickens when the protagonist hovers over the bowl ("the saturated hush thickened until even the chains anchoring the platform forgot to clink"), and sound returns at release ("Sound returned to the chains and the porcelain"). Present in all three gates: setup (opening line), middle (the hush thickening as constraint), and payoff (sound returning, the protagonist's "delighted shaking"). The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (stormlight brushing everything). Specificity is high ("tasted like rain," "chains forgot to clink"). The tone's modulation reflects the protagonist's internal state and the ritual's pressure, and its release at closure adds embodied consequence.</comment>
