<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is densely textured and particular ("counter clockwise clock maker, neatly inventive"), with choices driving the mechanism's assembly and final activation. Embodied moments appear ("I traced it with a finger, and felt dry thunder moving"), though some reflection edges toward label-speak ("bleak exhilaration"). The final renunciation—binding the yoyo to the pendulum and living "in the margins"—carries visible cost and forecloses rescue for rendezvous. Internal contradiction is present (wanting the impossible vs. needing the narrower path) but could act more simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator accepts a permanent role maintaining the counterclock, renouncing rescue for a liminal vigil with felt cost ("every night I fed it a year from my hoard of regrets"). The accumulative/textural lens holds through layered images and a cadence shift at the ending. Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse, rocky island, low tide), and causality flows through reverse-engineering the yoyo → assembling the mechanism → sister's return → binding the apparatus. One meaningful deepening tightens the stake from impossible rescue to sustainable rendezvous with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse and hunger stone constrain multiple choices: the lens feeds on the stone, the yoyo maps to planet gears, and the tidal cycle governs timing. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's craft bias ("back teeth of brass bit forward," "the house's heart steadied"). The rocky island's physicality—slick weed, silt, cracked lens—grounds the fantastical mechanism. Spatial choreography remains clear across the bunkhouse discovery, the lens chamber, and the final vigil, with the setting charging the closure image of waiting at the margin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to step beyond fate's design" and bring the sister home—is signaled early and tightens through the yoyo puzzle, the mechanism's assembly, and the sister's outline appearing. The reversal occurs when the narrator realizes "shattering fate is cruder than stepping around it," reframing rescue as rendezvous with visible cost (feeding the stone yearly regrets, living in margins). Agency drives the peak choice: the narrator initiates the reversal, binds the yoyo, and commits to the vigil. The cost is legible in the final image of tools, waiting, and the sister's voice reaching backwards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the counterclock, hunger stone, and latent radiance motifs without thesis statements. The concept of stepping beyond fate's design vs. exiting its grammar reweights the opening goal into a sustainable, liminal endurance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "keep the light inside…and keep the clocks honest in reverse" reframes the lighthouse's purpose from outward beacon to inward architecture. The sister's laughter and sobbing in the mechanism particularize grief and connection. Specificity anchors universals—ships unhook from sorrow, fog remembers windows—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is distinct and craft-inflected ("necessity edits vanity, and the sea edits lies"), with diction and rhythm controlled under pressure. POV remains stable first-person throughout, and the voice modulates from analytical ("I learned the plan through reverse-engineering") to incantatory ("gulls become sketches, waves become equations"). Some figurative density in peak beats edges toward overwriting ("latent radiance succumbing to order," "island's ribs quieted"), and a few metaphors strain slightly ("dry thunder moving"). No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most lines advancing mechanism, image, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the reversal and breathing in the final vigil. However, template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" stems across the mechanism assembly sequence, and several metaphors stack without always clarifying ("light withdrew, a latent radiance succumbing to order" near-duplicates the concept). Minor paraphrase loops occur ("bleak exhilaration" recurs without added pressure mid-text). The closure image is clear, but prior beats carry slight scaffold weight that dulls momentum incrementally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The counterclock mechanism and reverse-engineered yoyo offer a fresh synthesis, and the emotional turn from rescue to rendezvous feels earned rather than contrived. The lighthouse-as-inward-beacon transforms the genre fixture through specific craft logic and tidal constraints. However, the "mysterious lighthouse" and "vanished keepers" setup flirts with template territory, elevated by the narrator's particular occupation and the hunger stone's specificity. The final image's combination of grief, tool-tending, and liminal waiting avoids tidy resolution and commits fully to its premise without retreating to safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The counter clockwise clock maker identity shapes the yoyo analysis, mechanism rebuild, and counterclock assembly across multiple beats. The trait drives the peak choice to "rebuild the clockwork to run counterclockwise" and constrains the ending vigil ("I kept my tools tidy"). Occupation and mindset are causally active, not label-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hunger stone appears in setup (lifting from silt), development (lens feeds on it, mouth traced, "felt dry thunder"), and closure (thrumming companion, fed yearly regrets). It constrains the mechanism's function and charges the final image. Reweighted meaning across beats elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Latent radiance is seeded early ("inside both slept a latent radiance"), shapes the lens mechanism ("their light would not shine outward, but within time"), and returns at the reversal ("latent radiance succumbing to order"). It alters the lighthouse's function from outward to inward, affecting tactics and closure participation. Slightly abstract in peak beats but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" is claimed twice in early setup ("I am a counter clockwise clock maker, neatly inventive") and links to the narrator's methodical approach, but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost beyond general competence. Functions more as label than on-page friction or enabler.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears at the peak turn ("With a twist of the yoyo, I initiate the reversal of the clock") and directly triggers the mechanism's activation, the sister's appearance, and the closure commitment. The action is foregrounded and redefines options. Swapping "initiate" for "start" would weaken specificity but not break causality; strong integration, not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering the yoyo is signaled early ("I learned the plan through reverse-engineering the puzzle of an ancient yoyo"), its mechanics matter (runes, backward metronome, secret twist), and the method shapes the mechanism's design ("I mapped its whorls to the planet gears"). The yoyo is handled in setup and bound to the pendulum at closure. Method drives multiple beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mysterious lighthouse on a rocky island frames the entire narrative, supplies resources (bunkhouse clue, lens, gear chamber), and constrains choices (tidal timing, isolation). The setting charges the closure image ("mysterious lighthouse…stopped looking outward for applause") with thematic weight. Early setup, middle use, and closure transformation all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Under the slow exhale of low tide" appears in the opening and near the reversal ("gaps opened like blank pages"), governing the timing of the hunger stone's emergence and the mechanism's activation. The tidal clock tightens decisions and is tracked on the page. Present in setup and peak, with implicit closure pressure (narrator waits for the tide's rhythm).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To step beyond fate's design" is stated early as the narrator's goal, tested through the mechanism assembly, and reframed at the reversal ("shattering fate is cruder than stepping around it"). The motivation drives the counterclock project and the final acceptance of rendezvous over rescue. Friction between want (bring her home) and cost (live in margins) is dramatized, not only told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice and the tone modulates coherently through analytical craft ("I rebuilt the clockwork"), mystical reversal ("gulls become sketches"), and quiet endurance ("I sat with the hunger stone thrumming"). The tone charges the final image of waiting with tools and stone, balancing loss and purpose. Coherent through turns, though slightly declared rather than purely embodied.</comment>
