<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scholar's interiority is concrete and particular—"hands folded as if not to bruise the quiet," his pang at "court" as if "the room might pronounce a sentence upon sentences." Motivation is consistent and tested: the drive to decode growth in silence culminates in the testimony, a renunciation of certainty that forecloses easy proof with visible cost. Minor deduction: some reflection reads decorative rather than decision-shaping ("memory and hope braided with a kind of weathered innocence" does not alter present tactics). The final choice—offering listening over harvest—earns the stance through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by line 4 (shadowed library, dawn, reticent scholar). The piece accumulates pressure through echoes mapped to ivy grammar, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "after the last dictionary is printed the library becomes a garden of ears" reweights the premise, and the custodians' lowered eyes signal conceptual cost (authority yielding to care). One meaningful deepening is present; the fractured-sequences method builds to the testimony. Cost is legible: he offers "not a harvest, only a method," foreclosing certainty. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library is particularized—beams meeting plaster shift echo signatures, ivy through the window traced against dust, the wobbling ledger as a stage for the crystal. These details constrain the scholar's method (mapping the room, testing walls) and charge the final return of the crystal to the chandelier. Sensory selection is filtered through his priorities (sonic textures, increments of growth). Minor cap: the setting does not escalate pressure across beats; it supports rather than narrows options. Object-as-setting (crystal) qualifies and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving language grows in silence to the custodians. One clear tightening: the summons to Archive Court forces the scholar to compress his method into testimony, narrowing options to listening vs. declaring proof. Agency is decision and stance crystallization: he chooses to share authority ("listen with me, not to him") with visible cost—no harvest, only care. The custodians' lowered eyes register consequence. Escalation under Accumulative lens is sufficient; the testimony is earned by prior mapping. Minor deduction: the custodians arrive late and apply no visible counter-pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—growth without sanctioned naming—emerges from particulars: ivy increments, echoes clinging to invisible leaves, the crystal's unborn neighbors. The testimony delivers a resonant answer without moralizing: "after the last dictionary is printed the library becomes a garden of ears." The final image (hush hanging higher, pocket of patient rain) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gesture (custodians lowering eyes) and image (crystal nestled among dull fellows). No thematic echo or sermon. The piece invites reflection through ambiguity (does growth arrive?) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close; distance modulates purposefully (tight on interiority, looser for custodians' arrival). Perceptual signature is distinct: "sonically reflective," "grammar of growth," "seedlings of sound" reveal a scholar's idiom. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure; the custody scene compresses without shifting register. Minor deduction: some ornamental phrasing ("weathered innocence," "suspended hush thrumming with intent") decorates more than it constrains. Dialogue is absent; no head-hopping. Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stance. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (echoes "dressed in its own echo," waves folding into unborn neighbors) is coherent. Deductions: paraphrase loops appear ("suspended hush" recurs six times without evolving meaning; "sonically reflective" is restated across beats without fresh pressure). Template cadence in mid-section: "He had watched… he had traced" runs identical stems. Figurative density in some beats (morning dust, pear-shaped shard, low meadow of replies) trends ornamental without pattern payoff. Net −0.8 for loops and template stems touching non-closure beats. Closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—language as sonic ecology after print dies—is specific and non-obvious. The scholar's method (crystal echoes mapped to ivy grammar) particularizes the premise beyond abstraction. Transformation test passed: plot and arc depend on this exact world logic. Risk-taking (testimony via fractured sequences, no tidy proof) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the custodians' polite arrival and quick concession feel median; counter-pressure could escalate. The closure image (hush growing seed by seed) is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Within-band bonus +0.3 for structural boldness and coherent lyric design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present by paragraph 2 (setup). Chooses to test silence (mid-beat choice: hums into crystal, maps the room). Testimony is his decision under pressure (development). Returns the crystal and leaves (closure participation). Causal pressure: his stance alters the custodians' options. Cost: no harvest offered, only care. Beat count: three distinct (crystal retrieval, mapping, testimony). Swappability: "reticent scholar" could be "patient linguist" without major edits. Late penalty minimal; closure linkage strong. Deductions for modest irreplaceability. Base ~5.0 + setup +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +0.8 + closure linkage +1.0 − swappability −0.5 − modest specificity −0.4 = 7.8; round to 6.8 after reconsidering "reticent" as generic trait label −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Present paragraph 4 (setup). Used in three beats: retrieval, humming test, fingernail tremor on ledger (development). Returns to chandelier at closure (payoff). Causal: enables the fractured-sequences method; without it, no testimony mechanics. Closure linkage: nestling among dull fellows charges the final hush. Specificity: pear-shaped, sonically reflective—unique properties matter. Cost: borrowed, not stolen, signals ethical constraint. Base ~5.0 + early +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal +1.2 + closure +1.4 + specificity +0.6 = 10.2; cap at 10.0 per rubric. No swappability penalty; crystal's properties are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Present title and paragraph 1 (setup). Shapes stakes: the hush is what the scholar decodes and what the custodians must witness. Development: "suspended hush thrumming with intent" tightens pressure before testimony. Closure: "hush did not vanish, it hung a little higher… growing seed by seed" reweights the premise. Causal: the concept drives the scholar's method and the testimony's content. Cost: offering care over proof forecloses certainty. Specificity: "suspended" recurs, charging the final image. Base ~5.0 + early +0.7 + two beats +0.9 + causal +1.0 + closure +1.4 + cost +0.5 − swappability (could be "living silence") −0.6 − ornamental repetition −0.3 = 8.6; recalibrate for thematic role vs. tactical constraint, landing 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present paragraph 5 (setup). Enables the core method: crystal scatters hum onto walls, walls return replies. Development: scholar uses it to map echoes, decode growth (two beats). Closure: the attribute underpins the testimony's mechanics. Causal pressure: without sonic reflection, no fractured sequences. Specificity: the trait is unique and irreplaceable. Cost: the scholar must interpret scattered replies rather than direct answers. Base ~5.0 + early +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + causal +1.4 + closure linkage +1.0 + specificity +0.7 = 9.6; minor deduction for the attribute being told rather than shown in initial use (label-only −0.3) and modest mid-scene repetition without escalation −0.2 = 9.1; recalibrate to 7.4 after noting that "sonically reflective" could swap with "acoustically mirrored" without major edits, applying swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Summoned paragraph 20, arrives paragraph 26 (mid-story setup). The testimony is the climactic turn: scholar presents fractured sequences, asks custodians to listen with him, offers conclusion. Development and closure: the action redefines options and delivers the story's final stakes. Causal: all prior beats (crystal retrieval, mapping, recording) build to this moment. Cost: he offers method over harvest, and the custodians' response signals conceptual shift. Specificity: testifying via sonic demonstration is irreplaceable. Base ~5.0 + mid setup +0.4 + climactic beat +1.4 + causal +1.6 + closure +1.8 + cost +0.6 + irreplaceability +0.8 = 11.6; cap at 10.0. Recalibrate for late-ish introduction (after 40% mark per gate model cap 4.6 waived here because the element transforms all prior material and lands decisively at closure); score 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present paragraph 12 ("fractured sequences, not lines but shards"). Development: the scholar records echoes in fragments, arranges them as self-rearranging mosaic (beats 12–15). Testimony explicitly names the method (paragraph 33). Closure: the method defines the testimony's form and the final conceptual shift. Causal: without fractured sequences, no way to decode growth or persuade custodians. Specificity: the method's fragmented nature mirrors the story's own structure and theme. Cost: renouncing linear proof for shards forecloses certainty. Base ~5.0 + mid setup +0.4 + two beats +0.9 + causal +1.2 + closure +1.4 + specificity +0.8 + cost +0.5 = 10.2; cap at 10.0. Deduct for late-ish signal (not until 30% mark) −0.3 and modest swappability ("through broken patterns") −0.4, landing 9.3; recalibrate to 7.8 after noting that the method's mechanics are told more than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present paragraph 1 (setup). The library supplies the crystal, walls for echo mapping, beams/plaster for signature shifts, window for ivy observation, ledger as stage. Development: spatial details constrain the scholar's method across multiple beats. Closure: the crystal returns to chandelier, the room exhales—setting charges the final image. Causal: without the library's acoustics and objects, no method. Specificity: "shadowed," "dawn," post-dictionary abandonment particularize the space. Cost: the scholar must work within the room's constraints (no lab, no instruments). Base ~5.0 + early +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal +1.2 + closure +1.0 + specificity +0.6 = 10.9; cap at 10.0. Minor deduction for "shadowed library at dawn" reading slightly generic (could be "dim archive at sunrise") −0.5, landing 9.5; recalibrate to 7.6 after noting that the setting supports rather than escalates pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Present paragraph 3 (setup). Frames the stakes: dictionaries ended, definitions no longer corral culture. Development: the timeframe motivates the scholar's search for post-print growth and the custodians' question (paragraph 21). Closure: the scholar's answer ("after the last dictionary is printed the library becomes a garden of ears") directly addresses the temporal premise. Causal: the timeframe creates the central conflict. Specificity: post-print linguistic ecology is fresh. Lyric reprise: opened and closed with the same phrase, reweighted. Base ~5.0 + early +0.7 + lyric reprise +0.8 + causal +1.0 + closure +1.2 = 8.7; deduct for the timeframe not constraining tactics on the page (no clock pressure, no tightening deadline) −1.2 and for being more thematic frame than active constraint −0.6, landing 6.9; adjust to 6.3 after noting the timeframe could be "after the last press closed" without structural change, applying swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present paragraph 8 (setup). Drives all actions: retrieval of crystal, mapping echoes, recording measures, testifying. Development: friction between desire (proof) and cost (he wants evidence "gentle enough to carry, but strong enough to testify"). Closure: the scholar renounces harvest for method, fulfilling the motive with visible cost. Causal: every beat traces to this desire. Specificity: decoding growth in silence (not language revival, not preservation) is particular. Cost: offering care over proof forecloses certainty and professional validation. Base ~5.0 + early +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal +1.6 + closure +1.4 + cost +0.6 + specificity +0.6 = 11.3; cap at 10.0. Minor deduction for the motive being told more than shown under pressure in early beats −0.3, and for "decode the pattern of growth" reading slightly abstract (could be "trace the grammar of emergence") −0.4, landing 9.3; recalibrate to 7.9 after noting that dramatized friction appears late (testimony) rather than tested across multiple prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Present throughout: "patient spines," "not to bruise the quiet," "weathered innocence," "kindly… even when it is stern," "pocket of patient rain." Modulates: hush sharpens before testimony, exhales after. Closure: tone charges the final image ("suspended hush growing seed by seed in the care of listening"). Coherence: the tone is consistent across turns, supporting the scholar's gentle method. Specificity: "weathered innocence" (care worn but unjaded) is fresh. Cost: the tone itself embodies the scholar's renunciation of forceful proof. Base ~5.0 + coherence +1.2 + modulation +0.8 + closure charge +1.4 + specificity +0.7 = 9.1; deduct for some ornamental phrases ("weathered innocence" recurs without escalation) −0.4 and for tone being maintained more than tested under counter-pressure (custodians do not challenge it) −0.6, landing 8.1; recalibrate to 7.3 after noting that "weathered innocence" could swap with "patient humility" in several beats without major structural change, applying swappability −0.5.</comment>
