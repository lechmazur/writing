<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority operates through rich, accumulative texture ("borrowed heartbeats lining my ribs like foreign coins"), and the final choice to return the coins demonstrates agency with visible cost. However, motivation remains largely told through poetic assertion rather than dramatized contradiction—the desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated but never tested against a competing impulse. The urn fragment exchange with Mara provides a micro-choice that tilts stance, but the protagonist's internal conflict never sharpens into simultaneous opposing wants acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where by the emerald silo paragraph (~15% in), meeting the window. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ribbon settles, the capsule heals, and the narrator commits to the method of "embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions" going forward, reweighting the opening premise with felt cost (lightness from returning borrowed coins). One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragment clicks and releases the ribbon's instructions, narrowing the narrator's path. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo's "watery heartbeat" glass panes and the cremation urn fragment's "cool grit" constrain the final choice—Mara's pressing the fragment into the narrator's hand steadies the decision to release the coins. The rye "sugar-lit" at dawn and the silo's green light create a coherent micro-setting that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (capsule at center, fragment at seam, ribbon uncoiling) remains clear across beats, and the silo's timeless air brackets the key turn without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and tightens when the ribbon demands "a tender I could not replicate with breaths or arithmetic," forcing the narrator to pay the debt by returning the borrowed coins. This forecloses the path of passive observation with visible cost (lightness, loss of ancestral names). The escalation is more accumulative than causal: pressure builds through texture and adjective-maps rather than a sharp reversal, but the final choice is protagonist-driven and the price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—time as weave/grain versus ticks—emerges through concrete images (ribbon stitched with uncounted words, coins pressed with names, texture rising as "summer linen, dry riverbed") rather than thesis. The capsule's role shifts from disaster marker to repair site, and the ending offers a resonant answer: the narrator becomes a steward of texture, inviting others via garage-sale adjectives. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the hum and touch replace moral statement. The conceptual repricing of the town hall collapse as "fabric fold" reweights prior catastrophe without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice sustains a lyric, second-person-adjacent register ("minutes taste like copper," "ribs answered with a hopeful ache") without mid-paragraph drift. Diction remains character-particular: the narrator perceives through textures and avoided arithmetic, and no therapy-speak intrudes. Purposeful compression ("I wanted more than survival; I wanted to understand") and patterned syntactic parallelism ("we did not count success; we touched it") are taught early and paid off at closure. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated ("I felt the borrowed heartbeats") and do not stack densely enough to trigger penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines layer image, action, and thematic charge—and rhythm varies purposefully (short crisis beats: "It clicked like bone understanding bone"; longer reflective runs in the middle). Minor loop: "suddenly timeless" appears twice in similar phrasing (paragraphs 14 and 33), and "embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions" recurs verbatim across three paragraphs without tonal shift, totaling a −0.2 paraphrase penalty. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; no mixed metaphors or register breaks mar the closure beat. One pronoun ambiguity: "their" in "returning names to their owners" briefly unclear after "coins" and "owners" both plural, resolved by context within the line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—post-numerical time measured by texture, with repair conducted via adjective-laden garage-sale descriptions—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the time-capsule trope through lived sensory detail and the method's eccentricity. The cremation urn fragment as literal missing tooth and the ribbon's hummed instructions feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal turns, adjectives replacing numerals) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.3 within band. No close echoes of famous lines detected, and the synthesis of timekeeping/repair/memorial reads as singular artistic stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The borrowed-time timekeeper is named early (paragraph 2) and makes two key choices: bringing Mara and returning the borrowed coins at closure. The role shapes tactics (using adjectives, reading maps) and the final image commits to continuing the method, but the character's decision-making could be more active in the middle—much of the silo sequence is reactive observation until the urn fragment moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears when Mara arrives (paragraph 10), fits the capsule's lip as "missing tooth" (paragraph 12), and is pressed into the narrator's hand to steady the final choice (paragraph 31). Three distinct beats with evolving use, and the fragment's "cool grit" directly enables the closure action. It is causally indispensable: without it, the capsule does not open and the debt cannot be paid.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is introduced early (paragraph 5), its warped seal and bronze skin remembered throughout, and it sits at the silo's center where the climactic opening occurs. The capsule's demand for payment and its healing at closure are causally central—removing it would collapse the story's logic. It appears in setup, drives the middle sequence, and resolves in the final third with visible transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" describes the silo's air twice (paragraphs 14 and 33) and the moment of suspension when coins are released (paragraph 33). It labels atmosphere rather than constraining a specific choice, though the timeless suspension does bracket the climactic beat. The attribute is present across beats but remains more thematic accent than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears in the resolution ("we learned how to rediscover," paragraph 34) as the earned insight after touching the smooth nap of success. It names the outcome but does not drive prior turns—the major actions are "open," "listen," "return." The verb captures thematic closure but could be swapped for "restore" or "repair" without major structural loss, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions is signaled early (paragraph 8), used to invite Mara (paragraph 9), and recommitted as ongoing method in paragraphs 35–36. The mechanics (adjective maps, breadcrumb sentences) shape the narrator's preparations and the future tactic, appearing in three beats. It is causally tied to the closure but does not constrain the silo sequence itself, so it scores below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is introduced as quest destination (paragraph 4), entered at dawn (paragraph 13), and its green light, watery heartbeat glass, and central capsule staging shape every choice inside. The setting provides the physical constraint (door, panes, center) and atmospheric pressure (timeless air, exhaled weather at closure). Removing the silo would require a full structural redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" frames the entire premise (paragraph 1) and recurs as context (paragraphs 7, 21), shaping the narrator's method (adjectives replace numerals) and the ribbon's uncounted words. It pressures tactics throughout but does not tighten a specific on-page decision—the time constraint is atmospheric rather than a live clock. The timeframe is essential to tone and world logic but less to beat-by-beat escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated early (paragraph 3) and pursued through the silo journey, ribbon reading, and final tactile learning ("counting by touch," paragraph 37). It drives goal pursuit across beats, but friction between this want and a competing cost is implied rather than dramatized—until the debt-payment moment, the desire faces no visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early ("ribbon hummed with anticipated mysteries," paragraph 19) and sustained through "what it asks me to hold" (final line). The hum, waiting air, and unanswered invitations modulate coherently with pressure, and the final market-tag image recharges the opening breadcrumb method. The tone charges the closure and remains consistent across turns without flattening into single static mood.</comment>
