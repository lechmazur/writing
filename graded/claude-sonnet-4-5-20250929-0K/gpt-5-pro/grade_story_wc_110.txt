<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voiced ("my ledger felt heavier than its paper"), and the choice to expose both Rell and self is motivated by visible contradiction between watching records bend and fearing to speak. Internal conflict appears in simultaneous impulses: "If I revealed this, I would reveal myself, and perhaps be broken, but perhaps be freed." The final gesture—setting the lens beside Rell and pointing to their own name—embodies agency with cost, though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined by the lyric premise rather than fought for under unpredictable pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (night registrar), where (museum forecourt), and the premise (after words unnecessary) within opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through doodles → lens revelation → public display, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when both curator and narrator surrender secrecy with visible cost ("Rell slid his pass onto the stone...traced a line from replica to real"). Cost is legible: Rell's pass-down and the narrator's logged confession alter their professional futures. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt recurs across five distinct beats (opening hum, post-concert confetti, lens setup, Rell's arrival, street projection) and constrains the climactic choice: the narrator hangs the frame "between two columns" in the rain-washed public space, making secrecy impossible. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("tiles hissed softly," "lamp halos drifted like forgetting"), filtered through a curator's attention to surfaces and light. The rain and stone charge the final image of transparency as posture, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust with transparency—is signaled early and tightens once: the narrator moves from private discovery (lens over doodles) to public exposure (frame in forecourt), narrowing options and forcing both Rell and self into the open. Agency drives the turn: "I carried the tickets, the lens, and a portable frame into the forecourt" is a protagonist decision with visible cost (Rell's pass-down, logged confession, volunteer repair tours). One meaningful deepening fits this length under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is unmistakable on the page, though a second complication before the setup would have raised pressure further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—seeing together as truer than speaking alone—emerges from concrete actions: eavesdropping through doodles, lens projection, Rell's traced line, strangers pausing at the street-facing frame. The final image ("secrets...held in open hands and rinsed in the whispering rain") reweights the opening premise without moralizing, and the piece resists tidy binaries (Rell is neither villain nor redeemed; mercy born from concealment vs. harm from honesty). The doodled violin's ache and the cellist's bow-mark layer subtext without thematic echo. Complexity is earned through particulars, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("rain left the museum steps humming like bowls"), purposeful parallelism ("I answered to everything nights"), and perceptual signature (a curator notices "seams" and "glints"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The phrase "after words become unnecessary" recurs as frame rather than filter clutter, teaching the pattern early and paying it off at closure. Minor density concern: some lines ("He answered to nobody nights, and I answered to everything nights") approach decorative antithesis without advancing pressure, but the texture supports the Accumulative lens and the final image integrates rhythm with content.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer image, character, and pressure ("Under the lens, the doodles swelled into chambers; the rain beads inside the glass connected dots the pen had not"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes. Two minor frictions: "resonant hush" appears four times, risking scaffold; and "ambiguously clear" is both descriptor and required attribute, creating a hint of prompt echo. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and figurative language ("the forecourt hummed like a throat readying a vowel") remains coherent. Clarity and propulsion are strong, with no artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—projecting crowd doodles through a museum lens to restore trust—is specific and non-obvious, and the piece commits fully to its lyric premise. Risk-taking in the "after words" frame and the eavesdrop-through-art method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on this exact confluence of curator role, projector lens, and post-concert forecourt. Minor constraint: the curator-conceals-forgery premise is familiar; the story freshens it through the lens mechanic and the mutual confession structure, but the core ethical bind reads recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from line three and drives two key turns: discovering Rell's swaps via lens (middle) and choosing public exposure in the forecourt (climax). The role's "caretaker of objects that preferred moonlight" and "I answered to everything nights" establish motive and authority, making the final logged confession and key-no-longer-hidden gesture causal and costly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced early ("In a drawer lay the lens from projector"), used across three beats (over ink/puddles, doodles, public frame), and returns charged at closure ("I returned the lens to its cabinet, not hiding my key"). Its nicked, ambiguously clear property enables the plot (revealing Rell's swaps) and the final act (street projection). Removing it breaks the mechanism of seeing and the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shapes stakes and tactics on the page: "perhaps be broken, but perhaps be freed by honesty" motivates the forecourt setup, and both Rell and narrator "felt suddenly freed by honesty" at the climax. The concept drives the choice to project secrets publicly rather than confront privately, and the cost (pass-down, logged confession, unsoftened tours) makes the freeing legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears three times: lens description ("ambiguously clear"), projections ("ambiguously clear, because memory never loses its fog"), and as constraint ("clear enough for people to recognize what not speaking had distorted"). It enables the plot—the lens's partial clarity reveals enough to act—but the attribute functions more as descriptive motif than a tradeoff that alters tactics. Present in closure image, but the cost ties more to honesty than to ambiguity itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Signaled early ("I learned to eavesdrop through cryptic doodles"), performed at midpoint (lens over doodles reveals Rell's swaps), and extended to climax (public projection of doodles). The action redefines options: private knowledge becomes public transparency. Two distinct beats and causal pressure; swapping eavesdrop for another discovery method would require major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Introduced in line ten, mechanics detailed across three beats (reading loops "the way sailors read weather," lens swelling doodles into chambers, gauze projection where "doodles climbed...and widened"), and the method shapes both discovery and resolution. Specificity matters: concert tickets supply the substrate for public anxiety ("People drew waiting, doubt, longing"), and their casual medium (post-concert litter) contrasts with the curator's formal ledger, charging the transparency theme. The means is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present in title phrase, anchors five beats (opening hum, confetti scatter, lens setup between columns, Rell's arrival, street projection), and the rain-washed public space forces the climax: hanging the frame there makes secrecy impossible and invites strangers to witness. The forecourt's tiles, columns, and wet surfaces supply resources (reflective pools, lamp halos) that the lens mechanic depends on. Micro-setting pressure is high; removing this exact space breaks the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Framed in line two ("after words become unnecessary") and recurs at closure ("after words become unnecessary, we learned that seeing together can be truer"). The timeframe constrains form—gestures replace dialogue—and the lack of speech tightens the reliance on visual projection and physical acts (pass-down, bow-mark, logged confession). Two gates clear; modest causal role (enables silent resolution) but does not drive a middle turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stated in line six, dramatized in the choice to carry lens and tickets into the forecourt ("I wanted to thaw mistrust with transparency, not with proclamations, but with the simple showing"), and conflicted by fear ("I feared breaking what little peace remained"). Friction between desire (transparency) and cost (self-exposure) generates the climax, and the motive ties directly to the logged confession and public frame setup. Visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Established early ("the city around us moved in a resonant hush") and sustained through peak beats ("the forecourt hummed like a throat readying a vowel," "the resonant hush making room"). Tone modulates subtly: early hush is wary ("trust had frayed"), climax hush is readying, and final hush is collaborative ("after words become unnecessary, we learned"). The quiet charges the final image of open-handed transparency and coherently supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
