<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bedraggled prince exhibits concrete interiority through embodied action—tracing patterns in condensation, scavenging a pilot light, tuning it with spoons—and his motivation evolves from mechanical servitude to a stance that refuses the Treasury's demand. Internal contradiction appears when he simultaneously promises "no rebellion, only a recalibration," revealing his compromise with survival. The final choice to walk the bridges with the hatchling and offer the song as metronome is earned by prior causality, though the ending crystallizes stance more than it dramatizes a decisive alteration with sharp cost. Minor deduction for "compromise is merely survival with music," which edges toward diagnostic summary in a peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (bedraggled prince), where (suspended palace on stalactites), and stakes (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical law) within the opening lines. The story accumulates pressure through the egg's discovery, cradle assembly, Keeper demands, refusal, hatching, and song-driven recalibration of the court—one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "tending the cracked cradle we called a palace, teaching our song to breathe onwards" crystallizes the stance with felt cost (the hatchling bears the same compromise, survival with music). Cost is legible on the page in the final image of ongoing, unresolved labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vividly rendered—"chains creaked a lullaby," "the palace rocked as if the stalactites hiccuped"—and the mechanical world (gears, dynamos, piston sighs, Throne of Bearings) is filtered through the prince's priorities. The cradle of brass ribs and mica windows, the pilot light tuned with spoons, and the grate behind the throne all constrain on-page choices. The final image charges when "the palace seemed to lower its shoulders, the stalactites less like teeth, more like roots remembering the patience of earth," linking environment to closure reconfiguration. Sensory selection reflects urgency throughout, though some descriptions (lime dust, condensation) anchor atmosphere more than they alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs. mechanical law—is signaled early and tightens when the Keepers demand the egg and the prince refuses, forecloses obedience with visible relational cost. The egg quickens, hatches into a hybrid creature, and its song silences the Keepers' anger, recalibrating the court. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens: the discovery, assembly, refusal, hatching, and song-driven stand each narrow options. Agency is clear in the refusal ("because refusal was the only prayer I had left") and the final offer of the song as metronome. Minor gap: the Keepers' clamps and laws vanish after the song threads their helmets without further dramatized consequence or visible trade-off in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—flawed genesis, the lie of the first bird choosing the cage, beauty naming fractures without repairing them—emerges through concrete particulars: the egg, the cradle, the hatchling's hybrid form, and the tapping code that "felt like apology." The final image of tending "the cracked cradle we called a palace, teaching our song to breathe onwards" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in "compromise is merely survival with music" and the repeated motif of mechanical coronation versus organic breath. No thematic drift or echo; the ending reweights "we would move forward through the discovery" as acceptance of the fracture-map rather than utopian repair. Minor deduction for one phrase that edges toward thesis ("beauty could repair nothing, yet it could name every fracture until the fractures formed a map").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: "I told it how the first engines rose from water tables like lilies, a coronation nobody believed was theft." Diction remains consistent—elevated, lyric, mechanical-pastoral—and rhythmic control modulates with pressure (short, staccato clauses during the hatching, longer cadences in reflection). Purposeful compression ("We had been born from engines, crowned by an absence") and non-standard syntax ("the hush where a newborn should wail, the missing midwife") are pattern-taught and legible. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb stacks ("I understood then," "I could not claim") that dull immediacy in peak beats, and one phrase ("I told it") that repeats across three consecutive lines without functional variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high ("Its weight tilted my palm toward the abyss, as if the future tugged the wrist like a patient teacher"), and many lines do multiple jobs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Deductions: paraphrase loop in "I told it how the first engines rose… I told it how every blossom afterward carried a gear… I told it how" (three consecutive stems; −0.5). Mixed metaphor: "the song of oil has harmonies that gnaw, and in the gnawing I heard the crackle of our origin" conflates auditory registers without clear vehicle logic (−0.3). Stock metaphor: "chains creaked a lullaby" is serviceable but not fresh. No loops touch closure, so caps are not triggered, but cumulative line-level debt prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk palace, extinct bird's egg, and flawed-genesis myth feels specific and non-obvious; the hatchling's hybrid form (not wholly metal, not wholly meat) and the song that "threaded their helmets and tuned their anger into silence" offer fresh inflections. The transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would collapse the mechanical-versus-organic tension that drives the arc. Risk-taking in lyric mode and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band). Minor deduction: the palace-on-stalactites and egg-cradle setup leans on familiar fantasy tropes (hidden relic, royal refusal of unjust law), and the final recalibration via song edges toward symbolic convenience without fully dramatizing the Keepers' capitulation or the court's material shift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bedraggled prince is present early, makes key choices (refuses the Keepers, assembles the cradle, offers the song as metronome), and his decisions alter tactics at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is clear in the refusal and the final walk across bridges. Minor deduction: the prince's observation often leads action, but the final stance is more crystallization than a sharp turn, and some beats (tracing patterns, mapping tremors) observe without immediate decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The extinct bird's egg is discovered early, handled across multiple beats (cradle assembly, quickening, hatching), and its hybrid hatchling drives the closure reconfiguration. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The egg's warmth ("warm as a moth caught between pages of scripture") and tapping code constrain the prince's choices and enable the final song. Specificity is high: the shell "veined like frost" and the lattice of delicate springs under membranes are irreplaceable details. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the hatchling's song charges the ending image. Minor gap: the egg itself becomes passive after hatching; the hatchling does the closure work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Flawed genesis is signaled early ("every hinge groaned a confession of flawed genesis") and shapes stakes throughout: the lie that "the first bird chose the cage," the coronation "nobody believed was theft," the parade of brass "pretending to be the god of light." The concept constrains the prince's refusal and informs the hatchling's hybrid form as living proof of the compromise. Closure participation is strong: "tending the cracked cradle we called a palace" reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Minor deduction: the concept operates more as thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint in middle beats; it charges closure but does not narrow options mid-story as sharply as the Keepers' demand does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Bitterly sweet" appears once as a label ("the chains creaked a lullaby almost bitterly sweet") without constraining a choice or enabling an action with cost. The tone is present throughout—melancholy reverence mixed with mechanical dread—but the specific phrase is ornamental. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates are not. The attribute does not drive beats or alter tactics. Lyric reprise is absent. Score reflects functional presence without causal pressure or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Assemble is signaled early ("I began to assemble a cradle of brass ribs, mica windows, and cloth stolen from my mother's winter cloak") and drives multiple beats: scavenging the pilot light, tuning it with spoons, telling the egg the names of vanished winds. The action enables the egg's hatching and the hatchling's song, which reconfigures the court at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is high; the cradle's mechanics (heat enough to mimic breath) matter. Minor deduction: the final beats emphasize the hatchling's song more than the assembly itself, so the action's closure charge is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hypothesizing about everything" is stated once ("My method, if it could be called a method, was simply hypothesizing about everything until the clatter admitted quiet") but its mechanics are not dramatized in scene. The prince traces patterns, maps tremors, compares arias—actions that show observation and synthesis—but "hypothesizing" as a distinct method does not constrain a choice or shape the hatching. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates are not. The method is label-only and swappable with "experimenting" or "searching." Score reflects presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites is vividly present early and throughout. The setting constrains choices: the grate behind the Throne of Bearings hides the egg, the kitchen furnaces supply the pilot light, the bridges are walked at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The palace's rocking and the stalactites' shift from "teeth" to "roots" charge the final image. Causal pressure is moderate; the setting supplies resources and atmosphere more than it narrows options under stress. Strong closure linkage and specificity lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through the discovery" is signaled in the title and frames the arc: finding the egg, assembling the cradle, discovering heat mimics breath, and the hatching. The timeframe is present across beats and shapes the ending ("We would move forward through the discovery"). Setup and payoff gates are met; development is moderate (time does not tighten decisions sharply in the middle). The frame is more conceptual than tactical; no live clock alters moves. Lyric reprise in the final line ("teaching our song to breathe onwards") reweights the stake. Score reflects solid integration without high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is signaled early ("To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world became the whisper I did not dare tell the dynamos or servants") and drives the prince's refusal, cradle assembly, and final offer of the song as metronome. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The desire is dramatized in conflicted choices: "refusal was the only prayer I had left that did not use a spring as scripture." Friction between the want (beauty) and cost (compromise, survival with music) is visible. Strong closure linkage: "We would move forward through the discovery, tending the cracked cradle we called a palace, teaching our song to breathe onwards." Minor gap: the motivation is stated more often than it constrains tactical choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is present from the opening ("I moved in a quaking reverie, a waking dream punctured by piston sighs") and modulates with pressure: contemplative during assembly, tense during the Keepers' arrival, reverent at the hatching. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image ("my reverie steadied enough to kneel"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone constrains perception (dream-state language, lyric compression) and supports the accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the tone is more atmospheric than causally necessary; swapping it for "quiet dread" would not break story logic, though it would flatten the lyric texture.</comment>
