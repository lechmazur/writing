<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and contradictory—testing calibrated knees, looping the strap around the wrist without tightening, reading trauma responses as archive. Embodied trauma (wrists twisting apart, ribs clenching) drives micro-choices and the final boundary act of leaving the strap behind is earned by prior pressure. Minor deduction: the proprioceptive enhancement remains mostly a label rather than forcing on-page tradeoffs that constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through sensory density, trauma-response beats, and the recurring pewter strap, culminating in a conceptual repricing when the protagonist articulates "mercy equals intention weighted by injury" and leaves the strap as a boundary condition. The closure reweights prior material with visible cost (relinquishment, walking toward "survivable" dark). Orientation anchors (ultraviolet forest, post-anesthesia) arrive early. One micro turn (discovering the strap, then reversing path) supports the dominant escalation without fragmenting the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest constrains movement (liturgical maze, corridors of reeds), the pewter strap charges the final image, and proprioceptive nerves filter perception ("distances between tendons"). The pool's stillness and the strap dripping a circle anchor the climactic equation. Sensory hierarchy (bruised humming pollen, iron taste, moss smell) reflects trauma-survivor urgency. Minor slip: the camera/beetle blink lacks full integration into the choice sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and tightened through the strap discovery, the recursive path, and the poolside equation. Agency is clear: protagonist names stars under interrogation (past), tests proprioceptive calibrations, walks backward in recursion, and relinquishes the strap with visible cost. One meaningful deepening (equation as working tool, not proof) narrows options and forecloses full closure. The coincidence of finding the strap complicates but does not resolve; the choice to leave it behind does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the pewter strap's etched numbers, the pool's reflection, the equation "mercy equals intention weighted by injury, divided by power relinquished." The protagonist's renunciation of the strap and the shift from "instrument" to "survivable" answers the central question without moralizing. The mathematics frame charges recursion and the penance maze with conceptual weight. Final image (wrapping strap around branch, walking toward less-blue dark) is non-literal and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "ultraviolet penance," "archive I trust, because it never stops to polish its entries," "equations are the only prayers I was taught to trust." Perceptual signature (proprioceptive distances, shiver writing dates on bones) remains consistent under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during trauma responses, further during theorem work). No head-hopping; elision of interrogation details is purposeful and paid off through trauma-response beats. Single minor slip: "displaced rooted" phrase feels slightly imposed rather than organic to the narrator's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character (trauma archive), setting (pollen hum), or theorem. Rhythm modulates (short clauses during trauma spasms, longer syntactic arcs during reflection). Zero paraphrase loops; figurative language (echolocation unfolding, shiver writing date) is coherent and sparse. Minor deduction: two adjacent lines near the pool ("I lean over and the water gives me a face I do not fully trust, a face that survived because it learned to impersonate stone") edge toward metaphor stacking without full payoff in the next beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mathematics-of-mercy frame and proprioceptive enhancement are fresh angles on trauma recovery. The pewter strap's recursive numbering and the ultraviolet penance maze integrate organically. The equation ("mercy equals intention weighted by injury, divided by power relinquished") feels earned rather than imposed. Risk-taking (scientific metaphor threaded through somatic trauma, equation as prayer) heightens stakes. Minor deduction: the "ultraviolet penance" and "displaced rooted" phrasing occasionally read as prompt echoes rather than fully transformed particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Enhanced interrogation survivor frames all choices: testing calibrations, freezing at trauma triggers, naming stars under duress, wrapping the strap as boundary condition. Present in setup, middle (trauma responses constrain path), and closure (relinquishment to avoid becoming instrument). The trait drives at least three beats and charges the final image with irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pewter mask strap appears in setup (half-buried discovery), middle (looped around wrist to mark comfort/compulsion boundary, numbers match recursive path), and closure (wrapped around branch as boundary condition, dripping circle for equation). Handled across three beats, causally active, and reweighted at the end. Specificity (teeth, etched numbers, fingerprint memory) matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is the maze's purpose ("you walk until your memories stop flinching") and shapes the protagonist's goal (test and tutor). It pressures the middle walk and recursive proof. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but does not constrain a specific mid-scene choice as directly as the strap or proprioceptive trait. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced nerves filter perception ("distances between tendons," "angles," echolocation unfolding) and enable the recursive walk. Present in setup, middle reflection, and final approach. However, the trait does not force a visible tradeoff or constrain a choice with cost on the page; it remains largely a perceptual lens rather than a limiting factor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Brace" anchors the protagonist's first physical action (testing calibrations against knotted trunk) and recurs implicitly in the backward walk. It signals embodied agency early and ties to the proprioceptive enhancement. Present in setup and middle, but the final turn (leaving the strap) does not trace directly to bracing. Mid-high band for early causal work without full closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Remembering through trauma responses" is the protagonist's stated method ("the only archive I trust"), shapes the discovery beat (wrists twisting, ribs clenching), and enables reading the strap's meaning. It appears in setup, middle (camera/beetle blink triggers wave), and informs the closure choice (relinquishing the strap to avoid remaining an instrument). Causal across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest constrains movement (maze, corridors, clearing), supplies the pool for the equation, and the branch for the strap's final placement. Sensory details (pollen hum, moss, reeds) filter trauma responses. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure anchor. The environment enables and charges the final image with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening moment (iron taste, proprioceptive testing) and implies recent surgery. It sets the disoriented start but does not tighten decisions or tactics later; the maze walk unfolds without a live clock. Present in setup, minimal development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To discover the mathematics of mercy" is stated early ("the theorem I came here to prove"), drives the recursive walk, and culminates in the poolside equation with visible cost (relinquishment, shift to "working tool"). Desire faces friction (trauma responses, imperfect proof) and the final choice reflects the incompleteness. Causal across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Displaced rooted" (living where seed was thrown) appears explicitly mid-story and modulates tone: disorientation at waking, forensic calm during theorem work, charged poise at pool. The phrase itself feels slightly imposed, but the effect—unmoored yet searching for anchor—coheres through syntax shifts and the final walk toward "ordinary, which is to say survivable." Tone charges the final image without full inevitability.</comment>
