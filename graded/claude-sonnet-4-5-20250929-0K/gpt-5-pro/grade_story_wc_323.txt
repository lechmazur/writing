<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The navigation instructor's motivation is clear and specific—learning to navigate by starlight from beneath the sea—and drives consistent choices throughout. Interiority is embodied through concrete details (the chain link as anchor for "shaking thoughts," Inea breathing "as if she will break"). The instructor's petition to the council and the careful weeks of practice show agency under pressure. However, the emotional progression remains somewhat steady rather than contradictory; the instructor's resolve never wavers or fragments under the weight of risk, missing the layered complexity that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien contact, teaching edge geometry. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of detail, the petition gaining "a narrow yes," weeks of practice, until the final ascent that validates the method. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the submersibles rise "by that chart" as "the city behind us hums farewell like a solemn, answering star," reconfiguring the relationship between benthic isolation and stellar navigation with felt cost (the risk, the careful timing, the farewell). The cost is conceptual and relational rather than a lost limb, but the final image makes the stakes undeniable. One meaningful deepening—petition to ascent—is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The benthic city is vividly particular: domes that "hum like a held breath," corridors ringing "like filtered bells," a cracked dome patched "to a scumble that catches light." The projector and chain link function as micro-setting tools that constrain the method. The monorail terminus dome and the pressure gap above the ridge supply spatial constraints that shape the ascent route. The setting charges the final image—rising through water toward starlight—but does not force a mid-story tactical pivot, keeping it just below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving edge geometry can navigate from the benthic city to the surface—is signaled early and drives all moves. The council's narrow approval narrows options; weeks of practice add caution as cost; the timed ascent through the pressure gap raises physical risk. Agency is clear: the instructor petitions, drafts the route, practices, and leads the ascent. The final act (rising by the chart) forecloses the alternative of remaining blind beneath the sea, with the conceptual cost of leaving the safety of darkness. The escalation is steady accumulation rather than a sharp reversal, and while the price is felt, it remains more conceptual than visceral—enough for strong 7s but shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—navigating by what cannot be seen, orientation through loss and edges—emerges organically from the instructor's petition, the edge geometry method, and the chain link as "omen and a zero." "Edges are instruments, and the night can be heard even through stone" and the closing image of the city humming "like a solemn, answering star" reweight the premise without stating a moral. The instructor's teaching that "a circle asks for a sky" is thematically resonant but borders on direct statement; the piece earns resonance through image (the chain link warming, the ellipse appearing) rather than assertion. No mechanical theme summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: nautical diction ("benthic," "scumble," "trawler," "monorail's western terminus"), filtered-bell atmosphere, and the instructor's careful, patient rhythm. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate at the desk with the chain link, wider when describing the council or the ascent. Inea's whispered star names provide brief dialogue that advances plot and reveals her interior state. The prose occasionally leans into elevated registry ("arithmetic of need," "scale the world") that fits the instructor's voice but risks slight uniformity across emotional beats. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I feel") appear sparingly and remain voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propels: "We built our domes hard and clear after discovering aliens" contrasts with the longer, accretive "As the beam threads the ring, we expand the field slowly…" Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: the sea as "cathedral," stars that "speak," plankton "like pixels." Minor muddle: "where light loses patience" mixes agency oddly with the inanimate. A handful of scaffold phrases recur: "the chain link" appears in proximity without always doing new work, and "somber," "pressure," "edges" cycle. Paraphrase loop: "teaching our hands to read the ring's edge and the city's hum" echoes prior descriptions without added pressure. No loops touch the closure beat. Information density is high; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—edge geometry taught by aliens, applied to stellar navigation from a benthic city via a boat chain link as projector collar—feels specific and purposeful rather than generic. The instructor's dual heritage (deck child's child, now benthic teacher) and Inea's past as a methane-vent fisher add non-obvious texture. The voice and world cohere without quirk for its own sake. However, the core "hidden enclave rediscovering the sky" template is widely used in speculative fiction, and while the nautical-geometric angle transforms it, the emotional arc (petition → practice → ascent) follows a familiar shape. Risk-taking in prose and structure is moderate; the piece commits fully to its premise without radical formal choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The navigation instructor is present throughout, makes the key decision to petition the council, drafts the route, leads weeks of practice, and commands the ascent. These choices create all major turns: petition → narrow yes, practice → confidence, ascent → validation. The instructor appears in setup, middle, and ending. Causal pressure is strong; the trait shapes tactics (patience, careful mapping). Cost is conceptual (risk of the ascent, leaving the city's safety). Slight swappability: another teacher-advocate role could serve similar beats with edits, but the nautical lineage ("deck child's child," the trawler chain link) ties this character to the specific world.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The boat anchor chain link is introduced early ("On my desk sits…"), used in class as the projector collar ("I fit the boat anchor chain link onto the collar"), warms during the ascent ("the chain link rings softly when it warms"), and the instructor carries it ("I walk the city with the chain link in my pocket"). Three beats: desk/memory, classroom demonstration, ascent. It constrains the method (a "perfect circle" for the projector) and charges the ending (ringing as the chart appears). The link's specific origin—father's last trawler—adds irreplaceability. Cost linkage is strong: it anchors shaking thoughts and symbolizes the transition from surface to benthic life. Swappability is low; a generic ring would lack the nautical resonance and familial weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" names the core technology ("the work we named unfolded horizons for how it rescued distance from curve") and the concept shapes all tactics: expanding the projector field slowly, marking angles, unfolding the sphere to solve orientation. The method drives the middle (practice weeks) and ending (ascending by the chart). Early signal: appears by first third. Development: dictates how the instructor practices and petitions. Payoff: the ascent succeeds because "the horizon in our room lies flat as faith." Causal pressure is high; removing this concept would collapse the plot. Specificity is strong: "rescued distance from curve" and "the limb of a real star translated by water" are irreplaceable. Cost: weeks of patient practice and the narrow council approval.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is stated once ("I am balancedly curious") but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page choice with cost. The instructor's curiosity is evident in the desire to learn stellar navigation and the teaching method, but the "balanced" qualifier does not create friction or force a trade-off. The trait could be inferred from behavior (patient practice, careful petition) without the label. It does not return at closure or alter tactics under pressure. Present in setup but absent in development and payoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "expand" is central: "we expand the field slowly, because edge geometry punishes haste," "expand our habitation domes into the trench" (the council's plan), and the instructor's counter-move to "turn some eyes upward and outward." The petition to expand observation rather than habitation creates the key turn. The slow expansion of the projector field during practice is the method's core move. The ascent executes the expansion vertically through the pressure gap. Early signal, drives two beats (petition and practice), and shapes the ending (rising by the expanded chart). Removing "expand" would require a different verb and concept. Causal pressure and cost (patience, risk) are clear. Minor swappability: "extend" or "widen" could substitute in some lines, but "expand the field" is mechanically specific.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is introduced early ("The aliens taught a method they called edge geometry"), its mechanics explained ("the world is found…along the joined breaks"), and used throughout: the projector and chain link reveal "a halo of grain, then lines, then latitudes," Inea marks angles, and the instructor drafts a route by measuring intersections. The method dictates all middle beats (weeks of practice, "teaching our hands to read the ring's edge") and enables the ascent ("we rise by that chart"). Early signal, constrains attempts, and is indispensable at closure. Specificity is high: "edges do not lie" and "measuring their tilt" are unique to this technique. Cost: the method "punishes haste" and requires patient mastery. Swappability is very low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The benthic city is introduced immediately, provides the central constraint (navigating "from beneath this blind and utter weight"), and supplies the council's pressure (wanting to expand into the trench vs. the instructor's upward petition). The setting shapes the instructor's tactics: using a cracked dome at the monorail terminus, timing the ascent with "the moon's pull and the continental breathing," and the final image of the city humming farewell. Early signal, active in middle (council debate, practice location), and charges the ending (leaving the hum behind). Specificity is strong: "domes condense like tears along their ribs," "methane vents," "geothermal stacks." Cost: the risk of leaving the safety of depth. Minor swappability: an orbital station or mountain fortress could serve similar isolation with edits, but the nautical and pressure details are benthic-specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is stated early ("after discovering aliens, because their quiet arrival made us see") and provides backstory motive: the aliens taught edge geometry, then left, prompting the city's isolation and the instructor's desire to reclaim stellar navigation. The timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions—no countdown or urgent deadline tied to the aliens' departure. The ascent's timing ("when the moon's pull and the continental breathing cancel") is a tactical clock but unrelated to the alien discovery. Early signal, shapes motive, but does not constrain middle choices or reappear at closure. Lyric reprise: the aliens' "proof remains" and the city hums "like a solemn, answering star," reweighting the post-contact era. Functional but not indispensable; swappable with "after a disaster" or "after losing the surface" with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn to navigate by starlight, even from beneath this blind and utter weight" is stated early ("my motive has not changed since I was a deck child's child") and drives every choice: teaching edge geometry, petitioning the council, drafting the ascent route, and leading the submersibles up. The desire is in friction with the council's preference for deeper safety and the physical danger of the ascent. Early signal, constrains middle beats (weeks of practice to earn the skill), and is fulfilled at closure ("we rise by that chart, slow and careful, enough to spy the surface sky speak"). Cost is visible: risk, patience, and the farewell to the city's hum. Specificity is high: "by starlight" and "from beneath" are irreplaceable anchors. Minor swappability: "reclaim the sky" could substitute with edits, but the stellar navigation focus is specific to the instructor's heritage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is established immediately ("the sea turned cathedral, full of somber marvel that pressed and rang") and maintained throughout: the aliens' "quiet arrival," the instructor's balanced curiosity without rebellion, Inea breathing "as if she will break," the council's "narrow yes, more a sigh than a cheer," and the ending where "the domes condense like tears" and the city hums "solemn." The tone modulates with pressure—reverent during teaching, tense during petition, charged at the ascent—without breaking into triumph or despair. The tone charges the final image: the farewell hum is "solemn, answering," not celebratory. Coherent through all turns. Specificity is strong: "somber" + "marvel" balances weight and wonder. Swappability is low; "melancholy awe" could approximate but would lose the cathedral/filtered-bells texture.</comment>
