<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist shows clear interiority through purposeful micro-choices: winding the Archivist, building the ritual model, refusing to "take" from the shadows. The renunciation at closure—"relearn my own craft through what I now refuse to take"—is earned by prior causality and forecloses extraction with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "a light weight leaves my ribs," though some passages lean toward label-speak ("my patience has teeth"). The consistent trait of deliberate, non-extractive witness drives key beats and the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (rune scholar), where (observatory), and the altered-reality context by the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual layering (polish lenses, lace pathways, scratch runes), and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist shifts from seeking extraction to practicing humility, with cost legible in the refusal and the ribbon-seal. One meaningful deepening (discovery that shadows rehearse return) tightens the stake. The causal chain holds under this lens, and the closure image reweights the opening question with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory, brass rails, telescope shaft, and sealed pods constrain choices throughout: the isle's buoyancy depends on shadow-fuel, the corridor of pods blocks direct extraction, and the brass floor provides the ritual substrate. The clockwork key and copper pathways function as micro-setting elements that charge the final act. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("blackened like burned tea," "gears ratchating like rain"). The environment actively shapes the ritual method and the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained to closure. The tightening occurs when the Archivist warns against prying and the protagonist must honor the circuit by building a model that "eats only its own tail," narrowing options from extraction to respectful witness. The final choice to "close the ring and thank them" forecloses taking and stabilizes the isle, with cost legible in the renunciation of shortcuts. One meaningful deepening (shadows as teachers) reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—humility as the shortest circle, witness without theft—emerges organically from the ritual acts and the shadow-rehearsal revelation. The returning loop motif (circular lenses, ring pathways, closing loops) accumulates pressure and charges the closure without overt statement. The final image, "trust it to come back with better aim," offers a resonant answer to the opening question by reweighting extraction as collaboration. Subtext operates in the Archivist's warnings and the protagonist's confession; no moralizing intrudes. The piece earns quiet wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision layered with poetic compression ("spoons bend reality," "buoyant night," "patience has teeth"). Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's lexicon—runes, orbits, calibration—fits the role. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure, though phrases like "my patience has teeth" and "shortest circle" flirt with aphorism. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Rhythmic control supports the ritual cadence without algorithmic repetition. Dialogue is absent, appropriately so for solitary ritual work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance ritual logic, world rules, or thematic charge. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm breathes with the ritual stages. Minor figurative density in passages like "a bowl of noon that pools with lost silhouettes" and "smallest consent click" borders on overwriting but remains legible and voice-integrated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. A few aphoristic constructions ("humility is the shortest circle") risk register drift, but the closure image is clean. Proofreading is solid; grammar and punctuation are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of shadow-as-teacher, ritual closure, and buoyancy-through-absence is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of a familiar quest (where do shadows go?) into a lesson about humility and rehearsal feels inevitable in hindsight. The lyric-technical voice and the "sealed awakenings" conceit avoid stock fantasy tropes. Risk-taking in the compressed, ritual-paced structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's restraint—refusing to extract—offers a fresh moral calculus. Premise transformation is evident; the piece commits fully to its implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The budding rune scholar frames the opening, makes the key decision to wind the Archivist (paragraph 10), builds the ritual model (paragraph 20), and closes the loop at the ending with visible renunciation. The character's choices create the major turns: descent to the sealed pods, construction of the shadow-model, and the final refusal to extract. Present in setup, middle, and closure; irreplaceable to the logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears in paragraph 10 (found and used to wake the Archivist), returns in paragraph 20 as the ritual's axis ("I lay the clockwork automaton key at the center to serve as axis"), and is returned to its hook in paragraph 25. Three distinct beats; causal pressure in two (waking guide, anchoring model); closure linkage indirect but the final ritual depends on it. Specificity high: "teeth sharp as bitten frost."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings are introduced in paragraph 6, become the destination in paragraph 19, and their shadow-fuel mechanism shapes the ritual solution and closure. The concept defines the stake (isle buoyancy depends on them), constrains the method (must not pry), and the protagonist's final act honors their circuit. Present in setup, development, and closure; removing them collapses the logic and theme. Cost connection clear: the caretakers' shadows are the price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is claimed in paragraph 7 and demonstrated in the methodical ritual building (polish, lace, finish prayers; scratch runes, lay key, breathe). The trait constrains the protagonist from forcing entry to the pods and enables the loop-closure method. Present in setup and middle; influences tactics. Cost is implicit: slower method risks continued drift, but respects the circuit. Not strongly irreplaceable; "careful" or "patient" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Relearn" appears in the Archivist's instruction (paragraph 15: "you must relearn what a shadow really is"), drives the shadow-model revelation (paragraph 22: "Shadows go to noon to relearn us"), and anchors the closure vow (paragraph 27: "relearn my own craft through what I now refuse to take"). Three beats; causal pressure moderate (the verb frames the insight but does not mechanically force the turn). Closure linkage strong. Swappability low: "understand" would weaken the recursion theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is seeded in paragraph 7 ("my method...I begin by closing loops"), practiced through circular ritual actions (paragraph 8–9), becomes the Archivist's directive (paragraph 19: "we must respect their circuit by closing loops"), shapes the model construction (paragraph 20: "the loop encloses itself"), and anchors the ending (paragraph 26: "one more loop so the finding binds"). Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure; mechanics matter at every stage. Irreplaceable: the method is the theme. Causal pressure high; cost tied to discipline.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is established in paragraph 1, its buoyancy problem surfaces in paragraph 6 (rumor of sealed awakenings "under the floors"), the isle's dependence on shadow-fuel is revealed in paragraph 18, and the final ritual stabilizes it (paragraph 24: "The island steadies"). The setting supplies the central constraint (altitude depends on shadow-circuit) and the ritual substrate (brass rails, telescope shaft, spiral corridor). Present across all gates; causal pressure solid. Minor swappability: "floating tower" could substitute structurally, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" anchors the altered-world context in paragraph 3, constrains method (compasses sulk, straight edges lie, must use rituals), and the waking dates of the sealed pods "end on the day the spoons bent" (paragraph 19), linking the timeframe to the caretaker sacrifice. Present in setup and middle; shapes world rules. Closure participation weak: the bent-spoon moment is backstory, not live pressure. Lyric reprise absent. Functional but not indispensable to the ending's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find where shadows go at noon"—is declared in paragraph 4, restated to the Archivist in paragraph 14 ("You seek the noonward drain of shade"), drives the ritual construction to answer it (paragraph 22: "Shadows go to noon to relearn us"), and is satisfied at closure with visible cost (paragraph 23: renunciation of extraction; paragraph 28: welcoming the shadow's return). Present in setup, escalation, and closure; causal pressure high; cost legible (the protagonist abandons taking for witness). Irreplaceable to the arc.</comment>
