<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's internal state is rendered through specific sensory anchors (chafed palms, cold steadying breath) and his actions demonstrate purposeful expertise rather than generic competence. His motivation to learn "the rhythm of repair" drives choices at each step, and the final instruction he leaves is earned by the work shown. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract—terms like "the art of teaching a hurt how to keep moving" read as thematic gloss rather than embodied contradiction, and we never see him genuinely struggle or make a mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the locksmith gathers fragments of prophecy, applies oil, arranges gears, speaks quietly to the frost, and the hall of mirrors wakes in response—a density increase that reweights the dominant stake (repair) with palpable cost (patience, listening, the forfeit of triumph for "a listening"). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the machine wakes; the library breathes) with visible cost in the final instruction and the departure "carrying not triumph but a listening." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when he fits the smallest wheel and the mirror brightens, then the final arrangement crowns the floor and the machine responds—sufficient tightening for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library is vivid and purposeful: hoarfrost glazes corridors, stairwells ring like goblets, the hall of mirrors is hauntingly bright and layered like dawn. The setting constrains his work (frost must not be startled; hinges trap silence) and charges the closure image ("the library hovered like a lantern fuller than night"). Micro-setting elements—the canvas roll, the small bottle of oil, the gears with moons—function as tactile anchors that ground abstract action. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the scent of brass and pine, the chime drifting through stacks, and maps that breathe all support the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning and enacting the rhythm of repair) is signaled early and maintained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: reading scraps of prophecy → uncapping oil → arranging gears → speaking to the frost → the machine wakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lockwork ticks then falters, "asking for a story," and he must shift tactic from mechanical work to narrative offering. Cost is legible in "the art of teaching a hurt how to keep moving" and his departure carrying "not triumph but a listening," which forecloses the option of mastery-as-conquest. The piece delivers the required deepening for this length, though escalation remains contemplative rather than viscerally pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—repair as patient listening, the kindness of shadow, hurt learning to keep moving—emerges through concrete particulars: the oil that remembers ship decks, gears etched with moons, the instruction "listen to breaks the way sailors listen to fog." The final image (library as lantern, morning not yet warm, carrying a listening) answers the thematic question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the quiet voice he uses, the tears the mirrors wipe that "his eyes had not yet assembled," and theNote he leaves weighted by a gear for "whoever arrives next with pockets full of winter." The closure reweights prior material—eclipses teach patience, doors trust hands—without summary or sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric diction ("driftwood nostalgia," "buoy in cloud tides," "commas" as punctuation for time), purposeful compression, and a perceptual signature that notices maritime and clockwork metaphors throughout. No dialogue is present; interiority is filtered through poetic register that matches the elevated concept. Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. However, some formulations verge on ornamental ("the unhurried knowledge he had come seeking") and syntactic variety could be tighter—many sentences open with subject-verb or "He [verb]" patterns under pressure, creating mild template cadence in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence layers metaphor (hoarfrost, goblets, buoys, chalked names, gulls, harbors). While many images are evocative and voice-consistent, the sheer accumulation without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure risks overwriting—"palms chafed by wind that smelled like old tin and rain," "stacks answered with a hush that felt like driftwood nostalgia," "chime drifted up through the stacks like a buoy in cloud tides" cluster without a unifying vehicle or physical grounding. Template cadence appears in runs: "He searched… then knelt… He read… He took… He fit…" Template-cadence penalty (−0.5) and density without anchor (−0.4) apply. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, and information density is solid, but the relentless metaphor accumulation in high-pressure beats lowers momentum and triggers the overwriting check.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar-eclipse locksmith + frozen library + hall-of-mirrors-as-machine + maritime/clockwork metaphor feels purposeful and non-obvious. The transformation of "locksmith" from dark-door-opener to patient listener is specific, and the detail (oil that remembers ship decks, gears etched with moons) anchors the fantastical premise. The final instruction and the leaving-with-a-listening offer a fresh inflection on repair narratives. However, the elevated poetic register and fantastical elements risk feeling ornamental rather than inevitable, and the story's safety is in its beauty—there is little genuine risk or jagged edge that would elevate ingenuity into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith protagonist is present throughout, drives the central action, and makes key choices: to search the reading rooms, to kneel by the dim shelf, to uncap the oil with mittened care, to fit the smallest wheel, to speak quietly when the lockwork falters, to write the instruction, and to leave carrying a listening rather than triumph. His choices shape the middle (uncapping, arranging, speaking) and the ending (writing the note, departing). Early signal in paragraph 1, beat involvement across search/read/uncap/fit/speak/write, causal pressure (each choice advances repair), and closure linkage (his departure and note are the final acts). Slight swappability (another patient craftsperson could theoretically function) and the abstractness of some choices keep this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment is established early ("set down his clockmaker's gear assortment, the canvas roll creaking"), handled in multiple beats (he recognizes the kit his father left, fits the smallest wheel to a spindle, adjusts the last gear, aligns the crescents, packs the gear with patience, leaves a gear to weight the note), and its properties (gears etched with moons, "chips and crescents and whole commas") matter causally—the smallest wheel brightens the mirror, the last gear alignment triggers the chime. Closure linkage is strong: the final act is packing the tools and leaving one gear as anchor. Specificity and irreplaceability are high (the moons and the father's legacy charge the object). Only minor swappability (another inherited toolkit could serve) prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors is introduced early (paragraph 5), constrains tactics ("a machine that remembered how light used to heal," "needed a locksmith who could count the pauses between gleams and uncap the silence trapped in its hinges without startling the frost"), drives the middle action (he enters it, sees hundreds of reflections, arranges panels to create a ringed shadow), and is causally active at closure (the machine wakes, mirrors rotate to braid pathways, "the hall of mirrors became a soft clock of kindness"). Beat involvement spans introduction, prophecy reading, mirror work, and waking. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Slight reduction for the machine's transformation being more told ("became a soft clock of kindness") than shown in a final image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "hauntingly bright" attribute is established early ("The mirrors were hauntingly bright, each surface a layered dawn that refused to warm") and recurs ("the hauntingly bright walls pulsed"), but its function is primarily atmospheric. It does not clearly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost—he does not, for example, shield his eyes, adjust his approach, or suffer consequence from the brightness. The phrase charges the mirrors' presence and supports tone, but remains closer to label than lever. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff echo) with modest causal work places this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "uncap" action is signaled early in the method fragments ("uncap the silence trapped in its hinges"), prepared when he takes the small bottle and begins to uncap it with mittened care (paragraph 13), and executed when "The seal sighed… and the scent of brass and pine untangled the last knot in his throat" (paragraph 14). This moment shifts the locksmith's state and enables the subsequent mirror work and machine waking. The uncapping is specific (oil that remembers ship decks, the seal's sigh), and a later beat confirms its effect ("breathed, applied the oil, and the lockwork under the mirrors ticked once"). Causal pressure and beat involvement are strong. Minor swappability (another preparatory ritual could serve) and the action being one among several necessary steps (not solely decisive) keep this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" is signaled early (paragraph 8: "knelt by a dim shelf and sifted through scraps of prophecy"), its mechanics matter (paragraph 9: "The fragments spoke as diagrams and remembrances, suggesting that the hall of mirrors was a machine… It needed a locksmith who could count the pauses…"), and it shapes subsequent attempts (paragraph 11: "He read the notation again," paragraph 19: "More fragments of prophecy guided him, not as laws, but as weather notes"). The prophecy constrains his approach (patience, listening) and is present at closure (he writes a new note "near the corner where the prophecies hid"). Beat involvement and causal pressure are solid. Reduction for the prophecy being more infrastructure than irreplaceable—another diagnostic text could serve similar function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is established in the opening line, pressures choices throughout (stairs to climb, rime on doors, corridors glazed in hoarfrost, the risk of startling the frost, the need to listen until cold steadies breath), supplies resources (reading rooms, dim shelf with prophecies, the hall of mirrors as the machine to be repaired), and is causally active at closure ("Books curled their spines, maps breathed, and a ladder dared to thaw"; "the library hovered like a lantern fuller than night"). The setting's cold and silence constrain his method (mittened care, speaking quietly), and its thaw is the visible sign of success. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the library is both problem and solution) all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "under the soft hush of a distant morning" is established (paragraph 12: "It was happening under the soft hush of a distant morning, the hour when mended things decide whether to hold their seams") and recurs at closure (paragraph 32: "the library hovered like a lantern fuller than night, though morning had not learned its own warmth yet"). The morning hour functions as symbolic frame—the liminal time when repair crystallizes—but does not tighten decisions in a live-clock sense (no countdown, no urgent deadline forcing faster moves). The timeframe charges the tone and final image but remains more thematic than tactical. Two-gate presence (setup echo, closure callback) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the rhythm of repair" is established early (paragraph 2) and dramatized through choices: he searches, reads prophecy, uncaps oil, fits gears, speaks to the frost, writes an instruction. The desire is tested when the lockwork falters and asks for a story (paragraph 23), forcing him to offer narrative rather than only mechanical skill—a friction between technique-want and relational cost. Closure links directly: he leaves "carrying not triumph but a listening, and with it the unhurried knowledge he had come seeking," showing the motivation fulfilled but transformed. Beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage are strong. Minor reduction for the internal conflict being contemplative rather than viscerally torn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone "driftwood nostalgia" is established early (paragraph 3: "a hush that felt like driftwood nostalgia rolling in from forgotten coasts") and sustained through maritime/weathered imagery (old hull, harbors, ship decks, gulls, pier, tidewrack, buoy, fog). The tone modulates with pressure—calm description → careful uncapping → quiet speaking → resonant departure—without jarring breaks. It charges the final image: "carrying not triumph but a listening" and the library "like a lantern fuller than night." Coherence and closure linkage are strong. Minor reduction for tonal density verging on static lyricism rather than dynamic modulation that visibly shifts under peak pressure.</comment>
