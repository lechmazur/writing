<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is distinctive and layered—"warm coldness" as restraint, the oath to "aberrant mercy"—and embodied through the tessera handling and the fraught exchange with the patrol leader. Internal contradiction surfaces when the narrator must rename danger to save lives, balancing radical mercy against the leader's title-heavy hunger. The final choice to show steel arms and speak gently earns the stand-down without convenience. Minor slip: the leader's recognition of his mother's fig story feels slightly rushed, but the cost—exposing the narrator's augmented body and oath—lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The plaza tessera seeds early, recurs through retrocognitive visions, and charges the patrol confrontation where renaming becomes tactical necessity. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the leader lowers his rifle, the plaza "tastes like rain making dust into mud," and the narrator renames herself "keeper of soft armored rooms"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (exposure, ongoing vigilance). One meaningful deepening occurs when past-guard and present-leader converge. Orientation anchors are present but delayed slightly; tessera mechanics could be crisper earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky, charred cedar decree, and tessera as seed/door/bell anchor the post-fire plaza vividly. The tessera constrains choice: pressing it to the ground opens retrocognitive images that supply the renaming intelligence the narrator needs. Spatial choreography is clear—broken steps, square fracture-as-question, patrol approach—and the "peeled fruit" sky modulates tone. The arms of "pitted steel and faded scripture" serve as micro-setting that charges the final beat. Sensory selection remains purposeful without catalogue excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the people from the patrol by renaming danger, tested when the leader arrives rifle-ready. Escalation tightens through the tessera-reveal sequence: narrator kneels, speaks the fig-mother story, names "ordinary, ordinary, ordinary" until the leader lowers his weapon—agency and renaming both forecloses the violent path. Cost is visible: the narrator exposes augmented arms and oath, risking capture. The patrol's stand-down is earned by protagonist action under accumulative pressure. One micro turn (leader's mouth shaping lost summer) sets up closure without multiplying reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—mercy outlawed yet living through carriers—emerges organically from the charred decree, tessera visions, and the renaming gambit. The ending image ("I rename myself keeper of soft armored rooms") reweights the premise non-literally: mercy as craft, not ledger arithmetic, and the cost of carrying contraband compassion. Subtext saturates the leader's "weathered warmth" and the narrator's steel arms. No sermon; the story answers its central question (what did we call each other before numbers and masks) through the act of renaming itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person present with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: warm coldness, "a gentle radical," retrocognitive breach. Diction remains character-specific—"tessera as a seed that never learned to sprout," "guilt can be taught to lay down its hands"—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. The brief past-vision of the guard and fig story is anchored in the tessera; the leader's sparse dialogue ("what I am") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: a few elevated metaphors ("peeled fruit" sky) verge on lyric excess but stay voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (tessera as door/padlock, mercy as contraband, arms as steel scripture). No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Figurative language is dense—"sky is a peeled fruit," "time becomes a braid"—and occasionally stacks without full pattern-teaching, risking slight overwriting in the middle third. The closing lines ("I name the blue shard a bell, I name the cracks a map") achieve propulsive resonance. Clarity holds; one scaffold phrase ("people think mercy must fit the ledger") edges toward tell but serves voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of retrocognition-via-artifact, post-fire mercy-as-contraband, and renaming-as-tactical-craft is specific and non-obvious. The tessera's dual nature (light of prayers / dust of names) and the steel-armed narrator pursuing aberrant mercy avoid template arcs. Risk-taking in voice and structure (accumulative, vision-braided) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limit: the "gentle radical" frame and tessera-as-memory-key have speculative-fiction precedents; the story transforms them through lived detail and the cost of exposure, but the synthesis feels strong rather than unprecedented.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gentle radical's oath shapes the dominant stake (save via renaming) and drives the patrol confrontation. Early signal present ("I am a gentle radical"); the kneeling-and-renaming choice alters tactics and earns the stand-down. Closure participation: "I answer gently, a radical who believes guilt can be taught to lay down its hands." Causal pressure across at least two beats. Strong but not indispensable—"mercy-carrier" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minaret mosaic tessera is introduced early ("From the rubble I took"), used in vision-beats ("I press it against the ground, pictures break open"), and causally active in the patrol scene ("I lift the tessera and say his mother taught him"). Returns with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph ("tessera warms against my skin… I name the blue shard a bell"). Three distinct beats; closure linkage strong; specificity (blue, glassy, sharp, holding prayers/dust) matters. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aberrant mercy is the narrator's oath, frames the dominant stake, and shapes on-page tactics: renaming danger to save the wrong person. Dramatized in the confrontation ("mercy can breathe") and charged at closure ("the world will ask for more than this"). Constraint visible: mercy-as-contraband risks punishment. Two beats plus thematic closure. Strong causal pressure. Could score higher if the concept's cost were made more visceral earlier.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Retrocognitively trapped constrains the narrator's method (must use the tessera to access past-knowledge for present renaming) and enables the tactical choice. Present across vision-beats and the patrol moment. Cost: dependency on the artifact and vulnerability during vision. Setup clear, development functional, payoff implicit in the renaming success. Solid but not maximally charged—could be more visceral in constraining movement or attention during the vision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Renaming is the protagonist's core action: the narrator renames danger, grief, and finally herself ("keeper of soft armored rooms"). Major turn traces to renaming the leader's memory and people as "ordinary," which earns the stand-down. Setup early ("rebuild names"), middle development (recipe-from-wound), and closure ("I rename myself"). Causal, specific, and indispensable—swapping for "reframe" or "reinterpret" would break the thematic and tactical logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method (reading via chipped mosaic patterns) is signaled mid-first-third ("I read the past via the chipped patterns") and used in the vision-beats. Mechanics matter: cracks-as-syllables, fracture-as-question guide the intelligence the narrator offers. Shapes the attempt but not maximally dramatized—the stepping-stone could be more tactilely present during the patrol scene. Two beats; closure participation indirect. Solid, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky is established early and pressures every choice: the charred decree, broken steps as stage, the square's fracture-as-question. The setting supplies the tessera and stepping stone that enable retrocognition. Closure participates: "the plaza holds its breath," "the square and the sky have agreed." Spatial choreography clear; the plaza's post-fire state constrains movement and charges tone. Strong setting-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the great fire) anchors context and motive (mercy now contraband) but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The patrol's noon arrival creates mild urgency. Setup strong, development present (the fire's aftermath constrains resources), but no escalating timer pressures the ending. Functional and thematic, not maximally tactical. Mid-band: shapes one turn (patrol arrival) but could constrain harder.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation (cradle empathy in arms of steel) is dramatized through the narrator's oath, the choice to kneel and rename, and the exposure of steel arms at the climax. Friction between the desire to protect and the risk of punishment is visible. Setup early ("sworn not to topple walls but to rebuild names"), middle choice (offer water/stories), closure charge ("soft armored rooms"). Cost legible. Strong causal role across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Warm coldness as tone is introduced early ("warm coldness that settles between ash and wind") and recurs ("a cold that does not cut, a warm coldness grown from restraint"). The oxymoron charges the leader's final gaze and the narrator's restraint-under-pressure. Tone modulates—grief, tactical calm, tentative hope—but remains coherent. Contributes to closure mood ("the plaza and the sky have agreed") without dominating. Solid lyric device; could constrain choice more directly for higher score.</comment>
