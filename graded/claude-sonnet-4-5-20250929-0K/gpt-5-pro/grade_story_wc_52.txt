<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow's interior life is strongly particularized through embodied grief—the wrist ache as memory, the craft as steadying ritual. Her micro-choices (penciling the cage, choosing the door ajar) reflect contradictory impulses: containing without trapping, holding without choking. The renunciation of spectacle for private ritual reads earned, with visible cost in her solitary practice. Minor slip: "useful is not cold" edges toward self-aware thesis statement rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as closure: she forecloses spectacle and accepts ongoing grief transformed into portable ritual. Orientation anchors early (widow, loft, rain, kettle). The piece teaches its pattern of interleaved craft-beats and memory by the first third, holds the lens throughout, and the final image—pocketing the cage, drinking the lesson—reweights "here and gone" with undeniable cost (permanent loss balanced by portable memorial). One meaningful deepening occurs when she places mane and crystal inside the carved cage, crystallizing the dominant stake of shaping loss into livable form.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The loft setting (skylight, stove, bench, rain) constrains and enables throughout: the kettle marks time, the ash blank receives her attention, sawdust becomes textural witness. The carved cage—a micro-object functioning as setting—charges the final image by becoming the portable container she pockets. Rain modulates from "soft" to "darker, more insistent" to final "threading," tracking emotional pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects craft priorities: scent of ash "dry and green as unfinished thunder," steam "like tigers pacing in fog." All details filter through her trained attention as lion tamer's widow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shaping grief into livable form without trapping memory—is signaled early and tightens through the craft sequence. Agency is renunciation and endurance: she refuses spectacle, chooses the door ajar, practices the steadying her husband taught. The escalation is textural: each shaving writes a path, the door clicks on its hinge, the loop and crystal go inside. The cost is legible on the page: permanent solitude, the ache in her wrist, the choice to carry him "here and gone" rather than fixed. One reversal: the cage becomes not a trap but a home that opens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—containment without capture, memory that breathes—emerges through craft particulars (ribs, door ajar, loop coiled in the teacup) rather than statement. "Here and gone" reweights across the text: from loss to a trick of balance, from terror to a leash you do not see. The final image offers a resonant answer: she pockets the cage and "tends the small animal of living," reweighting grief as portable and ongoing rather than concluded. The piece resists moralizing; the widow's wisdom is embodied in gouge-work and the refusal to pin what she loves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: diction compressed and imagistic ("rust-hued peace like old steel," "thin animal nosing the air"), syntax that braids present craft with past instruction without summary. POV distance is stable; certainty matches what she can know. Psychic modulation works: calm precision during carving, sharper intimacy when memory intrudes ("He laughed like a drum under canvas"). Minor pattern debt: "here and gone" recurs seven times, bordering on mantra; the repetition is purposeful but risks over-cuing the thematic spine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("sugar that time turned to ridged crystals, wintered into itself"). Information density is high: most lines do double work (craft action + emotional charge). Two loop issues lower the score: "here and gone" appears in seven lines, crossing from motif into churn; "hauntingly practical" used twice in identical phrasing feels like a safety anchor rather than voice necessity. The kettle's "thin animal nosing the air" and tea "like tigers pacing in fog" are vivid, but the animal metaphor stack in adjacent beats risks decorative density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief as craft project, the carved cage as portable memorial—feels specific and non-obvious. The widow's occupation (lion tamer's assistant by inference) and her transfer of animal-tending attention to self-steadying offer fresh inflection on mourning narratives. Risk: the lyric compression and metaphor density heighten stakes without obscuring the dominant arc. Tether: the "here and gone" refrain and "hauntingly practical" repetition edge toward template reliance, suggesting the piece may be working from a thematic checklist rather than discovering its wisdom through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (paragraph one), drives middle choices (carving ribs, choosing door ajar, placing mane inside), and shapes closure (pocketing the cage, drinking the lesson). Her occupation as widow and former assistant informs every micro-choice: steadiness learned beside cages, attention as leash. The cost—solitary ritual, permanent loss transformed into portable memorial—is tied directly to her identity. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early ("sets an ash wood carving blank"), transformed across multiple beats (penciling, gouging, polishing, clicking the hinge), and active at closure (she pockets the finished cage). The blank's evolution from "pale as a tame shoulder" to functional container mirrors her transformation of grief. Specificity matters: ash wood (not oak, not pine) carries scent "dry and green as unfinished thunder." Removing this object collapses the central action and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is seeded in paragraph two, constrains her method (cage door ajar, not trapping), and charges closure ("he is here and gone, and she is here and going, and both truths can walk together"). The concept shapes her stake: memory that breathes versus memory that suffocates. It alters tactics: she chooses incompleteness (door ajar, loop loose) over fixity. The cost—accepting impermanence as ongoing rather than resolved—is legible in the final image. High integration, though the seven-fold repetition risks over-cuing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is used twice as a label and thematically threaded (craft as blanket, useful weight, steadying without breaking). It constrains one key choice: she turns sorrow into craft rather than spectacle, prioritizing function over display. The cost—solitude, no audience—ties to this trait. However, the phrase appears identically twice ("hauntingly practical" in paragraphs 6 and 29), suggesting checklist insertion rather than organic emergence. Mid-high band: causal but less irreplaceable than stronger elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Contain" is the verb governing her entire project: she carves a cage to contain without trapping, places loop and crystal inside, pockets the result. The action drives setup (blank as promise to contain), middle escalation (ribs and door shaped to hold breath and memory), and closure (she carries the cage, containing him "here and gone"). The specificity—containment that opens—differentiates this from generic "remember" or "preserve." Removing this action collapses both structure and theme. Strong irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" is seeded early (sugar turned to ridged crystals, he stirred tea saying "sweet things last longer"), mechanically matters (she places the crystal in the cage), and charges closure ("remember through crystallized time"). The method shapes one tactic: using preserved sweetness as slow-dissolving memorial. However, the mechanism is more metaphorical than functional—removing it would not break the cage's construction or her ability to carry it. Present in all three gates, but mid-band due to replaceability with another token object.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The loft is anchored early (rain-beaded skylight, two-ring stove, bench, shelf) and recurs throughout (skylight threading rain, kettle on stove, window as final perch). Setting enables her work (bench holds blank, stove heats kettle) and mirrors emotional weather (rain modulates from soft to insistent to calm). The skylight's rain-beading charges the final image ("rain threads the skylight"). However, a generic workshop would serve most functions; the skylight's specificity matters more for tone than constraint. Strong presence and reprise; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The kettle is introduced in paragraph three, mentioned intermittently (hums, climbs toward whistle, finally cries), and resolved when she pours and drinks. It provides a loose clock (boiling time ~10–15 minutes), pressuring her to complete the carving. However, the timer is slack: she could pause or continue, and the kettle's whistle does not force a choice. Present in setup and closure, but middle development is weak—she ignores the kettle for long stretches. Lyric reprise (kettle "breathes in sleepy clicks" at end) reweights it slightly, lifting into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desire to harvest lessons from loss is stated in paragraph eight and dramatized throughout: she translates his teaching (terror tended with patience, attention as leash) into craft ritual. The motivation is conflicted—she wants to hold him without trapping, to remember without choking—and this friction drives every carving choice (ribs, door ajar, loop loose). The cost is visible: solitude, the wrist ache, acceptance of impermanence. Strong causal pressure and closure tie; the motivation is essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace like old steel" is introduced at paragraph fourteen and sustained through modulation: rain "hushes darker" under pressure, then "threads" calmly at closure. The tone—elegiac but grounded, intimate without sentimentality—coheres through all turns and charges the final image (steel warmed, neither bright nor dim). It does not vary mechanically; instead it deepens as her work progresses. The tone is indispensable to the piece's effect, though it operates more as atmosphere than constraint. High integration; closure charge strong.</comment>
