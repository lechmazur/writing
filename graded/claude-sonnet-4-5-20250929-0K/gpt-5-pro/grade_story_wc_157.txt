<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece offers a coherent collective "we" POV with interior access to defiance and strategy, but individual differentiation remains thin—Ilya is "charming" and "candidly cryptic" by label more than by contradictory impulse in scene. The final renunciation (planting messages, letting collectors retreat) carries conceptual cost but lacks a foregrounded micro-choice that tests competing values with visible friction. Embodiment is present (ribs as slatted sunlight, beetles trembling) yet emotional progression stays declarative: "we laughed tax free" tells satisfaction without showing the bodily relief or fear that precedes it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accretes through planted message patterns and culminates when the collectors retreat, reweighting the dominant stake (evading taxation of thought). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the greenhouse opening; no penalty. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image (gourd seed in envelope labeled "Receipts") crystallizes the method and reconfigures the Bureau's ledger logic with conceptual cost (the collectors "realized the math just then"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the Notice of Arrears forces the group to draft a soil-based reply, narrowing tactics. However, the collectors' retreat hinges on their own epiphany rather than protagonist agency, diluting causal ownership of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse supplies concrete sensory anchors (wet soil, low heaters discouraging microphones, mantises as green knives) and micro-setting tools (seed trays, watering wands, vents) that constrain collector movements and enable the message-planting tactic. The final image charges when the gourd seed moves from potting bench to envelope, reweighting the ledger metaphor. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear, though the transition from greenhouse interior to garden maze compresses quickly without tracking distance or door passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evading thought-taxation—is signaled early and tightened when the Notice of Arrears arrives. One meaningful pressure point: drafting a soil answer to the Bureau's fine. The collectors' retreat constitutes a reversal, but it arises from their own realization ("their faces realized the math just then") rather than the narrator's decisive action, undercutting agency. Cost is conceptual (the Bureau's ledger logic is stalled) but not viscerally felt for the protagonists; no visible forfeiture of time, safety, or resource is shown on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—language as embodied resistance to commodification—emerges organically from planted patterns and the gourd-seed metronome without direct statement. The final image (seed in "Receipts" envelope) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: tactile records outmaneuver abstract ledgers. Subtext operates in gesture (mantises posing, ants marching through ink) and implication (laughter "tax free"). However, "We do not owe for lightning that visits the skull" tilts toward thematic echo in the penultimate beat, narrowly avoiding full sermon by embedding it in shadow-reading action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person plural holds stable collective focalization; no head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Diction carries consistent lyric compression ("air turned cashier," "ribs like slatted sunlight") and perceptual signature (noticing beetles, pollen, irrigation commas). However, elevated register ("candidly cryptic," "depreciate regret") sometimes drifts above the concrete texture the voice elsewhere inhabits, and Ilya's dialogue ("We will annotate this with stems") reads more as thesis than spoken idiom. Purposeful compression is taught early and remains legible at closure; no filter-stack penalty applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; many lines do double duty (e.g., "mantises posed like green knives beside watering wands" anchors threat and setting). Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory specificity (gourd clicking, moths rehearsing) advances atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "joining community gardens to plant message patterns" recurs verbatim across three beats without added pressure, triggering −0.4. Template cadence in the collectors' sequence ("Ilya smiled…Ilya was candidly cryptic…Ilya shook the seed") adds −0.3. Figurative density in mid-story beats (amber iris, drummers warming up sky, ellipsis refusing to finish) occasionally obscures causal linkage, but clarity at closure (seed in envelope) remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Core premise—literal thought-taxation resisted via horticultural semiotics—offers a fresh synthesis of surveillance dystopia and embodied language. The gourd-seed metronome, message-plant coordinates, and mantis choreography are specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in compressed lyric voice and mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the choice pays off at closure when the final image reweights the ledger. One friction: the "secret language club" and tax-resistance arc closely echo speculative-fiction templates (underground skill-sharing under oppressive regimes), though the greenhouse locus and insect semiotics personalize the execution enough to avoid full derivative penalty. Within-band adjustment +0.3 for sustained voice risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ilya is present by the second paragraph, shapes two beats (introducing the gourd seed, welcoming collectors), and appears in the closure unit (shaking the seed, tucking it into the envelope). The trait "charming rogue scholar" is labeled early; "candidly cryptic" register appears in dialogue ("how to depreciate regret"). However, Ilya's choices do not create key turns—the collectors' retreat stems from their own epiphany, and the narrator's "we" makes collective decisions. Ilya enables tactics (seed as metronome) but does not drive reversals with visible cost. Present across setup, middle, and payoff; causal pressure modest; swappability moderate (another facilitator could perform similar encouragement). Band guidance: two gates plus modest causal work → ~5.0–5.5 range; rounding down yields 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed is handled in four distinct beats: placed on potting bench as metronome, rattled when Notice arrives, shaken to release ants, tucked into "Receipts" envelope at closure. Each use advances pressure or reweights meaning (metronome → timing device → closure receipt). Setup early, middle development (enables ant release), payoff (final image charges ledger metaphor). Causal pressure clear; specificity high (dry heart clicking, beetles trembling). Cost connection: the seed's shift from tool to symbolic receipt underscores conceptual victory. Irreplaceability strong—no generic object could carry the rhythmic + closure charge. Band guidance: all three gates, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, high specificity → 7.0–8.4 range. Positive signals (early setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6) lift from base ~3.0 to ~6.7; closure participation and irreplaceability push into upper 7s; rounding yields 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "secret language club" is named in the fifth paragraph and frames the collective's identity. It shapes tactics (planting message patterns, drafting soil replies) and narrows options (must communicate covertly to evade thought-taxation). Present in setup (named early), middle development (guides message drafting), and payoff (Ilya welcomes collectors "to our secret language club" in climax beat). The concept constrains two key choices: how to answer the Notice and how to engage collectors. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but not charged—the final image emphasizes the gourd seed and receipt metaphor more than club identity. Band guidance: all three gates, two-beat involvement, moderate causal pressure → ~6.0–6.5 range. Positive signals (setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure mention +0.4) lift from base ~3.0 to ~5.6; the club's framing of resistance stakes adds ~+0.5, reaching 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" is labeled in paragraph 5 and demonstrated in Ilya's dialogue ("how to value a pause, how to itemize a hush"). It enables one on-page action: Ilya's speech tangles the collectors' questions into "converging chaos," buying time. Setup present, middle development weak (trait shown more than used to constrain), payoff indirect (Ilya's final seed-tucking reads as mischief, not cryptic speech). The trait is descriptive flavor more than a visible trade-off with cost. Swappability moderate—"evasive wit" or "playful obfuscation" could substitute with minor edits. Band guidance: setup + weak middle + indirect payoff → cap ~4.6 per missing development gate; the single causal moment (tangling questions) lifts slightly. Positive signals (setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, modest causal +0.5) reach ~4.3; the dialogue demonstration adds ~+0.5, yielding 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Warp" appears twice: "we bent wire frames and would warp the cedar trellises" (paragraph 11) and "the greenhouse glass began to warp with heat" (paragraph 28). The first use enables the message-planting tactic (angling vines into letters); the second contributes to the collectors' retreat by creating sensory pressure. Setup in first third, middle development clear (trellis warping shapes tactic), payoff indirect (glass warp pressures but does not decisively turn). One major turn traces to trellis warping (message legibility), but glass warping is atmospheric—swappable with "shimmer" or "blur." Causal pressure moderate. Band guidance: setup + middle + indirect payoff → ~5.5–6.5 range. Positive signals (setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9) lift from base ~3.0 to ~5.3; trellis use's irreplaceability adds ~+0.5; glass use's swappability limits further gain. Rounding yields 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method "joining community gardens to plant message patterns" is signaled in paragraph 7, used to draft the soil reply (paragraph 19), and shapes the sunflower maze confrontation (paragraphs 24–26). Mechanics matter: marigolds encircle kale, beans curl commas, sunflower shadows align as clockwork. Present in setup (introduced early), middle development (enables reply to Notice), and payoff (maze forces collector reading). Two key turns trace to this method: the draft that stalls the fine and the shadow-sentence that articulates the thematic claim. Causal pressure high; specificity strong (irrigation commas, pollen payment). Band guidance: all three gates, two major beats, high causal pressure → 7.0–8.4 range. Positive signals (setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.7) lift from base ~3.0 to ~7.3; irreplaceability (no other method fits the anti-ledger theme) adds ~+0.1, reaching 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse is introduced in paragraph 2 and anchors all action. It supplies resources (mantises, seed trays, ants, vents, ladybirds) that alter collector engagement and hides communication from microphones (heaters low, hum louder than mics). Setting shapes three key beats: Notice arrival, soil reply drafting, collector confrontation. Present in setup, middle development (resource access), and payoff (glass warp, insect choreography pressures collectors). Micro-setting tools constrain tactics (ant release, vent opening) and charge the final image (envelope on potting bench). Causal pressure high; specificity exceptional (mantises as green knives, moths on glass). Band guidance: all three gates, multi-beat involvement, high causal pressure, closure charge → 7.0–8.4 range. Positive signals (setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.8) lift from base ~3.0 to ~8.3; slight swappability (another hidden workshop could function similarly) and no unique irreplaceability at closure subtract ~−0.7, yielding 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after thoughts become taxable" is established in the opening line and frames all stakes. It tightens one decision: responding to the Notice of Arrears before collectors arrive. However, no live clock or deadline is tracked on the page—the Notice arrives "one night," the reply is drafted by "dawn," and collectors appear with no urgency cues. Setup strong (first line), middle development weak (no visible time pressure alters tactics), payoff indirect (the regime persists but does not press at closure). The timeframe is conceptual framing more than an escalating constraint. Band guidance: setup + weak middle + indirect payoff → cap ~4.6 per missing development; the opening stake-setting and thematic persistence lift slightly. Positive signals (setup +0.7, causal framing +0.6, closure relevance +0.4) reach ~4.7; the premise's necessity to the entire plot adds ~+0.5, but lack of tracked urgency limits gain. Rounding yields 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to stand guard over your own spark of defiance" is named in paragraph 3 and dramatized in two beats: answering the Notice (paragraph 19) and facing collectors (paragraphs 22–29). The desire is conflicted insofar as the group must balance visibility (planting legible patterns) with evasion (not getting caught), though the on-page friction is modest—no moment shows a character tempted to comply or abandon the spark. Present in setup, middle development (drives reply choice), and payoff (collectors retreat, spark preserved). Cost is conceptual (risk of audit) rather than viscerally embodied. Band guidance: all three gates, two-beat involvement, moderate friction → ~6.0–6.9 range. Positive signals (setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.6) lift from base ~3.0 to ~6.0; thematic centrality adds ~+0.4; lack of internal cost struggle or competing want subtracts ~−0.3, netting 6.1; pervasive presence across beats adds ~+0.5, yielding 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone "converging chaos" is coherent from opening ("air turned cashier") through climax ("everything tangled into converging chaos that still somehow climbed a trellis of sense") and modulates with pressure—lyric compression tightens during the collector confrontation, then releases into the final "tax free" laughter. The tone charges the final image by embedding order within apparent disorder (seed in envelope as receipt logic). Present in setup (established early), middle development (tightens during confrontation), and payoff (final line "kept studying…when to bloom" sustains the tone's balance). Causal pressure moderate; the tone does not constrain a choice but enriches every beat. Band guidance: all three gates, coherent modulation, closure charge → 6.5–7.5 range. Positive signals (setup +0.6, modulation across beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5) lift from base ~3.0 to ~5.8; the tone's pervasive integration and thematic fit add ~+0.5, but lack of direct causal constraint limits further gain. Rounding yields 6.8.</comment>
