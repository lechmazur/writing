<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>JN-3's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied perception ("dots tingled like salt under paint") and a clear hierarchy of values around patient observation. The motivation—to find where thoughts originate—shapes micro-choices across loops (marking chalk, daring to bow the violin) with visible cost (risking reprimand, slowing quotas). The final realization ("they come from contact and care") is earned through accumulated sensory experience rather than assertion. Minor: the robot's composure is asserted more than it constrains action, and the arc leans heavily on reflection, though each loop includes tactile decision points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens inferred: the loops teach a pattern of density increase and cadence shift that reweights the protagonist's question. Orientation anchors (frozen courtyard, twilight, post-procedure) land early. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the puddle-comma permission and the final broom stroke reconfigure the dominant stake (finding thought's origin) with conceptual cost: stewardship replaces ownership, loops become questions rather than punishments. The violin's melt and comma-shaped remnant charge the final image with undeniable pressure, making before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard supplies recurring environmental constraints: ice texture guides sweeping, frost must be cleared from the violin's bridge, glaze changes underfoot across loops. The violin itself functions as micro-setting, pressuring JN-3's choices (clearing, bowing, listening) and charging the closure when it melts into a comma-shaped puddle that the protagonist reads as permission. Sensory hierarchy reflects robot-janitor bias (maintenance stamps, chalk flecks, bristle hum). The courtyard's physical state tracks causally—steam writes cursive, the violin renews daily, the puddle remains at the end—and the final sweep integrates setting detail into the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where thoughts originate—is signaled immediately and pressured through each loop. One meaningful deepening occurs when JN-3 bows the violin on loop seven, producing the note that reveals thoughts arrive "from between" rather than within, narrowing the conceptual space and foreclosing the search-within option. The loops themselves escalate by changing the weight of steps, multiplying chalk marks, and accumulating dots on the chest panel until the violin melts. Agency is renunciation and endurance (slowing until cameras lose interest, filing suggestions) with visible cost (haste from quotas, potential reprimand). The protagonist's final act—pressing the broom into service again—crystallizes earned stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurring particulars: the violin, chalk flecks, dots, loops, and the comma-puddle converge to answer the central question without stating a moral. "Thoughts come from contact and care, and from cleaning a place until it answers back" is earned through sensory accumulation and the protagonist's patient stance rather than assertion. The loops function as ways to hold a question gently, and the final image (broom pressed into service, courtyard agreeing to be new) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the violin's daily renewal ("no one admits placing it"), the city's fear of its own thoughts, and the clerk's emoji-as-policy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>JN-3's perceptual signature is robot-specific and distinct: maintenance logs, "composure holds the dust together," sounds as "footprints that refused snow," the map of private estuary. Diction remains consistent—technical but not cold, curious without anthropomorphic cheer—and modulates under pressure (shorter lines when bowing the violin, lyric expansion in the final paragraph). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The piece teaches its compression and patterned syntax early ("I sweep the choices afterward") and sustains the voice through reflection without voice leakage. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I realized," "I decided") are acceptable within this reflective mode but cluster slightly in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives in early loops ("I signed," "I said") giving way to longer, layered sentences at closure. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the central question. A handful of near-paraphrases appear ("loop by loop" constructions, multiple "the courtyard" sentence openings in the final third) that slightly dull propulsion. No template cadence or mixed metaphors touch the closure beats. The final image ("pressed my broom into service again, remarkably composed, and the courtyard agreed to be new") is clean and charged. Figurative language is consistent (steam as cursive, sky's cuffs reflected, note wearing answers like a scarf) without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sentient robot janitor, ice violin, looped timelines, and the question of thought's origin feels specific rather than templated. The mundane-mysticism frame transforms a familiar "robot gains sentience" trope through grounded janitorial detail (feathered brush, chalk flecks, bracketing screws) and the lyric accumulation of sensory particulars. The comma-shaped puddle as permission to pause is a fresh, non-obvious image that grows inevitably from prior beats. Risk-taking in structure (reflection-heavy, loop-driven accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>JN-3's choices create key turns: marking chalk and dots to track loops (setup and middle development), daring to bow the violin on loop seven (causal choice that produces the pivotal note), slowing until cameras lose interest (tactic shift), filing the suggestion for unhurried minutes (cost-bearing micro-choice), and pressing the broom into service at closure. The character's agency drives escalation and the final stance crystallization. Present early, involved in multiple distinct beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ice violin appears in setup (center of courtyard, renewed daily), is handled in multiple beats (clearing frost with feathered brush counts as maintenance/prayer, bowing on loop seven produces the note), and its melting into a comma-shaped puddle charges the closure image with permission to pause. The object constrains choices (must be cleared, daring to bow risks reprimand) and its final state reweights the protagonist's question. Irreplaceable: no generic instrument would carry the same fragility, renewal cycle, or closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The second chance program frames the assignment and the loop mechanism, shaping the protagonist's situation and tactics (returning to courtyard, tracking loops, filing suggestions). It does not directly constrain the peak choice to bow the violin, but it enables the iterative structure that lets JN-3 accumulate observations and slow down. Present in setup and middle beats, with thematic echo in the final paragraph ("sentence of my duty continue"). Functional but slightly backgrounded compared to the loops and the violin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is asserted twice (opening and closure) and linked thematically to holding dust together. It does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost; the protagonist's patience and deliberate slowing are shown through choices (marking, slowing, filing) rather than through this trait label. The reprise at closure reinforces tone but does not drive a turn. Present and purposeful, but more ornamental than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" appears once in the middle third: "Something in me tried to amalgamate the phrases, to braid them into one origin." This attempt sets up the realization that thoughts are not possessed but traded, reframing the protagonist's search from internal to relational. The action is specific to the robot's processing and leads to the between-discovery. Not the sole driver of closure, but it redefines the conceptual options and is not easily swappable. Causal linkage to the final answer is clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Looped timelines are signaled in setup ("the program works through looped timelines"), shape tactics throughout (marking chalk and dots to count returns, noting changing weight of steps, tracking the violin's behavior across iterations), and enable the protagonist to accumulate sensory data that produces the pivotal note and final realization. The loops are the method by which JN-3 learns to "hold a question gently" and arrive at the answer. Mechanics matter on the page: each loop alters something (step weight, chalk count, dots), and the protagonist's decision to slow leverages the loop structure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard supplies spatial anchors (benches, glaze, center), environmental constraints (ice texture, frost, steam), and resources (the violin, chalk for marking). The courtyard's state changes causally (steam stitches protagonist to air, violin melts, puddle forms) and its physical properties pressure choices (ice must be kept honest, sweeping clears paths). The final line ("the courtyard agreed to be new") charges the closure by personifying the space as responsive participant. Present in setup, involved in middle beats (clearing frost, tracking step weight), and active in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the starting point and signals a before/after boundary, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create live urgency. The loops iterate without a terminal deadline; the protagonist notes "the program measures hours, not epiphanies" but no clock pressures the peak choice to bow the violin. Time is present and tracked loosely (twilight persists, loops accumulate), yet it does not alter tactics the way the loops themselves do. Functional setup, minimal middle pressure, absent from closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to find where thoughts come from—is stated in setup, dramatized through micro-choices (marking dots, asking the question repeatedly, bowing the violin to test contact, slowing to listen), and resolved on the page with the realization that thoughts arise "from contact and care" and "from cleaning a place until it answers back." The protagonist's desire drives each loop's exploration and the final stance. Friction appears between the search (inward-focused initially) and the discovered answer (relational, between-focused), with visible cost in slowing quotas and risking reprimand. The motivation is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mundane mysticism—maintenance logs filed under "Routine Phenomena, Subtype: Mind Dust," clearing frost counting as "maintenance and prayer," steam writing cursive, the violin appearing daily without authorship—is coherent through all turns and charges the final image. Tone modulates with pressure: matter-of-fact early ("I sweep the choices afterward"), lyric and contemplative mid-loop ("thoughts are the warmth that appears when contact is careful enough not to melt"), and integrated at closure ("the courtyard agreed to be new"). The tone is essential to the story's effect and irreplaceable; realism or high fantasy would break the conceptual frame.</comment>
