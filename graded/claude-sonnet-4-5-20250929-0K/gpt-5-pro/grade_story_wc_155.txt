<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal texture is consistently voice-specific (lanterns, projectors, "purse of spare dawns"), and the motivation to rediscover lost joy shapes several micro-choices (baiting roots with marmalade, letting the display blur back). However, the protagonist's arc reads more as enactment than struggle—no contradictory impulse threatens the mission, and the grandmother's wink delivers wisdom without dramatized resistance. The final choice to "let the display blur" and leave the fragment beneath roots feels thematically apt but arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with mosaic structure taught early (daydream fold, orchard opening "like a bruised pear"). The piece coheres through density increase and cadence modulation rather than causal linkage. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator rewinding the film, writing a promise and recipe on the leader, and acknowledging "joy…is happiest when exposed, shared…left on a tree for someone else to see" reweights the dominant stake (rediscovering vs. hoarding joy) with conceptual cost legible in the act of release. Orientation anchors (vivid mural artist, ruined orchard, fog) appear immediately. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reel stutters and the narrator tries juggling pears, then the grandmother winks across decades, shifting the stance from preservation to expenditure. The mosaic shard count (pre-display preparation, display itself, post-display departure, reflective return frame) stays within Track B allowance, transitions are signaled by time markers ("Tonight," "When morning sniffed"), and the lens holds. Cost is conceptual and felt (release of the film, leaving the fragment) rather than a decisive physical forfeiture, which keeps this out of the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting (ruined orchard, fog, skeletal pears, cracked cistern) is vivid and purposeful. The fog functions as "patient audience" and "emulsion waiting for light," directly enabling the display's mechanics and charging the final image when it "wants to keep all stories" and begins to bleach the projection. The projector balanced on a honey crate, bulbs strung between trees, and fresco fragment propped against a stump all constrain the narrator's staging choices. Sensory detail is dense and POV-filtered ("fog applauded in damp thuds," "pockets sticky, heart light, shoes muddied"). The orchard's spatial logic remains clear across preparation, display, and departure. Micro-setting (body, tools, recurring objects) qualifies under the allowance and charges closure when the narrator slips the fragment beneath roots and the bulbs in the bag "chimed like nervous birds."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to rediscover lost joy") is signaled early and modulates through the display sequence. The narrator's agency is visible in micro-choices (stringing bulbs, painting with light, juggling pears, letting the display blur). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fog begins to bleach the projection and the narrator realizes "to rediscover lost joy is not to hoard it in frames, but to spend it until the coin sings," then acts on that insight by leaving the fragment and rewinding the film. This is a stance crystallization rather than a causal reversal, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (release, ephemerality accepted) but legible on the page. No antagonist pressure or competing stakes appear; the fog's "ambition" provides gentle resistance but does not escalate into a high-cost dilemma, keeping this mid-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (the generative paradox of joy—exposure, sharing, release vs. preservation) emerges organically from the display mechanics, the grandmother's wink ("fix nothing, just practice joy until it remembers you"), and the final image of leaving the fragment and film for someone else. The piece resists moralizing; the narrator's realization is earned through concrete action (juggling pears, watching the reel stutter, seeing the fog bleach the image) rather than abstract reflection. The fresco, film, and fog recur with shifted weight: the fresco steadies the scene, the film reveals laughter and the grandmother's mischief, the fog both preserves and threatens to erase. The ending offers a non-literal answer—joy "is happiest when exposed, shared, tasted, and then left on a tree for someone else to see"—without stating a thesis. Pensive mirth as tone supports the thematic ambiguity (loss and delight coexist). Minor: a few lines approach thematic echo ("the opposite of ruin," "joy…is happiest when exposed") but remain image-anchored enough to avoid penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters sensory input through artist idiom ("fog for a canvas and branches for rafters," "brushstroke here, a kiss there") and whimsical concreteness ("purse of spare dawns," "baited the roots with stories and marmalade"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure ("I laughed, and it sounded like a gate discovering it still swings"). Non-standard syntax and rhythmic compression are purposeful and legible. Minor: some figurative density in mid-passage approaches overwriting ("shawl…knitted from shrugged shoulders and sudden giggles"), and a few recycled stems ("I wanted," "I knew," "I had") create mild template cadence, but rhythm modulates across beats and the voice stays singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, but several metaphors stack without breathing room ("fog lapped…silvering it," "knowledge network hummed as if trees remembered how to rewind laughter," "pensive mirth wrapped the rows as if a shawl were knitted") in consecutive lines, triggering mild overwriting penalty (−0.4). A handful of recycled stems ("I wanted," "I knew," "I had," "I tried," "I let") create template cadence in the middle third (−0.3). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and closure. No loops or paraphrase; no clarity breaks. The figurative density and template runs are pervasive enough to prevent 8+ but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, so deductions remain modest and routed here only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of vivid mural art, exposed film as relic, fog as darkroom, and a "knowledge network" woven through roots is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother's wink across decades and the decision to spend joy rather than hoard it offer a fresh inflection on memory-recovery narratives. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise without retreating into explanatory prose. Voice, subject, and style cohere as a singular stance. Risk-taking (mosaic structure, heavy figurative load, pensive mirth as sustaining tone) heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity. The "fold of a daydream" frame and the orchard as darkroom are memorable particulars. No close echoes of famous lines detected. Transformation test: plot and arc would collapse if setting/voice/objects were replaced, confirming originality. Within-band bonus (+0.3) for risk distinction applied.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character (vivid mural artist) present from line one; the narrator's choices to string bulbs, balance the projector, paint with light, juggle pears, and ultimately let the display blur and leave the fragment drive the display sequence and the final stance shift. Setup clear, middle beats show agency, closure participates (rewinding film, leaving fragment, returning promise). Two integration gates (setup, closure) met; middle development is present in staging choices. Causal pressure moderate (choices advance the display but no high-cost dilemma). +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal enable, +0.8 closure link, −0.3 swappability (another artist role would fit with edits). Band guidance: two gates + closure link trends ~6; causal pressure and specificity lift slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Object (fresco fragment) introduced early ("pried loose a fresco fragment"), used twice: propped against stump to steady the scene during display, then slipped beneath roots at closure. Setup clear, middle beat (steadying scene) and closure beat (leaving beneath roots) both on-page. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal (steadies display), +1.0 closure (charged reprise: leaving it gifts the orchard), +0.4 specificity (lime and sky, ladders and apricot laughter are unique). −0.0. All three gates met. Band: strong closure link + two beats + specificity trends mid-to-high 6s; slight lift for thematic charge at ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Core concept (exposed film) present early ("tin of exposed film, my grandmother's last reel"), threaded in projector, the boy's laughter displayed, grandmother revealed, and rewound with promise/recipe at closure. Setup, middle (display mechanics), and closure (rewinding, leaving on tree metaphor) all on-page. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 causal (film enables display, shapes tactics of painting with light), +1.5 closure (rewind + promise inscription is the final act), +0.6 specificity (grandmother's reel, curled like fern, leader inscription), +0.4 cost (release). −0.0. All gates met, causal + closure strong. High 7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attribute (paints with light) declared line four, demonstrated in middle ("painted his path with light, nudging highlights along fog-grain") and implicit at closure (bulbs chime, light as medium sustains theme). Setup clear, middle beat shows method, closure alludes. +0.8 early, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 causal enable (attribute dictates display method), +0.5 closure echo (light/laughter theme), +0.5 specificity (lanterns, projectors, painting fog). −0.4 swappability (another sensory medium could fit structure), −0.3 label-only in places (declared more than constrained). Two gates (setup, middle); closure is thematic echo rather than direct participation. Mid-5s to low 6s; lyric reprise lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Action (display) frames the entire sequence: preparation occupies early third, display itself is middle third, post-display departure and reflection close. Setup, middle, closure all involve display or its aftermath. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats (prep, execution, aftermath), +1.0 causal (display is the vehicle for stance shift), +1.2 closure (departure and return promise hinge on having displayed), +0.4 specificity (fog-canvas, projector on honey crate). −0.5 swappability (another ritual or public act could serve similar thematic function with edits). All gates met, strong closure link. Mid-to-high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Method (knowledge network) introduced early ("knotted copper wire through roots and radios"), hums when film plays ("knowledge network hummed as if trees remembered"), gathers whispers during reel stutter, and narrator promises to "tune the knowledge network with tea and jokes" on return. Setup clear, middle beat (humming, whisper-gathering), closure echo (tuning promise). +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.3 causal minor (network color but does not constrain display choices), +0.4 closure echo (tuning promise), +0.3 specificity (wire/roots/radios). −0.6 ornamental (mentions do not alter tactics or outcome), −0.4 summary (whisper-gathering told, not shown constraining action). Two gates (setup, middle); closure is promise rather than participation. Mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting (ruined orchard district lost in centuries of thick fog) present line two, frames entire piece, fog functions as audience/emulsion/darkroom, orchard supplies skeletal pears for stringing bulbs and spatial anchors (cistern, arbors, stump), fog begins to bleach display triggering stance shift, departure anchored to orchard's "corner open for return." Setup immediate, middle beats (fog as canvas, orchard as stage), closure (fog's ambition, leaving fragment beneath roots, return promise). +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.4 causal pressure (fog enables and threatens display; orchard supplies tools/space), +1.3 closure (fog's bleaching catalyzes release decision; return promise), +0.6 specificity (fog centuries thick, skeletal pears, honey crate). −0.0. All gates, strong causal + closure. High 7s to low 8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe (within the fold of a daydream) appears line one and final lines ("daydream folded me away," "borrow another hour from the fold"). Setup clear, closure reprise clear, but middle development is absent—no moment where the daydream-frame constrains choice or tightens clock. +0.8 early, +0.4 one beat (closure bookend), +0.0 causal (frame does not pressure tactics), +0.6 closure (frame reappears, light reprise), +0.5 specificity (fold, borrow hour). −0.6 ornamental (frame is metaphor without stakes), −0.5 lyric-only (no mid-scene use). Two gates (setup, closure); no middle development. Lyric reprise without cost or pressure. Mid-to-high 4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation (to rediscover lost joy) declared early ("I wanted to rediscover lost joy, not a museum of ache"), pursued through display staging and light-painting, reweighted mid-piece ("to rediscover lost joy is not to hoard it…but to spend it"), enacted at closure (letting display blur, leaving fragment, writing promise). Setup, middle realization, closure action all on-page. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 causal (desire shapes all display choices), +1.1 closure (final act of release enacts revised understanding), +0.4 specificity (joy vs. museum of ache, spending coin until it sings). −0.4 summary (key realization is told rather than fully dramatized in a high-pressure choice). All gates met, strong closure link. Low-to-mid 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone (pensive mirth) established early ("sweet and sour in its remembering," "silly and solemn at once") and sustained throughout: juggling pears with fog applause, crow judging kindly, grandmother's mischief, laughter "like a gate discovering it still swings," bulbs chiming "like nervous birds," city pretending not to grin. Setup clear, modulates across beats (light play, gentle absurdity, bittersweet release), charges closure ("pockets sticky, heart light," contagious display, borrowed hour). +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +0.8 causal (tone guides sensory selection and narrator's playful tactics), +1.4 closure (tone crystallizes in sticky/light/muddy image and "city pretended not to grin"), +0.6 specificity (fog applauds, gate swings, nervous birds). −0.0. All gates, coherent modulation, closure charge strong. High 7s.</comment>
