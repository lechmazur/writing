<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is consistently particular—speaking to rivets, translating wind tones—and interior texture remains stable through figurative density. Motivation (charting discovery "the way a baker wants bread to rise") is concrete and drives the phrasebook interpretation. However, the final choice to "fold" the luminance feels more thematic ceremony than a decision with visible cost; the narrator never faces a competing want or meaningful trade-off that would foreclose a path. Competence is unbalanced: the apprentice solves every puzzle (hopscotch angles, murmuration arithmetic, multi-lingual hum) without friction, flattening the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric density and guided discovery by the first third; pressure accumulates through layered clues (phrasebook, hopscotch, birds, net) toward the luminance capture. Orientation anchors early (airship, apprentice, Melora, sky). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the strand "yields like a promise that wants to be kept" and is folded into the dog-ear, transforming "loneliness...into a map we can share." Cost is conceptual and felt—isolation becomes communal artifact—but the physical mechanics (net kisses strand, glow crawls to paper) rely on convenient magic that the text does not earn through prior constraint or price. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hopscotch reveals the path, but no on-page reversal tests the narrator's commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The airship's groaning beams, brass bell, and copper-thread net are handled across beats and pressure choices (climb, lower net). The hopscotch board in the cargo hold constrains the heading solution, charging the final third. Sensory hierarchy (cumin/oil, pressure on teeth, hum in ribs) reflects priorities. However, spatial choreography is vague: the net's proximity to the luminance, the airship's altitude relative to murmurations, and the apprentice's station during the capture remain unclear, weakening the micro-setting's tactical role at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: chart stranded luminance. The hopscotch discovery tightens the path (north by east, climb), and the murmuration "escorts" complicate approach. The net sequence deepens involvement, but the luminance "yields...like a promise" without resistance, cost, or trade-off; coincidence (birds cooperate, strand craves the dog-ear) resolves rather than complicates. No on-page reversal or competing pressure tests the narrator's skill or forces a renunciation. Agency is present in plotting and folding, but competence goes unchallenged, so escalation under the Accumulative lens feels decorative rather than constrained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-into-communion emerges through particulars: talking to brass, waving to starlings, folding light "the way my mentor taught me to fold a greeting," crew signatures in the margin. The phrasebook dog-ear recurs with shifted weight (clue → vessel → harbor). The final image—"Stranded Luminance" labeled, fresh tea steeping—offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the loneliness the narrator voices throughout. However, "sociable isolation" as a phrase appears twice in near-identical phrasing, and the motif of "speaking to what does not speak" is over-articulated, approaching thematic echo. The piece resists moralizing but borders on announcing its own resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I answer the beams under my breath," "the way each tone scratches the ribs of the hull." Diction is consistently lyric-specific ("cursive," "skipped stone," "tea into a cracked cup"). Melora's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("our shadow looks like a skipped stone"). However, figurative density is high and constant (nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile), and some vehicles strain coherence: light as "silk on a nail" versus "a promise that wants to be kept" versus "tea into a cracked cup." The compression is purposeful and pattern-taught, but peak beats (the net capture) could breathe for clarity without losing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies sentence-to-sentence, and paragraph breaks create visual breathing room. Information density is high: most lines advance image, character, or discovery. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I listen to what does not speak" echoes "talking to the sky is how I keep company without asking anyone to stay"; "stranded luminance, a rumor of light that gets lost and never dims" is restated as "bright as a procession yet homeless, an exile of radiance." Figurative saturation in the net sequence (hums in ten languages, tone scratches ribs, glow crawls, craving paper as harbor) muddles the physical action, obscuring whether the apprentice manually guides the strand or it moves autonomously. Template cadence in cumulative "and" chains (lines 17–19, 23–24) flattens propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loops and metaphor density touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (charting lost light via polyglot clues and avian geometry) is fresh, and the hopscotch-as-navigation is a non-obvious synthesis. Voice and conceptual frame cohere without prompt echo. However, the emotional arc (lonely cartographer finds communal meaning) follows a familiar template, and the luminance's cooperative capture avoids confrontation or failure that would test the narrator's values. The airship-and-birds aesthetic is specific but not transformative; removing the antique setting and substituting a terrestrial frame would leave the arc intact. Risk is present in lyric density but does not heighten stakes—clarity suffers without proportional thematic gain.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early (line 2: "curious map apprentice"). Shapes two beats: interpreting the hopscotch board (line 13) alters heading; folding the luminance (line 25) completes capture. However, observation dominates—decisions feel inevitable rather than chosen under competing pressure. Curiosity enables rather than costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (line 7: mentor's torn scrap). Handled in three beats: kept against compass (line 9), pinned to chart as pointer (line 18), receives the luminance fold (line 25–26). Returns with reweighted meaning (clue → vessel). Specificity (three languages, bird smudge) matters to closure; swapping for generic map would break the fold logic. Cost is conceptual (the apprentice risks mentor's gift as container), though not foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Named early (line 4) and drives the search. Shapes stakes (chart it) and the net sequence (lines 17–26). The strand's cooperative yielding and the fold into the dog-ear depend on its properties (homeless, craving harbor). However, "stranded luminance" functions more as a found MacGuffin than a concept with rule-set implications; its mechanics are asserted, not explored. Removal would collapse the goal but not the method or narrator's arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Label appears twice ("diligently curious," line 2; "curious enough to chat," line 2). No on-page action dramatizes diligence as a constraint or cost. Curiosity enables clue-solving but does not compete with caution, speed, or other traits. Swappable with "observant" or "patient" without altering beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The action of noting occurs in the hopscotch beat (line 13) and the hum translation (line 20: "plotting bearings by the way each tone scratches"). Both alter tactics (heading, net adjustment). However, "note" is also used generically (line 15: "make a note for Melora"; line 27: "draw the route...label the page"), diluting specificity. The climactic fold (line 25) does not read as notation. Present across beats but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled midway (line 12: "dusty hopscotch board"). Mechanics matter: "squares carry a map of numbers, angles, and bird shapes" (line 12); "box tilt means north by east...cathedral...means climb" (line 14). Shapes the heading choice that drives the ascent. However, the method is used once and does not constrain later attempts or return at closure. Swapping for "constellation chart" or "painted compass rose" would preserve the beat with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Present throughout (line 1, cargo hold line 11, net apparatus line 18, hull line 20). The airship supplies the net, altitude control, and spatial frame for the capture. The brass bell (line 16) and groaning hull (line 21) provide resources. However, the setting does not constrain: the apprentice never struggles with limited altitude, wind, or tool failure. Postcard touches (cumin, hopscotch) add texture but do not pressure choices. Removal would require a ground frame but the arc would survive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Murmurations appear early (line 3) and recur (lines 10, 13, 17, 24, 28). They "braid above," "finish the arithmetic," "escort" the light, and "knot the evening into cursive curtains." However, the birds do not impose a time limit or complicate access; they cooperate without cost. "Amid" reads as atmosphere rather than a ticking clock. If the birds left, the capture could proceed unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stated early (line 6: "chart the next great discovery") and echoed at closure (line 29: "ready to chart the next great discovery beyond the dark"). Drives the search and note-taking. However, the desire is told, not dramatized in friction: no competing want (safety, rest, recognition vs. accuracy) tests the motive. The baker simile adds texture but the choice to risk the dog-ear or push altitude is never framed as a sacrifice of this want. Present and coherent but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Established early: "isolation is easier when you give it a voice" (line 1); "sociable yet mostly speaking to brass and birds" (line 2); "talking to the sky is how I keep company without asking anyone to stay" (line 28). The tone modulates: solitary noticing → collaborative capture (Melora, crew signatures) → return to solo readiness. The final tea-steeping image (line 29) charges the paradox—prepared for discovery, still alone. Coherent through turns and legible at closure, though "sociable isolation" as a phrase is repeated, bordering on over-articulation.</comment>
