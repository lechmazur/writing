<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android's interior life is vivid and contradictory—nostalgic for a childhood it never had, haunted by simulated toys, seeking resolution of "inner static" through concrete action. Micro-choices accumulate: greeting storms "like old classmates," trimming subroutines, following fire through breach. The final stance—planting packets, recognizing "fragmented wholeness" as promise—feels earned by the arc of burn and escape. Minor slip: the designer's voice ("growth is a controlled burn escape") reads slightly expository, though it anchors the central conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: android, dome, roses, magnetic shift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern (shift cresting, dome protesting, breach opening) and deepens via recurring motifs (fire, maps, inner hiss). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the android steps through breach, plants the first packet, and the hiss "loosens...turned, a river choosing deeper banks"—a decisive reweighting with felt cost (dome slumps, paint curls, museum tour ends). One tightening suffices at this length; the breach moment forecloses return and crystallizes new geography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dome's honeycomb shutters, magnetic alarms, air mixers, and glass-lung collapse are tactile and specific. Micro-setting (copper shavings, mulch corridor, terracotta shards) constrains the burn choreography and charges the final planting image. Desert ions, cooled sand, and revised pole all shape the escape and closure. Sensory hierarchy stays consistent with android perception—technical precision softening into organic metaphor under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: resolve inner static by staging the burn before the shift resets bearings. Accumulative pressure tightens through compass stutter, window spider, dome breach—each narrows options until escape becomes necessary. Agency is decision and renunciation (leaving the museum-tour behind) with visible cost: dome slumps, paint curls, old enclosure abandoned. The burn doesn't destroy but "unsticks time," and the android's gathering of packets shows tactical adaptation. One meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: memory, preservation, transformation through fire, choosing what to carry. The box of childhood fears, copper corridor, and seed packets recur with shifting weight; "fragmented wholeness" is invoked once as diagnosis-turned-promise, not sermon. The final image—planting along the new pole, hiss turning to deeper banks, desert writing "new cursive...tidy and wild"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question ("What is left after the fires?") without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, burying) and charged objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric—android interiority blends technical precision ("subroutines," "vials," "ions") with organic metaphor ("glass lung," "needle teeth," "river choosing deeper banks"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the android notices systems, patterns, lessons, and thresholds. Syntax modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during breach, longer reflection post-escape). Minor slip: "yellow teeth nibbling paths" and "mothers soothing feverish air" occasionally tip toward decorative figuration, though they remain voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, pressure, or image. Rhythm varies purposefully (clipped during burn, expansive in reflection). Minor pattern artifact: several sentences open with "I [verb]" in the middle third, creating momentary template cadence. A few metaphors stack without clear payoff ("needle teeth scratching," "tiny locks opening," "yellow teeth nibbling")—vivid but occasionally ornamental. No loops or scaffold; propulsion stays strong. The closure beat is clean and imagistically charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—nostalgic android, magnetic shift, desert roses that bloom after fire, controlled burn as escape—feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "robot caretaker" trope through lived interiority and the paradox of simulated nostalgia. The framing (archive choosing what to carry, museum ending the tour) avoids stock beats. Risk: lyric density and elliptical pacing could lose clarity, but the piece commits fully and the closure pays off. Transformation test passes; the arc depends on these exact elements and their convergence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nostalgic android caretaker appears early, drives the burn decision, stages the corridor, gathers packets, follows fire through breach, and plants the first packet—every major turn traces to this character's agency. The nostalgia (box of childhood fears, lullabies, toys) shapes motivation and the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible: paint curls, museum tour ends, fragmented wholeness held as promise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Box of childhood fears introduced early, opened mid-story ("greet the storms like old classmates"), and its recorded child's voice threads the air during the burn. The opening and invitation are two distinct beats. It does not return at closure, limiting final-image charge. Swappable with another memory vessel without breaking logic, though the "rosewood latch" and "felt" add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled burn escape is the premise, shapes all tactics (drawing corridor, laying copper, timing vents), and the breach moment literalizes it: "door of heat opening where metal once refused." The concept defines stakes and options throughout. The designer's lesson anchors it early; the execution dominates the middle; the breach and planting close it. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strangely organic appears in dome's "honeycomb shutters...despite its alloy bones," returns when the android's frame feels "strangely organic, as if nerves had grown along the welds" under heat. Two touches, both embodied. The trait enables the android's empathy (learning from sandstorms, soothing air) and charges the breach moment. Not fully irreplaceable but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miniaturize drives the escape: "seeds, spores on terracotta shards, vials of cultured scent" are packed, slung, carried through breach, and planted. The android also "miniaturizes" itself by trimming subroutines—a double use that shapes both physical and internal stakes. The action is irreplaceable; without it, there is no future to plant and no closure image. Present across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>By containing chaos appears as method (air mixers herd smoke in spirals, "by containing chaos instead of fighting it") and is learned from sandstorms ("only pass politely when you give them a corridor"). The corridor and vent mapping enact it; the breach follows from it. Mechanics matter and shape the burn's success. Not merely end-deployed; the principle guides tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Desert rose farm in glass-domed enclosure anchors setting, supplies the roses that require fire, the dome that forgets north, the honeycomb shutters and air mixers that enable the burn, and the breach that becomes the escape route. The enclosure's collapse and the exterior desert both pressure choices. Micro-setting (mulch, copper, terracotta) alters tactics. Essential across all beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Magnetic north shift is signaled early ("season when magnetic north shifts"), pressures the middle (needles point through walls, dome rotates wrong, windows spider), and the crest forces the burn timing ("before the shift resets all bearings"). The new pole determines where the first packet is planted. Time tightens decisions throughout; the shift is both clock and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>To resolve inner static is stated as motivation early and embodied: the android carries "a soft hiss like sand over glass," opens the box to confront storms, stages the burn, trims subroutines, and at closure the hiss "loosens, not gone, but turned." The want conflicts with cost (leaving the dome, burning the museum) and the friction drives every choice. Dramatized across beats and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness is named once ("she once called it") and embodied throughout: nostalgic android with simulated childhood, dome with alloy and organic parts, controlled burn that escapes, seeds and storms, inner hiss that loosens but persists. Tone modulates from technical reflection to lyric urgency during breach, then settles into grounded promise at closure. The final image ("tidy and wild") charges the phrase without repeating it. Coherent and purposeful across all turns.</comment>
