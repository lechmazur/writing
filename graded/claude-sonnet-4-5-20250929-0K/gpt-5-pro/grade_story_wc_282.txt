<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's sensory-mapping vocation is embodied through specific micro-choices (floating to ease joints, pressing the fossil to the wall, threading the chord through dream servers). Interiority is concrete and particular ("the limbic heat spikes," "the headband floods red and gold"), anchored in both professional idiom and embodied perception. The final choice to feed the chord into the sleepers' dream loops carries visible cost—the protagonist sits alone, logging "only half of the truth"—yet the renunciation feels earned by prior pressure. Minor repetition of "the fossil" and "the map" stems across beats prevents entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory data, the fossil's recurrence, and the chord's discovery, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the protagonist realizes the two leaf imprints are "transitional objects in the purest sense" and feeds the signal into the sleepers' dream loops. Orientation is anchored early (coastal cave, after hibernation, sensory map maker). The closure reweights the opening stake—charting silence to "become the voice of the unknown"—with a felt cost: the protagonist sits alone, aware the logged procedure is "only half of the truth." One meaningful deepening (the chamber chord + heirloom alignment) is sufficient for this length, and the conceptual cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains multiple choices: the protagonist must skim on her back through the narrow elbow, the mineral pool eases joints (enabling the float), and the chamber's imprint directly charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV's professional lens (trace gases, tannin ghosts, microtemporal steps). The elm leaf fossil functions as micro-setting, accumulating meaning from opening to chamber alignment to final broadcast. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (bluff mouth → mineral pool → narrow elbow → chamber → broadcast shed).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to become the voice of the unknown"—is signaled in the opening third and drives the protagonist's decisions (following the sorrow lane, trusting plankton light, pressing the fossil into the wall). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist enters the chamber and discovers the larger imprint; the alignment moment forces a choice to feed the chord into the sleepers' dream loops, foreclosing a safer path (returning without acting). The cost is visible: the protagonist sits alone afterward, aware the procedure is "only half of the truth," and the sleepers' response remains unknown. Minor escalation clarity issues (the surge moment feels decorative rather than pressure-adding) and the lack of a visible secondary trade-off prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the two leaf fossils as "transitional objects in the purest sense," the sensory map as both data and emotional archive, and the protagonist's role as intermediary between the unknown and the hibernating cities. The final image—threading the chord through dream servers while sitting on a cold step—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral: communication requires embodiment, listening, and accepting partial knowledge. The "factually mystical" phrase and the fossil's dual function (heirloom + cave imprint) accumulate meaning without overt symbolism. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and apt; perceptual signature is distinct (professional filter of "trace gases," "microtemporal steps," "salinity lulls" mixed with embodied emotion). Diction remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon—scientific idiom blended with lyric compression ("dripping language of intervals and vanishing vowels"). Purposeful compression ("the phrase fits," "I realize") is taught early and remains legible. Minor filter-verb density in mid-section beats ("I set," "I press," "I lift") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure clarity. No head-hopping; narrative distance is controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally with minimal template cadence. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "the fossil anchors a relic smell that the stone remembers" echoes "Buried woods once shaded this bay, and the tide still carries tannin and pollen ghosts," and "the unknown does not speak in words, but in pressures and temperatures" near-repeats the earlier sensory-mapping premise. Stock metaphor "like a gently opened door" in a peak beat triggers −0.3. "As if still wicking rain" and "like dawn behind my eyes" remain voice-apt. These issues accumulate to −0.4 total in Q7; closure beat ("I sit on the cold step and log the procedure") remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Core premise—sensory map maker charting post-hibernation silence with a heat-mapping headband and ancestral fossil—offers a fresh synthesis. The "factually mystical" phrase and the dual-fossil alignment feel specific and earned rather than decorative. The transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact particulars (heirloom fossil + cave imprint, heat-mapping emotions, dream-loop broadcast). Minor proximity risk: "to become the voice of the unknown" trends generic; the piece rescues it through embodied particulars (floating, chord, plankton light). No overt derivative template, though the solitary-scientist-bridges-worlds frame is familiar; specificity and the transitional-object concept elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by end of first third. Development: protagonist's choices drive multiple beats (following the sorrow lane, trusting plankton light, pressing the fossil into the wall, threading the chord through dream servers). Payoff: the final decision to broadcast the chord and the closing reflection are hers. Causal pressure: the vocation constrains her reading of the chamber ("maps are voices saying please") and enables the chord's interpretation. Closure linkage: the protagonist's action (threading the chord) and reflection (logging "only half of the truth") shape the ending. Cost: she sits alone afterward, aware of partial success. Early signal +0.6, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5 = strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in opening paragraph. Development: used in at least three distinct beats (floating with it on sternum, holding it beside the wall imprint, pressing it into the wall, hugging it to chest during exit). Payoff: the heirloom fossil's alignment with the cave imprint is the conceptual hinge of closure ("transitional objects in the purest sense") and its signal is fed into the dream servers. Causal pressure: the fossil anchors the protagonist's limbic response and enables the chord discovery. Closure linkage: the fossil signature is added to the broadcast, and the dual-fossil realization reweights the entire premise. Specificity: irreplaceable (elm, veins like frozen rivers, found by grandmother, resin mesh). Cost: the fossil's use exposes the protagonist to the surge and the aftermath. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5 = indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced explicitly by paragraph four ("transitional object that steadies the bridge between data and meaning"). Development: the concept shapes the protagonist's interpretation of both the heirloom and the cave imprint, and the realization moment ("I realize the imprint and my heirloom are transitional objects in the purest sense") changes her tactics (feeding the signal into the dream loops as "invitations to reenter the world carefully"). Payoff: the closure hinges on the concept—communication as bridge across epochs and minds. Causal pressure: the concept narrows the protagonist's reading of the cave chord and justifies the final action. Closure linkage: the protagonist's realization and subsequent broadcast are direct applications of the concept. Early signal +0.7, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph nine ("the science team jokes that the fossil is factually mystical, and I never argue because the phrase fits"). Development: the phrase frames the protagonist's calibration method ("It is not superstition, it is calibration") and justifies the headband's emotional mapping. Payoff: the algorithm "checksums the stream against tidal records, before letting it seep into the sleepers with its factually mystical stamp." The trait enables the blend of data and meaning that the protagonist seeks. Causal pressure: the trait licenses the protagonist's unorthodox method (using the fossil to anchor limbic heat). Closure linkage: the phrase reappears in the broadcast moment, stamping the final action. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0 = essential but slightly less indispensable than B or C.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph thirteen ("Inside, I float on a mineral pool to ease my joints"). Development: the float enables the protagonist to remain in the cave long enough for the headband to register the limbic bloom and for the passage through the elbow. The surge moment ("A surge shoves through the chamber, and I lift, weightless for an instant, floating and spinning") echoes the action with stakes. Payoff: the float is not directly present in the ending image, but it enabled the entire discovery sequence. Causal pressure: the float eases joints (a constraint) and creates the calm needed for the headband to map emotional responses. Beat involvement: two distinct moments (pool float, surge float). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure indirect +0.4 = shapes key turns but is not indispensable to the final image itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph ten ("I record with a headband that does heat-mapping emotions in real time"). Development: the headband registers the protagonist's embodied responses across multiple beats (thermal bloom of longing, limbic heat spike, lane of sorrow, red-and-gold flood at the alignment moment). Payoff: the headband's data is parsed into the chord and fed into the sleepers' dream loops. The method enables the entire discovery and broadcast. Causal pressure: the headband's readings guide the protagonist's choices (following the sorrow, pressing the fossil). Closure linkage: the headband's output is the chord that shapes the ending action. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.3 = essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: title and opening sentence ("coastal cave network"). Development: the cave network constrains every move (the slit mouth, mineral pool, narrow elbow, chamber with imprint, surge). The setting supplies the key resource (the cave imprint) and pressures the protagonist physically (must skim on back, joints ache, surge shoves). Payoff: the cave chord is the discovery that drives the closure action; the setting's acoustic properties and the imprint are irreplaceable. Causal pressure: the cave's layout and conditions force specific tactics and enable the alignment moment. Closure linkage: the chamber chord and imprint are the hinge of the final action. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7 = indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in opening sentence ("After the last city sealed its sleepers") and paragraph two ("Humans hibernate now"). Development: the timeframe justifies the protagonist's solitary mission and the urgency to "listen" while others sleep. The "after" framing sets the stakes (sleepers need guidance to "reenter the world carefully"). Payoff: the ending references the hibernation ("after humans hibernate and the earth reacquaints itself") and the sleepers' dream loops. The timeframe shapes the protagonist's motivation but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.8, no live countdown −0.5 = shapes key turn but does not alter tactics with urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph four ("I want to become the voice of the unknown"). Development: the motivation drives the protagonist's choices (charting silence, following the sorrow lane, pressing the fossil, feeding the chord into the sleepers' dream loops as invitations). Payoff: the ending reflection ("when the unknown sings, a body must answer, and the answer must be a map that can speak") directly restates and enacts the motivation. Causal pressure: the desire to translate the unknown into actionable guidance shapes every beat. Closure linkage: the final action and reflection are direct expressions of the motivation. Friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized in internal conflict; the protagonist never doubts or weighs a competing want. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, told-only friction −0.7 = essential but could be more conflicted.</comment>
