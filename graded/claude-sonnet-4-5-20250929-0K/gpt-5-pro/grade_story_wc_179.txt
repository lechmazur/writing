<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist exhibits clear motivation and interiority through cellular memory work, with embodied emotion in moments like "rage surged, and the sanctuary absorbed it." Mara's arc from "eyes bright with the kindled stiffness of someone unwilling to cry" to releasing resentment shows transformation, though the final shift feels slightly abrupt given the brief on-page time. The relationship pressure between protagonist and Mara drives choices effectively. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent language ("teach resentment to release," "cells remember") that occasionally edges toward diagnostic framing, though mostly dramatized through the music box ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who: scheming pacifist; where: soundless sanctuary; when: during siege) arrive within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through the ritual with cellular memory, Mara's confession of names and reasons, and the final placement of the music box against her sternum. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid)—Mara's body "reintroduced her to the woman who had kissed her" and "resentment stepped back," with the war turning home as visible cost. One meaningful deepening through the stone-mapping ritual narrows options and reweights the siege.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary functions as active constraint: it "reappears when needed," "absorbed" rage, and its "tremble...changed the pattern of dust on the floor into braided rivers" that maps withdrawal strategy. The music box serves as micro-setting/tool, shifting from "broken...teeth tired of harm" to charging the final beat when placed against Mara's sternum. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"sabre at her belt numbed by the sanctuary's hush," "pulse stuttered like hooves before a river crossing." The space actively shapes the cellular memory work and final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (convince Mara to end the siege) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the ritual sequence: protagonist demonstrates with their own father-memory, Mara resists ("Do not ask me to forget"), protagonist reframes ("teach that memory a different shape"), leading to Mara's confession and stone-mapping that narrows withdrawal options. The final choice—placing the box against her sternum and letting "resentment step back"—is protagonist-driven with visible cost: the war ends, but through vulnerability and cellular release rather than victory. One clear escalation path with felt trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming resentment through bodily memory emerges organically from the ritual rather than thesis statement. The broken music box pin that "learned mercy" when snapped recurs with shifting weight, charging the closure when it enables Mara's release. Subtext operates in Mara's physical responses—"shoulders changed their angle, a citadel ceding ramparts"—and the sanctuary's dust-map showing honorable withdrawal. Minor penalty for occasional abstract phrasing ("shifting grace began to flow without notes") that borders on direct thematic declaration, though mostly earned through specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature—"scheming pacifist with pockets full of methods and heartaches" establishes voice. Diction remains character-particular through metaphor ("eyes bright with the kindled stiffness," "breathed as if pulling her lungs through nettles"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Mara's lines pursuing resistance then yielding. Deduction for occasional elevated register that stretches plausibility ("inward hymn," "limned a discipline") and some filter-verb reliance ("I saw in the swirls") that could be tighter, though overall voice holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with layered imagery, but several prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She had held a man so he could die faster, and her throat had wanted to keep him instead" restates what cellular memory just revealed), template cadence in the ritual sequence ("I called it...I reached for...I felt the..."), and elevated diction clusters ("limned," "braided but unbroken," "tremble passing through me") that occasionally obscure momentum. The broken pin as recurring concrete anchor works well. Figurative language density in the opening and ritual beats borders on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching, though the sanctuary's dust-to-rivers transformation is specific and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cellular memory method offers a fresh angle on conflict resolution, grounded through the broken music box and embodied ritual rather than talk-therapy abstraction. The sanctuary as reappearing neutral ground and the dust-pattern tactical map provide specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk in the lyric-dense style heightens stakes without full obscurity. Deduction for the premise leaning toward therapeutic intervention templates (teaching resentment release, body keeps score) that, while transformed through music box mechanics and the grandmother's "anchor storms" backstory, still echo contemporary self-help frameworks in the core "cells remember" conceit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "scheming pacifist" frames the opening and drives the convince-Mara plan through the music box ritual. Character makes key choices: demonstrating with their own father-memory, reframing Mara's resistance, and guiding the stone-mapping. Present across all three gates (setup, middle ritual, closure guidance) with causal pressure that narrows Mara's options. Modest penalty for the scheming aspect being more told (opening self-description) than shown through specific deceptive tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken music box cylinder pin appears in three distinct beats: introduced as "teeth tired of harm," demonstrated in protagonist's own cellular work ("the broken pin glittered like a thorn had learned mercy"), and placed against Mara's sternum at closure to enable her release. Its brokenness is causally necessary—"some mechanisms work only after refusal is ruined"—and the pin's shift from harm-instrument to mercy-catalyst directly shapes the ending. High integration with visible cost tied to the object's transformed function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named once ("something like shifting grace began to flow without notes") and implied through the sanctuary's transformations (dust patterns, rage absorption) and Mara's physical yielding. It shapes tactics by enabling the cellular memory work to proceed, but remains more atmospheric principle than on-page constraint. Present in setup (sanctuary mechanics), middle (ritual effects), and closure (Mara's release reads as grace in motion), meeting two-of-three gates with lyric reprise, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary "reappears when needed" is established through Mara's testimony ("It had saved her once from arrows, appearing like a door where there had been none. Now it appeared again") and enables the entire meeting. The attribute constrains by creating the only neutral space where Mara would agree to meet, with cost visible in her vulnerability ("If this is a trick, make it gentle"). Present in setup and middle, shaping the primary tactical choice, though its mechanics remain somewhat convenient without on-page price for its reappearance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Convince" drives the entire narrative arc from the opening plan through the cellular memory demonstration to Mara's final yielding. The action is irreplaceable—not battle, treaty, or escape, but persuasion through embodied ritual. It appears across all three gates: stated goal, executed through stone-mapping and confession sequence, and achieved when Mara places the box against her sternum. The method (cellular rather than rational argument) makes the convince-action specific and causally necessary, with visible cost in mutual vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through cellular memory" is signaled early ("I intend to change the way your cells remember the world") and mechanics matter: "listen with skin instead of ears," protagonist's own body demonstration ("I breathed and invited my cells to uncoat the memory"), and Mara's muscles remembering the field where she held a dying man. The method shapes the attempt by requiring physical touch and bodily listening rather than verbal persuasion. Present across all gates with causal pressure, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract without detailed on-page cost for how cells "speak" or "answer."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" actively pressures choices: its hush numbs Mara's sabre, it "absorbed" rage and "feeding it back as a heat," its floor-dust trembles into tactical maps of withdrawal, and "reality tilted...and the sanctuary steadied it." The space enables the cellular work by creating conditions where "time here is braided but unbroken." Present in all three gates, supplies resources (rage absorption, tactical mapping) that directly affect outcome, and its soundlessness becomes the "preferred music" at closure. High integration with visible constraint and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is mentioned twice ("while reality shifts outside" as backdrop and "while reality shifts, banners fluttered") but functions more as atmospheric condition than active clock. The timeframe enables the sanctuary's pause ("long enough to release a war") and Mara's generals feel "a quiet" beyond walls, but no specific time pressure tightens decisions on the page. Present in setup and closure periphery with thematic weight, but the shifting itself doesn't alter protagonist tactics or force tempo changes, landing mid-band as functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To teach resentment to release" is the stated motivation ("This was where I would attempt...to teach resentment to release") and dramatized through conflicted choices: protagonist must first release their own father-grief, risks that Mara will reject the method, and navigates her resistance ("Do not ask me to forget"). Friction appears between the goal and cost—protagonist must model vulnerability, Mara must surrender her "citadel." Present across all gates with visible trade-offs and causally linked to the ending when "resentment stepped back, almost relieved." Strong integration with embodied cost.</comment>
