<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied contradictions like "I felt small, uncredentialed, and truer than the weeks I had rented cleverness from machines." The unstrapping moment dramatizes internal conflict through physical action with visible cost. Backstory fragments (grandmother's teaching, city memories) anchor in present stimuli and tilt stance via micro-choices. Minor slip: the keystone interaction lacks sufficient resistance to fully earn the final shift, though the renunciation of assistive charms provides credible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density builds through recurring motifs (mist walking, lingering luminance, brilliant dimness) that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (underachieving mage, icebound spire, automated world). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist leaves the keystone unpossessed, carries home "handmade silence," and practices "waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened"—a stance crystallization with felt cost (rejecting city efficiency, accepting underachievement). One meaningful deepening occurs when unstrapping the assistive pack forecloses reliance on automation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spire's micro-setting—frozen archways, hanging garden, cracked quartz pedestal—constrains choice by requiring mist walking and frames the protagonist's approach to the keystone. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: "silence pressed against my ears like a gloved hand," "beading on my lashes, teaching me how slow seeing could be." The keystone's "lingering luminance" charges the final image when it "remained, unpossessed yet shared." Tool (boots, pack) and body anchor spatial choreography throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple versus automated cleverness—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist unstrapps the assistive charms, forfeiting marketable correctness. One meaningful turn: removing the pack narrows options, leaving only "shivering breath and the listening cold." Cost is legible: "I had come to find the sacred in the simple, and what I found was a way to hold small things without selling them." Agency operates through renunciation and endurance. Minor cap: the keystone interaction could press harder before yielding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: chipped bowl, bruised fruit, river mud anchor "sacred might mean nothing more arcane than attention given without hurry." The keystone's function—"accommodates impossibilities" by enfolding absence until presence arrives—dramatizes rather than states the theme. Final image offers a resonant answer: "I practiced waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened, and I wrote with absence beside me." No stated moral; the spire's hush versus the city's automated studios charges the ending without sermon. Recurring motifs (lingering luminance, mist walking, brilliant dimness) reweight the premise without convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "a broom leans, how a kettle breathes, and how light lingers after light." POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and controlled, with purposeful compression ("mist walking meant trusting weight to moments"). Rhythmic modulation under pressure: short declaratives during the keystone encounter ("I waited, counting my heartbeat") accelerate into longer, breath-like cadences at closure. Minor consideration: a few elevated turns ("accommodates impossibilities") approach the edge of the character's established lexicon but remain voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with scene needs. Minor loop detected: "brilliant dimness" recurs across multiple beats without escalating pressure each time (−0.3). Figurative language is dense in the spire sequence—"moonmilk saturated into stone," "thin bridges unrolling like breath"—but remains coherent and pattern-taught. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. One scaffold phrase: "I understood then" slightly externalizes realization rather than dramatizing it (−0.2). Strong propulsion overall, no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "underachieving mage" in an automated-creativity world is a non-obvious angle that drives the entire arc. Specificity elevates: "mist walking" as embodied practice, "lingering luminance" as concrete visual logic, backyard memories versus curated streams. The transformation test passes—plot and emotion require this exact combination of automation anxiety and embodied attention. Proximity check clear; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/lyric with taught pattern) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band). Minor limit: the "icebound spire" and "automated ateliers" carry slight genre familiarity, though execution transforms them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character present from the opening line and drives two key turns: the decision to ascend via mist walking and the choice to unstrap the assistive pack. Final action—setting the keystone back and carrying "handmade silence" home—closes the arc. Setup early, middle development (unstrapping), and payoff (returning home with new practice) all present. Causal pressure moderate: choices narrow options but escalation is gentle. Cost visible: forsaking marketable cleverness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Object appears in two distinct beats: discovered on the pedestal with "lingering luminance," then lifted to reveal new pathways, and finally set back as an act of renunciation. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Specificity high: "veined with pearly frost," "moonmilk saturated into stone." Closure linkage strong: leaving it unpossessed ("not everything precious needs relocating") enacts the theme. Cost tied to the element: choosing not to possess or relocate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concept shapes stakes and tactics across the arc. "Lingering luminance" is the keystone's primary attribute, enabling the protagonist to see backyard memories and feel alignment. It reappears in the ending: "I practiced waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened" and "light lingers after light." Setup early (keystone description), development (triggering memory), payoff (final practice). Causal pressure moderate: it enables rather than constrains. Irreplaceability high; the exact phrasing charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attribute labels the spire and keystone's function: "The spire accommodates impossibilities" and "The keystone, which accommodates impossibilities, did not unlock power; it enfolded absence until presence showed up." It constrains choice subtly—protagonist must trust rather than command. Setup present, development (keystone interaction), payoff (understanding). Cost connection light: the attribute frames the protagonist's stance but does not impose a visible price. Swappability moderate; "holds paradoxes" or similar could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Action drives a major turn: unstrapping the pack forecloses reliance on automated assistance and leaves the protagonist with only "shivering breath and the listening cold." Setup (carrying the pack), development (the moment of removal with audible "small regret"), and payoff (returning home with slack straps as reminder). Causal pressure high: the act narrows options and alters tactics for the keystone interaction. Cost visible: loss of marketable correctness. Irreplaceability strong; no synonym action would carry the same physical and symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Method signaled early via grandmother's teaching: "trusting weight to moments, treading the transient as if it were faithful stone." Used in two beats: ascending to the spire and descending home. Returns with reweighted meaning at closure: "not as travel now, but as listening: stepping gently from thought to thought." Setup, development (ascent), and payoff (descent as embodied practice) all present. Causal pressure moderate: it enables access but does not impose constraint. Specificity high; mechanics matter and shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting pressures every choice: the doorless landing requires mist walking, the frozen archways house the keystone, the open arches admit mist that teaches "slow seeing." Setup immediate, development (navigation and interaction), payoff (view from the rim, returning down). Spatial choreography clear and micro-setting (pavilion, pedestal) alters tactics. Cost connection present: the climb and cold impose physical and attentional price. Strong closure linkage: the spire's hush contrasts with the city's studios in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe frames the inciting context—"when creativity gets automated"—and motivates the protagonist's rejection of "factories that composed sonnets while boiling tea." Present in setup (opening lines) and payoff (contrast with automated studios at closure). Development weak: the timeframe does not tighten mid-scene decisions or create a live clock. Swappability moderate: any post-automation era would serve. Cost connection oblique: the protagonist's underachievement gains meaning from the era, but no on-page moment hinges on temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated early—"to find the sacred in the simple"—and dramatized through conflicted choices: ascending without assistive charms, speaking "weathered words" to the keystone, setting it back unpossessed. Friction visible: the pull to "rent cleverness from machines" versus trusting "handmade silence." Setup, development (keystone interaction), and payoff (final practice) all present. Causal pressure high: the motivation shapes every tactic and the renunciation at closure. Cost legible: forsaking marketability and accepting underachievement. Irreplaceability strong; no other want would generate this arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone coheres through turns: "brilliant dimness" is established early ("as if evening had learned to glow without glare"), modulates with pressure (the keystone's "lingering luminance"), and charges the final image ("I practiced waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened"). Setup, development, and payoff present. The oxymoron holds steady yet intensifies: from external description to internalized practice. Causal pressure moderate: tone frames perception but does not constrain action. Specificity high; the exact phrase is irreplaceable and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>
