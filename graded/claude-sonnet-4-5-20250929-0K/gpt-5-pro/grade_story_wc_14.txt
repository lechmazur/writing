<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is rich and idiosyncratic ("incandescent restraint," measuring lamp hums to recover time), but agency remains observational rather than decisional—the daily routines of charting and gilding never face a test that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (staying vs. the valley's silence) but never crystallizes into a micro-choice that alters tactics. Embodiment is strong (kneeling to whisper to bark, warming hands above kettle), yet the final image of waiting for footsteps defers rather than earns stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the daily ritual of charting lamp variations and binding invented histories accumulates density and recurrence. Orientation anchors (mountaintop kiosk, bonsai maze, post-silence) arrive cleanly within the first third. However, closure reads as deferral—"Until then I continue"—rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the protagonist's stance does not visibly foreclose a path or reweight prior material, and the cost of staying remains asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bonsai maze, fluorescent lamp, and kiosk function as micro-setting that constrains daily ritual and charges imagery throughout (blossoms refracting light, paths that "lean," sap fragrance steadying the protagonist). Spatial choreography is coherent, sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's archival bias, and the labyrinth's protective shade and gesturing pines participate in the closure image. The mountaintop isolation and post-silence emptiness pressure the protagonist's choice to remain, meeting the constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving textures of lost time through lamp-charting and gilding—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure is steady (power falters, valley silence, no visitors) but does not tighten; the protagonist's actions (charting, binding, whispering to trees) are repeated without a reversal or deepening that narrows options. The ending defers resolution ("until footsteps return") rather than enacting a trade-off or renunciation with on-page cost, leaving escalation flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as custody, restraint as devotion, the archive as vigil—emerges organically from lamp-charting, gilding, and invented histories without overt statement. The bonsai's gestures and the lamp's hum recur with shifting weight, and "incandescent restraint" is enacted rather than declared. However, the final image ("a custodian of small brightness the silence has not learned to refuse") offers a lyric summary rather than a non-literal reconfiguration that reweights the central question with undeniable cost, capping thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric-meditative syntax, precise sensory selection ("apricots and sawdust," "gold that smells faintly of lemons"), and perceptual bias (charting minutes, refracting light) anchored in the stationer's archival attention. Psychic distance remains stable; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("a bell without a ringer, just orbiting hush") and patterned ellipsis are taught and legible. Minor diction slips into elevated register ("glissando," "scriptorium") appear but do not break voice coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("minutes keep the pulse company," "drama would snap these fragile hours like thread"). However, metaphor density approaches saturation in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, and several paraphrase loops recur: "charting the faint hum" / "chart peaks of memory," "invented histories" restated across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("I record… I note… I tuck…"), flattening propulsion. Closurebeat remains clean, capping penalty at −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief-as-archival-practice, lamp-charting as memory-recovery—is specific and fresh, and the mountaintop bonsai maze offers vivid spatial particularity. However, the emotional arc (solitary custodian awaiting return) follows a familiar elegiac template without a decisive transformation: the protagonist's role and stance at the end mirror the opening, reducing ingenuity. The method (fluorescent-hum variations) is inventive but underexploited in causal terms, leaving the premise partly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer frames the piece and performs the core actions (gilding, charting, binding), appearing in setup, middle ritual beats, and the closure image. However, choices remain observational and repetitive rather than decisional; no on-page turn traces to a stationer-specific constraint or trade-off that alters tactics. Present across beats but replaceable with "archivist" or "keeper" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The battered notepad is handled in at least three beats: charting at dawn, noting scents and blooms, binding sheaves. It recurs with consistent function (ledger for invented histories) and participates in the closure image ("handwriting waiting"). However, its meaning does not reweight; it remains a tool rather than a charged object whose changing state alters options. Functional across beats, but swappable with "journal" or "ledger."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Invented histories shape the protagonist's daily stake (drafting pasts for the empty post office and baker's oven), appear in setup, middle exposition, and closure ("the handwriting waiting"). The concept drives the archival method and provides the thematic frame (courtesy, mercy, keeping faith). It constrains the protagonist's ritual and charges the final image of pages waiting for footsteps, meeting causal pressure and closure tests.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is enacted through meticulous charting, note-taking, and patient observation ("numbers patient as stones," "graphs neat as fences"). The trait appears in setup and middle beats, enabling the lamp-measurement method. However, it does not visibly constrain or cost a choice; the protagonist's diligence never faces a test where studiousness must be traded off or defended. Present and consistent but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Refract" recurs as the central perceptual and thematic action: blossoms refract light into confetti, dew beads refract wishes into "invisible grammars," invented histories refract counsel. It shapes the protagonist's method (light as medium for memory), appears in setup and multiple middle beats, and charges the closure image (pages as "small wings" catching sky). The verb is specific and irreplaceable, driving the story's lyric logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Charting the fluorescent lamp's hum is signaled early, detailed in the opening third ("graphs neat as fences"), and motivates the invented-history method. The lamp's faltering in the middle provides a micro-complication. However, the mechanics (how hum variations encode time) remain abstract; the method does not alter tactics at closure or create a visible cost. Present and thematically apt but underexploited causally.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth pressures choices throughout: paths open and "lean" to guide, blossoms refract light for the protagonist's work, sap fragrance steadies after power falters, and the maze's protective shade participates in the closure ritual. The mountaintop isolation enforces the protagonist's solitude and stakes (no visitors, valley silence). Setting is indispensable to the archival logic and charges the final image of pages waiting among pines.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The post-silence timeframe is established early ("the morning after the town goes silent") and recurs as context for the protagonist's vigil. It shapes the dominant stake (preserving pre-silence textures) and appears in closure ("until footsteps return"). However, time does not tighten on the page; the protagonist's rituals are iterative rather than urgent, and no live clock alters tactics. Present and coherent but not pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to collect lost textures drives every beat: charting lamp hums, drafting invented histories, gilding pages, asking trees which hour to save. It is dramatized through ritual actions and generates friction (power falters, no visitors arrive, restraint required). The closure image directly ties to this desire (pages waiting for the town's return). The motivation is essential and felt, though the cost of staying is implied rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Incandescent restraint is enacted throughout: controlled breath when tempted to shout, careful gilding in silence, whispering to bark rather than commanding, sentences "scarcely louder than grass." The tone modulates with micro-pressures (lamp faltering, bonsai shivering) and charges the closure image of "small brightness the silence has not learned to refuse." Coherent, purposeful, and woven into syntax and pacing; the final restraint reconfigures the opening posture.</comment>
