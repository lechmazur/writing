<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority is richly textured through sensory particulars (salt taste, flame lean, crystal facets), and his motivation to recover deleted memory drives micro-choices across beats. The embodied perception is strong—"air that tastes of iron rain"—and his actions (exhuming cubes, tapping the ear bone) align with his quest. However, the woman's laugh and the deleted memory remain abstract; no contradictory impulse complicates his resolve, and the final choice feels more like completion of a ritual than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (whale, crystals, gravity pockets, coffee grounds) and the final altar-building ritual reweights the opening stillness with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors who (Ilya), where (harbor/chamber/whale), and when (after the beaching) by the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the town "remember[s] itself by the shore"—but the cost remains oblique; no specific forfeiture or visible trade-off marks the ending, only atmospheric charge. Causality is elliptical but taught early via the coffee-ground spiral and gravity-pocket logic, and the piece sustains its pattern to the end without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the salt crystal chamber's sensory particulars (iron-rain air, hanging crystals, brine troughs) constrain Ilya's exhumation and the gravity pockets shape his path and the flame's lean. The micro-setting (the chamber, the whale's ear bone) supplies the resources that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across pier, chamber, and strand. The whale's vestibule and the tideline altar are not postcard description but active participants in the closure ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to find where deleted memories go—is signaled early and guides Ilya's moves through chamber and shore. Pressure accumulates through the gravity-pocket constraint, the coffee-ground spiral pointing him beneath, and the cube's wildflower memory sweating back into voice. The final altar-building is a deepening rather than a reversal, and the cost (building the altar, waiting among lanterns) is felt but not explicitly foreclosing a live option. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is sufficient, and the ritual satisfies that bar, though the stakes remain more atmospheric than concrete choice-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory's migration and communal grief—emerges through particulars (the council's licensed forgetting, salt's listening, the whale as vestibule) without moralizing. The final image (the town remembering itself, voices falling like rain) offers a resonant answer to the central question: deleted memories do not vanish but migrate and can be summoned. The pressed wildflower's transformation and the salt-as-listener motif charge the closure without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "Salt listens better than machines" edges toward abstraction, but it's voiced by the memory-echo, not authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is strong (flame lean, coffee grounds, crystal facets as minnows under glass). Diction is lyric and controlled—"gleaming silence, salted with everything the town cannot carry awake"—and rhythm modulates with the beats (short sentences at the cube's sweating, longer cadences in the chamber). The woman's disembodied voice ("memories do not die, they migrate") is brief and does not constitute head-hopping; it reads as echo within the cube's moment. No filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is densely imagistic with high information load ("Crystals hang like unfinished bells, ringing only if you touch them with careful skin"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, two adjacent sentences in the opening third effectively restate the whale's gravitational effect ("flame licks sideways… as if weight has shifted" / "harbor is riddled with pockets of gravity") without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 paraphrase penalty. Minor template cadence in the council sequence ("workers ran wires… machine drank the ache… redacted faces, erased lullabies") but the pattern is brief and does not pervade. No major loop or scaffold artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of beached whale, gravity pockets, salt crystallization, and deleted memory is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock grief-ritual templates. The lantern-lighter's occupation and the coffee-ground divination integrate organically rather than as token quirks. The final altar of crystals among kelp ribbons feels inevitable in hindsight, and the piece commits fully to its lyric premise. The risk—layering multiple metaphors (whale, salt, gravity, wildflower) without causal scaffolding—succeeds because the Accumulative lens is taught early and held, though the piece remains on the safer side of bold by relying on atmosphere over high-stakes decision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ilya appears early, drives all beats (reads grounds, unlocks chamber, exhumes cubes, builds altar), and his choices shape the arc. He is present in the closure beat (tapping the ear bone, waiting among lanterns). However, his final action is more ritual completion than a decision that narrows live options; the cost is atmospheric rather than a visible trade-off. Two gates (setup, closure) are strong; middle development is present but could be more causally decisive. Score reflects solid integration with minor swappability in the middle moves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pressed wildflowers are introduced mid-story within the exhumed cube, return with reweighted meaning when the cube sweats and the voice speaks, and are tucked into Ilya's vest for transport to the whale. They appear in at least two distinct beats (discovery, voice-return) and contribute to closure by charging the altar. Setup is late (past first third), triggering a −0.3 penalty, but development and payoff are solid. The flowers' specificity (petal veins etched in salt) and their role in the memory's materialization elevate the score, though earlier planting would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gravity pockets are signaled early (flame lean, harbor "riddled with pockets"), shape Ilya's route via the coffee-ground spiral, and govern the cube's sweating moment ("when gravity slackens"). The concept appears in setup, middle (the trough where new crystals grid the brine, the pocket passing), and closure (lanterns lean again, acknowledging pockets that shepherd him). The mechanism is more atmospheric than a hard constraint that narrows options, but it does enable the memory's release and guide the final path. Three gates present; causal pressure is moderate. Score reflects solid thematic integration with room for more visible tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute "fluctuates mysteriously" is stated early and governs the gravity pockets' behavior throughout (flame lean, trough pull, room tilt, lanterns acknowledging). It constrains Ilya's timing (he waits until gravity slackens for the cube to sweat) and enables the memory's release. The fluctuation is present in setup, middle (pocket passes, room tilts), and closure (lanterns burn straight, then lean). However, the cost is implied rather than visible; Ilya adapts but does not visibly forfeit an option due to the fluctuation. Two strong gates (setup, middle) and thematic presence at closure, but the causal pressure and on-page trade-off are modest.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ilya's exhumation of the cubes from the salt chamber is the pivotal middle action that delivers the pressed-wildflower cube and sets up the memory's return. The action is signaled (he "begins to exhume small cubes from the silted rack with tongs"), executed on the page with sensory detail (each cube clouded, one holds wildflowers), and its result (the cube sweating, voice returning) drives the closure ritual. Setup and development are strong; the exhumation is irreplaceable—without it, no cube reaches the whale. The action does not itself appear in the final beat (that is the altar-building), so full closure participation is indirect. Score reflects high middle-beat centrality with minor swappability in the final ritual.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coffee grounds appear early ("patterns in coffee grounds swirling in his tin mug"), are read via his mother's teaching, and point Ilya beneath the pier to the chamber. The method shapes his route and the spiral recurs as a guide ("he follows the spiral to a trough"). Present in setup and middle development, but absent from the closure beat; the grounds do not reappear at the whale. Two gates (setup, middle) allow eligibility to ~6.0; the lyric reprise is missing. The method is somewhat swappable (another divination tool could serve), and the mechanics are told rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber is introduced early (beneath the workshed), supplies the arena for the exhumation and memory-release beats, and its sensory particulars (iron-rain air, hanging crystals, brine troughs) are integral to Ilya's actions. The chamber constrains his choices (he must unlock it, kneel, use tongs) and its gravity-pocket mechanics enable the cube's sweating. Present in setup, middle (entire exhumation sequence), and indirectly in closure (the cubes carried to the whale originated here). The chamber is nearly irreplaceable; no other location offers the salt-memory synthesis. Score reflects strong causal pressure and three-gate presence, with minor penalty for the closure beat shifting to the whale strand.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the whale beaches" is established in the opening sentence and governs the entire story's context (the council's licensed forgetting, Ilya's route to the chamber, the final altar at the whale). It is present in setup and thematically in closure (the beached monument, the town remembering). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; "after" is a backdrop rather than a pressure. Two gates (setup, closure presence) allow ~5.5–6.0; the middle development does not show the timeframe altering tactics. The element is somewhat swappable (another communal trauma could frame the forgetting).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation—to find where deleted memories go—is signaled early ("he comes… to find where deleted memories go after they are stripped"), drives his chamber descent and exhumation, and is answered at closure (memories swim with whales, he builds the altar). The desire faces friction (he cannot name the woman, his pocket keeps "a thin rectangle of absence") and is tested across beats (reading grounds, exhuming cubes, waiting for gravity to slacken). Present in setup, middle, and closure. The motivation is somewhat generic (quest for lost memory), and the cost is oblique rather than a visible trade-off, but the sustained focus and final ritual earn solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone "gleaming silence" is established in the opening ("the harbor learns a new stillness… gleaming silence") and recurs in the chamber ("chamber keeps its gleaming silence") and implicitly at closure (lanterns burn straight, the whale exhales). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (the cube's sweating moment adds brightness, the altar-building restores stillness). Present in setup, middle, and closure image. However, the tone is more atmospheric than a constraint or charge that alters a choice; it supports rather than drives. Three gates present; causal pressure is modest. Score reflects solid thematic coherence with room for the tone to more actively shape the final beat.</comment>
