<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied perception ("my chest feels hollow as gourds," the tip "warms when the arches hum"), and her micro-choices under pressure—launching at the right moment, fitting the arrow tip to the wound—are motivated by her inherited legacy and drive to restore resilience. The mother's bequest (clasp and arrow tip) functions as both motive anchor and constraint that shapes the climactic action. Minor deduction: the protagonist's competence is high throughout with little struggle or mistake that compounds before resolution, slightly flattening the arc of genuine difficulty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered imagery (gravity inversion, water-flow navigation, echo-braiding) that converges at the climax when the arrow tip repairs the arch's wound and "every echo, patient and bruised, returns its voice." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist fits the tip, the chamber tightens, resilience is redefined as "a hinge that knows how to slow falling," and she descends with a seed and a pulse-map. Cost is felt in the shaking hands and the conceptual shift from spring-back to slowed falling. Orientation anchors (orchard pilot, gravity invert, floating arches) land within the first ~100 words. The lens holds cleanly and the ending reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, inverted gravity, and upward-running water are vividly established and constrain every choice: the protagonist launches when pears loosen, navigates by water flow, and works inside a root-sphere accessible only during inversion. The broken arrow tip (micro-object-as-setting) heats and leaps at the wound, charging the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency ("drips crawl upward along my arms like silver insects") and the setting's rules are learned through action. The arches' singing and the root-sphere's light-and-sap interior provide both atmosphere and causal scaffolding for the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring resilience to the orchards—is signaled early ("the planet were trying to speak while biting its tongue," trees "bow and tremble, and some do not spring back") and tightens when the protagonist discovers the shard drinking light and bleeding echoes into silence. Agency is clear: she shoulders through the veil, fits the tip to the wound, and the system responds. The escalation is Accumulative: pressure builds through the hour's arrival, the upward flight, the discovery of the chamber, and the repair. Cost is visible in her shaking hands and the undeniable shift in resilience's definition. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: resilience shifts from "bowed and sprang back" to "a hinge that knows how to slow falling," a non-literal answer earned by the protagonist's discovery and repair. The broken arrow tip is not a weapon but "a plug shaped by ancestors who trusted echoes to finish sentences," transforming the inherited legacy from regret-pointer to functional key. The final image—seedlings whispering "we can keep going now"—reweights the opening premise without stating a moral. The gathered echoes (sound as memory, pressure, and seed-catalyst) unify concept and theme organically. No thematic echo or summary intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with consistent perceptual signature: "whirling silence," "hollow as gourds," "echoes dart...stitching little ladders of sound." POV remains stable (first-person singular, present-tense launch framed by past reflection). The prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during the repair ("I open my pocket and the broken arrow tip leaps"), longer rhythmic swells during the flight. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction: a few lines approach decorative density ("drips crawl upward along my arms like silver insects") without full integration into immediate choice, though they remain voice-coherent and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer breath-units during ascent and tighter syntax at the repair. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled and mostly embodied ("pears lift sighing," "arches open their throats"), though a few ornamental moments ("drips crawl upward...like silver insects," "knotted ropes of air") edge toward overwriting without disrupting momentum. Propulsion is strong through the climax, with clear sequence and no scaffolding artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity inversion, water-flow navigation, echo-accelerated plant growth, and the arrow-tip-as-ancestral-plug is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise, following the implications of sound-as-seed-catalyst and resonance-as-resilience through to the repair and redefinition. The final reconfiguration—resilience as a hinge rather than a spring—feels inevitable in hindsight and transforms the inherited legacy without retreating to safe middle ground. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, dense imagistic layering) heightens stakes and coherence. A fresh inflection on familiar orchard/eco-repair tropes through speculative mechanics grounded in embodied action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The intrepid orchard pilot frames the opening, launches at the right moment (first pears loosen), navigates by water flow, discovers the wound, and fits the arrow tip—her decisions create every key turn and the closure would collapse without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears in the opening (inheritance, pointing forward), heats during flight, clicks against the clasp, leaps at the wound, and is fitted to repair the arch—evolving from regret-pointer to functional plug across four distinct beats and charging the closure with specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A gathering of echoes shapes stakes (singing changed, thin, arch wounded), tactics (navigating by echo-ladders, understanding sound pools as seeds), and the climax (echoes return their voice to the braid after repair). Removing this concept would break the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Echo-accelerated plant growth is discovered in the root-sphere ("pressure turns to pulse, and the pulse to seeds"), explains why the singing matters, and is paid off visually when pears blossom back into fruit after repair. The trait constrains the protagonist's understanding and charges the ending's ecological recovery.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Discover drives the entire arc: the protagonist discovers the root-sphere, the shard wound, and the arrow tip's true function. Each discovery redefines options and culminates in the repair. Swapping "discover" for another action would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("I learned navigating by water flow"), used during the ascent ("I lean into the river that runs to sky, navigating by water flow"), and implicitly informs her approach to the veil and root-sphere. The method shapes her path and is tied to the inversion mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches provides the gravity-inversion mechanic, the echo-resonance chambers, and the spatial logic of the climb. The arches sing, house the root-sphere, and are wounded by the shard. Setting pressures every choice and supplies the resources for closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hour of gravity inversion tightens all decisions: the protagonist launches when it arrives, navigates upward during it, and completes the repair before gravity "remembers itself." The timeframe is tracked ("the hour arrives," "gravity remembers itself") and shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>To find the source of resilience is dramatized through inherited objects, the protagonist's launch into the inversion, and the climactic discovery that resilience is not just spring but "a hinge that knows how to slow falling." The motivation drives every beat and is conflicted with risk (shaking hands, cold hum).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Whirling silence appears in the opening, recurs at the hour's arrival ("the whirling silence that makes our chests feel hollow"), intensifies at the repair ("my hands shake in the whirling silence"), and modulates with pressure. The tone charges the final image and coheres through all turns.</comment>
