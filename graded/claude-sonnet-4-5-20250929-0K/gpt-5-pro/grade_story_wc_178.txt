<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The astronomer's frugality and empirical devotion create a coherent interior logic that drives his choices throughout. His embodied actions—counting instruments "like coins he dared not spend," kneeling with the tile—ground motivation in physical gestures rather than labels. The final choice to place the tile and speak the vow arises organically from prior causality, though the renunciation lacks a felt interpersonal or moral cost that would elevate the stakes. Internal contradiction is present but muted: his "empirically ironic faith" wavers only briefly before the bronze eyelid, limiting the pressure of genuine doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (astronomer, palace observatory, twilight between regimes) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The accumulative-textural lens holds: the astronomer assembles schematic representations, aligns the tile, and the culminating gesture—touching the bronze eyelid—unlocks the passage and seals the covenant with visible cost (he reduces himself to "curves and sums" and pledges ongoing stewardship). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ash mirrors his diagrams and the ceiling river returns to stone, crystallizing his vow with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the palace "seemed to read him," tightening the reciprocal stake before the final ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The palace's dusky corridors, chipped lapis ceiling, and bronze eyelid constrain the astronomer's movements and choices: he aligns the tile to painted claws, follows the seam of mortar-sparked mica, and the eyelid's warmth signals the passage's opening. Sensory detail—"boiling glue and cedar," torchlight pooling—is filtered through the astronomer's patient, frugal perception. The micro-setting of the niche (ash basin, stylus rack, charred wax slab) directly enables the final ritual and charges the closure image when the ash turns to mirrored night. Spatial choreography remains clear across the hall and hidden passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown through encrypted devotion—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ceiling river meets the tile's center and the bronze eyelid warms, narrowing the astronomer's options to a leap of faith that his empirical method has led him to. The covenant is sealed through his agency (placing the tile, speaking the vow, drawing the diagrams) with a visible cost: he pledges to "maintain the balance of numbers even when banners changed," forgoing allegiance to any regime. Coincidence does not resolve; the protagonist's preparation and ritual earn the passage's opening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the astronomer's empirically ironic faith: his devotion is encrypted in arithmetic, and the palace itself becomes a partner in meaning-making ("the palace seemed to read him"). The final image—his figure "reduced to curves and sums" and the request to "uncloak only what a careful heart can keep"—reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the tension between empirical method and faith. The covenant's terms (maintaining balance between regimes, acknowledging the unknown with humility) avoid tidy resolution and invite reflection on stewardship and attention as forms of piety. No late motifs are introduced; the magic square and palace proportions carry thematic weight throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; the narrative distance modulates with the astronomer's heightened attention during the ritual without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and period-appropriate ("patient dust," "eventless spaces where meaning collects"), filtering the palace through the astronomer's scholarly, frugal perceptual signature. The astronomer's lexicon of "ratios and paths," "schematic representations," and "grammar of stone" feels character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, though at peak moments the prose occasionally drifts toward decorative phrasing ("the mosaics around him unclasped their scenes") that slightly distances the reader from immediacy. No dialogue appears; all pressure operates through gesture and interior resolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings diversify across the piece. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "a river of ash where constellations once glowed," "their histories were joining budgets to avoid collapse." Two localized slips: "It was an empirically ironic faith" borders on thesis statement, and "the passage did not open with miracle, but with the practiced thrift of doors long kept" repeats the frugality motif without advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "he spoke with the unknown" is restated as "he began to speak with the unknown" within three paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the sequence "He drew…not predicting…only offering…to ensure," but does not pervade. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or ritual progress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian setting, magic square tile, and astronomical devotion feels specific and non-generic. The framing of faith as "piety with proofs" and the palace as a partner in meaning-making offer fresh angles on scholar-mystic tropes. The astronomer's vow to maintain balance "between regimes" grounds the premise in political liminality, avoiding the safety middle. The "empirically ironic" stance and the final self-reduction to "curves and sums" feel earned rather than imported. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet, ritual closure, though the overall arc follows a recognizable scholar-quest template without bold subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer is introduced early and his frugality shapes his careful counting of instruments, his alignment of the tile, and his final vow to maintain balance with minimal resources. His choices—kneeling, touching the eyelid, placing the tile in the ash—drive the ritual's unfolding and the passage's opening. Frugality constrains his approach (he "dared not spend" his instruments, his hunger is "not for bread or coin") and informs his final pledge to avoid waste. The trait is essential across at least two beats (instrument counting, covenant sealing) and charges the closure when he offers a "ledger of eclipses" rather than predictions. Removing "frugal" would weaken the thematic coherence and the specificity of his devotional method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears early ("On his palm rested a magic square tile"), is aligned to the painted claws mid-story, touches the bronze eyelid to open the passage, and is placed in the ash basin at closure where it transforms the ash into mirrored night. Its numbers are "patient as planets" and serve as the encrypted devotion that only the sky will read. The tile's sums are whispered "as if they were names" and the palace's proportions are translated to match its ratios, making it essential to the ritual logic. Removing the tile would break the causal chain from diagram to covenant. Its glaze and numbers constrain the astronomer's alignment work and charge the final image when the ash mirrors his diagrams.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is named early ("the tile held encrypted devotion, a prayer written in arithmetic") and shapes the astronomer's stake: to communicate with the unknown through numbers rather than words. The concept drives his method—translating palace proportions into ratios, whispering values as vows—and is paid off when the ash basin reflects his diagrams, acknowledging the devotion without decoding it. The phrase "encrypted" recurs at closure ("His vow was an encrypted devotion"), reweighting the opening claim. The concept constrains his tactics (he must use schematic representations, not direct speech) and charges the final image when the unknown "duly acknowledged" his offering. However, the concept functions more as thematic lens than as a tactical pressure that narrows live options with visible cost, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is defined mid-story ("It was an empirically ironic faith, to weigh the invisible in ounces and exacted angles") and resurfaces when "his doubts pull him back, empirically ironic, because the evidence had led exactly to a gesture of faith." The attribute constrains his approach—requiring proof and precision even while pursuing the unfathomable—and creates internal friction at the closure threshold. However, the trait is more often labeled than dramatized through contradictory on-page actions; the astronomer's internal conflict is told ("he felt lifted by the humility") rather than shown through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. It shapes one key beat (the decision to touch the eyelid despite doubt) but lacks a second distinct turn where the irony forces a visible tradeoff or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears in the title of the covenant ("He would uncloak the listening place by moving wordless shapes"), at the climactic moment ("Light drained…and uncloaked a passage"), and in the final spoken vow ("Speak, he said, uncloak only what a careful heart can keep"). The action defines the astronomer's goal and is fulfilled when the mosaics "unclasped their scenes and uncloaked a passage." The verb is specific to the ritual logic (removing concealment through schematic alignment) and charges the final image when he asks the unknown to "uncloak only what a careful heart can keep." Swapping "uncloak" for "reveal" or "open" would dilute the tied-to-textiles imagery and the reciprocal dynamic. The action drives two major beats (passage opening, final vow) and links setup to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Schematic representations" is introduced early ("He worked through schematic representations, tracing on parchment the flow of torches, the tilt of the roof") and recurs at closure ("he began to speak with the unknown through schematic representations"). The method shapes the astronomer's entire approach: translating palace proportions into ratios, aligning the tile to painted claws, drawing the coming year's eclipses in the ash basin. The mechanics matter—his diagrams must match the ceiling map, and the basin reflects "his diagrams, faint but obedient"—and the method is essential to sealing the covenant. Removing it would collapse the ritual's logic. However, the method is more often described than dramatized through tactical failures or adjustments that force mid-scene choices, keeping it high-mid rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as a solemn observatory" anchors the opening line and pressures every choice: the dusky corridors muffle his sandals, the chipped lapis ceiling provides the map he must align the tile to, the bronze eyelid marks the threshold, and the ash basin in the hidden niche enables the final ritual. The palace's liminality (caretakers allow scholars "the hush of uncertain ownership") permits the astronomer's unsanctioned work, and its scent of "boiling glue and cedar" signals repairs suspended between reigns. The setting is essential across at least three beats (entry, alignment, covenant sealing) and charges the closure when "the ceiling river returned to stone" and the astronomer leaves with "covenant sealed by attention." The palace functions as co-agent, reading the astronomer as he reads it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is signaled early ("It was between regimes, when the throne room lay undecided") and recurs at closure ("Between regimes, he pledged to maintain the balance of numbers even when banners changed"). The timeframe grants the astronomer access and urgency—soldiers debate "which banner would rise at dawn"—and his vow to "ensure the palace never paid twice for darkness" depends on regime instability. However, the timeframe functions more as static backdrop than live clock that alters moves; no countdown or regime shift occurs on the page to tighten decisions. The interval enables his work but does not escalate pressure through temporal scarcity or imminent arrival of a new power. It shapes the covenant's terms (maintaining balance across regimes) and charges the thematic resonance, earning mid-to-upper band placement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To seal a covenant with the unknown" is named early ("the hunger that led him tonight was…to seal a covenant with the unknown") and drives every beat: counting instruments, aligning the tile, touching the eyelid, placing the tile in the ash, speaking the vow. The motivation is dramatized through embodied actions—he holds the tile "in both hands," whispers values "as if they were names"—and the covenant's terms (maintaining balance, uncloaking only what a careful heart can keep) are specified on the page. Friction between want and cost is present: sealing the covenant requires him to reduce himself to "curves and sums" and pledge ongoing stewardship with no earthly reward. The motivation is essential to the closure, where "covenant sealed by attention" confirms fulfillment. Minor limitation: the astronomer's desire is never seriously tested by competing wants or interpersonal pressure, muting internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named in the opening paragraph ("The corridors breathed a dusky harmony that muffled his sandals and steadied his resolve") and coheres across the piece: twilight, dim lamps, torchlight pooling, the bronze eyelid "dark as a well." Tone modulates subtly—peaceful patience during alignment, brief doubt before touching the eyelid, solemn finality in the vow—without breaking the contemplative register. The tone charges the final image when "the ash shivered, then stilled, and the ceiling river returned to stone," matching the opening's muffled, patient atmosphere. However, the tone remains largely static; no decisive shift (e.g., from dusky harmony to stark exposure or discord) marks escalation or closure, and the phrase "dusky harmony" itself is ornamental rather than tactically constraining. Coherence is strong, but lack of modulation under pressure limits upper-band eligibility.</comment>
