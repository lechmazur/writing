<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The painter is characterized primarily through lyric declaration rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains abstract—"perceptively calm, yet aware of every tremor"—without showing competing impulses acting simultaneously. Lio's reaction to the mirrors is conveyed through gesture ("gasped and laid the slate"), but the internal experience stays label-only. The borrowed heartbeat device is told rather than dramatized as a constraint that shapes decision-making on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece opens with strong atmospheric anchors (terrace, spring, post-storm) but defers clear causality: the painter arrives, performs a ritual, and leaves without a visible before/after that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The ending asserts transformation ("the people learned to hum the key again") via summary rather than dramatizing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration in the closure beat. Lens ambiguity persists—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density produces a legible tightening at closure. Cost is conceptual (the city's "glance now carried a seam of brightness") but remains abstract and told, not felt in a final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The terrace is vividly rendered with selective detail (puddled skies, slick bricks, silvered wells) and the prism parapet recurs across beats, constraining the painter's method by redirecting sunlight. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or impose a tactical cost; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The final paragraph's "terrace answered with subtle echoes" is atmospheric but does not charge the closure image with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The painter performs the ritual without friction, and the crowd's participation ("bakers tapped their rolling pins") is cooperative rather than conflicted. No on-page reversal narrows options; the mirrors comply, Lio sees the boat return as a "possibility, not a promise," and the painter departs. The resolution is summary-told ("the people learned to hum the key again") rather than earned through protagonist agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A coherent theme—possibility versus promise, the city's pulse as shared heartbeat—emerges through recurring images (locket, wells, parapet). However, the final paragraph makes the theme explicit: "a habit of seeing around corners," "bent obligation into choice and duty into dream." The ending offers thematic commentary rather than a resonant non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars. The borrowed heartbeat recurs but remains symbolic rather than constraining choice or charging the closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyric—"swallows spooled their quiet," "coded lullabies in children's songs"—with consistent compression and patterned diction. POV remains stable third-limited on the painter. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("I am here…to persuade mirrors"). However, perceptual signature is generalized rather than character-specific; the painter's "odd appetite" and "dusky harmony" are asserted labels. Under peak pressure (the ritual itself), diction remains elevated and uniform rather than modulating with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is densely figurative throughout—"swallows spooled their quiet," "a borrowed heartbeat ticked from a small brass locket, engine of an unshared story"—without teaching a pattern or paying it off at closure. Multiple sentences restate the same concept with synonym churn: "possibilities, not a promise" echoed in "bent obligation into choice and duty into dream." Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("They used no chalk, only their hands…"; "Will you lend a beat too, the painter asked…"). The final third accumulates abstractions ("a grafting of patience and hope," "a seam of brightness") that dull momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The frame—mirage painter, borrowed heartbeat, coded lullabies—offers a fresh synthesis of folklore and sensory specificity. The prism parapet and silvered wells are particular to this setting. However, the emotional arc (city learns to see possibility) follows a familiar template: wandering mentor arrives, performs transformative ritual, departs. The ending's summary—"the people learned to hum the key again"—resolves without the non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost that would elevate freshness. Risk-taking in lyric compression is present but does not fully transform the mentor-visit structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The painter arrives, performs the ritual (kneels to Lio, hums coded lullabies, tilts the locket, directs the prism light), and departs. These are actions but not decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under pressure. The painter is introduced early (setup present), participates across beats (middle development), and is mentioned in the ending ("the locket could be heard from the parapet"), satisfying all three gates. However, the painter's role is facilitative rather than conflicted; removing this exact character and substituting another mentor figure would not fundamentally break story logic. The painter's perceptive calm is label-only and does not constrain a choice. Swappability and ornamental use (−0.8 combined) lower the score from the 5.0 baseline for single-gate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears in paragraph two ("the prism parapet after rain threw unsubtle rainbows"), recurs in the ritual ("their hands to grace the air above each well, sketching arcs that redirected sunlight from the prism parapet after rain"), and is reprised in the climax ("A tilt of the painter's wrist sent the prism parapet after rain to splay rainbows across the well"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. The object enables the painter's method by redirecting light, a specific mechanical role. However, it does not constrain a choice or carry visible cost; it functions as a tool used successfully without friction. Closure linkage is indirect (the painter's method succeeds, allowing the ending's transformation). Early signal, beat involvement across two distinct beats, and causal pressure (enabling tactics) lift the score; swappability with another light source and lack of cost connection limit it to the 6.5–7.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early ("a borrowed heartbeat ticked from a small brass locket") and explained (belonged to a bell ringer who traded it for dreams). It recurs when the painter kneels to Lio ("tilted the locket so the heartbeat could be heard"), is invoked as truth-guarantee ("A borrowed heartbeat keeps me from lying"), and is mentioned in the ending ("the locket could be heard from the parapet"). All three gates are present. However, the concept shapes stakes only thematically—truth-telling, shared pulse—rather than altering on-page options or tactics. The painter does not face a choice where the borrowed heartbeat constrains or enables action. It is label-claimed ("because it belongs to another tempo") but not dramatized as a pressure point. Setup, lyric reprise, and beat involvement lift the score above ornamental; lack of causal pressure or cost connection caps it in the 5.0–5.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute appears in paragraph three: "They were perceptively calm, yet aware of every tremor the terrace returned." It is mentioned once, as a label, without enabling or constraining an on-page action. The painter's ritual proceeds smoothly; no moment shows the cost or tradeoff of this trait. Setup gate is present (early mention), but development and payoff gates are absent. The trait could be swapped for another calm descriptor without structural impact. Ornamental use and label-only application (−1.0 combined) lower the score to the mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The painter's actions include arriving, kneeling, humming, tilting the locket, sketching arcs, and rising "with grace" before departing. "Grace" as an action appears once in the final sequence ("The elusive mirage painter rose with grace") and is not dramatized as a choice that alters options. It functions as description rather than a major turn. The element is introduced late (final third) and does not shape prior beats or the closure's causal chain. Late-arrival cap (4.6) applies; ornamental use and swappability (could be "rose smoothly" or "rose quietly") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("To wake them, the painter would breathe through coded lullabies in children's songs") and demonstrated in the ritual ("their voice widened into hum and syllable, slipping rhymes about boats and bridges and bread ovens"). It recurs in the ending ("the people learned to hum the key again through coded lullabies in children's songs"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. The method enables the painter's success (the wells ripple, the door swings), providing causal pressure. However, the mechanics are not tested by opposition or scarcity; the songs work without friction. Closure linkage is present (the method is passed to the people). Early signal, beat involvement, causal enablement, and closure participation lift the score; lack of cost or constraint (the method succeeds effortlessly) limits it to the 6.0–6.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The terrace is introduced in the opening line and anchors the entire scene. It recurs as a spatial container ("the terrace itself seemed to nod") and in the ending ("On future mornings the terrace answered with subtle echoes"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. The terrace provides resources (the prism parapet, the silvered wells) that enable the painter's method, creating causal pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (painter arrives, crowd gathers, painter kneels at the parapet, rises, departs). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or impose a tactical cost; it facilitates rather than pressures. Early signal, beat involvement across the full arc, and causal enablement lift the score; lack of constraint or felt cost at closure caps it in the high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("Their time for work was always over the hush before bells ring") and recurs ("over the hush before bells ring, the locket could be heard"). The phrase "when even footsteps hesitate and secrets sit up straight" establishes a specific temporal window. The bells peal at the ritual's end ("Then the cathedral bells began their fruit-metal peal, breaking the hush"), marking closure. Setup and payoff gates are satisfied; development is present as the ritual unfolds within this window. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the painter works at leisure, and the bells' arrival is coincidental rather than a pressure point. Early signal and closure participation lift the score; lack of live clock constraint (no countdown, no urgency) limits it to the 5.5–6.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly ("They had come to persuade mirrors to show possibilities") and repeated ("I am here…to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"). It appears early (setup), drives the middle ritual (development), and is echoed in the ending's transformation (payoff). All three gates are satisfied. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The painter faces no friction or cost in pursuing this goal; the mirrors comply, the crowd cooperates, and the painter departs satisfied. The motivation lacks want-versus-cost tension or visible tradeoff. Early signal and closure linkage lift the score; told-only application and lack of dramatized friction cap it in the 5.0–5.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone is established early ("That margin of morning kept a dusky harmony, a quiet chord between dew and clamor") and recurs in the ending ("left, leaving behind in dusky harmony a habit of seeing around corners"). The prose maintains lyric compression and elevated diction throughout, coherent with the tone. Setup and payoff gates are satisfied. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; it remains uniformly lyric and elevated even during the ritual's climax. The final image reprises "dusky harmony" but does not charge it with new cost or reweight it against prior material—it functions as a thematic label rather than a pressure vessel. Early signal, consistency, and lyric reprise lift the score; static mood and lack of modulation under pressure cap it in the 6.0–6.5 band.</comment>
