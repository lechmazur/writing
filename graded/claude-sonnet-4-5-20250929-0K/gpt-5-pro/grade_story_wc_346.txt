<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The adjuster's motivation is coherent and the puppet-as-companion device provides embodied emotion, but the interiority remains largely atmospheric and abstract ("bruised awe") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. The choice at closure—to turn the key and grant reprieve—lacks a live alternative or visible cost that forecloses a path; the action reads as ritual repetition rather than a decision under pressure. Micro-choices like lifting the puppet or humming the tune add texture but do not alter tactics or options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where cleanly by the opening; the lighthouse setting and doomsday-clock mechanism establish stakes early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through nested patterns, the pane of hush, and the lullaby motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the adjuster scatters the lullaby "like seeds" and the beacon turns "not to warn but to welcome." Cost is felt in the reweighting of endings from alarm to companionship, though the tangible price—what the adjuster sacrifices or forecloses—remains oblique rather than unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior is vivid and purposefully filtered through the adjuster's ritualistic attention: panels, pendulum, lens, pane of hush, puppet on the finial. The storm glass, nested lens rings, and brass finial constrain the sequence of actions and charge the final image when "the beacon turns not to warn but to welcome." Sensory detail (salt taste, surf as applause, burn of old oil) is selective and voice-consistent, anchoring the closure in concrete physicality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—granting the world a reprieve through the lullaby—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates texturally (nested patterns, storm glass darkening, the sequence of switch/lever/tick/breath) rather than through a causal tightening or reversible choice. The adjuster's agency is endurance and ritual execution; no live alternative or visible tradeoff appears on the page to test commitment. The final act—scattering the lullaby—deepens meaning but does not narrow options or impose a felt cost within the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lullaby-as-mercy motif, the puppet's role as witness, and the shift from alarm to welcome in the final image. The piece resists overt moralizing; the adjuster's desire to "make endings bearable" is dramatized through ritual and image rather than stated thesis. The closing lines—"the beacon turns not to warn but to welcome"—offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to tend the end with kindness, reweighting prior material without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and syntactically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "bruised awe," "pane of hush," "the sea combing its own memory"). Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflection, and the diction fits the contemplative, ritualistic stance. However, several figurative constructions in peak beats blur clarity: "quiet fire," "warm tide washing the mechanism clean," "time made gentle" stack without sharp embodiment. The prose leans toward pattern-taught lyricism, but the density of metaphor in the climactic sequence (lines 34–39) occasionally flattens immediacy rather than sharpening it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is purposeful and paragraph structure varies to support the accumulative design. However, multiple lines restate the same content without adding pressure: "not by erasing them, but by breathing around them" / "to be found by sleepers yet unborn" / "kept them company in their earliest dark" loop the lullaby concept without new detail. The final third contains a run of template cadence ("I lift… I take… I do not crave… So I vouchsafe… I hum… I touch") that dulls propulsion during the closure sequence. Figurative density is high without consistent payoff: "time's final ripple," "nested rings that drink the dusk," "warm tide washing the mechanism clean" mix vehicles and blur causality. Apply baseline artifact deduction (−0.6) and proximity to closure (−0.4).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The doomsday-clock-adjuster frame and the puppet-as-witness device are specific and memorable, transforming the familiar apocalypse-keeper trope through ritual and tenderness. The lullaby-as-reprieve synthesis feels earned in hindsight, grounded in the nested-patterns mechanic and the lighthouse's hidden decree. However, the emotional arc—mercy through slowing the end—could transfer to otherkeeper-of-threshold premises with minor edits; the specificity lies more in setting and object detail than in a non-obvious moral calculus or irreplaceable character choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The doomsday clock adjuster is present throughout and performs the key action (turning the key, scattering the lullaby). However, the role reads as ritual executor rather than decision-maker under pressure; no live alternative or trade-off appears on the page to test commitment. The adjuster's choices (check panels, hum the tune, lower the key) advance the sequence but do not alter tactics or narrow options. Present in closure but without a causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken puppet head appears in beats 5, 7, 19–22, 37, serving as key-holder, audience, and witness. It is handled (lifted, balanced on the finial, touched) and its backstory (the girl's gift) reweights its presence with relational cost. The puppet charges the closure by standing in for "many small hands" and their applause returning as surf. However, the puppet does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its role is symbolic anchor rather than causal lever. Strong lyric reprise, mid-band causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The pane of hush is introduced early (line 4) and returns in lines 15, 26, 41, serving as sensory anchor and thematic echo. The adjuster presses an ear to it and the world "goes still without accusing," but the pane does not change options or constrain tactics on the page. Its function is atmospheric and metaphorical rather than mechanical. Present across beats but ornamental to the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is applied to the puppet's gaze (line 6) and recurs implicitly in line 37 ("beautifully flawed and perfectly still"). The attribute characterizes the puppet's witnessing role and primes the theme of imperfection as companion to mercy, but it does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait enriches texture without altering tactics. Lyric anchor, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears twice (lines 17, 32) as the adjuster's core action: granting a reprieve. The term frames the ending's stakes and charges the final act of scattering the lullaby. However, the action is declared rather than dramatized through a choice with alternatives or cost; "vouchsafe" names the intention but does not redefine options on the page. Present in closure, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Nested patterns are signaled early (line 8) and developed through tides, light, scars, and the sequence of switch/lever/tick/breath (lines 9, 25). The method shapes the adjuster's ritual: "each pattern is a gate, and each gate opens not with force but with listening" (line 26). The nested-rings lens (line 33) and the turn-by-turn key sequence (line 30) tie the mechanic to the closure act. The method constrains tactics and charges the final image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk is anchored in the opening line and sustained through panels, pendulum, lens, pane of hush, and the beacon. The setting supplies the mechanism and the decree that "keep endings patient" (line 12), directly shaping the adjuster's stake. The lighthouse's isolation and the dusk-to-starlight arc frame the ritual and charge the closure when "the beacon turns not to warn but to welcome." Environment constrains choices and is indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" appears in line 11 as lyric frame for the lullaby's reach. The phrase recurs implicitly in "the widened seconds" (line 35) and "time made gentle" (line 32), but the timeframe does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions on the page. Dusk-to-starlight provides ambient progression without urgency. Thematic echo, minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes—is stated in line 10 and dramatized through the ritual sequence: humming the tune, scattering the lullaby like seeds, the beacon turning to welcome rather than warn. The desire is coherent and shapes the adjuster's actions, but no conflicting want or cost appears on the page to test commitment. The motivation drives the closure but lacks friction or trade-off. Present across beats, moderate dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bruised awe is named in lines 2, 16 and sustained through diction ("quiet fire," "ache in that stillness," "shy at first, then confident") and the adjuster's reverent attention to the mechanism. The tone modulates with the ritual's progression—from checking panels to the lullaby's dispersal—and charges the final image when the beacon shifts from warning to welcome. Coherent through turns, strong closure linkage.</comment>
