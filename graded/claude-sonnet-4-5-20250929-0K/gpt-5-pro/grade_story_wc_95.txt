<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's role as dueling philosopher with mechanical arm reads as ornamental – the arm clicks approval but never constrains a choice. Interiority is highly stylized but remains surface-level; we see posed philosophy ("lateness is a borderland") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The courier duel offers a beat where stance shifts, but the protagonist's yielding of the needle card lacks visible internal cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is present in limited gestures (servos purr, foils settle) but never degrades under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors late: who/where/when clarifies gradually across the first third without teaching disorientation as pattern. The drive lens reads Situational (philosophy-as-duel protocol) but wobbles toward Accumulative in the lyric phrasing; by closure the lens is ambiguous. Closure attempts Charged Poise – the pact sealed by noon, the walk toward gardens – but cost remains abstract: no foreclosed option is named, no prior path visibly abandoned. The sundial-and-needle mechanism works causally to reveal coordinates, but the final departure reads as gentle inevitability rather than a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glass chiming, water speaking, leaves agreeing). The sundial constrains the decoding action in the middle beat and charges the pact-sealing moment at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear through the duel. The setting functions as more than backdrop, grounding the philosophical posture in tactile particulars, though the orchid-nursery council chamber arrives as decoration rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake – delivering the overture-as-peace-protocol – is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The duel provides one tightening: the courier wants the card without the peace, forcing a test. The protagonist's choice to offer the card "as trust that trusts him back" lacks visible cost; the courier's acceptance comes easily, his "pride steps back" without dramatized internal friction. One meaningful pressure point exists but the resolution feels granted rather than earned, and no live option is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the duel-as-argument frame: "to fence is to argue about arrival." The needle card and sundial accrue meaning without becoming symbols-with-capital-S. The line "music refuses aim once it knows love" risks platitude but is embedded in action. The final image – following the brook "like a line of treble stitched forward" – offers resonant closure without moralizing. Subtext operates in the courier's laugh and torn sleeve. The piece resists tidy resolution while keeping thematic pressure legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and purposeful: elevated diction ("borderland," "conciliator," "libretto of streets") remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Dialogue between protagonist and courier differentiates lightly by register (courier more martial, protagonist more philosophical) and advances goals. Free indirect interiority is clean. The prose modulates appropriately under duel pressure with shorter clauses. Perceptual signature is consistent: the world filtered through philosophical metaphor and mechanical detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Figurative density is high throughout ("hands folded like questions that expect applause," "path forward is hidden like music under a cough") and occasionally muddles in stacked vehicles. Some lines do double duty (the brook as timekeeper and directional metaphor) but others loop conceptually: "turn questions into destinations" repeats across three beats without added pressure. No major template cadence or filter stacks. Clarity holds at closure. Information density is moderate; a few scaffolding phrases ("deciding where to stand, where to interrupt") could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dueling-philosopher frame is fresh, and the sundial-plus-needle-card decoding mechanism offers concrete ingenuity. The synthesis of philosophy, swordplay, and cartography feels organic rather than checklist-driven. Risk is present in the lyric register and the refusal to resolve the war-council confrontation on the page. The premise avoids template plots. The courier's dual role (antagonist-then-ally) follows a familiar arc but executes cleanly. Emotional honesty in the duel's restraint ("refusal to humiliate") adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the decoding and duel beats. The mechanical arm is mentioned (oils joints, servos purr, clicks approval) but never constrains a tactical choice or alters the duel outcome. The philosopher role enables the needle-card use and shapes dialogue tone. Setup clear, middle and closure participation present, but causal pressure remains moderate and the arm itself is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced in beat ~13 with backstory anchor (teacher's gift). Used functionally in beat ~13 to decode sundial via perforations, then offered to courier in beat ~32 and read together in beat ~34. Returns in penultimate beat ("pocket the card"). Present in closure zone. Three distinct functional beats plus closure mention. Swappability low (the perforations and teacher link are specific). Causal pressure moderate; it enables the path but does not narrow options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("hidden overture tucked into geometry") and named throughout. Shapes the dominant stake (deliver the overture to enable ceasefire). The overture-as-music metaphor recurs and charges the final image ("libretto of streets"). Middle beats explain its dual nature (protocol and music) but the mechanics remain abstract. Closure linkage present. Causal pressure moderate; it frames desire but does not force a visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Label present in opening line and echoed once ("borders make me diplomatically fierce"). No on-page action demonstrates the trait under stress. The duel itself could illustrate fierceness tempered by diplomacy, but the text does not explicitly tie the attribute to a tactical choice or visible cost. Setup present, middle and closure participation absent. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fencing occupies beats ~21–30, the story's longest pressure sequence. The duel forces the trust-offer turn and enables the courier's alliance shift. Setup in beat ~18, sustained across nine beats, and the pact outcome flows from it. Removing fencing would require full structural redesign. Causal pressure high within its span; the "gentlest insult" and "refusal to humiliate" shape the resolution. Closure linkage indirect (pact sealed after the duel) but strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sundial introduced beat ~8, calibrated beat ~10, used with needle card beat ~13 to generate coordinates, reappears beat ~25 (glance during duel), and sealed at noon beat ~40. Four functional beats; setup early, closure participation clear. The coded-angles mechanic is specific and enables the path reveal. Swappability low. Causal pressure moderate; it structures the decoding sequence but does not narrow live options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glass atrium named in opening line; brook recurs as metaphor and anchor across the piece. The space grounds the duel choreography ("glass chiming above us, water speaking beneath"). Closure image follows the brook forward. Setup immediate, middle spatial use solid, closure presence strong. The setting provides atmosphere and coherence but does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics. Micro-setting (sundial on stone where light shatters) charges one beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "while waiting" established in opening and recurs ("while waiting for the light to shift"). Waiting creates the situation but does not tighten on-page decisions with a live clock. The noon moment (beat ~10, ~40) functions symbolically but is not tracked as urgent countdown. Setup present, middle mentions exist, closure touches it lightly. Time pressure remains abstract; the courier's lateness sets the frame but does not narrow protagonist's choices under visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation stated beat ~5, dramatized in needle-card use and the trust-offer to courier, articulated in dialogue beat ~37 ("I want to turn questions into destinations, because destinations invite arrivals"). Setup early, middle beats enact it, closure image ("follow the brook like a line of treble stitched forward") ties back. Friction between want (peace) and cost (trust without guarantee) is present but mild. Causal linkage moderate; the want frames choices without forcing a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone anchored in opening line ("morning hums with dignified chaos") and sustained through elevated diction, philosophical asides, and restrained action. Modulates appropriately: duel beats quicken syntax, pact moment softens. Coherent across turns. The final image balances poise and forward motion, matching the established register. Tone charges atmosphere and voice but does not itself constrain a choice. Setup immediate, maintained throughout, closure participation present via tonal consistency.</comment>
