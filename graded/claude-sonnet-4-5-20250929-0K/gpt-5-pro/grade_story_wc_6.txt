<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is poetic but often abstracted through metaphor ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert care") rather than embodied contradiction. The boy's arrival provides relational pressure, yet his characterization remains instrumental—forearm wrapped, freckled—without autonomous motive that complicates the protagonist's project. The final choice to leave the coin singing reads as thematic closure rather than a trade-off with visible cost that forecloses an alternate path. Interiority leans toward lyric assertion ("I would rather be kept by the latter") instead of micro-choices under stress that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The piece accumulates grafting beats and coin-note imagery toward a final image that reweights "scars can sing" with kelp-drift peace and tide-song. Orientation anchors (obsidian lagoon, narrator as firefighter, arsonist's father) land by ~15% and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy hears the throat-note and his wrapped forearm relaxes—micro turn that charges the closure. Cost is conceptual (forgiveness "without forgetting") rather than a visible forfeiture; the final image reconfigures the father's heat and narrator's restraint into shared breath and hum, meeting the RR standard with felt pressure even if opportunity cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, charred trunks, and kelp-drift peace anchor setting early and recur with purpose. The coin as plumb bob and the grafted trunks function as micro-setting objects that guide wind-reading and charge the closure song. Sand is handled in two beats (jar set down, pockets filled at dusk) and its warmth/memory properties constrain the grafting ritual. Spatial choreography is clean (lagoon shore, trunk to trunk, beach walk). The setting supplies resources (willow, breeze seams) that enable the protagonist's method, lifting the score above postcard description into functional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained through grafting acts. One meaningful tightening: the boy's question ("why I bothered") forces articulation of mercy versus fire-watch, crystallizing the stance without a decision that forecloses an alternate tactic. The coin-whisper and trunk throat-note demonstrate the proof-of-concept, but no reversal narrows options or imposes visible cost. Agency is attention and endurance rather than renunciation; the closure reconfigures inherited harm into chorus, meeting Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens, though the price paid (leaving the coin, walking away) is more symbolic than a trade-off with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation of arsonist's legacy with firefighter's restraint—emerges from grafting particulars, coin rhythm, and black sand memory without overt thesis. The final image (healed trunks humming tide-song, lagoon as kept promise) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights scar-singing with kelp-drift peace. "Unyielding compassion" and "gracefully alert" recur as anchor phrases, bordering on label-speak, yet the coin/graft mechanics ground them in action. One slip: "music keeps watch" / "so does mercy" in the boy's exchange edges toward moralizing; the closing lines recover by returning to sensory image (shawl of night, tide-song) that resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with stable psychic distance and a lyric-poetic register ("kelp-drift peace," "throats waiting for new song"). Perceptual signature is consistent—firefighter's eye for sap, scars, and wind seams—though diction occasionally elevates beyond urgent focus ("cambium to cambium," "deceiving no one, expecting nothing but attention") in ways that read voice-motivated rather than register drift. The boy's brief dialogue ("You are the one who stops fires...") and the narrator's replies carry subtext (neither blame nor safety, "truth is a shoreline") and advance plot by forcing articulation of the watch-mercy calculus. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I told him," "I said") are economical and voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; lyric parallelism ("gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion," "kelp-drift peace") recurs purposefully to anchor motifs. Clarity holds across complex actions (scoring cleft, aligning cambium, binding with thread). Two friction points: "deceiving no one, expecting nothing but attention" is a strained metaphor whose vehicle (the lagoon as deceiver/expecter) contradicts established tranquility; "migration of clouds" appears in opening and closing but its symbolic function (time-passage, transience) is asserted rather than integrated into a choice. Information density is high—most lines advance ritual, relationship, or image—but runs of abstract nouns ("ballast, memory, and polish"; "harm," "chorus," "forgiveness") in the middle third lean toward tell over embodied perception. No loops or scaffold detected; minor overwriting in figurative density does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—arsonist's child as firefighter grafting song into burn scars via coin-pendulum wind-reading—is specific and non-obvious. The volcanic sand as ballast/memory and the drilled foreign coin as plumb bob/conductor avoid generic symbolism through concrete function (marking air seams, dusting grafts). The boy's wrapped forearm mirroring the narrator's ladder-scar and relaxing at the throat-note is an earned inflection that deepens the proof-of-concept without overt echo. Risk: lyric-heavy voice and accumulative structure could flatten pressure, yet the piece commits fully to the ritual's logic and follows implications (kelp-drift peace, tide-song) without retreat. Transformation test: plot and arc would collapse if coin/sand/grafting were replaced with generic healing gestures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist identified as "arsonist's daughter firefighter" by paragraph two. Development: her training in restraint and scar-knowledge guides grafting method, scoring clefts where sap dreams (paragraph fourteen). Closure: she walks away "gracefully alert, listening for the coin, the grafts, the boy, and even my father, all breathing in rhythm"—the dual legacy shapes final stance. Two distinct beats (choosing trunks via wind-reading; leaving coin to sing) and causal pressure (firefighting skill enables graft precision). Cost is conceptual forgiveness-without-forgetting rather than a visible trade-off, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: jar set down in paragraph seven, "still warm from sun and ancient fire." Development: used as ballast/memory in paragraph eight, then dusted onto grafts (paragraph eighteen) to "slow glare and remember heat." Closure: pockets filled with black sand at dusk (paragraph thirty-one), embodying shared story and carry-forward. Three functional beats; properties (warmth, volcanic origin) matter to ritual logic. Slightly below indispensable because the sand could be replaced with another memory-object without breaking the grafting mechanics, though symbolic specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph two as training ethos, repeated in paragraph three ("unyielding compassion written in hose, shovel, and patient breath") and paragraph fifteen ("unyielding compassion in my palms steady the knife"). Development: shapes stance toward apology-per-cut and the mercy-versus-fire articulation to the boy. Closure: felt in "forgiven without forgetting" and kept-promise lagoon image. Present across beats and charges closure, but operates more as thematic refrain than a constraint that alters tactics or forecloses an option with visible cost. The label recurs without embodied friction that tests its limits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two ("gracefully alert care for every spark"). Development: paragraph seventeen (coin keeps rhythm "reminding me to stay gracefully alert instead of afraid"). Closure: final paragraph ("I walked away gracefully alert, listening..."). Three mentions across story arc; the trait anchors perceptual stance (noticing wind seams, reading scars) but does not constrain a choice with visible trade-off—it enables without cost. The attribute reads more as label and tone anchor than a capability with limits that shape tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: foreshadowed in paragraph thirteen ("firefighting had taught me where sap still dreams"). Development: grafting willow to charred trunk (paragraphs fourteen–eighteen) is the method's core act—scoring cleft, aligning cambium, binding with thread. Closure: grafts hum in final image ("healed trunks hummed a tide-song"), fulfilling the proof-that-scars-can-sing stake. Action drives three distinct beats (first trunk, repeated grafts, closure hum) and causal pressure (apology-per-cut, sand-dusting, coin-rhythm coordination). Removing grafting would collapse the story's logic and symbolic resolution. Slightly shy of 9.0 because the mechanics (cambium alignment, willow selection) are asserted rather than tested under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph nine as "my father's coin, rescued from a shoebox, still salt-streaked." Development: weighted with sand and used to read wind seams (paragraphs eleven–twelve), then hung as plumb bob to keep breathing rhythm during grafting (paragraph seventeen). Closure: coin left to sing in trees (paragraph thirty-three), "proof enough that scars can sing." Three functional beats; the drilled/strung mechanics and salt-history matter to ritual and thematic charge. Essential across beats and shapes ending's resonance, though the coin's specific properties (foreign monarch, salt-streak) are more symbolic than mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: title and opening line anchor "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes." Development: lagoon shore provides charred trunks (paragraph six), and its kelp-drift peace establishes tone. Closure: lagoon mirrors sky and shines "like a kept promise" in final paragraph. Present throughout; supplies the ritual's stage and recurring peace motif. Does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics—trunks could stand anywhere fire had passed. The lagoon functions more as atmospheric anchor and symbolic close than as micro-setting pressure that shapes the grafting attempt.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: opening line and closing paragraph bookend with "migration of clouds." Development: "By afternoon" (paragraph twenty-seven) and "At dusk" (paragraph thirty-one) mark passage, but no ticking clock tightens decisions. Closure: "Night gathered" (paragraph thirty-four). Time passage is tracked but does not impose urgency or alter tactics—grafting could stretch or compress without affecting outcome. Present but ornamental; swappable with "during the long afternoon" or similar phrasing without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: stated in paragraph four ("I came here to prove that scars can sing"). Development: desire drives grafting sequence and is tested when boy asks "why I bothered" (paragraph twenty-nine); narrator's reply ("music keeps watch") articulates the want. Closure: coin left "proof enough that scars can sing, and keep singing." Desire is dramatized across beats with visible proof-of-concept (throat-note from grafted trunk). Friction is mild—no competing want or cost that forces trade-off—so the motive reads more as mission statement than conflicted stake. Present in three beats and shapes closure, landing mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph five introduces "kelp-drift peace, dark as obsidian glass." Development: tone recurs (paragraph twenty-seven, "kelp-drift peace"; paragraph thirty-four, "in that kelp-drift peace I felt forgiven"). Closure: tone modulates from task-focus to night's shawl and tide-song hum, charging final image with tranquility earned through ritual. Coherent through turns; the calm does not flatten pressure but frames it as restorative work. Modulation is subtle rather than dynamic—tone stays in one register (meditative, elegiac) without sharp contrast under stress. Present and purposeful, charging closure, but static mood caps score below 7.5.</comment>
