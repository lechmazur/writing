<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lucid-dream-chronicler protagonist shows strong interiority through embodied perception ("jaded wonder clung to me like frost") and a consistent hierarchy of values (keeping the ledger, facing envy, refusing to be fooled). The method of "getting jealous of past selves until they spoke up" provides character-particular contradiction—envy as magnet generates multiple interior selves that pressure the present stance. The final choice to "keep the ledger…to keep the time honest" forecloses passivity with visible cost (older but kinder, accepting the bill). Minor slip: the surveyor/lover/child trio in the dream risks ornamental multiplication, though the verbs they offer ("stake…scent…play") do tilt present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (grave → cabin → scroll → ridge) with clear transitions and a coherent lens held to closure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist commits to "keep the ledger…not to win immortality, but to keep the time honest" and "let the mouth keep eating the stone until meaning appears"—a renunciation of simple resolution with visible cost (older, kinder, but bound to the task). The birch-bark scroll and the grave recur with reweighted meaning. One meaningful deepening occurs when envy softens into questions and the dream provides verbs that alter waking tactics. Cost is legible in the final image: "the scroll rattled softly, a wild animal tamed enough to travel but not to forget."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin anchors early with concrete sensory detail (creosote, spruce, birch bark, the stuttering clock). The grave cairn on the ridge, the scroll's pale scars, and the window where "the moon could adjudicate" all constrain or enable choices—writing on the bark "until my knuckles creaked," reading aloud to the ridge. The scroll functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (cabin interior, ridge, dream cabin, return to ridge) tracks cleanly. The only slip: "thermals that hummed like bees" and "wind fretted, stones listened" veer slightly ornamental, though they remain voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "to distill chaos into narrative, to compress the wild into sentences that could carry heat." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as envy → interrogation → dream verbs → writing → reading aloud. One meaningful tightening: the grave "solved a question nobody asked" and the protagonist chooses to "edit its silence," narrowing options from passive witnessing to active ledger-keeping. Cost is visible: "older again, but kinder to the versions," and "awe is better when it knows the bill." The turn is protagonist-driven (envy as method, the choice to return to the ridge). Minor: the dream's surveyor/lover/child trio provides answers rather than complicating, which slightly softens pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of envy, memory, and narrative-making. The recurring scroll and grave charge the final image with a non-literal answer: "let the mouth keep eating the stone until meaning appears." Subtext operates in gesture and image (the moon as adjudicator, the scroll as "wild animal tamed enough to travel but not to forget"). The ending avoids moralizing, offering instead a stance crystallization with cost. The piece resists false equivalence—the protagonist commits to honesty over immortality. One exceptional move: "jaded wonder hummed like the stove, and I let it, because awe is better when it knows the bill" reweights awe as earned rather than innocent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "names are traps," "jealousy is a magnet for loose iron," "memories are all bent nails until you face their rust." POV distance is stable; first-person focalization stays consistent through dream and waking. Diction remains character-particular and lyric without register drift. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (e.g., "I told the dream I would not be fooled") are taught early and legible. Rhythmic control under pressure: "I wrote…until my knuckles creaked, mapping envy into paths and paths into story." One minor slip: "consensus reality" moment when wind, stones, and hawk all attend the reading risks slight anthropomorphic convergence, though it reads as metaphorical rather than literal POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The rings were still in it, pale scars of seasons, a calendar that never learned digits" anchors object, time, and voice). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in action beats and breathing in reflection. Zero paraphrase loops. Minor deductions: "I envied the kid who hiked without checking weather, the surveyor who sang, the lover who carried cinnamon" is a brief list, and "feral nostalgia prowled the room, sniffing…It bit when I looked" stacks two figurative moves in close succession. The final third sustains clarity and propulsion without scaffold, lifting the score. Still, figurative density in several beats (thermals humming, wind fretting, stones listening) approaches but does not cross the overwriting threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, time confusion, and ledger-keeping as method feels specific and non-obvious. The birch-bark scroll as living calendar and the grave-as-pupil metaphor transform familiar tropes (memento mori, dream journal) through concrete detail. "Getting jealous of past selves until they spoke up" is a fresh psychological tactic, and the dream interrogation scene (surveyor, lover, child offering verbs) provides an earned inflection. The final image—"a wild animal tamed enough to travel but not to forget"—is memorable and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the mosaic structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler present early (first paragraph "my trade is remembering while sleeping"); shapes two major beats (the dream interrogation where envy softens into questions, the second dream as "quiet ledger"); closure moment ("I would keep the ledger…to keep the time honest") is identity-driven. Cost visible: "older again, but kinder." Specific profession mechanics (lucidity as "cold and exact, like a plumb line") constrain tactics. Three-gate pass; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll introduced early (second paragraph); handled in three distinct beats (unrolled and traced, written on "until my knuckles creaked," carried to ridge and read aloud); returns with reweighted meaning in final image ("rattled softly, a wild animal tamed enough to travel but not to forget"). Closure participation strong: the scroll embodies the ledger-keeping commitment. Specificity high: "pale scars of seasons, a calendar that never learned digits" and "rings accepted ink like winter accepts a shovel" are irreplaceable. Cost tied: writing physical, reading public.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia named early (first page: "prowled the room, sniffing…bit when I looked at the mirror"); shapes one key beat (the mirror confrontation showing "a face that had already practiced being stone"). Present in closure framing ("jaded wonder hummed…awe is better when it knows the bill"). Does not constrain middle choices as strongly as other elements—functions more as atmosphere than engine. Two-gate pass (setup, payoff); lyric reprise reweights but does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chronologically confused signaled early ("the cabin clock stuttered and leaped…I am chronologically confused"); enables the dream-time mosaic structure and the merging of past selves. Shapes two beats: the scroll's undated map and the dream where "every year I had ever worn [sluiced] into one river." Constrains tactics: the protagonist must use envy rather than linear memory. Cost visible in disorientation and the need to "keep the time honest" at closure. Three-gate pass; causal role clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Soar appears in dream sequence ("I chose to soar, a slow glide on thermals"); enables one major turn (the aerial view of the grave as "pupil widening" and the perspective shift that feeds the later ledger work). Present in closure reflection ("I did not soar there; I shelved, I dusted"). Two-gate pass (middle, payoff); shapes one key realization but easily swappable with another dream action (e.g., descend, traverse). Cost tied indirectly via the contrast with grounded ledger-work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("my method was getting jealous of past selves until they spoke up"); mechanics explained ("jealousy is a magnet…memories are all bent nails"); drives two major beats (the envy list that tugs threads, the dream interrogation where jealousy "softened into questions"). Closure causally linked: the verbs gained ("stake…scent…play") inform the writing and ridge reading. Cost visible: the protagonist must confront envy and older selves. Three-gate pass; irreplaceable and specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin anchors setting early (found by scent); supplies resources (table, stove that "replied by ticking," window for moon adjudication); constrains writing (wrote "until my knuckles creaked"). Micro-setting effect: the cabin as container for past/present collision. Present in closure frame (door closing, scroll traveling). Three-gate pass; setting pressure moderate but legible. The ridge functions as co-setting and provides the grave, raising total setting involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after seeing your own grave" present in opening (second sentence); drives the central question and tightens every choice (the grave "solved a question nobody asked" and makes the ledger-keeping urgent). Shapes two beats: the initial discovery and the return to "edit its silence." Closure directly tied: keeping the ledger is a response to mortality made legible. Cost felt throughout (the face "that had already practiced being stone"). Three-gate pass; causal role strong.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to distill chaos into narrative" signaled early (first page); dramatized in conflict (the scroll work, the dream interrogation, the ridge reading). Friction visible: "compress the wild into sentences that could carry heat" vs. the difficulty of untangling ("the tangle on the scroll began to sort itself"). Closure direct: "I would keep the ledger…to keep the time honest." Cost legible: physical (knuckles creaking), temporal (older), relational (kinder to past selves). Three-gate pass; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Jaded wonder named early ("clung to me like frost, a numbed awe that still pricked"); modulates through turns (the dream's "cold and exact" lucidity, the final "jaded wonder hummed like the stove"). Charges the final image: "awe is better when it knows the bill." Coherent across pressure points; tone shifts purposefully from numbed to active acceptance. Three-gate pass; tone reweights closure meaningfully. Minor: could be slightly more embodied in middle beats.</comment>
