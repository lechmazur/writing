<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's phobia-ridden stunt double identity is embodied through specific physical memory ("body knows fire, heights, water, and impact"), and the trembling hands against forward motion shows contradictory impulses in action. The interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("breath keeps arguing with itself," "old fear climb my spine like a hot ladder"). However, the final confrontation relies on convenience choreography (chalked safe tiles, rotten boards beneath Kellan) that reads more like screenplay blocking than earned character choice, and the pivot from victim to agent lacks micro-choices that show the cost of crossing that threshold in real time. The seashell functions more as talisman than a dramatized anchor for decision-making.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (rusted library, night, post-discovery timeframe) land by line two. The accumulative lens holds: smudged cast → microfilm → projection → floor trap form a causal chain, and the closure image (sitting among stacks, watching film "reflower") offers Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("ruin is another name for an honest beginning"). The drive tightens from discovery through decryption to confrontation. However, the floor-trap resolution introduces a convenience not seeded—chalked tiles and rotted boards appear only when needed, weakening the earned quality of the final image and nudging this below 7.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library supplies concrete constraint: skylight for projection, circulation desk as arena, metal stacks and rotten floorboards that enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("air salted and still," "smell of iron and old glue thick"). The seashell's spiral steps matched to rust constellations and the cast under skylight demonstrate micro-setting that charges the ending. The projector threading the microfilm "to the ceiling" and spraying images "across the stars" uses setting to embody the thematic reversal, elevating this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim identity and agency from exploitation) is signaled early and tightens through discovery, decryption, and confrontation. The narrator's call to Kellan and the projection gambit demonstrate agency under pressure, and the floor-trap moment forecloses Kellan's script with visible cost ("save myself from becoming his kind of script"). However, the trap itself is not earned by prior struggle—chalked safe tiles appear as a deus ex machina rather than a resource the protagonist fought to secure, capping escalation credibility and preventing entry to the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power, composite identity vs. authenticity) emerges through concrete action: the microfilm projection, the seashell cipher, the choice to sit with Kellan rather than simply trap him. "Ruin is another name for an honest beginning" and "done being a composite" land without moralizing. The cast cipher—"a child's wish that grownups tell the truth"—carries subtext that reweights the betrayal. The final image (film "reflower[ing]" on the ceiling) offers resonant non-literal closure. No overt thematic echo in the final paragraph, and the recurring objects (seashell, cast, microfilm) charge the ending without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: "breath keeps arguing with itself," "making shelter out of whatever breaks me," "the stars hold steadier in the dark, and so do I." Perceptual signature is consistent (stunt coordinator idiom, movement awareness, exits as halos). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You never would have been Jax... only the body that bruises" / "Yes, but mine"). Figurative language density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register drift in "composite truth" and "constellation learning to pronounce my name" nudges slightly elevated diction, but it reads intentional and does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high across most beats. However, overwriting clusters in peak moments: "my heartbeat a drumline I could not keep in straight time," "fear answer," "film reflower" stack metaphors without always clarifying the image. Template-cadence runs appear ("I told him how... I told him the... I told him...") in the climax, and paraphrase loops ("transformative betrayal, the kind that does not end you so much as replace your hinges") slow momentum. Mixed-vehicle metaphors ("breath keeps arguing," "truth knocked like a stunt punch") and elevated diction ("biography section," "circulation desk") in a visceral crisis scene create register drift. Artifacts in the final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stunt-double-as-ghost-star premise is fresh, and the cipher-in-cast method offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The rusted library under stars and the microfilm-to-constellation projection provide memorable staging. Emotional specificity (mapping shaking instead of exits, coral-like adaptation) avoids generic templates. However, the floor-trap climax and the convenient chalk-pattern resolution echo familiar thriller mechanics without full transformation, and the "vulnerability is power" thesis, while earned, trends toward a recognizable empowerment template. Risk-taking in voice and structure elevates without obscuring clarity, justifying mid-7s placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The phobia-ridden stunt double is signaled in the opening paragraph, drives the narrator's perception and embodied memory throughout (fire, heights, water, impact knowledge vs. mental tolerance), and the final choice to "save myself from becoming his kind of script" hinges on this identity. The narrator's decision to call Kellan, project the microfilm, and confront rather than flee all stem from stunt training and phobia management. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in the second paragraph ("only thing I brought"), returns as cipher key (spiral steps matched to cast doodles), is held during the confrontation ("seashell in my palm"), and delivers the closure line ("seashell say that ruin is another name for an honest beginning"). However, its mechanical use is primarily symbolic rather than tactically constraining—removing it would not break the plot, only the lyric resonance. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise but limited causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal (Kellan using the narrator's life as a mask for Jax) is discovered on the page ("truth knocked like a stunt punch"), drives the decryption quest, and the narrator's final stance ("done being a composite") directly answers it. The betrayal "cracked and let light in," reshaping the narrator's identity and tactics. Present across all three gates and causally active in the ending, though the "transformative" quality is told more than shown in micro-choices that test the narrator's old loyalties.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is claimed explicitly ("I am firmly adaptive, the way coral is, making shelter out of whatever breaks me") and demonstrated in the narrator's improvisation with the cast, microfilm, and projection setup. The choice to sit with Kellan after the trap rather than flee shows adaptive response under pressure. However, the trait is more a thematic label than a resource with visible tradeoff—adaptiveness enables tactics but does not force a visible sacrifice. Two-gate participation with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Outwit" is the explicit goal ("I wanted to prove vulnerability is power, to outwit him") and shapes the entire second half: the narrator calls Kellan, stages the projection, sets the floor trap, and delivers the verbal confrontation. The climax turns on outsmarting rather than overpowering. Removing "outwit" would leave only flight or violence as options, fundamentally altering the resolution. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the convenience of the trap mechanics slightly limits irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast is signaled early (charity bin discovery), the mechanics are detailed (doodles and instructions "bled into one another like breakaway glass, hiding directional script"; half moons and wave marks matched to seashell spiral), and the method directly unlocks the microfilm location, driving the entire middle and climax. The narrator sets the cast under skylight and uses it during confrontation. Present across all three gates with high specificity and causal pressure; the exact decryption method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is anchored in line one and supplies multiple tactical resources: skylight for aligning cast and projecting microfilm, ceiling projector, circulation desk as confrontation arena, rotten floorboards that enable the climax, and the night sky as projection surface. The setting constrains and enables key choices, and the "stars hold steadier in the dark" closure line charges the final image. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the exact setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering I am not who I thought" is stated in line two ("first hour after discovering") and frames urgency—the narrator acts immediately rather than retreating. However, the clock is not tracked or tightened across beats; no visible time pressure forces faster decisions. The discovery moment shapes stakes but does not constrain tactics in a live, escalating way. Two-gate participation (setup, thematic framing) with modest causal pressure but no tactical tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is stated explicitly ("I wanted to prove vulnerability is power, to outwit him") and demonstrated in the narrator's choice to project the microfilm publicly, face Kellan, and sit with him rather than simply trap and flee. The narrator's shaking hands and fear are framed as resources rather than liabilities. However, the motivation is told more than tested—no scene dramatizes a choice between hiding vulnerability and weaponizing it. Two-gate participation with moderate closure linkage but limited friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is embodied in the opening ("my hands shake, yet a trembling certainty keeps the rest of me moving") and sustained throughout: "heartbeat a drumline I could not keep in straight time," "hands shaking, not to save him from consequences," "my voice steadied like a rig." The tone modulates with pressure—trembling intensifies during confrontation, certainty crystallizes in the final lines—and charges the closure image. Coherent across all three gates with strong tonal control under pressure and direct participation in the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
