<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist POV is consistent and embodied through concrete micro-choices: opening the ledger, tying strings, packaging the button. Interior texture remains stable ("my heart breaks in archived increments") with character-particular diction. The final mailing decision carries visible cost (uncertainty about reception, the long hallway walk) and forecloses passivity. Minor deduction: some interiority edges toward poetic summary rather than immediate perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the archivist sends the package with "tactfully hopeful" uncertainty that reweights prior archival distance. Cost is felt in "I let the envelope go, and in the quiet afterward, the file room waits"—the character has acted beyond policy and now carries the unknowable outcome. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (dust patterns, gaps, the button's story accretes meaning through layered observation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the button transforms from object to gesture to return. The lens holds cleanly through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The file room constrains choices (shelves, ledger, lamp, Row M) and charges the final image (vending machine hum, hallway length, mailbox). Dust patterns function as micro-setting that enables investigation and tactic (reading clean gaps, thumb-smudged crescents). Spatial choreography is clean: desk lamp, third shelf, envelope, mailer, hallway, mailbox. The button itself becomes object-as-setting, its brass face and bent shank carrying the story's pressure into closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether to return the button and bridge the unknown history with present care. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist decides to package and mail despite policy ambiguity ("I preserve, not intrude"). The choice forecloses archival neutrality with visible cost (the long hallway, the thought of Rowan on a night bus). Agency is active: the archivist investigates, records, writes, and sends. Minor gap: Rowan's emancipation ceremony provides backstory pressure but his absence from scene limits the felt stakes of the return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: dust as ledger, button as memory, archival care versus intrusion. The final image offers a resonant answer to "can unknown histories be tenderly examined?"—yes, through return with cost, not gift. "Examined unknown, yet tactfully hopeful" reweights the opening without stating a moral. The button's journey from Alvarez to Rowan to archivist to mail embodies the theme through object and gesture. Subtext operates in "be warm" (pencil, unread prose, the coat's absence) and the narrator's refusal to call it a gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable: archival diction ("emancipation," "legitimate privacy and negligent time") blends with lyric specificity ("dust patterns," "small, stubborn star"). Psychic distance is consistent; the narrator's perceptual signature (reading through gaps, shadows, hesitations) shapes every beat. No head-hopping. Minor texture issue: some lines edge toward elevated register ("the air itself is a ledger") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally drift from immediacy. Free indirect style is clean; the narrator's uncertainty at closure (sending "will be received") maintains stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the button description conveys both object and Alvarez's care). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final paragraph's longer breath supports closure. Two craft issues lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loops ("small kindnesses" appears three times with synonym churn: "magnify," "gestures that kept a day from failing," "proof that a man once fixed a coat"); (2) occasional filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("I remember," "I do not read," "I say"). These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, so the cap at 8.7 does not apply, but they reduce propulsion in mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-detective, foster care file as site of kindness, and the button as hinge between past care and present repair feels specific and earned. The turn from passive archive to active return transforms a familiar archival frame. Risk is present in the lyric-heavy style and the quiet ending, both coherent with the material. Minor limitation: the emancipation ceremony and foster care setting draw on familiar emotional territory; the transformation comes through voice and object detail rather than premise novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's choices—turning on the lamp, opening the folder, reading the button, packaging it, mailing it—drive all key beats. Early signal (first paragraph), middle investigation (unfolding, recording), and closure (mailing) are all present. Causal pressure: the decision to send rather than preserve creates the ending's cost. Irreplaceable: no other role could frame the "examined unknown" lens or the archival tension between preserve/intrude.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The button appears in setup (manila envelope), middle investigation (lamp examination, scratches read, Alvarez connection), and closure (packaged, sent, imagined missing from Rowan's coat). It enables the archivist's choice (return vs. archive), carries Alvarez's care ("lucky click," "be warm"), and charges the final image (Rowan's pocket "remembering the roundness"). The button is irreplaceable; a different object would not bridge infantry service, foster care repair, and present tenderness with the same specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames the opening question, shapes the archivist's method (reading dust gaps, not intruding on prose), and reconfigures at closure ("examined unknown, yet tactfully hopeful"). The concept constrains tactics: the archivist investigates through indirect evidence (dust, red string, photo, button) rather than opening the folded note. It charges the ending: sending the button tests whether the unknown can be "tender when examined." The phrase itself appears in the final line, reweighting the entire investigation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is signaled early ("My job is tactfully hopeful work"), constrains the middle choice (sending "only what is his" rather than intruding or claiming credit), and returns at closure ("tactfully hopeful that what we send will be received"). The attribute enables one key action with cost: mailing the button despite uncertainty is the tactful hope dramatized. Minor gap: the trait edges toward label-only in some uses; the final reprise strengthens it but does not add new causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears twice with functional weight: unfurling the red string's knot releases the envelope (setup to middle), and "unfurl a thread of story" describes the archivist's method (middle). The action is purposeful and metaphorically charged (unknotting as investigation), but it does not itself create the major turn—the decision to mail does. Swappability test: "untie" or "open" could substitute in the physical beat without major loss, though the lyric reprise would weaken. Present in two beats, causal in setup, but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is signaled early (third shelf, "the air itself is a ledger I read through accumulated dust patterns"), used as investigative method (middle: "drifts like dunes," "thumb-smudged crescents," "clean gaps where someone once cared"), and referenced at closure ("the way the dust made a map"). The method enables the archivist's discovery and constrains the approach (indirect, respectful reading). It charges the final ledger entry ("I learned more from what was touched than what was written"). Irreplaceable: no other method captures the archival lens or the "examined unknown" theme as precisely.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The file room is present throughout: shelves, ledger, lamp, Row M, vending machine hum, hallway, mailbox. It constrains the archivist's role and supplies the button discovery. The room's atmosphere ("hush that feels like a held breath," "the room calmed when the story chose its shape") charges multiple beats and the closure ("the file room waits"). The setting is the story's container and conceptual frame (archive as site of care vs. intrusion). Removing the file room would collapse the stakes, method, and tone. Spatial choreography is clean and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" anchors the timeframe in the opening and middle (Rowan's ceremony last week, the scheduled coat pickup three years ago, the button left behind). It motivates the archivist's investigation (Rowan is now gone, the file dormant) and tightens the choice (send now or let it sleep). The time constraint is present but not urgent; the archivist could delay. Closure references it obliquely ("Rowan stepping into a night bus"). The timeframe shapes context more than it compresses tactics. Two gates (setup, middle) are met; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is stated early as the archivist's job and desire, dramatized in the middle investigation (reading Alvarez's gesture, the "be warm" note, recognizing repair as care), and enacted at closure (mailing the button as "small proof" rather than gift). The motivation is conflicted: policy says preserve, desire says magnify, and the choice to send costs certainty. The motivation drives the entire arc and charges the ending. It is irreplaceable: no other desire would frame the archival tension or the "tactfully hopeful" stance as precisely.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" is woven throughout: the opening hush, the archivist's method (dust as ledger, gaps as care), the middle investigation (reading without intruding), and the closure phrase ("examined unknown, yet tactfully hopeful"). Tone modulates with pressure: contemplative in setup, investigative in middle beats, tender and uncertain at closure. The tone charges the final image (quiet after sending, waiting for what cannot be known). It is coherent across turns and integral to theme. Minor gap: some mid-story lines edge toward static lyricism without pressure modulation, though the ending recovers fully.</comment>
