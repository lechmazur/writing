<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is specific and controlled, with embodied choices (canceling the test, lowering mufflers, checking sensors) that reveal priorities under pressure. The stance crystallization—listening over spectacle—is earned through micro-choices throughout. Minor deduction: the reflection on "credibly curious" and "honored the solstice hush" edges toward self-congratulation without dramatized cost in those exact beats, though the broader renunciation (canceling the alarm) carries weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (microclimate monitoring, solstice hush, mountain breath) and the closure—switching to standby and muffling the bell—reconfigures the stakes with visible cost (professional risk, district director's expectation defied). The cost is legible in "the only metric that mattered was the bell rope's clean, unstartled sway" and the deferred report-filing. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains every choice: sensor placement, wind shear observation, the bell rope's tactile feedback. The "cathedral bell rope, frayed by weather and blessed by a thousand hands" becomes micro-setting; the protagonist's hand on the rope ("felt the mountain's shrug arrive before the gust") directly informs the pivotal decision. Sensory hierarchy matches professional attention (thermistors, strain gauges, anemometers) and the spatial choreography (nave of wind, eaves, doorway) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: maintain credibility by choosing safety over ritual. The zero-hour text from the district director applies external pressure; the protagonist's decision to cancel the siren test narrows options (professional consequences implied) and forecloses the safe path of compliance. The split downdraft observation and the choice to muffle rather than ring constitute one meaningful tightening with a felt cost ("Later I would file reports and graphs" acknowledges the professional friction). Agency is renunciation with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—attention and humility over spectacle—emerges organically through recurring images: the bell rope as witness, the "sanctuary's breath," "listening without mistaking it for nothing." The final image ("the wind, pleased to be heard, braided itself around the bell rope and slept") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The curriculum metaphor in "the sanctuary and I agreed on the same curriculum, to master listening" risks over-articulation but remains grounded in the protagonist's professional idiom. No token motifs; the rope and sensors accumulate pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices tension, grainy hum, rime powder, and pressure ticks—sensory detail filtered through professional expertise. Diction remains stable ("credibly curious," "a tired animal choosing another path") with purposeful elevation that matches the contemplative setting. The piece sustains a lyric register without drift; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: "the zero hour meant something else" and "I was paid to throw the switch" edge toward expository scaffolding, though they serve voice-motivated reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm modulates purposefully ("The sanctuary breathed, the ropes quieted, and the storm split with the dignity of a river finding two beds"). Minor deductions: "quiet crown the day" is a strained metaphor; "the city kept its heart rate" mixes vehicle (body) with setting in a way that blurs sense. "Credibly curious, the sort who asked the bell rope how it knew the weather" loops conceptually with the prior paragraph's claim without added pressure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but a few figurative reaches in high-density passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storm-siren-tester frame is fresh, and the micro-meteorology specificity (thermistors, strain gauges, shear lines) grounds the premise. The choice to favor silence over ritual alarm transforms a familiar "professional versus bureaucracy" conflict through lived expertise. The bell rope as both sensor array and witness is a purposeful synthesis. Minor deduction: the solstice setting and mountain-as-sentient-judge edge toward familiar nature-wisdom tropes without full transformation; the "wind, pleased to be heard" personification risks Stock Sublime.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm siren tester's choices drive two key beats: repairing the sensor (establishing expertise) and canceling the siren test (the decisive renunciation). The role enables the protagonist's access to microclimate data and the authority to override the scheduled test. Closure hinges on this occupational position and the credibility it confers. High irreplaceability; the story would collapse without this exact role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cathedral bell rope appears in setup (sensor installation), development (tactile feedback: "felt the mountain's shrug arrive before the gust"), and closure (mufflers lowered, "clean, unstartled sway," final wind-braiding image). It constrains the protagonist's data-gathering method and reweights the ending with thematic charge. The rope is handled physically across multiple beats and its "witness" status ties directly to the protagonist's philosophy. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is signaled early, frames the district director's expectation, and the protagonist explicitly redefines it ("up here, the zero hour meant something else"). The concept shapes the ticking pressure and the decision to cancel the ritual test. It appears in closure reflection ("It was zero hour across the city") and ties the professional stakes to the thematic question. Strong causal presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is named twice and exemplified through the protagonist's sensor work and question-asking stance. The trait enables the expertise that justifies the final choice ("trusted because I could explain why silence sometimes saved more lives"). It shapes the protagonist's observational method but does not constrain a single on-page choice with visible cost; the trait is more identity than friction. Mid-band: present and coherent, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The switch action appears in setup (circuit board), middle (switching from bulk test to local read), and climax ("I threw the switch to standby, canceling the blast"). The final switch-to-record beat closes the frame. Each instance alters tactics or consequences; the standby decision is the story's hinge. Removing "switch" would require fundamental restructuring. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tracking microclimate variations" is introduced early (thermistors, strain gauges along the bell rope), enables the protagonist's wind-shear prediction, and justifies the decision to cancel the test. The method shapes the middle observation beats and underpins the closure authority. Specific and causal, though the mechanics could be summarized more tightly in a shorter piece. Essential across two beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary supplies sensory pressure throughout (rime loosening, anemometers, cracks the sun never reached) and its elevation above the city creates the protagonist's unique vantage. The tower's exposure to shear lines drives the meteorological stakes. The setting constrains movement (stairwell, nave of wind) and the final doorway moment roots the closure image. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" anchors the repair sequence and creates a brief waiting period that forces the protagonist to walk and observe. The timeframe tightens the noon-test deadline ("By midmorning the glue had set"). It shapes pacing but does not impose high urgency; the protagonist retains control throughout. Functional causal role across two beats; mid-band for real but modest pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To favor listening over noise" is dramatized in the oath, the choice to cancel the siren, the whisper-alert substitution, and the closing curriculum reflection. The motivation creates friction with the district director's ritual expectation and generates the story's central conflict. The protagonist's actions consistently enact this desire with professional cost implied. Essential and coherent across setup, choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Solstice hush" is named in the opening, informs the contemplative register, and charges the closure image ("kept the quiet whole," "the wind...braided itself around the bell rope and slept"). The tone modulates subtly with rising pressure (district text, downdraft observation) but remains coherent. It shapes the protagonist's perceptual filter and the thematic stance. Strong presence in closure; tone and theme are tightly braided.</comment>
