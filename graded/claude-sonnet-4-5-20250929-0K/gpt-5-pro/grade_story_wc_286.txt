<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The potter protagonist is rendered through distinct perceptual filters ("slow enough to hear clay explaining itself") and embodied ritual ("fingers steady, my breath slow"), but motivation remains largely contemplative observation rather than high-stakes choice. The tests with slip and dust are micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy, yet they carry minimal personal cost—the windbreak's leaf and moth's trust feel more like confirmation than consequence. Internal contradiction is absent; the narrator moves through discovery without competing impulses that would deepen pressure. Azra functions as historical presence rather than on-page pressure, limiting relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through braided-light imagery, ritual acts, and the final pulse-answer that reweights the oasis's resistance as "gentle repetitions...which over years harden like glaze." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator recognizes phototropic kindness and tests it, then receives the thrum-answer that reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost: the outcome they will never see. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the place's stubborn mercy is re-priced as accumulated care rather than force—but the cost remains oblique and felt rather than viscerally on the page, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The oasis is vividly particular: "collapsed hives and brittle windbreaks," "trough," "honey house," and the lantern glass all anchor spatial choreography and constrain action (the narrator sits, lifts, mends, places objects with clear blocking). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("the hush so complete that the memory of bees seemed louder than wind"). The faded lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's discovery of braided timelines and charging the final image when placed on the mended bowl's rim. Scorched wasteland and distant kiln smoke supply temporal and atmospheric pressure without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and pursued through observation and two small tests (mending trough, brushing crown) that trigger responses (leaf, moth). These tests narrow options by confirming the phototropic-kindness hypothesis, but personal cost is minimal; the narrator risks neither safety nor cherished belief. The thrum-answer at closure deepens meaning under the Accumulative lens, yet the tightening is gentle rather than a forfeiture that visibly alters the narrator's path forward. Pressure accumulates through textural density but lacks a moment where competing goods force a trade-off with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—place as cemented by gentle repetitions rather than force—emerges organically from the narrator's discovery of phototropic kindness, Azra's bowl-setting, and the final thrum that answers "what holds you" without stating a moral. The closing image (cup and note left for the next wanderer) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: repair as an act of faith in unseen outcomes. Subtext operates in gesture (the bow, the slip mending) and the braided-light metaphor that shifts meaning across the piece. No template echo or overt philosophizing mars the final third, and the theme resists tidy binaries by embracing stubborn mercy over force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "slow enough to hear clay explaining itself," "phototropic to kindness," "cemented not by force but by gentle repetitions." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person, with perception filtered through craft idiom (slip, kiln, glaze). Non-standard syntax ("by the glass I found the hour") and compression ("which over years harden like glaze against ruin's fingers") are purposeful and legible. Filter verbs appear ("I thought it was my blood, then the wind") but remain voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("the ligament that held this place against the jerk of heat, war, and forgetting") yet stays within a contemplative potter's plausible register under the lyric frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or charge motifs (braids, thrum, phototropic kindness). Rhythm varies purposefully, though some sentences share a template cadence ("In one braid...in another...in a third"; "I tested it by...I tested it by") that borders on pattern-taught parallelism but verges on formulaic when not explicitly framed. Figurative language is dense ("light like threads tugging at my wrists," "freshwater hair") without becoming muddy, and spatial blocking remains clear. Minor scaffold phrases ("I had come to understand," "I realized") summarize insight rather than dramatizing the micro-choice that triggers it, nudging momentum slightly downward in those beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of potter-as-investigator, fractured timelines as lantern-glass braids, and phototropic kindness feels specific and non-obvious; the combination avoids template plotting. Emotional truth—repair as unseen faith—anchors the lyric frame without quirky ornament. The final image (cup and note left) is a fresh inflection on legacy and care that grows from prior particulars (Azra's bowl, the mended trough). Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the conceptual cost (loving an outcome you will never see) transforms the premise into durable insight rather than surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Potter present throughout; observes, lifts lantern, mends trough with slip, brushes crown, places glass on bowl rim, leaves cup and note. These are micro-choices that test the hypothesis and enact the theme, but high-stakes decisions that narrow options remain absent. The craft idiom shapes perception and the final gesture, yet the potter's agency is contemplative rather than forfeiture-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Faded lantern glass introduced early ("hung a lantern"), handled in beat two ("I lifted it"), reveals fractured timelines, then returns at closure ("I placed the faded lantern glass on the rim of the bowl"). Three distinct beats; the glass constrains discovery (braids visible only through it) and charges the final image when combined with the mended bowl, creating the water-braid moment. Removing it would collapse the timeline-reveal mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fractured timelines revealed midpoint via the glass showing gardens "that were, are, and might yet be" and braids with alternate beekeeper fates. This concept shapes the narrator's recognition that kindness bends reality ("the braids were nearest" at kiln-firing hour) and informs the final answer: acts ripple across strands. It alters the narrator's tactic (leaving a note for "the next wanderer...by following sun patterns"), though the timelines themselves remain passive backdrop rather than active constraint forcing a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Phototropic-to-kindness trait named at midpoint, immediately tested twice (slip mending → leaf; crown brushing → moth) with visible on-page responses that confirm the hypothesis. The trait constrains the narrator's final action (leaving cup and note as an act of kindness to future visitors) and provides the causal link for closure: places held by accumulated care. Removing it would eliminate the mechanism that answers "what holds you," though personal cost to the narrator remains gentle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thrum introduced early ("the earth gave a small thrum"), recurs when the narrator tests kindness ("the windbreak uncurled"), intensifies at closure ("the place answered with a pulse I felt in ankle, wrist, and teeth"), and follows the narrator out ("carrying the thrum at my heel"). Four beats; the thrum is the oasis's reply and the proof of phototropic response. Major turn—recognition that places resist via gentle repetitions—traces directly to the thrum-answer. Swapping it for another signal would require rewriting causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sun patterns mentioned in opening ("learned by following sun patterns") as the map method and repeated in the final note ("so the next wanderer could find the crossing by following sun patterns"). The method frames navigation but does not constrain a mid-story choice or tactic under pressure; it bookends rather than drives beats. Functional reprise that charges theme but replaceable with minor edits to another wayfinding cue.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Oasis present throughout: collapsed hives, trough, honey house, windbreak supply spatial anchors and resources (the trough is mended, the windbreak responds with a leaf). Scorched wasteland contextualizes the oasis's fragility and the beekeeper's towel-stacking against ash. The setting's emptiness (bees gone, hives collapsed) pressures the narrator's search for what holds the place, and the oasis's phototropic response drives the discovery. Micro-setting (body and objects) also constrains action. Removing the oasis specificity would break the logic of resistance and kindness.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "as chimney smoke flattens" introduced midpoint as the synchronization hour for beekeepers, potters, wind, and the moment when braids are nearest. The narrator uses this hour to time the glass-on-bowl placement, grounding the closure beat. The repeated phrase charges the final gesture, though it functions more as atmospheric marker than a live clock that narrows tactical windows under pressure. Present in three beats (declared, explained, enacted), essential to the ritual timing but not to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("I had come to understand why some places resist change") and pursued through observation, testing, and question ("I asked aloud what holds you"). The answer—gentle repetitions hardening like glaze—arrives on the page with conceptual cost (loving an outcome you will never see). The desire drives the investigation but lacks friction between competing wants; the narrator never risks cherished belief or safety to obtain the answer, keeping cost at the conceptual rather than personal level.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness coherent throughout: "a little ritual of sharp gentleness given to light," "stubborn and merciful," acts that are "small repair because they loved an outcome they would never see." Diction balances precision and care ("cemented not by force"), and tone modulates with the thrum-pulse intensification at closure without veering into sentimentality. The final gesture (leaving cup and note) embodies the tone, charging the ending image. Tone supports the Accumulative lens and holds under pressure, though it remains static rather than shifting between beats.</comment>
