<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's systematic care is embodied through concrete actions (lighting wicks, measuring splits, cataloging), and her interior contradiction between duty and "foxglove regret" operates continuously. Micro-choices like letting the chime remain cracked and opening the mezzanine window reveal hierarchy of values. However, the stakes remain largely symbolic—she never faces a hard choice between competing goods with visible cost, and the final act of winding the chime reads more as ritual than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (caretaker, opal library, above clouds). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (orchids, chime, names, rooms) and culminates in a cadence shift when Aristea's name is whispered into the orchid, the mezzanine reveals itself, and new rooms are assembled. The final winding of the chime offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options crystallize as she commits to collecting what is "lost but not surrendered"—but the cost remains more atmospheric than legible on the page; no concrete forfeiture or visible trade-off marks the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal library, glass-orchid planters, cracked bamboo chime, and mezzanine window all constrain choices: the chime's fracture catches fragile frequencies, prompting her decision not to patch it; the mezzanine window allows wind to animate the orchids. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the caretaker's priorities (match flame warming dew, translucence across aisles). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the stormfields outside charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preservation of forgotten names, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cracked chime offers a plea and she chooses to let it remain fractured, then opens the mezzanine to let wind animate the orchids, recovering Aristea's name. Under the Accumulative lens this counts as deepening, but agency is limited—no live option is foreclosed, and the cost is more conceptual than visible. The "gently systematic even in refusal" phrasing gestures toward a trade-off, but no tangible price (time, resource, alternate name lost) appears on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus loss emerges through concrete acts (cataloging petals, lighting wicks, tracing echoes) without thesis statement. The final image of new rooms assembled and the chime wound offers a resonant answer: care can create space for what was thought extinct, and the caretaker's "foxglove regret" becomes "a tincture that kept tenderness awake." Subtext operates in the teacher's warning ("cracks make maps") and the shift from poison to tincture. A few moments edge toward abstraction ("museum of extinct feelings," "Not Letters But Breath"), but they are anchored by the orchid-throat and porcelain labels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person close with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the caretaker notices syllables cupped in petals, consonants leaning on one another, bookends waddling. Diction is lyric and purposefully compressed ("harp-bright and salt-tender," "foghorn cotton"), taught as the piece's pattern. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction without clear POV anchor ("deserted marvels returned as murmurs," "neighborhoods of sound where warmth would not evaporate"), and some metaphors push legibility ("ferris wheel nobody rode" as a murmur feels ornamental). No head-hopping; narrative stance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, but several beats stack metaphors without clear vehicles: "foxglove regret in its rhythm" compresses poison/flower/meter unclearly; "ribbon staircases" and "weathered chambers" float without spatial grounding. Paraphrase loops appear ("She followed the sound… toward the old vestibule window. There hung the wind chime…" could compress). Template stems recur: "Room of X had Y; Room of Z had gone hoarse" reads list-like. High information density in many lines, but the final third introduces multiple new abstractions (mezzanine, stormfields, schoolyard comet) that slow closure momentum. No major causality breaks, so artifacts stay here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of caretaker-as-archivist, glass orchids fed by names, and a cracked chime catching fragile frequencies is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows implications (deserted galleries, extinct feelings, names loosened from bodies). Risk-taking in compression and metaphor density heightens atmosphere without obscuring the dominant stake. Minus points for proximity to common "last keeper of a dying art" templates and the mezzanine reveal feeling slightly convenient rather than earned by prior spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The caretaker is present throughout and makes at least two decisions: not patching the chime (letting fractured frequencies persist) and opening the mezzanine window to animate the orchids. These choices enable the recovery of Aristea's name and the assembly of new rooms. However, she is more observer than agent—most turns arise from the chime's plea and the library's revelation rather than her active push against opposition. Setup early, middle choices present, and she shapes the ending by winding the chime, meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is modest; the story would function if another caretaker performed the same systematic acts.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo chime appears in at least three distinct beats: discovery in the vestibule, the decision not to patch it, placement among the orchids, and winding at the end. Its crack enables the catching of fragile frequencies (unique property), and the caretaker's choice to preserve the fracture directly shapes tactics. The chime's echo method (9 F) and its reappearance in the final line charge closure. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; swappability is low. Slight reduction because the chime's mechanics (how a crack "catches" frequencies vs. producing them) remain abstract, and its role in the mezzanine reveal feels more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" (ferris wheel, fountain, schoolyard comet) are named in the penultimate section and prompt the assembly of new rooms, but they do not constrain on-page choice or alter tactics. The concept frames the library's emptiness and the stakes of preservation, present by implication from the opening ("before the deserted marvels fell silent"). It shapes the thematic question but does not drive a key turn. Setup present, thematic resonance clear, but middle development weak and closure participation indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is embodied in micro-actions: cataloging, lighting the wick, measuring the split with a moonbeam hair, tracing echo with ink. The trait enables her to "let it be, gently systematic even in refusal," a choice with thematic cost (accepting imperfection to preserve fragility). However, the cost is not made visible—no shown trade-off (another name lost, time spent, resource consumed) appears. Trait is present in setup, middle, and ending, but the tradeoff remains conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Light" appears as the action to warm dew in the orchids (match-strike beat), as the request from recovered rooms ("each name asked for a room, and the rooms asked for light"), and metaphorically in Aristea's role lighting streetlamps and the caretaker's dream of a new choir of lamps. The match-lighting enables the orchids to brighten and cast translucence; the assembly of lighted rooms is the story's resolution gesture. Setup early, beat involvement across three moments, and closure participation clear. Slightly reduced because the lighting action itself is brief ritual rather than effortful choice, and the rooms' need for light is declared more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By the echo of a long-forgotten song" is taught via the teacher's example (summoned a surname back to bloom), used at the mezzanine when Aristea's name unfurls from the cracked tube, and implied in the morning when orchids "spoke like birds finding shore." The method shapes the recovery mechanism and is seeded in backstory, applied at closure. However, the mechanics (how echo differs from direct sound, why a song vs. other memory) remain abstract, and the method does not constrain attempts or generate friction. Setup, payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The opal library supplies resources (glass orchids, lantern, vials, chime) and the mezzanine's reveal opens a new spatial layer that enables the wind-animation beat. "Above clouds" isolates the caretaker and charges the stormfields image. The library's architecture (aisles, stacks, vestibule, mezzanine) guides movement and the assembly of new rooms. Strong setup, middle constraints clear (she moves shelves to make neighborhoods of sound), and closure tied to spatial opening. Slightly reduced because the clouds and stormfields function more as backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" names a conceptual geography (Room of First Touch, Gallery of Saying Goodbye) that the caretaker walks "without moving, borne by resonance." Time is marked by dusk, night, exhaustion, morning, but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure or deadline. The museum visit occupies an indeterminate span and reads more as dreamlike drift than timed exploration. Setup present as thematic frame, no middle tightening, and minimal closure role. Time does not alter tactics or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the sound of forgotten names" is dramatized in every major beat: cataloging petals, lighting orchids, listening to the chime, whispering Aristea into the orchid, assembling new rooms. The oath is stated early ("she had sworn") and tested when she chooses to let the chime remain cracked—accepting imperfection to preserve fragile frequencies. Friction between duty and "foxglove regret" colors the rhythm. Setup, middle choices, and closure all hinge on this drive. Cost legibility is modest (the regret softens but no concrete forfeiture appears), preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named twice, modulates from "poisonous" to "tincture that kept tenderness awake," and charges the dream sequence and final winding. Tone is coherent through lyric compression and melancholy images (ash, hoarse rooms, names loosened from bodies), and it shifts purposefully when morning lays "sugar-blue light" and orchids speak "like birds finding shore." The tone reweights the ending from sorrow to cautious renewal. Strong closure participation and modulation under pressure. Slight reduction because "foxglove" as a specific poison is under-leveraged (the flower's actual properties do not shape the metaphor's mechanics).</comment>
