<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is densely rendered through synesthetic perception, but motivation remains abstract—"certify wonder as essential" is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The choice to ring bells and unfetter the hush reads as fulfillment of an assigned role rather than a decision under competing pressures. Embodied contradiction is present in "oscillating repose" and the tension between sleep and vigilance, yet the final act feels ceremonial rather than earned by prior internal conflict. The council's demand and the protagonist's compliance lack friction that would reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple lines of lyric description, though the piece teaches its accumulative pattern early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through interleaved bell-ringing, aurora observation, and the sculptor's parallel action, culminating in a final image where the "sculpted hush" becomes a harboring presence. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush "curled beside me like a cat of light"), yet the cost remains conceptual and oblique—the protagonist rests but no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The parallel sculptor narrative provides a structural doubling, but causality between the bell-ringer's actions and the sculptor's success is asserted rather than demonstrated through because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered with "veins loosened their centuries" and "ribs glowed," and the aurora functions as both atmosphere and tactical guide ("I stepped where green asked, where purple hushed"). The amber music sheet and bells are handled objects that constrain choices—"fossil bubble a syllable, each trapped leaf a rest"—and the cavern's spatial logic (above/below, sculptor/bell-ringer) remains coherent. The setting charges the final image: the hush "curled beside me" in a space "where ice remembers rivers." Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all constrain on-page action, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—certifying wonder to the council—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page council refusal or test dramatizes the opposition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist must "walk a measure through the colors of the aurora, and not fall asleep," introducing the danger of repose as immediate threat. The sculptor's parallel strike provides a temporal hinge, yet the bell-ringer's agency is passive observation rather than forced choice. Cost is implied (the protagonist rests, awaits "the next first strike") but no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Under Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and deepens through layered imagery, but escalation driven by protagonist decision is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the enacted question: can repose and wonder be measured, and what does their defense cost? The amber music sheet's "recipe" and the sculptor's "first strike" embody the theme without direct statement, and the final image—"sculpted hush curled beside me like a cat of light"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The piece resists moralizing and sustains ambiguity (the council is absent from closure; success is unverified). However, "certify wonder as essential" in the opening third edges toward prompt-language thematic echo, and the protagonist's articulation of the task ("unfetter," "certify") occasionally sounds like mission-statement rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is single and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in synesthesia: "every tone as bloom and every color as held breath." Diction is elevated and lyric-compressed ("frostfare waited on my breath"), consistent with the narrator's role but occasionally slipping into register mismatch ("field test, a moment of origin, and a witness willing to stake a life" reads corporate-bureaucratic). No head-hopping, and the narrator's uncertainty is purposeful ("The sculptor did not know me, but I knew her pulse"). Free indirect style is clean when filtering the sculptor's state, yet the piece's compression flattens some micro-choices into summary. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final lines drift into meta-commentary ("I would say...") that asserts rather than enacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("bells threw prisms like minnows," "hush stood, timid as a foal"), but several mixed metaphors obscure sense: "city above murmured, stone by stone, as if rehearsing an argument with time" blurs agency. Paraphrase loops appear: "I unrolled the amber music sheet, and its golden script ticked" is immediately followed by "I struck the first bell...and the tone went rose, then rain," restating preparation-to-action twice. Template cadence is present in repeated "I [verb]" stems across the middle third. Information density is high, yet some lines ("Down here, frostfare waited on my breath") add atmosphere without advancing situation. No scaffolding or generation artifacts visible, and the final line ("awaiting the next first strike") lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, ice-cavern mysticism, and parallel sculptor narrative is specific and non-obvious, with the amber music sheet and aurora-as-guide providing fresh inflections. The premise—certifying wonder through sculpted silence—avoids stock templates, and the risk of interleaving two simultaneous actions (bell-ringer below, sculptor above) heightens structural ambition. Emotional truth is present in the tension between repose and vigilance, and the final image's quiet authority feels earned. However, the council remains abstract (a declared constraint never tested on the page), and the protagonist's role as "appointed" bell-ringer reduces some sense of personal stakes. The piece commits fully to its lyric logic and sustains a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer is present throughout, and key actions—unrolling the amber sheet, striking bells, walking through aurora colors—are on-page decisions that shape the middle and ending. The character's choice to "ring once to keep them from tearing each other" (sculptor's fear vs. stubbornness) and to "let the bells drift to stillness" are functional turns. However, the role feels ceremonial: the bell-ringer executes an assigned task rather than making a decision under competing pressures that alters tactics. The character appears in the closure image ("I rested where ice remembers rivers") but passively. Early signal, middle involvement, and closure presence meet the three-gate test, yet causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate—another mystical mediator could perform similar actions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is handled in multiple beats: unrolled, its "golden script ticked like old honey"; a "trapped moth fluttered, and its shadow spelled the measure for courage"; later folded "like evening, soft and precise." It enables the protagonist's tactical choice (playing the moth's line) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("I folded it"). Early signal, middle development (moth shadow dictates a bell line), and closure participation all present. The object's fossil-song properties are specific and irreplaceable (no generic scroll could substitute), and it constrains the protagonist's method. Cost is implicit (the sheet dims, its power spent). Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the swappability test is borderline—another mystical artifact could serve with moderate rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sculpted hush is introduced early ("they said it kept the world from shattering"), developed through the middle ("the hush felt muscle, learned to carry the sculptor's strike"), and present in the closure image ("the sculpted hush curled beside me like a cat of light"). It shapes stakes (the protagonist's task is to unfetter and certify it) and tactics (ringing bells to give "the hush a shape that could endure"). The concept is unique and irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the story's logic. However, the hush remains more thematic presence than tactile constraint: it does not narrow options or impose a visible cost. The protagonist succeeds without friction, and the hush's "living presence" is asserted rather than tested. All three gates met, but causal pressure and cost connection are moderate, keeping the score in the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced early ("seeing every tone as bloom and every color as held breath") and enables the middle action: "My synesthesia bloomed into guideposts, and the tones painted paths through which the hush could travel." The trait allows the protagonist to navigate the aurora's colors and translate bell tones into spatial movement. However, it imposes no visible cost or tradeoff—the gift is pure advantage, never a liability. The trait is specific and irreplaceable (removing it would require rewriting the navigation logic), but it functions as label-plus-convenience rather than constraint. Present in setup, middle development, and implicit in closure (the protagonist's perceptual mode persists), meeting two gates solidly and touching the third, but lacking the friction or price that would elevate the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unfetter" is introduced as the protagonist's task ("My task was not to command but to unfetter") and enacted in the middle: "To unfetter it, I had to walk a measure through the colors of the aurora." The action drives the central sequence—walking without falling asleep, ringing bells to release the hush—and is present implicitly in the closure (the hush, now unfettered, curls beside the protagonist). The verb is thematically specific and shapes tactics, but it is somewhat swappable: "release," "free," or "awaken" could replace it with minor edits to surrounding lines. Early signal, middle causal involvement, and closure linkage all present, meeting the three-gate test. However, specificity and irreplaceability are moderate—the concept matters more than the exact verb—and no distinct cost is tied to the act of unfettering itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aurora's colors are introduced early ("Tonight the aurora braided above") and become the method in the middle: "I stepped where green asked, where purple hushed, where gold opened a window in my ribs." The protagonist's navigation through aurora colors is the tactical means by which the hush is unfettered, and the aurora "tilted, pouring a river of teal through the hush's spine" in response to the moth-shadow bell line. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (color-as-path), and it shapes multiple attempts. Present in the closure reflection ("it entered the city through the colors of the aurora"). Early signal, middle development, and closure mention meet all three gates. The method is specific and irreplaceable, but the cost and friction are low—the protagonist succeeds without misstep. Strong integration with moderate causal pressure places this in the upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is introduced immediately ("Under the glacier's skin, the ice cavern breathed") and constrains multiple choices: the protagonist must wait within it, navigate its spatial relationship to the sculptor above, and contend with its "oscillating repose" that threatens sleep. The cavern's "veins loosened their centuries" and "ribs glowed" as the protagonist works, and it provides the anchor for the closure image ("I rested where ice remembers rivers"). The setting is not mere postcard—it applies immediate pressure (repose, cold, isolation) and charges the final image. Early signal, middle constraint (the danger of sleep, the spatial above/below logic), and closure participation all present. The cavern is irreplaceable; no other setting could provide the specific acoustics, isolation, and symbolic weight. Causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's "first strike" moment is introduced as the protagonist's chosen "instant that births all chisels" and frames the narrative's temporal anchor. The synchronization ("Her chisel kissed marble as my bell kissed ice") provides the story's central hinge, and the timeframe shapes the protagonist's urgency (waiting for that precise moment). However, the timeframe is more conceptual than tactile—no live clock tightens decisions, and the protagonist's actions do not race against a deadline. The sculptor's second strike occurs later, but the time pressure does not escalate or narrow options. Early signal and middle payoff (the dual strike) meet two gates; closure mentions "the next first strike" but does not dramatize it. Swappability is moderate (another symbolic moment could serve), and the lack of a ticking constraint or visible cost keeps this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "certify wonder as essential" is introduced early and frames the protagonist's task throughout. The council's demand for "proofs that breath could not supply" sets the external pressure, and the protagonist's final testimony ("I would say it entered the city through the colors of the aurora") gestures toward fulfillment. However, the motivation is told and abstract—no on-page scene dramatizes the council's skepticism or the protagonist's fear of failure. The desire does not conflict with another want (no competing impulse), and no visible cost or friction attends its pursuit. Early signal and closure reflection meet two gates, but the motivation is not tested in a middle choice with stakes. Functional but swappable (another altruistic mission could substitute), and the absence of dramatized friction or cost keeps this below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Oscillating repose is introduced as the protagonist's state ("I waited within oscillating repose, bell tongues quiet, heart swinging like a slow pendulum") and sustained through the middle: "Sleep was the danger, because repose here attends in waves, and each wave asks you gently to stay." The tone modulates with pressure—urgency rises during the aurora navigation, then eases at closure ("I rested where ice remembers rivers"). The final image ("the sculpted hush curled beside me like a cat of light, awaiting the next first strike") returns to poise, charging it with accomplishment and anticipation. Early signal, middle development (repose as threat), and closure participation all present. The tone is coherent and distinct, though its constraint on action is moderate—the protagonist never succumbs or struggles visibly. Strong thematic fit and closure linkage, but the lack of a moment where the tone's oscillation forces a tactical shift or visible cost caps the score in the upper-mid band.</comment>
