<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is strongly embodied through meteorological perception and grief-driven micro-choices (categorizing clouds, tying the line to absence). The motivation to prove empty spaces remember drives consistent action across beats. Minor deduction: the deceased "you" remains somewhat abstract—a collection of gestures (laughing, carrying string) rather than a fully contradictory presence whose loss reshapes specific beliefs. The final choice to wind the ribbon is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator accepts that proving absence's fidelity is sufficient wholeness, forecloses rescue, and commits to ongoing witness with visible cost ("almost whole… because the spool has remembered how to wind"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; pressure accumulates through layered acts of categorization and the ribbon experiment. Orientation anchors (sky gondola, post-fall vigil) are clear by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator ties a line to the absence and it holds, reweighting the vigil from passive observation to active memorial architecture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gondola micro-setting constrains every choice (altimeter, burner, rail) and charges the final image ("papered in pencil dust and star grit"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: fogging telescope lens, cooler gradient felt through fingers, ozone scent anticipated on the ribbon. The brass telescope recurs with reweighted meaning (heat fog clears to stars, then frames the "dim braille" of absence). Spatial choreography is coherent across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving that empty spaces remember—is signaled in the opening third and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening: tying the fresh line to the absence and feeling it hold narrows options from passive measurement to active architecture with visible cost (the narrator becomes tethered to the wake). The experiment structure (categorizing, tracing, tying, ribbon descent planned for the next night) escalates through accumulative pressure. Agency is renunciation and endurance that forecloses rescue with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the meteorological method applied to grief: air as archive, absence as yarn, categorization as liturgy. The final image—"the spool has remembered how to wind"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether memory can be proven in empty space, reweighting all prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the brass telescope (measuring what cannot be recovered), the string motif (world-tying transferred from the lost to the narrator), and the distinction between mending and winding. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: meteorological filter shapes every observation (cirrus as wistful, cumulus as stubborn, wake as "melancholic cumulonimbus"). Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early ("quietly explosive," "negative monument") and paid off at closure. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("parenting hail it never intends to drop," "half-life by the persistence of eddies") approaches ornamentation in mid-beats, though voice-motivated and legible. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The graphite line trembles with the gondola as if the absence were breathing back" fuses action, perception, and thematic charge). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates at key beats. Minor scaffold detected: "I whisper the categories again and again until they become a liturgy for air" followed immediately by the litany itself is a near-paraphrase loop (−0.3). One instance of slight overwriting: "a pressure bloom so gentle it can lift us for hours" leans decorative in the opening without immediate causal work. No major loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of aviation meteorology and grief architecture through cloud-emotion categorization is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the familiar memorial-vigil frame by literalizing absence as measurable phenomenon (wake cylinder, cooler gradient, anticipated ozone scent). The transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse if the POV's occupational filter changed. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation without traditional confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One recognizable move: the "tying a line to absence" gesture echoes magical-realism conventions, though specificity (carpenter pencil, brass telescope, altimeter notation) earns transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aviation meteorologist identity frames expectation (opening paragraph), drives the categorization method across multiple beats (cirrus/stratus/cumulus taxonomy, altimeter/burner operation, half-life calculation), and shapes the closure choice (ribbon experiment, continued vigil). Decisions alter tactics: choosing to tie the line to the absence stabilizes the balloon and commits to architecture over passive observation. Visible cost: professional methodology becomes liturgy, forecloses rescue or conventional mourning.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Brass telescope appears in three beats: steadying it to "judge the hush," lens fogging then clearing to stars, pointing through the gap to see the wake as "dim braille." Each use advances perception but does not constrain a choice until the final observation charges the closure image by making the absence legible. Functional across beats, contributes to ending, but could be replaced with another optical instrument (binoculars, sextant) with minor edits. Does not narrow options or enable a tactic unavailable otherwise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spooled wholeness is named explicitly ("what you once called spooled wholeness") and enacted across beats: categorizing clouds as threads, tracing the wake with pencil, tying the line to absence, planning to wind the ribbon back. The concept shapes the memorial strategy and the closure directly: "Not because the missing is mended, but because the spool has remembered how to wind." Causal pressure: the winding method alters tactics from measurement to architecture. Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Quietly explosive is attributed to the hush/pressure bloom in the opening and echoed in the altocumulus annotation ("melancholic cumulonimbus, quietly explosive, parenting hail it never intends to drop"). Descriptive rather than action-constraining; the trait characterizes the atmosphere but does not enable or foreclose a specific tactic. Present in setup and middle annotation, contributes thematic texture, but swappable with similar atmospheric descriptors. No visible trade-off tied to this exact attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Memorialize is the dominant action from the opening ("I memorialize you not with statues but with method") through every beat: categorizing clouds, tracing the wake, annotating drawings, tying the line, planning the ribbon descent. The experiment structure is explicitly memorial architecture. Major turns trace to this action: choosing to tie a line to the absence and feeling it hold redefines the vigil from passive witness to active proof-building. Closure directly articulates that memorialization via method holds the narrator together. Irreplaceable; no synonym could substitute without altering the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Categorizing clouds by emotion is introduced in the first third ("discipline you once mocked as meteorology for poets"), enacted across multiple beats (cirrus/wistful, stratus/loyal, cumulus/stubborn, towers/angrily patient), and becomes the liturgy whispered at closure. The method shapes every observational beat and the final reconfiguration: categories as threads, classification as belief-spool. Mechanics matter: the taxonomy enables the narrator to prove air remembers by assigning emotional persistence to atmospheric states. Essential to the experiment structure and closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sky gondola is present throughout, supplies the rail for tying the line, houses the altimeter/burner/notebooks, and its creak and rise into colder layers alter the narrator's access to memory. Setting constrains every choice: the narrator cannot descend, must manage the balloon's altitude, and is spatially tethered to the absence's wake. The gondola's stabilization when the line holds is a key reversal. Closure image ("papered in pencil dust and star grit") is inseparable from this floating workspace. Story logic collapses without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>After the string breaks establishes the timeframe in the title and opening line, gates all subsequent action (the tether's failure initiates the loss and the vigil), and is echoed at the pivotal test ("After the string breaks, I test my theorem on absence"). The broken string is the wound all actions address. Time itself does not tighten tactics (no countdown), but the initiating break shapes every beat's stakes. The next night is promised for the ribbon experiment, extending the window. Strong setup and causal linkage; moderate closure participation through the planned continuation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To prove that empty spaces remember is stated explicitly ("I have to prove that empty spaces remember, or else the atmosphere is a liar") and dramatized through every choice: categorizing clouds, tracing the wake, tying the line, planning the ribbon descent. Desire is conflicted with cost: the proof-building forecloses rescue and conventional grief. The experiment structure makes the motivation concrete and testable. Closure directly addresses whether the proof succeeds: not mending but winding, the spool's memory rather than the missing's return. Friction between wanting proof and accepting irretrievability charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dusty starlight appears in the opening vigil ("dusty starlight"), recurs when the telescope clears to "a scatter of cold stars" with light "dusty, old as crossed deserts," and modulates through the ending image ("papered in pencil dust and star grit"). Tone is coherent: elegiac, precise, lyric without sentiment. The dust/starlight pairing charges the final image by fusing grief's residue with cosmic witness. Modulates appropriately: warmer in the categorization litany, cooler in the measurement beats, fully integrated at closure. The exact phrasing anchors both the sensory texture and the thematic register of memorial-as-archive.</comment>
